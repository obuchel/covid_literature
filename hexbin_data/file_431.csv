A gap between guidelines and clinical practice often exists, which may result in patients not receiving appropriate care. This project aimed at improving adherence to lung cancer guidelines at our institution. METHOD: The records of patients with lung cancer were evaluated for adherence to guidelines by using an auditing tool that was developed to capture pertinent information. The study team collected data about the following variables: compliance with documentation of pathological diagnosis, documentation of disease stage prior to treatment initiation, presentation at thoracic tumour board within 30 days of diagnosis, management course, and management of end of life in terms of early ‘no code’ initiation, stopping chemotherapy and referral to palliative care prior to 2 weeks of death. Annual audits were performed from 2012 to 2015. Education and discussion with team members to address the deviations were the main interventions to improve adherence. RESULTS: The baseline measurements were taken in 2012 (49 patients). Histological subtype identification improved from 94% to 100%. Presentation of new cases at the tumour board improved from 35% to 82%. Testing for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation for non-squamous cell lung cancer improved from 77% to 100%. The staging was documented in 100% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Running audits to monitor adherence to guidelines and discussions with the team have a positive effect on providing consistent evidence-based care for patients with lung cancer.","Jazieh, Abdulrahman; Alkaiyat, Mohammad Omar; Ali, Yosra; Hashim, Mohamed Ahmed; Abdelhafiz, Nafisa; Al Olayan, Ashwaq",BMJ Open Qual,431,1
4255,4255,4255,Gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with renal prognosis in adult patients with IgA vasculitis with nephritis,18.38949,6.4994326,2019-10-15,"BACKGROUND: Although the prediction of renal prognosis in patients with IgA vasculitis with nephritis (IgAVN) is important, the association between gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and its renal prognosis is unknown. This study investigated the effect of GIB on the progression to end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with IgAVN. METHODS: We compared the clinicopathological findings at diagnosis, therapy, and clinical outcomes between 10 patients with GIB and 20 patients without GIB in 30 patients with IgAVN aged ≥18 years at the renal biopsy. The primary outcome was the incidence of ESKD. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission and all‐cause mortality. The outcomes and factors affecting the progression to ESKD were evaluated using the Kaplan‐Meier method with log‐rank test and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: End‐stage kidney disease, clinical remission, and deaths from any related cause occurred in 6, 17, and 2 patients, respectively. In Kaplan‐Meier analyses, the GIB group showed a higher incidence of ESKD (50% vs 5%, P = .003) and a lower incidence of clinical remission (20% vs 75%, P = .003). Although the numbers were not statistically significant, this group tended to have a greater number of deaths than the non‐GIB group (7% vs 0%, P = .07). In a multivariable Cox model adjusted for hypertension and urinary proteinuria, GIB could not demonstrate a significant association with ESKD (hazard ratio, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.39‐52.7; P = .23). CONCLUSION: IgAVN with GIB has worse renal outcome, but GIB does not have a statistically significant association with progression to ESKD.","Shimamura, Yoshinosuke; Maeda, Takuto; Nishizawa, Keitaro; Ogawa, Yayoi; Takizawa, Hideki",J Gen Fam Med,431,22

The disorder is most commonly associated with gynecological and breast carcinomas, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and Hodgkin’s disease and in most cases comes on prior to identification of the underlying neoplasm. The hallmark of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is the presence of an immune response reactive with intracellular proteins of Purkinje or other neurons or, less commonly, against neuronal surface antigens. Evidence-based treatment strategies for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration do not exist; and approaches to therapy are thus speculative. Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying neoplasm is critical, and characterization of the antibody response involved may assist in tumor diagnosis. Most investigators have initiated treatment with corticosteroids, plasma exchange, or intravenous immunoglobulin G. Cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, rituximab, or possibly mycophenolate mofetil may warrant consideration in patients who fail to stabilize or improve on less aggressive therapies. Plasma exchange has been of questionable benefit when used alone but should be considered at initiation of treatment to achieve rapid lowering of circulating paraneoplastic autoantibodies. Because the course of illness is one of relentless neuronal destruction, time is of the essence in initiating treatment. Likelihood of clinical improvement in patients with longstanding symptoms and extensive neuronal loss is poor.","Greenlee, John E.",Curr Treat Options Neurol,431,22

The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a survey-based work system assessment (WSA) tool to facilitate the dissemination of a program for optimizing blood culture (BC) use. METHODS: Informed by findings from an onsite, interview-based WSA at 2 hospitals, a 50-item WSA survey was devised and administrated to 15 hospitals participating in a QI collaborative. WSA survey data were summarized, shared, and discussed with individual hospitals to inform the adaptation and implementation of the BC program. Physician champions leading the local QI team assessed the use of the WSA survey by completing an 8-item survey. RESULTS: A total of 347 clinicians completed the WSA survey, and physician champions at 12 hospitals evaluated the use of the WSA survey. Both the WSA survey data and the evaluation of the WSA survey showed that the survey-based WSA tool could help participating hospitals understand their current BC ordering practices and identify potential barriers to implementing the program from the perspectives of different clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated how a survey-based tool could be used to facilitate WSA in the dissemination of a program for improving BC use to a multisite collaborative. A survey-based WSA tool can be used to facilitate future large-scale intervention dissemination efforts.","Xie, Anping; Koontz, Danielle W.; Voskertchian, Annie; Fackler, James C.; Milstone, Aaron M.; Woods-Hill, Charlotte Z.",Pediatr Qual Saf,431,12

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D over early clinical outcome and serum cytokine levels in patients with moderate to severe brain injury. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the ICU unit were recruited into the study. Subjects were randomly allocated to a treatment regimen comprising either a one-time oral dose of 120,000 IU (two tablets of 60,000 IU each) of vitamin D (n = 20) or 8 mg of saccharide (two tablets of 4 g each) as placebo (n = 15). The main parameters evaluated included duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2). RESULTS: The results indicated an improvement in the level of consciousness after 7 days in the vitamin D-treated group compared with placebo. An elevation in GCS score by 3.86 units in the vitamin D-treated group with a 0.19-unit descent in the control group was recorded. Duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced in the vitamin D-treated group compared with the control group (4.7 days vs. 8.2 days, p value 0.0001). A noticeable reduction was recorded in inflammatory biomarkers (cytokines) in the vitamin D-treated group (IL-6 p = 0.08, TNF-α p = 0.02, IL-2 p = 0.36) with notable elevation in IFN-γ (p = 0.65) compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: In the acute phase of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin D supplementation plays a vital role and has a favourable effect on the consciousness level of patients.

We describe a superficial population of flat primordium cells that wrap around deeper epithelialized cells and extend polarized lamellipodia to migrate apposed to the overlying skin. Polarization of lamellipodia extended by both superficial and deeper protoneuromast-forming cells depends on Fgf signaling. Removal of the overlying skin has similar effects on superficial and deep cells: lamellipodia are lost, blebs appear instead, and collective migration fails. When skinned embryos are embedded in Matrigel, basal and superficial lamellipodia are recovered; however, only the directionality of basal protrusions is recovered, and migration is not rescued. These observations support a key role played by superficial primordium cells and the skin in directed migration of the Posterior Lateral Line primordium.","Dalle Nogare, Damian E; Natesh, Naveen; Vishwasrao, Harshad D; Shroff, Hari; Chitnis, Ajay B",,431,1

Exclusion from work can be a powerful public health measure during epidemics; both legislation and physician advice contribute to patients’ decisions to recover at home. METHODS: We surveyed Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians members to determine what impacts sick notes have on patients and the system, the duration of time off work that physicians recommend, and what training and policies are in place to help providers. Descriptive statistics from the survey are reported. RESULTS: A total of 182 of 1524 physicians responded to the survey; 51.1% practice in Ontario. 76.4% of physicians write at least one sick note per day, with 4.2% writing 5 or more sick notes per day. Thirteen percentage of physicians charge for a sick note (mean cost $22.50). Patients advised to stay home for a median of 4 days with influenza and 2 days with gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infections. 82.8% of physicians believe that most of the time, patients can determine when to return to work. Advice varied widely between respondents. 61% of respondents were unfamiliar with sick leave legislation in their province and only 2% had received formal training about illness verification. CONCLUSIONS: Providing sick notes is a common practice of Canadian Emergency Physicians; return‐to‐work guidance is variable. Improved physician education about public health recommendations and provincial legislation may strengthen physician advice to patients.","Hayman, Kate; McLaren, Jesse; Ahuja, Dezi; Jimenez Vanegas, Carolina; Sheikh, Hasan",J Occup Health,431,1

Virion attachment is mediated by envelope proteins E(rns) and E2, and E2 is indispensable. Using a pull-down assay with soluble E2 as the bait, we demonstrated that ADAM17, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, is essential for CSFV entry. Loss of ADAM17 in a permissive cell line eliminated E2 binding and viral entry, but compensation with pig ADAM17 cDNA completely rescued these phenotypes. Similarly, ADAM17 silencing in primary porcine fibroblasts significantly impaired virus infection. In addition, human and mouse ADAM17, which is highly homologous to pig ADAM17, also mediated CSFV entry. The metalloproteinase domain of ADAM17 bound directly to E2 protein in a zinc-dependent manner. A surface exposed region within this domain was mapped and shown to be critical for CSFV entry. These findings clearly demonstrate that ADAM17 serves as an essential attachment factor for CSFV.","Yuan, Fei; Li, Dandan; Li, Changyao; Zhang, Yanan; Song, Hao; Li, Suhua; Deng, Hongkui; Gao, George F.; Zheng, Aihua",PLoS Pathog,431,5

However, the field of medical image analysis suffers from a lack of sufficient data for training deep learning models. Moreover, medical images require manual labeling, usually provided by human annotators coming from various backgrounds. More importantly, the annotation process is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. Transfer learning was introduced to reduce the need for the annotation process by transferring the deep learning models with knowledge from a previous task and then by fine-tuning them on a relatively small dataset of the current task. Most of the methods of medical image classification employ transfer learning from pretrained models, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective. This is due to the mismatch in learned features between the natural image, e.g., ImageNet, and medical images. Additionally, it results in the utilization of deeply elaborated models. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach to overcome the previous drawbacks by means of training the deep learning model on large unlabeled medical image datasets and by next transferring the knowledge to train the deep learning model on the small amount of labeled medical images. Additionally, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model that combines recent advancements in the field. We conducted several experiments on two challenging medical imaging scenarios dealing with skin and breast cancer classification tasks. According to the reported results, it has been empirically proven that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of both classification scenarios. In terms of skin cancer, the proposed model achieved an F1-score value of 89.09% when trained from scratch and 98.53% with the proposed approach. Secondly, it achieved an accuracy value of 85.29% and 97.51%, respectively, when trained from scratch and using the proposed approach in the case of the breast cancer scenario. Finally, we concluded that our method can possibly be applied to many medical imaging problems in which a substantial amount of unlabeled image data is available and the labeled image data is limited. Moreover, it can be utilized to improve the performance of medical imaging tasks in the same domain. To do so, we used the pretrained skin cancer model to train on feet skin to classify them into two classes—either normal or abnormal (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)). It achieved an F1-score value of 86.0% when trained from scratch, 96.25% using transfer learning, and 99.25% using double-transfer learning.","Alzubaidi, Laith; Al-Amidie, Muthana; Al-Asadi, Ahmed; Humaidi, Amjad J.; Al-Shamma, Omran; Fadhel, Mohammed A.; Zhang, Jinglan; Santamaría, J.; Duan, Ye",Cancers (Basel),431,1

METHODS: This multicenter study using propensity score matching took place from January 2013 to June 2019 in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai, China, with a mean and maximum follow-up of 3.3 and 6.8 years, respectively. We included patients with mild to moderate LVSD, undergoing primary, isolated multi-vessel CABG with left internal thoracic artery. The in-hospital and mid-term outcomes of MABG versus conventional left internal thoracic artery supplemented by saphenous vein grafts (single arterial CABG) were compared. The primary end points were death from all causes and death from cardiovascular causes. The secondary end points were stroke, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and a composite of all mentioned outcomes, including death from all causes (major adverse events). Sternal wound infection was included with 6 months of follow-up after surgery. RESULTS: 243 and 676 patients were formed in MABG and single arterial CABG cohorts after matching in a 1:3 ratio. In-hospital death was not significantly different (MABG 1.6% versus single arterial CABG 2.2%, p = 0.78). After a mean (±SD) follow-up time of 3.3 ± 1.8 years, MABG was associated with lower rates of major adverse events (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44–0.94; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16–0.99; p = 0.045) and repeat revascularization (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18–0.97; p = 0.034).

This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of diurnal temperature range (DTR) on emergency room (ER) visits for URI in Seoul, Korea, between 2009 and 2013. METHODS: Daily ER visits for URI were selected from the National Emergency Department Information System, which is a nationwide daily reporting system for ER visits in Korea. URI cases were defined according to International Classification of Diseases, 10(th) Revision codes J00–J06. The search for DTR effects associated with URI was performed using a semi-parametric generalized additive model approach with log link. RESULTS: There were 529,527 ER visits for URI during the study period, with a daily mean of 290 visits (range, 74–1942 visits). The mean daily DTR was 8.05 °C (range, 1.1–17.6 °C). The cumulative day (lag 02) effect of DTR above 6.57 °C per 1 °C increment was associated with a 1.42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–2.82) increase in total URI. Children (≤ 5 years of age) were affected by DTR above 6.57 °C per 1 °C, with 1.45% (95% CI 0.32–2.60) at lag 02, adults (19–64 years) with 2.77% (95% CI 0.39–5.20) at lag 07. When the DTR (lag02) was 6.57 °C to 11.03 °C, the relative risk was significant at 6.01% (95% CI 2.45–9.69) for every 1 °C increase in youth subjects aged for 6 to 18 years.

It is based on a follow-up examination of a subsample (older group) of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). PARTICIPANTS: The GendAge study assessments took place between 22 June 2018 and 10 March 2020. A total of 1100 participants (older BASE-II subsample, aged ≥65 years) with baseline data assessed at least by one of the BASE-II partner sites were investigated in the follow-up. These participants had a mean age of 75.6 years (SD ±3.8), with a mean follow-up at 7.4 years (SD ±1.5). FINDINGS TO DATE: Data from different domains such as internal medicine, geriatrics, immunology and psychology were collected, with a focus on cardiometabolic diseases and in the context of sex and gender differences. Diabetes mellitus type 2 was reported by 15.6% and 8.6% of men and women, respectively. In contrast, this disease was diagnosed in 20.7% of men and 13.3% of women, indicating that a substantial proportion of almost 30% was unaware of the disease. Echocardiography revealed that left ventricular ejection fraction was higher in women than in men, in agreement with previous reports.

During motion, the spatial location of these joints changes, but they must maintain their distances to one another, effectively moving semirigidly. This pattern, termed “biological motion” in the literature, can be used as a visual cue, enabling many animals (including humans) to distinguish animate from inanimate objects. Crucially, even artificially created scrambled stimuli, with no recognizable structure but that maintains semirigid movement patterns, are perceived as animated. However, to date, biological motion perception has only been reported in vertebrates. Due to their highly developed visual system and complex visual behaviors, we investigated the capability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from nonbiological motion using point-light display stimuli. These kinds of stimuli maintain motion information while being devoid of structure. By constraining spiders on a spherical treadmill, we simultaneously presented 2 point-light displays with specific dynamic traits and registered their preference by observing which pattern they turned toward. Spiders clearly demonstrated the ability to discriminate between biological motion and random stimuli, but curiously turned preferentially toward the latter. However, they showed no preference between biological and scrambled displays, results that match responses produced by vertebrates. Crucially, spiders turned toward the stimuli when these were only visible by the lateral eyes, evidence that this task may be eye specific. This represents the first demonstration of biological motion recognition in an invertebrate, posing crucial questions about the evolutionary history of this ability and complex visual processing in nonvertebrate systems.","De Agrò, Massimo; Rößler, Daniela C.; Kim, Kris; Shamble, Paul S.",PLoS Biol,431,1

Elevated plasma levels of circulating cell-derived microparticles (MPs) have been reported in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, with the ability to mediate inflammation and thrombosis. Microparticles are bioactive agents, and it has been suggested that MPs can be used as a diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic biomarker in various diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of platelet-derived MPs (PMPs) in breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 30 patients with breast cancer and 20 normal subjects were sampled after obtaining written consent. MPs were isolated from blood samples by centrifugation technique. CD42b and annexin V markers were used respectively for counting PMPs and procoagulant MPs with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Flow cytometry results showed that the number of PMPs and procoagulant annexin V positive MPs was significantly higher in the breast cancer patients than normal subjects (p<0.001). The number of the annexin V MPs differed significantly in patients with high tumor size (T2) compared to the patients with low tumor size (T1) and controls (p<0.001). Significant and positive correlations were found between PMP levels and tissue-based biomarkers, tumor grading, and distant metastasis (P<0.05). Tumor histological type did not correlate with the numbers of PMPs (p=0.065). CONCLUSION: Increased levels of PMPs and activity in terms of hemostasis and having a positive and significant relationship with tumor grading and metastasis may indicate the effective role of PMPs in the pathogenesis and prognosis of breast cancer.","Haghbeen, Marzieh; Hashemi Tayer, Akbar; Kamravan, Maryam; Sotoodeh Jahromi, Abdolreza",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,431,1

In the field, it is assumed to be a multifactorial disease triggered by immunosuppressing factors. This is the first experimental study to provoke clinical signs of conjunctivitis in pigs after C. suis primary mono-infection. Five six-week-old male piglets, free of ocular chlamydia shedding and seronegative for Chlamydia, were conjunctivally infected with the C. suis-type strain S45 (1 × 10(9) inclusion forming units), while four piglets served as negative controls. The infection group developed clinical signs of conjunctivitis with a peak in the first week post-infection. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed the presence of Chlamydia not only in the conjunctival epithelium, but also in the enlarged lacrimal glands, lungs, and intestine. No circulating antibodies could be detected during the whole study period of three weeks, although three different test systems were applied as follows: the complement fixation test, MOMP-based Chlamydiaceae ELISA, and PmpC-based C. suis ELISA. Meanwhile, high numbers of IFN-γ-producing lymphocytes within PBMC were seen after C. suis re-stimulation 14 days post-infection. Hence, these data suggest that entry via the eye may not elicit immunological responses comparable to other routes of chlamydial infections.","Unterweger, Christine; Inic-Kanada, Aleksandra; Setudeh, Sara; Knecht, Christian; Duerlinger, Sophie; Stas, Melissa; Vanrompay, Daisy; Kiekens, Celien; Steinparzer, Romana; Gerner, Wilhelm; Ladinig, Andrea; Barisani-Asenbauer, Talin",Pathogens,431,1

Existing approaches for this task substantially rely on complex clustering-like architectures, and they usually assume the number of clusters is known beforehand or predict the number by applying another model, which involve increasingly complex and time-consuming architectures. In this paper, we combine simple neural networks with two sets of heuristic rules to explore strong baselines for the author name disambiguation problem without any priori knowledge or estimation about cluster size, which frees the model from unnecessary complexity. On a popular benchmark dataset AMiner, our solution significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods both in performance and efficiency, and it still achieves comparable performance with many complex models when only using a group of rules. Experimental results also indicate that gains from sophisticated deep learning techniques are quite modest in the author name disambiguation problem.","Zhang, Zhenyu; Yu, Bowen; Liu, Tingwen; Wang, Dong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,431,21

The demise of markets and capitalist systems calls for a straightforward economic intervention and radical transformation of the way societal production is conceptualized. This paradigm shift must deprioritize economic growth driven by the omnipresent commodification of all social relations and must furnish a viable alternative provided by the political economy.

We review the key issues in the domestic politics of implementation as the new rules migrate from the international to national levels. Lastly, we consider the implications of TRIPS for the governance of innovations in industries based on ICT and where ICT has enabled global value chains (GVCs), where the speed and distributed nature of innovation makes IPR simultaneously less effective and more necessary.","Athreye, Suma; Piscitello, Lucia; Shadlen, Kenneth C.",J Int Bus Policy,431,0

Thus, new effective modulators of the immune response are urgently needed to ameliorate the outcome of septic patients. As growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6)/Tyro3, Axl, MerTK (TAM) receptors signaling has shown immunomodulatory activity in sepsis, here we sought to determine whether Gas6 protein injection could mitigate MOF in a cecal slurry mouse model of sepsis. Mice, divided into different groups according to treatment—i.e., placebo (B), ampicillin (BA), Gas6 alone (BG), and ampicillin plus Gas6 (BAG)—were assessed for vitality, histopathology and cytokine expression profile as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ALT and LDH levels. BAG-treated mice displayed milder kidney and lung damage and reduced levels of cytokine expression and iNOS in the lungs compared to BA-treated mice. Notably, BAG-treated mice showed lower LDH levels compared to controls. Lastly, BAG-treated cells of dendritic, endothelial or monocytic origin displayed reduced ROS formation and increased cell viability, with a marked upregulation of mitochondrial activity. Altogether, our findings indicate that combined treatment with Gas6 and antibiotics ameliorates sepsis-induced organ damage and reduces systemic LDH levels in mice, suggesting that Gas6 intravenous injection may be a viable therapeutic option in sepsis.","Salmi, Livia; Gavelli, Francesco; Patrucco, Filippo; Bellan, Mattia; Sainaghi, Pier Paolo; Avanzi, Gian Carlo; Castello, Luigi Mario",Cells,431,16

A widely cited Chinese study (n = 34) reported postoperative COVID-19 pneumonia and mortality rates of 100% and 21% respectively [1]. This audit assessed outcomes after abdominal surgery across three hospitals within Mid & South Essex NHS Foundation Trust. METHODS: Patients undergoing abdominal surgery at Basildon University Hospital, Mid Essex Hospital and Southend University Hospital between 1st March and 27th April 2020 were included. Obstetric, gynaecological, vascular, inguinal/femoral hernia, and skin operations were excluded. Electronic data collection was supplemented by telephone follow-up. RESULTS: 306 patients were included. The median age was 57 years. 148 (48.4%) were female. 156 (51.0%) and 150 (49.0%) patients underwent elective and emergency surgery respectively. The preoperative and postoperative SARS-CoV-2 rates (based on RT-PCR or imaging) were 0.3% (n = 1) and 4.6% (n = 14) respectively. 84.6% (n = 259) did not have RT-PCR tests. All-cause 30-day mortality was 3.6% (n = 11). Amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2, mortality was 50% (7/14), occurring only after emergency surgery. Elective (vs. emergency) surgery was associated with lower postoperative SARS-CoV-2 (0.6% vs. 8.7%; p < 0.001) and mortality (0.6% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.005). At follow-up, 79.1% (242/306) of patients responded, most (85.1%; 206/242) without major clinical issue. CONCLUSION: Local SARS-CoV-2 and mortality rates are lower than previously reported [1]. Perioperative COVID-19 carries a high mortality risk. We recommend perioperative SARS-CoV-2 testing for all patients and cohorting by infection status. REFERENCES: 1.

The results show that the statistical observation of colonies was based on a territorial distinction between metropole and colonies, which led to the use of different methods.

Although DPP-4/CD26 has been recognized as both a suppressor and inducer in tumor biology due to its various functions, how DPP-4 inhibitor affects cancer progression in diabetic patients is still unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize one unfavorable aspect of DPP-4 inhibitor in cancer-bearing diabetic patients. ABSTRACT: DPP-4/CD26, a membrane-bound glycoprotein, is ubiquitously expressed and has diverse biological functions. Because of its enzymatic action, such as the degradation of incretin hormones, DPP-4/CD26 is recognized as the significant therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes (T2DM); DPP-4 inhibitors have been used as an anti-diabetic agent for a decade. The safety profile of DPP-4 inhibitors for a cardiovascular event in T2DM patients has been widely analyzed; however, a clear association between DPP-4 inhibitors and tumor biology is not yet established. Previous preclinical studies reported that DPP-4 suppression would impact tumor progression processes. With regard to this finding, we have shown that the DPP-4 inhibitor induces breast cancer metastasis and chemoresistance via an increase in its substrate C-X-C motif chemokine 12, and the consequent induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the tumor. DPP-4/CD26 plays diverse pivotal roles beyond blood glucose control; thus, DPP-4 inhibitors can potentially impact cancer-bearing T2DM patients either favorably or unfavorably. In this review, we primarily focus on the possible undesirable effect of DPP-4 inhibition on tumor biology. Clinicians should note that the safety of DPP-4 inhibitors for diabetic patients with an existing cancer is an unresolved issue, and further mechanistic analysis is essential in this field.","Kawakita, Emi; Koya, Daisuke; Kanasaki, Keizo",Cancers (Basel),431,16

Through focussing specifically upon their primary concerns during the 2019 election, the piece expands upon existing quantitative research. Survey studies have highlighted leadership concerns and Brexit as the primary factors that have driven voters away from Labour and towards the Conservative Party. It is argued here that leadership, Brexit, and economic management were closely intertwined, with party leaders at the centre of broader thinking for these participants. Perceptions of the party leaders were foremost in these deliberations and this has clearly impacted upon the interviewees’ thinking on a range of political matters. Additionally, the interviews asked what might influence the participants’ future electoral choices. Here, the data suggest a sense of limited, qualified attachment to the Conservative Party and a desire to see the Labour Party move towards what the respondents perceive as a centrist ideological position. The final section considers what these findings may mean for the major parties in future electoral contests. It is suggested that the presidential focus has worked for Johnson so far due to his abilities as a communicator, but the government will have a difficult hill to climb in this parliament if they are to retain the loyalty of these voters in future.","Hart, Gavin",Br Polit,431,30

Microdata from the Eurobarometer and the World Values Survey are used for the period 2000–2019. This period includes several economic changes, among which are the strong expansion at the beginning of the century, the Great Recession, and the subsequent recovery. Our study includes several groups of countries. In the broadest case, the study comprises a group of 83 countries and analyses the issue both from a global perspective as well as focusing particular attention on European countries. These asymmetric effects of economic activity are in line with behavioural economics and previous literature and allow us to determine a macroeconomic aversion to losses. The results obtained support the existence of asymmetric effects of changes in aggregate income on subjective well-being, and show that losses generated in recessions require a far more vigorous recovery if they are to be compensated for, and that they might even have permanent effects.

This included rheumatology patients on immunosuppressive therapies sufficient to increase their risk of infection. Methods This was a retrospective audit assessing the number of rheumatology patients within the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust (MSE Trust) and Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Trust (BHR Trust) who were sent shielding letters. We audited how effective these measures were in preventing COVID-19 infection during the shielding period (up to 1(st) July 2020). Risk criteria from NHS Digital and the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) were used by individual departments within these Trusts to identify the relevant patients. We audited from case records demographic details, rheumatological diagnoses, therapies and associated co-morbidities in these patients. Results A total of 5,876 high risk patients within these Trusts were identified and sent shielding letters: 4,914 within the MSE Trust and 962 patients within the BHR Trust. As seen in Table 1, of these 5,876 patients, 28 (0.48%) were hospitalised with positive tests for COVID-19: 23 of the 4,914 (0.47%) in MSE Trust and 5 of the 962 (0.52%) in BHR Trust. Of the 28 COVID-19 admissions, 10 died (36%). The number of rheumatology patients that developed COVID-19 as a proportion of all patients admitted across these two Trusts was 0.76% (28 out of 3,695). Conclusion This audit supports the idea that shielding is an effective tool in protecting these vulnerable patients. Most of our patients admitted were elderly, had multiple co-morbidities and generally conformed with the known risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. This supports Government guidelines and BSR risk scoring and is particularly important as it is becoming increasingly apparent that COVID-19 will be prevalent for a long time to come. In line with the recent EULAR COVID-19 registry report, only one of the hospitalised patients from these Trusts was on anti-TNF therapy, suggesting that these therapies were in fact protective. It raises the open question: whether immunosuppression may have a protective effect in some Rheumatology patients. Disclosure C. Ranasinghe: None. A. Nandagudi: None. E. Balogh: None. E.

We report a case of aortic thrombosis occurring after COVID-19 pneumonitis, with persistently positive anticardiolipin antibodies. Methods A 63-year-old lady presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain radiating to the back, associated with vomiting. She reported feeling slightly breathless, and ten days prior to admission a throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. Oxygen saturation was 96% (94-100%) on room air. Respiratory examination revealed minimal basal crackles bilaterally. Her heart sounds were normal, and there was no carotid or subclavian bruit. Radial, ulnar, brachial, subclavian and temporal pulses were intact and symmetrical. The abdomen was soft, but tender over the right upper quadrant and epigastrium. Nailfolds were normal, and there was no livedo reticularis and no vasculitic rash. Initial investigations showed a CRP of 235 mg/L (<5), White blood cell count 15.2 x109/L (4.0-11.0), neutrophil count 12.6 x109/L (1.7-7.5). She was reviewed by the surgical team and CT Thorax, Abdomen and Pelvis requested due to the high CRP. Results CT showed a mild COVID pattern pneumonitis, inflammatory changes around the infrarenal aorta containing irregular circumferential clot, raising the suspicion of aortitis. An autoimmune screen was requested with following Results positive IgM Anti-Cardiolipin Antibodies (ACL) at 34.6 U/mL (0.0-20.0), IgG ACL 8.5 U/mL (0.0-20.0), Anti-B2-GP1 (B2GP1) Antibodies negative, Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) was not tested as patient was already on Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). ANA screen, Anti-ENA screen, ANCA screen, Crithidia Lucillae (dsDNA), RF, Anti-CCP Antibodies, Complement C3 and C4 were all negative. No steroid treatment was commenced. The patient then self-discharged against medical advice and was reviewed as an out-patient. CT scan was reviewed by a vascular radiologist who confirmed the suspicion of aortitis. Subsequently, a 5-Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) CT scan showed no evidence of active, ongoing large vessel vasculitis. A short, linear focus of mild increased FDG uptake associated with some calcification within the left lateral abdominal aortic wall was more typical of atheromatous disease than vasculitis. LMWH was switched to long-term warfarin. She has now fully recovered from COVID and has remained well. Repeat Antiphospholipid screen taken more than 12 weeks later showed a positive IgM ACL (40.2 U/mL), and negative IgG ACL and B2GP1. Once again LAC was not tested as the patient has continued warfarin. IgM ACL positivity following COVID-19 infection has been reported by several other centres. Conclusion Our understanding of the significance of positive antiphospholipid antibodies and COVID-19 infection is evolving. Further research is needed to establish if there is a relationship between COVID-19 infection, thrombosis and positive ACL or if this is an epiphenomenon. Disclosure M. Curuvija: None. K.

Laboratory investigations showed low and borderline levels of the following hormones TSH 0.590 (0.3-4.2 mU/L), FT4 1.44 (12.0-22.0 pmol/L), FT3 0.858 (3.1-6.8 pmol/L), ACTH at 8 am 2.59, ACTH at 16 pm 8.44 (7.20-63.3 pg/ml), GH 0.090 (0.0-14.0), FSH <0.7 (1.6-9.7 IU/L), LH <0.7 (0.7-7.8 IU/L), prolactin <30.8 (78-380 uIU/ml), testosterone 1.01 (above 50 years 2.5-21.6 nmol/l), cortisol at 8 am 557, cortisol at 16 pm 674, cortisol at 11 pm 674 (morning: 123-626 nmol/L, afternoon 46-389 nmol/L), DHS 1.87 (2.17-11.7 nmol/L). On 12/10/2020 he tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. On 14/10/2020 his condition worsened. He was somnolent, and even though he was admitted to diuretic therapy, he had decreased urine output. His D-dimer was 3.93 (0-0.055 mcg/mL). CT findings of thoracic organs described cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic altered thoracic aorta, and changes in the pulmonary parenchyma on both sides. On 16/10/2020 the patient was transferred to the cardiology department. SARS-CoV-2 test was repeated, and it was positive. The patient exited due to pulmonary arrest on 17/10/2020. Conclusion: There are several possible mechanisms that may describe that COVID-19 infection exacerbates the symptoms of myxedema and panhypopituitarism, and consequently leads the patient to severe acute respiratory failure.","Burekovic, Azra; Divanovic, Anida",J Endocr Soc,431,1

We report a case of a prolonged persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 associated with clinical relapses of COVID-19 in a patient with mantle-cell lymphoma who underwent treatment with R-BAC (rituximab, bendamustine, cytarabine) with consequent lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Real time-PCR (RT-PCR). On five positive nasopharyngeal swabs, we performed viral culture and next generation sequencing. We analysed the patients’ adaptive and innate immunity to characterize T and NK cell subsets. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs samples remained positive for 268 days. All five performed viral cultures were positive and genomic analysis confirmed a persistent infection with the same strain. Viremia resulted positive in three out of four COVID-19 clinical relapses and cleared each time after remdesivir treatment. T and NK cells dynamic was different in aviremic and viremic samples and no SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected throughout the disease course. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, SARS-CoV-2 persisted with proven infectivity for over eight months. Viremia was associated with COVID-19 relapses and remdesivir treatment was effective in viremia clearance and symptoms remission, although it was unable to clear the virus from the upper respiratory airways. During the viremic phase, we observed a low frequency of terminal effector CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood that are probably recruited in inflammatory tissue for viral eradication. In addition we found a high level of NK cells repertoire perturbation with a relevant involvement during SARS-CoV-2 viremia.","Sepulcri, Chiara; Dentone, Chiara; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Bruzzone, Bianca; Lai, Alessia; Fenoglio, Daniela; Bozzano, Federica; Bergna, Annalisa; Parodi, Alessia; Altosole, Tiziana; Delfino, Emanuele; Bartalucci, Giulia; Orsi, Andrea; Di Biagio, Antonio; Zehender, Gianguglielmo; Ballerini, Filippo; Bonora, Stefano; Sette, Alessandro; De Palma, Raffaele; Silvestri, Guido; De Maria, Andrea; Bassetti, Matteo",Open Forum Infect Dis,431,27

INTRODUCTION: During COVID-19 pandemic reports increased of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in prone and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), mostly describing four and five chamber apical views, and inferior vena cava (IVC) by lateral IVC window (from right side of the patient). PURPOSE: Evaluate quality of images obtained with protocol of apical-subcostal TTE in patients with IMV and prone position. METHODS: Prospective study, between August and December 2020, in adults who required prone position during IMV. After placing the patient in the prone position, left arm was extended overhead, and a pillow was placed only under the left hemithorax to elevate and facilitate the apical window and space below the patient for subcostal window. Operator stands on the left side of the patient and takes images with the transducer in your right hand, starting with apical window and subsequently subcostal window. Apical views were apical four, two and three-chambers, to obtain function parameter of right and left ventricle (LV), evaluation of aortic valve, mitral and tricuspid valve. Subcostal views were four cardiac chambers and IVC, to obtain qualitative ventricle function, presence of pericardial effusion, and volume status and estimation of pulmonary pressure (together to peak systolic tricuspid pressure gradient from apical views). The images were acquired by cardiologist, then were saved, and finally evaluated by two echocardiography cardiologist experts. RESULTS: 16 ETTs were performed. Male gender and obesity predominate. Positive end-expiratory pressure average was 10.8 cm of water. One patient cannot be assessed by absence of acoustic window and the rest (n = 15) were analyzed with experts. It was achieved a four-chamber apical view in 100% (n = 15), a two-chambers apical view in 60% (n = 9) and a three-chambers apical view in 100% (n = 15). It was possible to assess global function of the LV in 100% (n = 15), LV segmental function in 53% (n = 8), LV outflow tract velocity time integral in 100% (n = 15) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion in 100% (n = 15). Pulsed wave doppler of mitral valve in 100% (n = 15) and tissue doppler of lateral mitral valve annulus 100% (n = 15). Continuous wave doppler of aortic valve in 100% (n = 15) and tricuspid valve in 93% (n = 14). Subcostal four-chamber 80% (n = 12), presence pericardial effusion 100% (n = 15) and IVC 93% (n = 14). Non-complications associated with obtaining the position. CONCLUSIONS: ETT in the prone position during IMV was possible and interpretable images were achieved. The position described allows assessment by apical and subcostal views at the same time and position of the operator and the patient. In addition, it was a safe technique, and the position was easy to be incorporated by the health team. Limitations were obtaining the two-chamber apical view and evaluation of segmental alterations of the LV. Better validation requires a larger sample.","Del Castillo Gordillo, C; Appiani Florit, F; Begazo Gonzales, A; Yanez Vidal, F; Mora Valdes, R; Avila Cisternas, C; Garcia Medina, A; Luque Gonzales, M; Ibanez Mora, A; Alfaro Diaz, M",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,431,16

Clinical Case: A 78-year-old Filipino female sought consult due to a rapidly progressive anterior neck mass. This started as a centimeter-sized nodule initially noted three months prior. Two months after, there was gradual enlargement to a fist-size, movable mass, hard in consistency associated with dysphagia and hoarseness of voice. On consult, neck ultrasound revealed an enlarged right thyroid with a mass in the right lobe (TI-RADS 5), multinodular with no lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, a CT scan of the neck was done to evaluate for other structural causes of dysphagia showing no intrathoracic extension. Patient was advised surgery but was lost to follow up due to lockdown from COVID-19. In the interim, patient was admitted for aspiration pneumonia. IV antibiotics were initiated and urgent surgery was advised to relieve patient of respiratory compromise. Patient was airlifted to a tertiary care center for further management. Baseline thyroid function tests were normal. Repeat neck imaging showed interval increase in the hypodense mass measuring 6x9x8 cm (from 3x4x5 cm) (APxWxCC) extending to the hypopharynx and laryngeal vestibule with mass effect to the trachea and esophagus. A multidisciplinary meeting was done to establish goals of care. On the 3rd hospital day, a tracheostomy with incisional biopsy and frozen section was done which revealed round to spindle cell neoplasm with anaplastic features. No further surgical resection was done and specimen was sent for immunohistochemical staining. Long term enteral access was secured during the same operation. Final histopathology showed undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma with anaplastic features and no definite lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemical markers were negative for CD3, CD20, Thyroglobulin, TTF-1, PAX8, Calcitonin and Pancytokeratin which reveal loss of tumor antigenicity, consistent with the histopathologic diagnosis. Metastatic work-up revealed varisized pulmonary, subpleural and hepatic nodules with lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Patient was staged as IVC (T4N1M1). Patient was referred for radiation to maximize local control, to complete 33 fractions of 200 cGy on the thyroid mass and received one cycle of Paclitaxel before discharge. Concurrent chemoradiation was continued and completed 29 cycles of radiation and 2 cycles of Paclitaxel which significantly reduced the tumor size. However, the patient succumbed to acute coronary syndrome on her third admission. Conclusion: There is currently no consensus first-line treatment modality available worldwide. Although the diagnosis and treatment of ATC is considered medically urgent, end-of-life planning must be given high priority in order to optimize the quality of the patient’s remaining life.","Sarigumba, Marion Bagaloyos; Isidro, Maria Jocelyn Capuli",J Endocr Soc,431,33

A significant proportion of rheumatology patients are considered ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ and are at increased risk of COVID-19. With this in mind, alongside national guidance from the British Society for Rheumatology and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence we adapted our services in response to COVID by mostly suspending face-to-face appointments for follow up patients, instead relying on telephone or virtual consultations with a face-to-face appointment if necessary in order to minimise risk to our patients. We aimed to evaluate our use of telephone consultations during the pandemic and gain understanding of our patients views of telephone consultations longer term. Methods We retrospectively surveyed rheumatology patients under active follow-up at the royal Wolverhampton trust who had a telephone consultation with a rheumatology consultant over a 4-week period (11/5/20- 4/6/20). Patients were invited to participate via a SMS text message containing an embedded web-link to the survey. Results were analysed using SPSS version 26. Results Surveys were sent to 1,213 patients; 306 (25.2%) patients completed the survey. Responders were mostly female; the predominant diagnosis was inflammatory arthritis. Ages included: 1 (0.3%) patient 16-29 years, 46 (15.0%) 30-49, 180 (58.8%) 50-69, and 79 (25.8%) aged >70 years. Regarding their telephone consultation, 86.6% of responders were satisfied with the consultation. During the current pandemic 81.4% of responders were pleased to have a telephone consult rather than face-to-face; 57.2% of responders would be happy for their next routine appointment to be a telephone clinic. A significantly higher proportion of patients <50 years preferred telephone consultations when compared to older patients (Chi(2) [DF = 3]= 10.075, P = 0.018) and more younger patients had access to a smartphone than those in the older cohort (Chi(2) [DF 3]= 20.919, P = <0.001). Conclusion Overall, the short-term switch to telephone consultation was well received by our cohort. The majority of patients were satisfied with their telephone consultation and most were pleased to have a telephone consult rather than a face-to-face appointment in the current pandemic. Just over half would be happy for their next routine appointment to be a telephone consultation, however, a significantly higher proportion of younger patients prefer telephone consultations compared to older patients and a greater number of younger patients have access to a smartphone compared to older patients. Further planning is required to ensure patients in older and other vulnerable groups are not excluded should telephone clinics become a more permanent fixture. Disclosure N. Cleaton: None. S.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical services have been adapted to reduce hospital admissions. Our aim is to assess the safety and efficacy of the surgical ambulatory service in the management of acute diverticulitis. METHOD: Data was retrospectively collected on consecutive patients referred to the surgical team with a suspected diagnosis of diverticulitis between 30.04.20-16.08.20. Unsuccessful ambulation was determined by representation at 30 days. RESULTS: 83 patients presented with suspected diverticulitis. 36 patients were deemed clinically stable and suitable for ambulation. 21 of these patients underwent a CT abdomen in the ED, confirming uncomplicated diverticulitis and were discharged with oral antibiotics as per trust guidance. 4 patients were discharged from ED for an ambulatory CT abdomen, with a median waiting time of 3 days. 11 patients received no imaging prior to discharge, all of whom had known diverticular disease. 86% of ambulated patients underwent a telephone review within 72 hours of acute presentation. 8.3% of ambulated patients represented within a 30 day window, 0 of which required surgical management. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis can be safely managed in an ambulatory setting. Access to imaging early can facilitate successful discharge.","Harty, M; Armstrong, L; McElvanna, K; McElvanna, K",Br J Surg,431,1

METHOD: Data was collected across 3 cycles in 3 hospitals. A questionnaire assessed four domains: symptoms; spread; risk factors and the means to reduce transmission. PHE materials were shown before cycle 2 and respondents then subjected to the general campaign. RESULTS: 253 responses were collected. Symptom recognition was 84%, increasing to 88% post-intervention, longer-term recognition remained high at 81% - including the new symptom of anosmia. Identification of COVID’s means of transmission increased from 76% to 95% post intervention, risk factor recognition increased from 85% to 93% post-intervention. This fell to 74% later in the pandemic when recognised risk factors increased. Recognition of the new risk factors BAME status and BMI was 73% and 79% respectively in the final cycle. Doctors had the highest number of pre-intervention correct answers for 3 domains and nurses gave the most incorrect answers for 3 domains pre-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the PHE message is being transmitted effectively. We have also shown an increase in hospital workers recognition of aspects of COVIDs characteristics that have since been verified in the literature.","Render, L; Truss, A; Waddington, H; John, S; Henderson, C; Aldaraggi, A; Page, O",Br J Surg,431,16

However, emergency surgical procedures must still be performed, with the commonest being appendicectomy. It is common practice across National Health Service trusts to collect a group and save (G&S) sample pre-operatively which increases healthcare staff exposure to the patient and increased use of personal protective equipment in this pandemic. METHOD: Prospective study of adult patients undergoing emergency appendicectomy since the transformation of emergency care with COVID-19 induced restrictions compared with patients undergoing the same operation before the pandemic. RESULTS: 179 adult patients underwent emergency appendicectomy over 6-months in 2019–2020, 60 patients in the 12 weeks period from the start of the transformed emergency services due to the pandemic. Pre-operative G&S samples were taken for 60(33.5%) patients in the pre COVID-19 period, whereas 7(11.6%) were taken for patients undergoing appendicectomy during the pandemic. None of the patients in either group had intra-operative blood loss of more than 500 millilitres and none of them required peri-operative blood transfusion CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the routine pre-operative G&S can safely be abandoned as a routine practice for all patients undergoing emergency appendicectomy.","Baig, M; Sarma, D; Ng, V; Shortland, T; Sood, S",Br J Surg,431,16

With the COVID-19 outbreak, examination and procedures on the upper airway may put otolaryngologists at increased risk of infection. ENT UK released new guidance for the management of epistaxis during COVID-19 pandemic to safely manage epistaxis and reduce admissions. We report our experience in managing epistaxis using a locally approved protocol using this guidance. METHOD: Prospective audit of management and outcomes of patients presenting to acute ENT services at a large teaching hospital with epistaxis over a 3-month period. RESULTS: 58 patients attended with epistaxis. Various management strategies were used with 50% managed with non-absorbable packing. 15 cases required admission only 8 solely due to epistaxis. Only 5 cases (8.6%) reported re-bleeding within 30 days with one case (1.7%) requiring readmission. CONCLUSIONS: The current guidance appears to be a safe and effective method for managing epistaxis and minimising the number of admissions which may lead to a permanent shift in epistaxis management.","Eastwood, M; Metcalfe, C; Lovett, A; Isles, M",Br J Surg,431,26

METHOD: An electronic survey was distributed to Healthcare Workers through Professional Associations' websites and social media. The survey contained demographic questions, a Burnout Inventory, a General Resilience scale, a scale to assess for Resilience during the Pandemic, as well as an Adapted Dweck Mindset instrument to measure Mindset as related to Workplace Environment and Resilience. Univariate and multivariate analysis was undertaken to examine the relationship between these factors. RESULTS: 1,370 healthcare workers completed the questionnaire. 58.5%, 25.4%, 28.5% reported having Burnout, Low General Resilience and Low COVID Resilience, respectively. Burnout was significantly associated with Fixed Mindset, Low General Resilience and Low COVID Resilience. Resilience Training was found to be protective for Burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Pandemic has led to a higher proportion of HCWs experiencing Burnout than previously reported. Our findings demonstrate that HCWs with Low Resilience and Fixed Mindsets are more likely to experience Burnout, suggesting that, in combination with improved institutional support, there is a role for personalised Resilience and Mindset Training, in helping reduce the proportion of HCW Burnout.","Lupi, M; Maweni, R; Foley, R; Shirazi, S; Machando, D; Woods, S; Vig, S",Br J Surg,431,16

We have implemented a quality improvement project to improve patient satisfaction of TCs in our unit. METHOD: This was a prospective complete-cycle project, with online patient satisfaction questionnaires sent following TCs in ENT clinics. This consisted of 28 questions including the Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (MISS-21). Based on results and a current literature review, a two-pronged intervention was designed, comprising of staff education and application of a model structured TC framework. A follow-up survey was subsequently undertaken. RESULTS: 100 patient questionnaires were collected (April & June 2020). Significant improvements in MISS-21 scores were seen over the two surveys (p = 0.026). An average MISS-21 score of 114.6 (range 49 – 147) was seen in the first survey, with a mean score of 128.5 (range 79 – 142) seen in the second (maximum score of 147). There was a significantly increased preference for TC over FTF appointments over the two surveys (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significant improvements in patient satisfaction and an increased TC preference through use of a structured consultation model. Its potential benefits in infection control and impact on outpatient workload may see TCs persist in the post-coronavirus era.","Zammit, M; Siau, R; Williams, C; Hussein, A",Br J Surg,431,24

INTRODUCTION: After publication of the 2019 ESC Guidelines for dyslipidemia, the LDL cholesterol target in patients with very high cardiovascular risk was reduced from 70 mg/dl to 55 mg/dl. Currently, there is more and more evidence that getting these levels is very important in prognosis, to avoid new cardiovascular events. The paradigm of this situation could be represented by young patients after STEMI, in which secondary prevention is essential to achieve a long-life expectancy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to analyze the impact the new guidelines have had on the control of LDL cholesterol in a population of young patients after STEMI, one year after their publication. METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive young patients (aged ≤ 40 years) presenting with STEMI admitted at our center between 2006 and 2017 were included. There were no exclusion criteria. We collect demographic, clinical and treatment information, and laboratory values in september/2019 and again one year later. RESULTS: Out of 101 patients, 89 were male (88.1%). Mean age was 35.87 ± 4.07 years. Among the classic cardiovascular risk factors, dyslipidemia (44.5%) was the second one most prevalent in our cohort, after smoking (93.1%). In September/2019, only 66.3% of our patients had a recent LDL-cholesterol control, and only 20.9% of them had a target LDL-cholesterol lower than 55 mg/dl (""LDL-c -goal""). During the following year, a new determination of LDL cholesterol was only carried out in 18 patients out of the total sample, with these results: 15 patients had an LDL> 55 mg/dl; 2 patients maintained an ""LDL-c-goal"", and only a single patient achieved optimal control (from 81 mg/dl to 39 mg/dl) coinciding with the change from low to high intensity statin. Regarding lipid-lowering treatment, in September/2019 the 87.7% of our population were taking statins, 21.9% ezetimibe, and 0.0% PCSK9-inhibitors. In that moment, in 6 patients, the lipid-lowering treatment was reduced (all of them had LDL values were between 65-105 mg/dl). One year later, in September/2020, 82.2% were taking statins, 21.9% ezetimibe, and in 1 patient was started with the PCSK-9 inhibitor. Thirteen patients (12.9%) had suffered a reinfarction during follow-up, but none in the last year. CONCLUSIONS: Despite of the new LDL-cholesterol target established by the ESC Guidelines, we have not improved our lipid control in a population with high cardiovascular risk -with a percentage of cardiovascular events during mean follow-up that is not negligible-, being only 1 of each 5 patients correctly treated. We must carry out a closer clinical and analytical follow-up, by increasing our efforts in secondary prevention, and perhaps the Cardiac Rehabilitation Units can play an essential role in this objective. It is possible that the Covid-19 pandemic could have influenced these results.","Borrego Rodriguez, J; Larrabide-Eguren, I; Toribio-Garcia, I; Santos-Garcia, C; Echarte-Morales, JC; Bergel Garcia, R; Gonzalez Maniega, C; Sanchez Munoz, E; Palacios Echevarren, C; Minguito Carazo, C; Martin Centellas, A; Maillo Seco, J; Menendez Suarez, P; Galan Farina, C; Fernandez-Vazquez, F",Eur J Prev Cardiol,431,1

Self-reported scores on each of the five factors identified by the Eating and Food Literacy Questionnaire (EFLBQ) were used to measure change. METHODS: University students 18 to 30 years of age were recruited to complete the EFLBQ during the Covid-19 pandemic. Demographic information about gender, height, weight, race, and ethnicity were gathered. Current COVID-19 data was compared to a random sample of data collected pre-COVID-19 in a similar population group. Each of the five EFLBQ factor scores were compared using independent-sample t-tests. Significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: 229 university students completed the EFLBQ during the Covid-19 pandemic. 164 participants were female (71.6%). Their race/ethnicity included: 184 White (80.3%), 26 Black (11.4%), 11 Hispanic or Latino (4.8%), 6 Asian (2.6%), and 2 reported as Other. These scores were compared to a random sample of EFLBQ scores gathered from students at the same university pre-Covid-19. The pre-Covid-19 participants included 125 females (54.6%). 177 were White (77.3%), 30 were Black (13.1%), 9 were Hispanic/Latino (3.9%), 8 were Asian (3.5%), 2 were American Indian or Alaska Native (.9%) and 3 identified as Other. Independent-sample t-tests were conducted to compare each of the five EFLBQ factor before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. There was a significant difference in scores for the pre-Covid-19 (M = 2.59, SD = 0.49) and those during the Covid-19 pandemic (M = 2.72, SD = .51) for the factor of Health and Nutrition; (t(456) = 2.86, P = .004) and the factor of Food Preparation pre-Covid-19 (M = 2.52, SD = 0.70) and during the Covid-19 pandemic (M = 2.66, SD = .76); (t(455) = 1.98. P = .049). There were no significant differences in the EFLBQ factors of Taste, Planning and Decision Making, and Convenience. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this investigation suggest that during the Covid-19 pandemic, university students have become more concerned about eating healthy foods and consuming balanced diets and are more confident about their cooking skills.

However, these models often remain limited due to their contamination with non‐human animal‐derived components. As such, there is a need for a major shift to entirely xenofree methodologies so experimental conditions are free of non‐human animal contaminants. Here, we evaluate the availability of xenofree stem cell lines and the extent of xenogenicity in major public sources of AD and control cell lines that could also be used in COVID‐19 iPSC‐related research. In order to assess the extent of xenogenicity, we analyzed three primary catalogs of stem cell repositories for AD and control cell lines. The iPSC catalogs were chosen based on their efforts to create accessible, high quality cell lines and recognition of the need to improve reproducibility in stem cell research. These public collections included the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), and the European Bank for induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC). Over 300 cell lines were reviewed in this study. Although all cells were obtained from human donors, none of the collections were determined to meet fully verifiable xenofree criteria. A large numbers of cell lines were generated with one or more known xenogenic components (e.g., fetal bovine serum, Matrigel). Others lines were classified as 'suspected exposure to xenogenic components', based on the composition of the culture reagent and/or lack of manufacturer product information to verify whether animal‐free reagents were used (e.g., Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium). Even CIRM, a repository clearly dedicated to producing xenofree cell lines, included Vitronectin (VTN‐N) Recombinant Human Protein that was manufactured using Casein Peptone Type I derived from bovine milk. The results show that major stem cell collections ‐‐ despite substantial efforts to improve accessibility, consistency and reproducibility ‐‐ either fail to be xenofree or make it difficult to establish truly xenofree research conditions. The absence of xenofree resources fundamentally undermines the clinical, scientific and ethical integrity of stem cell research and raises specific concerns for readiness to study AD and COVID‐19 using iPSCs. There is a clear need for xenofree sources, not only for clinical applications but also for the discovery and testing phases of research. This will likely require the development of open and transparent xenofree certification. By establishing truly xenofree research criteria, the field can build a foundation for accurately and effectively studying conditions that affect large parts of the population, including AD and COVID‐19. Xenofree conditions for the study of long‐term sequelae will be important in COVID‐19 research as sources for iPSC cells from recovered and vaccinated individuals become available. Beyond population impact studies, having a xenofree platform could help lay the groundwork for safe and effective personalized medicine.","Edrosa, Eizleayne; Lam, Ann; Ohayon, Elan",FASEB J,431,1

This study aims to probe the protective effect and mechanism of recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor 2 (rhKGF-2) against smoke inhalation-induced lung injury (SILI) in rats. The SILI was induced in rats using a smoke exposure model, which were then treated with rhKGF-2. The rat blood was collected for blood-gas analysis, and the levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress markers in the plasma were measured. The rat lung tissues were collected. The pathological changes and cell apoptosis were determined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1, and FoxO1-NLRP3 inflammasome expression were verified by western blot (WB). Both of the human alveolar epithelial cell (HPAEpiC) and primary rat alveolar epithelial cell were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for making in-vitro alveolar epithelial cell injury model. After treatment with rhKGF-2, GSK2126458 (PI3K inhibitor) and AS1842856 (FoxO1 inhibitor), the cell viability, apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/Nrf2, HO-1/NQO1, and FoxO1-NLRP3 in HPAEpiC and primary rat alveolar epithelial cell were examined. The data suggested that rhKGF-2 reduced LPS-induced HPAEpiC cell and primary rat alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and the expression of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress factors. Moreover, rhKGF-2 improved the blood gas and alleviated SILI-induced lung histopathological injury in vivo via repressing inflammation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, rhKGF-2 activated PI3K/Akt pathway, enhanced Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 expression, and attenuated FoxO1-NLRP3 inflammasome both in vitro and in vivo. However, pharmaceutical inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway attenuated rhKGF-2-mediated protective effects against SILI, while suppressing FoxO1 promoted rhKGF-2-mediated protective effects. Taken together, this study demonstrated that rhKGF-2 mitigated SILI by regulating the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway and the FoxO1-NLRP3 axis, which provides new reference in treating SILI.","Fu, Zhonghua; Jiang, Zhengying; Guo, Guanghua; Liao, Xincheng; Liu, Mingzhuo; Xiong, Zhenfang",Front Pharmacol,431,1

Previous studies have focused more on the health–growth nexus, but the role of poverty reduction and the threshold of health required to mitigate the effect of poverty on economic growth were missing. This paper, therefore, examined the life expectancy–growth nexus and the role of poverty reduction with the view to determine the contribution of health to growth and poverty reduction and the threshold of health required to mitigate the adverse effect of poverty on economic growth in Nigeria. Based on the endogenous growth theoretical approach, the link between life expectancy, poverty incidence, and economic growth was estimated using the fully modified ordinary least square method. Findings showed that health contributes positively to economic growth and also mitigates the adverse effect of poverty on economic growth in Nigeria. The study determined the minimum threshold of life expectancy of 64.4 years as a health improvement annual benchmark. Therefore, for Nigeria to achieve sustainable economic growth and significant poverty reduction, policies aimed at achieving the newly determined health improvement threshold from the current annual average of 47.8 years are fundamental.","Lawanson, Olukemi I.; Umar, Dominic Ikoh",SN Bus Econ,431,1

This paper examines the relation of leader to society he uses to ground his account of the state in the 1930s. But breakthroughs in the previous decade, in Being and Time in particular, make the political ontology he endorses less compelling. Heidegger’s political positions are incompatible with his account of the ontological difference. The power of the leader of the society he or she leads cannot repeat the relation of Being over entities. Ontologically speaking, totalitarianism is a category mistake.

However, mainstream research has tended to focus on the negative effects of smartphone. Even though smartphone use can have adverse outcomes, it may also allow students to engage in flexible mobile learning, gain access to important information about their possible future careers and achieve their personal goals. To fill this gap in adolescent smartphone usage, this study explored the smartphone usage patterns of adolescent subpopulations and the associations with their self-control, achievement goals, and academic achievements. Data were collected from 2341 s-year high school students as part of a larger longitudinal panel study. Three distinct smartphone usage profiles were identified in the latent profile analysis: learning, recreational use, and minimal use. Respondents with high perseverance were assigned to the learning group, and respondents with lower compliance and perseverance were assigned to the recreational group. The achievement goal score was found to be the highest in the learning group and lowest in the recreational group. Academic achievement was found to be higher in both the learning and minimal use groups than the recreational use group. Based on these findings, the implications of this study for research and practice are discussed.","Yoon, Meehyun; Yun, Heoncheol",Asia Pacific Educ,431,24

METHODS: We examined National Family Health Survey data for the respective states in which registries are located, on relevant indicators like multiparity, early childbearing, cervical examination, multiple sexual partners/high-risk sexual behavior, and HIV prevalence (for cervical cancer), multiparity, early childbearing, duration of breastfeeding, overweight, alcohol use, and clinical breast examination (for breast cancer). We used Global Adult Tobacco Survey smoking data. RESULTS: The top four positions in cancer cervix were all in registries from northeast India with a higher proportion of multiparous women (≥3 births; around 40%), whereas three major metros in the south and the national capital of Delhi, all with a relatively low proportion of multiparous women (11–25%) topped the chart for breast cancer. Overweight/obesity was higher in states with a higher incidence of breast cancer (23.3–31%) compared to states with a lower incidence (12.2–16%). No clear patterns emerged with regard to alcohol consumption, duration of breastfeeding or clinical breast examination. CONCLUSION: The shift in the childbearing age group explains the increasing breast cancer rates in urban areas, whereas the persisting higher rate of multiparity explains higher cervical cancer rates especially in underserved states in the northeast. India needs to invest in transforming its cancer control program to be a more resilient one with a focus on screening and prevention.","Pilakkadavath, Zarin I.; Rao, Arathi P.; Nayar, K.

Most previous bibliometric studies on anesthesiology examined data limited to journals focused on anesthesiology rather than data answerable to authors in anesthesia departments. This study comprehensively explored publication trends in the field of anesthesiology and their impact. We hypothesized that anesthesiology's bibliometric scene would differ based on whether articles in the same study period were published in anesthesiology-focused journals or were produced by authors in anesthesia departments but published in non-specialty journals. Methods: This cross-sectional study used bibliometric data from the Science Citation Index Expanded database between 1999 and 2018. Two datasets were assembled. The first dataset was a subject-dataset (articles published in 31 journals in the anesthesiology category of InCites Journal Citation Reports in 2018); the second dataset was the department-dataset (articles published in the Science Citation Index Expanded by authors in anesthesia departments). We captured the bibliographical record of each article in both datasets and noted each article's Institute for Scientific Information code, publication year, title, abstract, author addresses, subject category, and references for further study. Results: A total of 69,593 articles were published—cited 1,497,932 times—in the subject-dataset; a total of 167,501 articles were published—cited 3,731,540 times—in the department-dataset. The results demonstrate differences between the two datasets. First, the number of articles was stagnant, with little growth (average annual growth rate = 0.31%) in the subject-dataset; whereas there was stable growth (average annual growth rate = 4.50%) in articles in the department-dataset. Second, only 30.4% of anesthesia department articles were published in anesthesiology journals. Third, journals related to “pain” had the lowest department-subject ratio, which was attributable to a large portion of non-anesthesia department researchers' participation in related research. Conclusions: This study showed that articles published in anesthesiology-focused and non-specialty journals demonstrate fundamentally different trends. Thus, it not only helps researchers develop a more comprehensive understanding of the current publication status and trends in anesthesiology, but also provides a basis for national academic organizations to frame relevant anesthesiology development policies and rationalize resource allocation.","Chen, Sy-Yuan; Wei, Ling-Fang; Huang, Mu-Hsuan; Ho, Chiu-Ming",Front Med (Lausanne),431,1

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous imaging-guided spine cryoablation for pain palliation and local tumor control for vertebral metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Imaging-guided spine cryoablation was performed in 14 patients (31 tumors) with vertebral metastases refractory to conventional chemoradiation therapy or analgesics, to achieve pain palliation and local tumor control in this retrospective study. Spinal nerve and soft-tissue thermal protection techniques were implemented in all ablations. Patient response was evaluated by a pain numeric rating scale administered before the procedure and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure. Pre- and postprocedural analgesic requirements (expressed as morphine-equivalent dosages) were also analyzed at the same time points. Pre- and postprocedural cross-sectional imaging was evaluated in all patients to assess local control (no radiographic evidence of disease at the treated sites). Complications were monitored. Analysis of the primary end points was undertaken via paired-comparison procedures by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS Thirty-one tumors were ablated in 14 patients (9 women and 5 men; 20-73 years of age; mean age, 53 years). The most common tumor location was in the lumbar spine (n = 14, 45%), followed by the thoracic spine (n = 8, 26%), sacrum (n = 6, 19%), coccyx (n = 2, 6%), and cervical spine (n = 1, 3%). There were statistically significant decreases in the median numeric rating scale score and analgesic usage at 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month time points (P < .001 for all). Local tumor control was achieved in 96.7% (30/31) of tumors (median follow-up, 10 months). Two patients had transient postprocedural unilateral lower extremity radiculopathy and weakness.

It is our hypothesis that procedural release of embolic particulate may be one contributor to poor outcomes and is a modifiable risk. The goal of this study is to assess various treatment strategies that reduce the risk of distal emboli. METHODS Mechanical thrombectomy was simulated in a vascular phantom with collateral circulation. Hard fragment-prone clots (HFC) and soft elastic clots (SECs) were used to generate middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions that were retrieved by the Solitaire FR devices through (1) an 8 Fr balloon guide catheter (BGC), (2) a 5 Fr distal access catheter at the proximal aspect of the clot in the MCA (Solumbra), or (3) a 6 Fr guide catheter with the tip at the cervical internal carotid artery (guide catheter, GC). Results from mechanical thrombectomy were compared with those from direct aspiration using the Penumbra 5MAX catheter. The primary endpoint was the size distribution of emboli to the distribution of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. RESULTS Solumbra was the most efficient method for reducing HFC fragments (p<0.05) while BGC was the best method for preventing SEC fragmentation (p<0.05). The risk of forming HFC distal emboli (>1000 µm) was significantly increased using GC. A non-statistically significant benefit of direct aspiration was observed in several subgroups of emboli with size 50-1000 µm. However, compared with the stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy techniques, direct aspiration significantly increased the risk of SEC fragmentation (<50 µm) by at least twofold.

We focus on strong social distancing, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards nonquarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of the active phase.

PURPOSE This study aims to quantify the incidence of linear and angular growth disturbance of adolescents undergoing partial transphyseal ACL reconstruction (ACLR) while assessing graft failure rates, reoperation rates, and functional outcomes in the population. STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing partial transphyseal ACLR by 2 surgeons were retrospectively reviewed. Radiographic outcomes, including bilateral limb length, mechanical axis deviation (MAD), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (MLDFA), and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), were measured on long standing anterior-posterior view radiographs postoperatively. Growth disturbance was defined as ≥1-cm leg length discrepancy, ≥1-cm difference in MAD, or 5° difference in MLDFA or MPTA as compared with the nonoperative side and as MAD, MLDFA, or MPTA outside the established range of reference values. Clinical outcomes, including graft failure and reoperation, were recorded at each follow-up visit. Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC) scores were collected electronically after last follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-four patients (mean ± SD age, 12.3 ± 0.9 years; 79.2% male) with a mean follow-up of 31.5 ± 17.1 months met inclusion criteria for the study. Overall postoperative growth disturbance incidence was 16.7% (4 of 24), but the incidence of growth disturbance was 66.7% (2 of 3) for those patients with >5 years of growth remaining. Seven patients (29.2%) required reoperation, most frequently for hardware removal. Two patients (8.3%) had graft failure with subsequent revision ACL reconstruction. One patient underwent bilateral medial distal femur hemiepiphysiodesis for genu valgum that was present before ACLR, but no other patients required guided growth procedures. In the subset of patients who completed a Pedi-IKDC questionnaire, the mean score was 94.8 ± 5.3. CONCLUSION Overall, partial transphyseal ACLR has good functional outcomes and graft failure and reoperation rates, comparable with those seen with transphyseal and all-epiphyseal techniques. While postoperative growth disturbance occurred in 16.7% of the cohort, the severity was mild and well tolerated without necessitating secondary procedures. There is a high rate of growth disturbance of patients with >5 years of growth remaining (66.7%). Partial transphyseal ACLR represents a valid recommendation for adolescent patients with ACL injury and ≤5 years of growth remaining.","Chambers, Caitlin C; Monroe, Emily J; Allen, Christina R; Pandya, Nirav K",The American journal of sports medicine,431,1

However, this has to be done with caution because of the high mortality rate of calves due to the lack of nutrients and the harsh environmental conditions. Twenty-four weaned male yak calves were used in a 60 d feeding trial in which astragalus root extract (ARE) was supplemented. They were assigned randomly to one of four dietary treatments (n = 6 per treatment) that differed in ARE level: 0 g kg-1 (control), ARE0 ; 20 g kg-1 , ARE20 ; 50 g kg-1 , ARE50; and 80 g kg-1 DMI, ARE80 . RESULTS Final bodyweight and average daily gain (ADG) were significantly higher and the DMI:ADG ratio significantly lower in calves with ARE supplementation than control (ARE0 ) calves. Ruminal concentrations of acetate and propionate and serum concentration of superoxide dismutase in ARE80 calves were higher than in the other groups and serum concentration of insulin was higher in ARE80 calves than in ARE20 calves. Serum IgG and IL-2 concentrations in ARE-fed calves were higher than in controls. Serum TNF-α concentration was higher in ARE50 and ARE80 groups than ARE0 calves and serum IL-6 concentration was higher in ARE80 than in ARE0 calves. Serum IgA, IgG and IgM concentrations increased with age in ARE-fed calves. ARE supplementation increased the abundance of fiber degrading bacteria. CONCLUSION Astragalus root extract at a dosage of 5% to 8% DMI can be supplemented to early weaned yak calves to improve growth performance, antioxidant capacity and immunity.

Our aim was to assess the potential effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for COVID-19 in children. Methods Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane library, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang Data) from their inception to March 31, 2020 were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical controlled trials and cohort studies of interventions with antiviral agents for children (less than 18 years of age) with COVID-19. Results A total of 23 studies with 6,008 patients were included. There was no direct evidence and all of evidence were indirect. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate to high in general. The effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 is uncertain: For adults with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir had no effect on mortality [risk ratio (RR) =0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45 to 1.30]. Arbidol and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had no benefit on probability of negative PCR test (RR =1.27; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.73; RR =0.93; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.18) respectively. For adults with SARS, interferon was associated with reduced corticosteroid dose [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -0.14 g; 95% CI, -0.21 to -0.07] but had no effect on mortality (RR =0.72; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.88); ribavirin did not reduce mortality (RR =0.68; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.06) and was associated with high risk of severe adverse reactions; and oseltamivir had no effect on mortality (RR =0.87; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.38).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A non-systematic literature review was performed using PubMed/Medline search electronic engines. Existing patents for robotic devices were researched using the Google search engine. Findings were also critically analysed taking into account the personal experience of the authors. RESULTS The relevant patents for the first generation of the da Vinci platform will expire in 2019. New robotic systems are coming onto the stage. These can be classified according to type of console, arrangement of robotic arms, handles and instruments, and other specific features (haptic feedback, eye-tracking). The Telelap ALF-X robot uses an open console with eye-tracking, laparoscopy-like handles with haptic feedback, and arms mounted on separate carts; first clinical trials with this system were reported in 2016. The Medtronic robot provides an open console using three-dimensional high-definition video technology and three arms. The Avatera robot features a closed console with microscope-like oculars, four arms arranged on one cart, and 5-mm instruments with six degrees of freedom. The REVO-I consists of an open console and a four-arm arrangement on one cart; the first experiments with this system were published in 2016. Medicaroid uses a semi-open console and three robot arms attached to the operating table. Clinical trials of the SP 1098-platform using the da Vinci Xi for console-based single-port surgery were reported in 2015. The SPORT robot has been tested in animal experiments for single-port surgery. The SurgiBot represents a bedside solution for single-port surgery providing flexible tube-guided instruments. The Avicenna Roboflex has been developed for robotic flexible ureteroscopy, with promising early clinical results. CONCLUSIONS Several console-based robots for laparoscopic multi- and single-port surgery are expected to come to market within the next 5 years. Future developments in the field of robotic surgery are likely to focus on the specific features of robotic arms, instruments, console, and video technology. The high technical standards of four da Vinci generations have set a high bar for upcoming devices. Ultimately, the implementation of these upcoming systems will depend on their clinical applicability and costs. How these technical developments will facilitate surgery and whether their use will translate into better outcomes for our patients remains to be determined.","Rassweiler, Jens J; Autorino, Riccardo; Klein, Jan; Mottrie, Alex; Goezen, Ali Serdar; Stolzenburg, Jens-Uwe; Rha, Koon H; Schurr, Marc; Kaouk, Jihad; Patel, Vipul; Dasgupta, Prokar; Liatsikos, Evangelos",BJU international,431,1

This review aimed to quantify the representation of women in exercise thermoregulation research between 2010 and 2019 and the frequency that these articles reported details pertaining to female participants' menstrual cycle to determine the volume of novel research that is directly relevant to this growing population. METHODS Original exercise thermoregulatory studies published in three major sports medicine databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus) between 2010 and 2019 were surveyed. Articles were screened to determine the number of female and male participants in the study and whether studies involving women reported menstrual orientation or phase. Research involving healthy adult participants and an exercise protocol with a thermoregulatory outcome measure were included in the review. RESULTS A total of 1407 articles were included in the review, involving 28,030 participants. The annual representation of women ranged from a mean of 11.6% [95% credible interval (CI); 9.2, 14.3] to 17.8% [95% CI; 15.2, 20.6] across the 10 years, indicating studies predominantly included men. Nonetheless, there was a small statistical increase in the overall proportion of women, with a mean overall proportion change of 0.7% [95% CI; 0.2, 1.2] per year. The increase appeared to be driven by a reduction in the number of studies including only men, rather than studies including more women alongside men, or increased women-only studies. Less than one third of articles involving women reported the menstrual orientation of participants and less than one quarter reported both menstrual orientation and phase. This study shows that women were proportionally underrepresented in exercise thermoregulation research during the past decade and the majority of studies did not report menstrual cycle details of female participants. Researchers should consider including women in future work where their inclusion could contribute meaningful data that enhance the evidence-based and ultimately improves our comprehension of women's thermal physiology.","Hutchins, Kate P; Borg, David N; Bach, Aaron J E; Bon, Joshua J; Minett, Geoffrey M; Stewart, Ian B",Sports medicine - open,431,29
65666,65666,65666,Setting Expectations for Clinical Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,18.559,6.290527,2020-07-27,"Current debate exists around whether a presumed eccentric exercise, the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), actually causes active hamstring muscle lengthening. This is because of the decoupling that can occur between the muscle fascicle and muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length changes in relatively compliant human lower-limb MTUs, which results in MTU lengthening not necessarily causing muscle fascicle lengthening. This missing knowledge complicates the interpretation of why the NHE is effective at reducing running-related hamstring muscle injury risk in athletes previously unfamiliar with performing this exercise. The purpose of the study was therefore to investigate if the most-commonly injured hamstring muscle, the biceps femoris long head (BF), exhibits active muscle lengthening (i.e. an eccentric muscle action) during the NHE up until peak force in Nordic novices. External reaction force at the ankle, knee flexion angle, and BF and semitendinosus muscle activities were recorded from the left leg of 14 participants during the NHE. Simultaneously, BF muscle architecture was imaged using B-mode ultrasound imaging, and muscle architecture changes were tracked using two different tracking algorithms. From ~85 to 100% of peak NHE force, both tracking algorithms detected that BF muscle fascicles (n = 10) significantly lengthened (p < 0.01) and had a mean positive lengthening velocity (p ≤ 0.02), while knee extension velocity remained positive (17°·s-1) over knee flexion angles from 53 to 37° and a duration of 1.6 s. Despite some individual cases of brief isometric fascicle behavior and brief fascicle shortening during BF MTU lengthening, the predominant muscle action was eccentric under a relatively high muscle activity level (59% of maximum). Eccentric hamstring muscle action therefore does occur during the NHE in relatively strong (429 N) Nordic novices, which might contribute to the increase in resting BF muscle fascicle length and reduction in running-related injury risk, which have previously been reported following NHE training. Whether an eccentric BF muscle action occurs in individuals accustomed to the NHE remains to be tested.","Raiteri, Brent J; Beller, Ronja; Hahn, Daniel",Frontiers in sports and active living,431,12

Here, we determined the genetic architecture of both historical and modern lions to document changes in genetic diversity over the last century. We surveyed microsatellite and mitochondrial genome variation from 143 high-quality museum specimens of known provenance, allowing us to directly compare this information with data from several recently published nuclear and mitochondrial studies. Our results provide evidence for male-mediated gene flow and recent isolation of local subpopulations, likely due to habitat fragmentation. Nuclear markers showed a significant decrease in genetic diversity from the historical (HE=0.833) to the modern (HE=0.796) populations, while mitochondrial genetic diversity was maintained (Hd = 0.98 for both). While the historical population appears to have been panmictic based on nDNA data, hierarchical structure analysis identified four tiers of genetic structure in modern populations and was able to detect most sampling locations. Mitogenome analyses identified 4 clusters: Southern, Mixed, Eastern, and Western; and were consistent between modern and historically sampled haplotypes. Within the last century, habitat fragmentation caused lion subpopulations to become more geographically isolated as human expansion changed the African landscape. This resulted in an increase in fine-scale nuclear genetic structure and loss of genetic diversity as lion subpopulations became more differentiated, while mitochondrial structure and diversity were maintained over time.","Curry, Caitlin J; Davis, Brian W; Bertola, Laura D; White, Paula A; Murphy, William J; Derr, James N",Molecular biology and evolution,431,1

This article discusses recent literature documenting the impact of racism on early childhood development, disparities in access to developmental services and ways healthcare providers and health systems can promote physician well being during these difficult times. RECENT FINDINGS Exposure to racism begins prenatally, and early childhood experiences with racism are intimately tied to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Early intervention is key to treating children with developmental delay, but disparities exist in accessing eligibility screening and in the provision of services. Paediatric providers are at risk of developing secondary traumatic stress and burnout, which may affect the care that they provide.

However, the activities and efficiencies of the transition metal-based nanoparticles or single-atom sites are still ambiguous in Fenton-like reactions. Herein, to compare the Fenton-like catalytic efficiencies of the nanoparticles and single atoms, the free-standing nanofibrous catalyst comprising Co nanocrystals and Co-Nx codoped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or bare Co-Nx doped CNTs is fabricated. It is noteworthy that all these nanofibrous catalysts exhibit efficient activities, mesoporous structures, and conductive carbon networks, which allow a feasible validation of the catalytic effects. Benefiting from the maximized atomic utilization, the atomic Co-Nx centers exhibit much higher reaction kinetic constant (κ = 0.157 min-1 ) and mass activity toward the degradation of bisphenol A, far exceeding the Co nanocrystals (κ = 0.082 min-1 ). However, for the volume activities, the single-atom catalyst does not show apparent advantages compared to the nanocrystal-based catalyst.

The temporal pattern of opioid prescribing in the context of the opioid epidemic remains unknown. Objective To examine the temporal pattern of opioid prescribing within an ED for varying pain conditions between 2009 and 2018. Design, Setting, and Participants A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted at the ED of an urban academic medical center. All patients treated within that ED between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, were included. Main Outcomes and Measures The proportion of patients prescribed an opioid for treatment of pain in the ED temporally by condition, condition type, patient demographics, and physician prescriber. Results Between 2009 and 2018, 556 176 patient encounters took place in the ED, with 70 218 unique opioid prescriptions ordered. A total of 316 632 patients (55.9%) were female, 45 070 (42.6%) were of white race, and 43 412 (40.6%) were privately insured; the median age group was 41 to 45 years. Yearly opioid prescriptions decreased by 66.3% (from 16.3 to 5.5 opioids per 100 encounters) between 2013 and 2018, with a yearly adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.808 (95% CI, 0.802-0.814) compared with the prior year. In patients with musculoskeletal pain (back, joint, limb, and neck pain), opioid prescribing decreased by 71.1% (from 36.7 to 10.6 opioids per 100 encounters between 2013 and 2018; aOR, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.744-0.773). In patients with musculoskeletal trauma (fracture, sprain, contusion, and injury), opioid prescribing decreased by 58.0% (from 34.2 to 14.8 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.811; 95% CI, 0.797-0.824). In patients with nonmusculoskeletal pain (abdominal pain, kidney stone, respiratory distress, and pharyngitis) opioid prescribing decreased by 53.7% (from 20.1 to 9.3 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.834-0.868). Between 2009 and 2018, patients who were black (aOR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.741-0.779) and those who were Asian (aOR, 0.714; 95% CI, 0.665-0.764) had the lowest odds of receiving an opioid compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions and Relevance There was a substantial temporal decrease in the number of opioid prescriptions within this ED during the study period. This decrease was associated with substantial relative reductions in opioid prescribing for treatment of musculoskeletal pain compared with fractures and kidney stones.","Smith, Ben C; Vigotsky, Andrew D; Apkarian, A Vania; Schnitzer, Thomas J",JAMA network open,431,16

Tumor identification with fluorescence imaging could improve positive margin rates through demarcating location, size, and invasiveness of tumors. We investigated the technique's diagnostic accuracy in detecting tumors during BCS using intravenous indocyanine green (ICG) and a custom-built fluorescence camera system. METHODS In this single-center prospective clinical study, 40 recruited BCS patients were sub-categorized into two cohorts. In the first 'enhanced permeability and retention' (EPR) cohort, 0.25 mg/kg ICG was injected ~ 25 min prior to tumor excision, and in the second 'angiography' cohort, ~ 5 min prior to tumor excision. Subsequently, an in-house imaging system was used to image the tumor in situ prior to resection, ex vivo following resection, the resection bed, and during grossing in the histopathology laboratory to compare the technique's diagnostic accuracy between the cohorts. RESULTS The two cohorts were matched in patient and tumor characteristics. The majority of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma with concomitant ductal carcinoma in situ. Tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) in the angiography cohort was superior to the EPR cohort (TBR = 3.18 ± 1.74 vs 2.10 ± 0.92 respectively, p = 0.023).

Recently, a sophisticated modality (the Ibis Biosciences T5000 biosensor system) has been introduced that uses pan-domain primers in a series of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to identify and speciate essentially all bacteria and fungi as well as to identify key antibiotic resistance genes. We investigated the role of the Ibis in identifying infecting organisms in cases of known and suspected periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS Synovial fluid specimens were collected prospectively from eighty-two patients undergoing eighty-seven arthroplasty procedures (sixty-five knee revisions, fifteen hip revisions, and seven primary knee arthroplasties) and were sent for both conventional culture and Ibis analysis. The surgeon's clinical determination of the cause for revision arthroplasty was failure due to infection in twenty-three cases and noninfectious failure in fifty-seven cases. RESULTS In the twenty-three cases that were considered on clinical grounds to involve a periprosthetic joint infection, the Ibis detected the same pathogen isolated by conventional culture in seventeen of eighteen cases and also detected one or more organisms in four of the five culture-negative cases. In addition, the Ibis detected organisms in fifty (88%) of the fifty-seven cases in which revision arthroplasty was performed for a presumed noninfectious failure. CONCLUSIONS The Ibis technology was not only effective at detecting organisms in cases of suspected periprosthetic joint infection in which cultures were negative, but it also suggested that many of the revision arthroplasty cases that have previously been considered to be purely aseptic may have a component of unrecognized, subclinical infection.","Jacovides, Christina L; Kreft, Rachael; Adeli, Bahar; Hozack, Bryan; Ehrlich, Garth D; Parvizi, Javad",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Pre-printed articles were also reviewed at medRxiv.org. DATA ANALYSIS Corticosteroids were not recommended early in the COVID-19 pandemic outside of the use for concomitant indications (i.e. ARDS, septic shock) as they have been associated with delayed time to viral clearance in other viral pneumonias. A randomized trial showed a mortality benefit with dexamethasone in COVID-19. Guidelines have been updated to include a strong recommendation for their use in COVID-19 in those hospitalized requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION Based on data from available randomized trials, patients that require respiratory support or mechanical ventilation benefit from corticosteroid therapy.

Change-oriented leadership was negatively related to performance obstacles, but only indirectly through participation in decision-making, whereas it was positively related to job satisfaction both directly and indirectly. ORIGINALITY/VALUE The authors developed a theoretical model based on existing theory, but to their knowledge no other studies have tested these exact relationships within one model. These findings offer insights relevant to current and ongoing developments in the healthcare field and to the question of how hospitals may deal with continuous changes in ways that could contribute positively towards outcomes relevant to service quality.","Øygarden, Olaug; Olsen, Espen; Mikkelsen, Aslaug",Journal of health organization and management,431,1

A Systematic Review.,18.464176,6.542515,2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, children's hospitals across the country postponed elective surgery beginning in March 2020. As projective curves flattened, administrators and surgeons sought to develop strategies to safely resume non-emergent surgery. This article reviews challenges and solutions specific to a children's hospital related to the resumption of elective pediatric surgeries. We present our tiered reentry approach for pediatric surgery as well as report early data for surgical volume and tracking COVID-19 cases during reentry. METHODS The experience of shutdown, protocol development, and early reentry of elective pediatric surgery are reported from Levine's Children's Hospital (LCH), a free-leaning children's hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. Data reported were obtained from de-identified hospital databases. RESULTS Pediatric surgery experienced a dramatic decrease in case volumes at LCH during the shutdown, variable by specialty. A tiered and balanced reentry strategy was implemented with steady resumption of elective surgery following strict pre-procedural screening and testing. Early outcomes showed a steady thorough fluctuating increase in elective case volumes without evidence of a surgery-associated positive spread through periprocedural tracking. CONCLUSION Reentry of non-emergent pediatric surgical care requires unique considerations including the impact of COVID-19 on children, each children hospital structure and resources, and preventing undue delay in intervention for age- and disease-specific pediatric conditions. A carefully balanced strategy has been critical for safe reentry following the anticipated surge. Ongoing tracking of resource utilization, operative volumes, and testing results will remain vital as community spread continues to fluctuate across the country.","Pickens, Ryan C; Kao, Angela M; Williams, Mark A; Herman, Andrew C; Kneisl, Jeffrey S",The American surgeon,431,19

A clinician's perspective.,18.78742,6.6208735,2020-05-19,"OBJECTIVES Navajo Nation is disproportionately affected by hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a severe respiratory disease that can quickly progress to respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. The initial signs and symptoms of HCPS are indistinguishable from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, this distinction is critical, as the disease course differs greatly, with most patients with COVID-19 experiencing mild to moderate illness. We set out to determine if the evaluation of peripheral blood smears for five hematopathologic criteria previously identified as hallmarks of hantavirus infection, or ""the hantavirus 5-point screen,"" could distinguish between COVID-19 and HCPS. METHODS The hantavirus 5-point screen was performed on peripheral blood smears from 139 patients positive for COVID-19 seeking treatment from Tséhootsooí Medical Center and two Emory University hospitals. RESULTS Of these 139 individuals, 136 (98%) received a score of 3/5 or below, indicating low suspicion for HCPS. While thrombocytopenia, one of the key signs of HCPS, was seen in the patients with COVID-19, it was generally mild and remained stable on repeat specimens collected 12 to 24 hours later. CONCLUSIONS Given these findings, the 5-point screen remains a useful rapid screening tool for potential HCPS cases and may be useful to distinguish early HCPS from COVID-19 in HCPS endemic regions.","Joyce, Allison K; Oliver, Tarrah T; Kofman, Aaron D; Talker, Donna L; Safaeian, Shahrokh; Peker Barclift, Deniz; Perricone, Adam J; D'Andrea, Shawn M; Whitesell, Amy N; Yazzie, Del; Guarner, Jeannette; Saleki, Mozafar; Ingall, Glynnis B; Choi, Mary J; Antone-Nez, Ramona",American journal of clinical pathology,431,1

We sought to determine hospital-based factors associated with achievement of PSC certification. METHODS We used the 2011 American Hospital Association survey and the 2010 national census for population and household data to identify potential hospital and demographic factors influencing certification as a PSC by the Joint Commission, Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program, and DNV Healthcare. RESULTS Of the 3696 hospitals to complete the survey, 3069 fulfilling study criteria included 908 PSC (31%) and 2161 non-PSC. Independent hospital characteristics associated with PSC certification were Joint Commission accreditation (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-5.0), increasing size (per quartile in number of beds; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.1-3.1) and inpatient neurological services (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.4-4.6), number of households per zip code (per 1000 households; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2), increasing Hispanic population (by 10% increase; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2), and income per household (per $10 000; OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3). Designation as a sole community provider (OR, 0.22; 0.10-0.47) or governmental hospital control (0.61; 0.44-0.84) was associated with noncertification. CONCLUSIONS Less than 1 in 3 hospitals has achieved certification as an PSC. Potential areas of improvement include increasing certification of governmental-controlled hospitals.","McDonald, Catherine M; Cen, Steven; Ramirez, Lucas; Song, Sarah; Saver, Jeffrey L; Mack, William J; Sanossian, Nerses",Stroke,431,1

METHODS An institutional review board-approved, HIPPA-compliant review identified 73 patients with 94 previously untreated CLM that underwent RFA between March 2003 and May 2010, resulting in an ablation zone completely covering the tumor 4-8 weeks after RFA dynamic CT. Comparing the pre- with the post-RFA CT, the minimal margin size was categorized to 0, 1-5, 6-10, and 11-15 mm. Follow-up included CT every 2-4 months. Kaplan-Meier methodology and Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of the minimal margin size, tumor location, size, and proximity to a vessel on LTP. RESULTS Forty-five of 94 (47.9 %) CLM progressed locally. Median LTP-free survival (LPFS) was 16 months. Two-year LPFS rates for ablated CLM with minimal margin of 0, 1-5 mm, 6-10 mm, 11-15 mm were 26, 46, 74, and 80 % (p < 0.011). Minimal margin (p = 0.002) and tumor size (p = 0.028) were independent risk factors for LTP. The risk for LTP decreased by 46 % for each 5-mm increase in minimal margin size, whereas each additional 5-mm increase in tumor size increased the risk of LTP by 22 %. CONCLUSIONS An ablation zone with a minimal margin uniformly larger than 5 mm 4-8 weeks postablation CT is associated with the best local tumor control.","Wang, Xiaodong; Sofocleous, Constantinos T; Erinjeri, Joseph P; Petre, Elena N; Gonen, Mithat; Do, Kinh G; Brown, Karen T; Covey, Anne M; Brody, Lynn A; Alago, William; Thornton, Raymond H; Kemeny, Nancy E; Solomon, Stephen B",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,431,8

METHODS A rapid, systematic review was conducted to elucidate existing safety planning strategies used during public health emergencies. These were supplemented with strategies from an expert panel. A survey of IPV survivors and service providers gauged the helpfulness of each strategy during COVID-19. RESULTS Together, the systematic review and expert panel yielded 26 conceptually distinct strategies, which were evaluated by 111 IPV survivors and providers. Of these, 19 (69%) were 'highly recommended', 3 (12%) were 'somewhat recommended' and 6 (23%) were not recommended for use during the COVID-19 pandemic because they might make the violence worse. CONCLUSIONS Safety planning needs have changed owing to the effect of COVID-19 on IPV incidence, service provision and risk factors, as well as policies restricting freedom of movement. These results will be used to modify an existing IPV safety planning mobile application for use during COVID-19 and future public health emergencies.","Metheny, N; Perri, M; Velonis, A; Kamalanathan, J; Hassan, M; Buhariwala, P; Du Mont, J; Mason, R; O'Campo, P",Public health,431,27

A pool testing approach may shorten the screening time and increase the test rate during times of limited test availability and inadequate reporting speed. Pool testing has been effectively used for a wide variety of infectious disease screening settings. Historically, it originated from serological testing in syphilis. During the current COVID-19 pandemic pool testing is considered across the globe to inform opening strategies and monitor infection rates after interventions were implemented. OBJECTIVES This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global efforts to implement pool testing, specifically for screening of COVID-19. SOURCES Data were retrieved from a detailed search for peer-reviewed articles and preprint reports using Medline/PubMed, medRxiv, Web of Science, and Google up to March 21, 2021, using search terms ""pool testing"", ""viral"", ""serum"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"". CONTENT This review summarizes the history and theory of pool testing. We identified numerous peer-reviewed articles that describe specific details and practical implementation of pool testing. Successful examples as well as limitations of pool testing, in general and specifically related to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, are reviewed. While promising, significant operational, pre-analytical, logistical, and economic challenges need to be overcome to advance pool testing. IMPLICATIONS The theory of pool testing is well understood and numerous successful examples are available from the past. Operationalization of pool testing requires sophisticated processes that are adopted to the local medical circumstances. Special attention needs to be paid to sample collection, sample pooling, and strategies to avoid re-sampling.","Grobe, Nadja; Cherif, Alhaji; Wang, Xiaoling; Dong, Zijun; Kotanko, Peter",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,431,28

Limited data directly compare selection of mechanically ""optimal"" or ""best"" PEEP in both supine and prone positions, either with or without changes in chest wall compliance. To compare best PEEP in these varied conditions, we used an experimental ARDS model to compare the mechanical, gas exchange, and hemodynamic response to PEEP titration in supine and prone position with varied abdominal pressure. METHODS Twelve adult swine underwent pulmonary saline lavage and injurious ventilation to simulate ARDS. We used a reversible model of intra-abdominal hypertension to alter chest wall compliance. Response to PEEP levels of 20,17,14,11, 8, and 5 cmH2O was evaluated under four conditions: supine, high abdominal pressure; prone, high abdominal pressure; supine, low abdominal pressure; and prone, low abdominal pressure. Using lung compliance determined with esophageal pressure, we recorded the ""best PEEP"" and its corresponding target value. Data were evaluated for relationships among abdominal pressure, PEEP, and position using three-way analysis of variance and a linear mixed model with Tukey adjustment. RESULTS Prone position and PEEP independently improved lung compliance (P < .0001). There was no interaction. As expected, intra-abdominal hypertension increased the PEEP needed for the best lung compliance (P < .0001 supine, P = .007 prone). However, best PEEP was not significantly different between prone (12.8 ± 2.4 cmH2O) and supine (11.0 ± 4.2 cmH2O) positions when targeting lung compliance CONCLUSIONS: Despite complementary mechanisms, prone position and appropriate PEEP exert their positive effects on lung mechanics independently of each other.","Keenan, Joseph C; Cortes-Puentes, Gustavo A; Zhang, Lei; Adams, Alex B; Dries, David J; Marini, John J",Intensive care medicine experimental,431,1

We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., 'weight gain') and a 'content signature', a numeric code that summarized the metric's conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child's change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.","Leung, Michael; Perumal, Nandita; Mesfin, Elnathan; Krishna, Aditi; Yang, Seungmi; Johnson, William; Bassani, Diego G; Roth, Daniel E",PloS one,431,1

This study aimed to compare clinical features in adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia to those in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).Methods: Clinical presentations, laboratory findings, imaging features, complications, treatment and outcomes were compared between patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and patients with CAP. The study group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia consisted of 120 patients. One hundred and thirty-four patients with CAP were enrolled for comparison.Results: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had lower levels of abnormal laboratory parameters [white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level] and more extensive radiographic involvement. More severe respiratory compromise resulted in a higher rate of intensive care unit admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mechanical ventilation (36% vs 15%, 34% vs 15%, and 32% vs 12%, respectively; all p < 0.05). The 30-day mortality was more than twice as high in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (12% versus 5%; p = 0.063), despite not reaching a statistically significant difference.Conclusions: Lower levels of abnormal laboratory parameters, more extensive radiographic involvement, more severe respiratory compromise, and higher rates of ICU admission, ARDS, and mechanical ventilation are key characteristics that distinguish patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia from patients with CAP.","Tian, Juncai; Xu, Qizhong; Liu, Song; Mao, Lingli; Wang, Maoren; Hou, Xuewen",Current medical research and opinion,431,1

In a murine model of influenza infection, IRF5 deficiency had no effect on viral load in comparison to WT controls, but controlled metabolic responses to viral infection since IRF5 deficiency led to reduced expression of Sirt6 and Hk2. Together, our data indicate that IRF5 is a key component of AM metabolic responses following influenza infection and TLR3 activation.","Albers, Gesa J; Iwasaki, Jua; McErlean, Peter; Ogger, Patricia P; Ghai, Poonam; Khoyratty, Tariq E; Udalova, Irina A; Lloyd, Clare M; Byrne, Adam J",Clinical and experimental immunology,431,16

In the initial stage, CCNP aims to recruit 1520 healthy individuals (6-90 years), which comprises three phases: developing (devCCNP: 6-18 years, N = 480), maturing (matCCNP: 20-60 years, N = 560) and aging (ageCCNP: 60-84 years, N = 480). In this paper, we present an overview of the devCCNP, including study design, participants, data collection and preliminary findings. The devCCNP has acquired data with three repeated measurements from 2013 to 2017 in Southwest University, Chongqing, China (CCNP-SWU, N = 201). It has been accumulating baseline data since July 2018 and the second wave data since September 2020 in Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (CCNP-CAS, N = 168). Each participant in devCCNP was followed up for 2.5 years at 1.25-year intervals. The devCCNP obtained longitudinal neuroimaging, biophysical, social, behavioral and cognitive data via MRI, parent- and self-reported questionnaires, behavioral assessments, and computer tasks. Additionally, data were collected on children's learning, daily life and emotional states during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We address data harmonization across the two sites and demonstrated its promise of characterizing the growth curves for the overall brain morphometry using multi-center longitudinal data. CCNP data will be shared via the National Science Data Bank and requests for further information on collaboration and data sharing are encouraged.","Liu, Siman; Wang, Yin-Shan; Zhang, Qing; Zhou, Quan; Cao, Li-Zhi; Jiang, Chao; Zhang, Zhe; Yang, Ning; Dong, Qi; Zuo, Xi-Nian",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,431,31

The aim was to investigate a new stapler device designed to overcome these side effects. METHOD In all, 135 patients (71 men, mean age 42 years) with degree III haemorrhoids were randomly allotted to stapled haemorrhoidopexy with PPH® staplers (Ethicon EndoSurgery) (63 patients) or with an EEA® stapler (Covidien) (72 patients) in four referral colorectal centres. The number of haemostatic overstitches apposed on the stapled suture, the area of the resected mucosa (in square centimetres) and any postoperative bleeding within 30 days were recorded. RESULTS The mean area of the resected mucosa was significantly wider in EEA than PPH patients (35.75 ± 17.51 vs 28.05 ± 10.23 cm(2), P = 0.002). The median number of haemostatic stitches apposed in the EEA group was significantly lower than in the PPH groups (median value 1, vs 3, interquartile range 0-2, vs 2-5, P < 0.0001). Intraoperative haemostasis was better in the EEA group compared with the PPH01 and PPH03 groups. Postoperative bleeding occurred only in two PPH patients. CONCLUSION Data suggest that the EEA stapler has better haemostatic properties than the PPH stapler and allows resection of a larger area of mucosal prolapse with potential benefits over the recurrence rate of haemorrhoid prolapse.","Giuratrabocchetta, S; Pecorella, G; Stazi, A; Tegon, G; De Fazio, M; Altomare, D F",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,431,13

This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. Observations SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. Conclusions and Relevance As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.","Wiersinga, W Joost; Rhodes, Andrew; Cheng, Allen C; Peacock, Sharon J; Prescott, Hallie C",JAMA,431,0

The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation. In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite. Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention. Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described. Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.","Chakraborty, C; Sharma, A R; Sharma, G; Bhattacharya, M; Lee, S S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,431,20

Healthcare workers are placed at an elevated risk of nosocomial cross-infection from clinical exposure. One diagnostic criterion for COVID-19 is a positive result from a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens, which has been a routine procedure for healthcare workers during the outbreak. In the context of a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), we aimed to lower the probability of clinical cross-infection without impacting the results of pharynx sampling through an optimized pharyngeal swab assisted device (OPAD). Methods To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of an OPAD for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, 22 confirmed COVID-19 cases were enrolled in our self-controlled study. The results of two pharyngeal sampling qRT-PCR tests using the OPAD or the traditional method were recorded each. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, laboratory tests, and computed tomography (CT) results were also collected. The procedure duration and levels of pharynx exposure with the OPAD, and the diagnostic consistency between the OPAD and the traditional method for pharyngeal sampling qRT-PCR, were evaluated individually. Additionally, a questionnaire was designed for healthcare workers who had performed the pharyngeal swab to deepen our understanding of their attitude during their service on the frontline. Results In all 44 samplings (22 samples with each method), the qRT-PCR results of 18 pairs (81.82%) were consistent, while 3 (13.64%) were single positive with the OPAD. The positive rate was slightly higher with the OPAD (54.55%, 12/22) than with the traditional method (45.45%, 10/22). Using the OPAD, the average procedure duration of sampling was 30 s (30±13 s). Pharynx exposure was excellent in 21 subjects (95.45%, 21/22), which meant that the operator could acquire the swabs without difficulty. Conclusions As the COVID-19 pandemic escalates, our OPAD has identical efficacy compared to the traditional method for pharyngeal swabs, and it can also contribute to protecting the safety of healthcare workers.","Jia, Jie; Fang, Sun-Ting; Feng, Xiao-Bo; Tong, Wei; Tian, Hong-Tao; Tang, Jing",Annals of translational medicine,431,29

In this scenario, the current study aimed to identify the impact or effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' health. This is a scoping literature review based on the following databases: Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SciELO, and PUBCOVID19. The study adopted the stages proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and the question orienting the procedures consisted of the acronym PCC (population; concept; context). Eleven articles were included in the review. Clinically, adolescents present the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults. The pandemic and the health measures taken to control transmission were found to be associated with mental health problems in adolescents. Specifically, adolescents have a negative experience with social distancing measures and closing of schools. These measures can also favor situations of violence or aggressive behaviors in the home environment. Healthcare services that treat the adolescent population had to reorient their practices, adopting a virtual model to replace face-to-face care, and even research projects involving adolescence had to be rethought. This scoping review addressed an emerging theme in relation to a population that has received little attention in studies on COVID-19. The results suggest that the pandemic can be considered a determinant that affects different dimensions of adolescents' lives.","Oliveira, Wanderlei Abadio de; Silva, Jorge Luiz da; Andrade, André Luiz Monezi; Micheli, Denise De; Carlos, Diene Monique; Silva, Marta Angélica Iossi",Cadernos de saude publica,431,12

Poults that developed enteritis and depressed growth (SIB flock) were raised on a commercial farm in eastern North Carolina, whereas poults with normal growth and no enteritis (TAU flock) were raised in the Teaching Animal Unit at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Beginning on day 5 through day 35 and at processing, TAU poults were significantly heavier than SIB poults. Jejunal weights, relative jejunal weights, and jejunal densities were greater in SIB poults from day 10 through 35. Jejunal efficiency (body weight /jejunal length) was higher in TAU poults at day 5 and days 10 through 35. Mucosal thickness was greater in SIB poults between days 7 and 21 but greater in TAU poults at days 28 and 35. From day 7 to 35, villus-to-crypt ratios were higher for TAU poults and lower for SIB poults because hyperplastic crypts formed a greater percentage of the mucosa in SIB poults. By day 7, PH3- and CCASP3-positive cells were increased in SIB poults, showing that mucosal changes resulted from combined crypt epithelial hyperplasia and increased apoptosis of villous enterocytes. Findings in this study confirm that enteritis, in the absence of clinical signs, and depressed growth in turkey poults begins by day 7, can be identified microscopically, persists for at least 35 days, is associated with lower processing weights, and has a profound negative effect on turkey growth.","Fletcher, O J; Mansell, R; Martin, M P; Borst, L B; Barnes, H John; Gonzalez, L M",Avian diseases,431,0

Nutraceuticals thus may have a potential role as adjunctive treatments for BD. METHODS A search of Embase via embase.com, PubMed via PubMed, Cumulated index to nursing and allied health literature (CINAHL) Complete via EBSCO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials via cochranelibrary.com was conducted to identify published randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of nutraceuticals on mood symptomatology in adults with BD. Search terms for BD, nutraceuticals, and clinical trials (total search terms = 75) were used to search from inception to February 20, 2020. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS A total of 1,712 studies were identified through the search. After rigorous screening, 22 studies were included in the review. There was large variability across the studies with 15 different nutraceutical agents assessed and as such insufficient homogeneity for a meta-analysis to be conducted (I 2 > 50%). Studies revealed promising, albeit conflicting, evidence for omega-3 fatty acids and N-acetylcysteine. Isolated positive results were reported for coenzyme Q10. CONCLUSION Given nutraceuticals are tolerable and accessible, they may be useful as potential adjunctive treatments for BD. Nutraceuticals targeting neuroinflammation or mitochondrial activity may have the most potential for the depressive phase. However, further studies are required to determine efficacy.","Ashton, Melanie M; Kavanagh, Bianca E; Marx, Wolfgang; Berk, Michael; Sarris, Jerome; Ng, Chee H; Hopwood, Malcolm; Williams, Lana J; Dean, Olivia M",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Proliferative DR (PDR) is a sight-threatening complication of DR and is characterised by the development of abnormal new vessels in the retina, optic nerve head or anterior segment of the eye. Argon laser photocoagulation has been the gold standard for the treatment of PDR for many years, using regimens evaluated by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). Over the years, there have been modifications of the technique and introduction of new laser technologies. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of different types of laser, other than argon laser, and different laser protocols, other than those established by the ETDRS, for the treatment of PDR. We compared different wavelengths; power and pulse duration; pattern, number and location of burns versus standard argon laser undertaken as specified by the ETDRS. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the search was 8 June 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) using standard argon laser for treatment of PDR compared with any other laser modality. We excluded studies of lasers that are not in common use, such as the xenon arc, ruby or Krypton laser. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed Cochrane guidelines and graded the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We identified 11 studies from Europe (6), the USA (2), the Middle East (1) and Asia (2). Five studies compared different types of laser to argon: Nd:YAG (2 studies) or diode (3 studies). Other studies compared modifications to the standard argon laser PRP technique. The studies were poorly reported and we judged all to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The sample size varied from 20 to 270 eyes but the majority included 50 participants or fewer.Nd:YAG versus argon laser (2 studies): very low-certainty evidence on vision loss, vision gain, progression and regression of PDR, pain during laser treatment and adverse effects.Diode versus argon laser (3 studies): very-low certainty evidence on vision loss, vision gain, progression and regression of PDR and adverse effects; moderate-certainty evidence that diode laser was more painful (risk ratio (RR) troublesome pain during laser treatment (RR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.51; eyes = 202; studies = 3; I2 = 0%).0.5 second versus 0.1 second exposure (1 study): low-certainty evidence of lower chance of vision loss with 0.5 second compared with 0.1 second exposure but estimates were imprecise and compatible with no difference or an increased chance of vision loss (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.04, 44 eyes, 1 RCT); low-certainty evidence that people treated with 0.5 second exposure were more likely to gain vision (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 7.28, 44 eyes, 1 RCT) but again the estimates were imprecise . People given 0.5 second exposure were more likely to have regression of PDR compared with 0.1 second laser PRP again with imprecise estimate (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.48, 32 eyes, 1 RCT). There was very low-certainty evidence on progression of PDR and adverse effects.'Light intensity' PRP versus classic PRP (1 study): vision loss or gain was not reported but the mean difference in logMAR acuity at 1 year was -0.09 logMAR (95% CI -0.22 to 0.04, 65 eyes, 1 RCT); and low-certainty evidence that fewer patients had pain during light PRP compared with classic PRP with an imprecise estimate compatible with increased or decreased pain (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.93, 65 eyes, 1 RCT).'Mild scatter' (laser pattern limited to 400 to 600 laser burns in one sitting) PRP versus standard 'full' scatter PRP (1 study): very low-certainty evidence on vision and visual field loss. No information on adverse effects.'Central' (a more central PRP in addition to mid-peripheral PRP) versus 'peripheral' standard PRP (1 study): low-certainty evidence that people treated with central PRP were more likely to lose 15 or more letters of BCVA compared with peripheral laser PRP (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 13.46, 50 eyes, 1 RCT); and less likely to gain 15 or more letters (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.08) with imprecise estimates compatible with increased or decreased risk.'Centre sparing' PRP (argon laser distribution limited to 3 disc diameters from the upper temporal and lower margin of the fovea) versus standard 'full scatter' PRP (1 study): low-certainty evidence that people treated with 'centre sparing' PRP were less likely to lose 15 or more ETDRS letters of BCVA compared with 'full scatter' PRP (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50, 53 eyes). Low-certainty evidence of similar risk of regression of PDR between groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27, 53 eyes). Adverse events were not reported.'Extended targeted' PRP (to include the equator and any capillary non-perfusion areas between the vascular arcades) versus standard PRP (1 study): low-certainty evidence that people in the extended group had similar or slightly reduced chance of loss of 15 or more letters of BCVA compared with the standard PRP group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.28, 270 eyes). Low-certainty evidence that people in the extended group had a similar or slightly increased chance of regression of PDR compared with the standard PRP group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.31, 270 eyes). Very low-certainty information on adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Modern laser techniques and modalities have been developed to treat PDR. However there is limited evidence available with respect to the efficacy and safety of alternative laser systems or strategies compared with the standard argon laser as described in ETDRS.","Moutray, Tanya; Evans, Jennifer R; Lois, Noemi; Armstrong, David J; Peto, Tunde; Azuara-Blanco, Augusto",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,431,1

Not surprisingly, there are many misconceptions about modern food production, including the potential collateral environmental damage attributed to agriculture, particularly the application of pesticides. However, the implication of conventional agriculture in the broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes (SSOs) lacks context and relativity. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have had a profound impact on their environment. Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the ""first proto-farmers,"" humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies ""developed,"" and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of ""agriculture"" on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to ""pesticides"" in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.","Brain, Richard A; Anderson, Julie C",Environmental science and pollution research international,431,33

METHODS Information on H1N1 influenza patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay was gathered and analyzed from an influenza surveillance system, including demographic features, clinical symptoms and signs, therapeutic regimen, and duration of fever and virus shedding. RESULTS The clinical course of infected individuals appeared mild. Mainly young adults were affected. Most cases had low or mid-level fever, cough, headache, rhinorrhoea, and sore throat. Few patients had vomiting (1.3%) and diarrhea (3.9%). Oseltamivir treatment did not shorten the duration of fever. Furthermore, early oseltamivir treatment as well as early conventional supportive treatment without antiviral drugs contributed to a reduction in the duration of virus shedding. CONCLUSIONS In the first pandemic wave, novel H1N1 virus caused disease primarily in adults, causing mild febrile illness.

RESULTS We categorized principal insights into 5 topic areas: scale of the response, vaccination operations, exclusion policies, community engagement, and countering anti-vaccine efforts. These topics address resource-intensive aspects of these outbreak responses, including personnel demands; guidance needed to support response operations and reduce transmission, such as excluding exposed or at-risk individuals from public spaces; operational challenges and barriers to vaccination and other response activities; and effectively engaging and educating affected populations, particularly with respect to insular and vulnerable communities. CONCLUSIONS Measles outbreak responses are resource intensive, which can quickly overwhelm existing public health capacities. Early and effective coordination with trusted leaders and organizations in affected communities, including to provide vaccination capacity and facilitate community engagement, can promote efficient response operations. The firsthand experiences of public health and healthcare personnel who responded to measles outbreaks, including among insular communities, provide evidence-based operational lessons that can inform future preparedness and response operations for outbreaks of highly transmissible diseases.","Martin, Elena K; Shearer, Matthew P; Trotochaud, Marc; Nuzzo, Jennifer B",BMC public health,431,12

The metabolic consequences of the incorporation of a Roux limb are unknown. OBJECTIVES To evaluate differences in glucose and insulin dynamics between RYGB and OLGB in normoglycemic patients, by submitting them to a glucose challenge after stabilization of their weight. METHODS Nondiabetic patients who had undergone OLGB 4 years earlier were matched with nondiabetic patients who had undergone RYGB around the same time and with healthy controls. Participants underwent oral (OGTT) and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Endpoints of the study were: progression of plasma glucose and insulin, changes in their concentration [calculated by area under the curve (AUC)] at OGTT and IVGTT, incretin effect and incidence of hypoglycemia. RESULTS Each of the three groups comprised 14 participants. At OGTT, plasma glucose and insulin incremental values were comparable after OLGB and RYGB, and substantially higher than in controls. Overall glucose concentration, however, did not vary across the three groups. Thirty-minute and overall insulin plasma concentration, indicators of early and total insulin secretion, respectively, was significantly higher in both bypass groups than in controls, and was greatest in OLGB. Severe hypoglycemia occurred in one out of two patients in both bypass groups. At IVGTT, no differences were registered across the three groups and no participant experienced hypoglycemia. The incretin effect was higher after OLGB than after RYGB, but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The incorporation of a Roux limb in a loop gastric bypass appears to create a statistically nonsignificant tendency toward reducing insulin hypersecretion observed at OGTT after OLGB, and consequently toward tapering the incretin effect.","Himpens, Jacques M; Vilallonga, Ramon; Cadière, Guy-Bernard; Leman, Guido",Surgical endoscopy,431,1

Objective To examine the use of medications for OUD and potential indicators of quality of care in multiple states. Design, Setting, and Participants Exploratory serial cross-sectional study of 1 024 301 Medicaid enrollees in 11 states aged 12 through 64 years (not eligible for Medicare) with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10) codes for OUD from 2014 through 2018. Each state used generalized estimating equations to estimate associations between enrollee characteristics and outcome measure prevalence, subsequently pooled to generate global estimates using random effects meta-analyses. Exposures Calendar year, demographic characteristics, eligibility groups, and comorbidities. Main Outcomes and Measures Use of medications for OUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone); potential indicators of good quality (OUD medication continuity for 180 days, behavioral health counseling, urine drug tests); potential indicators of poor quality (prescribing of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines). Results In 2018, 41.7% of Medicaid enrollees with OUD were aged 21 through 34 years, 51.2% were female, 76.1% were non-Hispanic White, 50.7% were eligible through Medicaid expansion, and 50.6% had other substance use disorders. Prevalence of OUD increased in these 11 states from 3.3% (290 628 of 8 737 082) in 2014 to 5.0% (527 983 of 10 585 790) in 2018. The pooled prevalence of enrollees with OUD receiving medication treatment increased from 47.8% in 2014 (range across states, 35.3% to 74.5%) to 57.1% in 2018 (range, 45.7% to 71.7%). The overall prevalence of enrollees receiving 180 days of continuous medications for OUD did not significantly change from the 2014-2015 to 2017-2018 periods (-0.01 prevalence difference, 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.02) with state variability in trend (90% prediction interval, -0.08 to 0.06). Non-Hispanic Black enrollees had lower OUD medication use than White enrollees (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.81; P < .001; 90% prediction interval, 0.52 to 1.00). Pregnant women had higher use of OUD medications (PR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25; P < .001; 90% prediction interval, 1.01-1.38) and medication continuity (PR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.17, P < .001; 90% prediction interval, 1.06-1.22) than did other eligibility groups. Conclusions and Relevance Among US Medicaid enrollees in 11 states, the prevalence of medication use for treatment of opioid use disorder increased from 2014 through 2018.

The Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometric (REIMS) technique reports tissue histology in real-time by analysing aerosolised tissue during electrosurgical dissection. METHODS Aerosol produced during diathermy of tissues was sampled with the REIMS interface. Histological diagnosis and mass spectra featuring complex lipid species populated a reference database on which principal component, linear discriminant and leave-one-patient-out cross-validation analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 198 patients provided 335 tissue samples, yielding 3384 spectra. Cross-validated OC classification vs separate normal tissues was high (97·4% sensitivity, 100% specificity). BOT were readily distinguishable from OC (sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 89.7%). Validation with fresh tissue lead to excellent OC detection (100% accuracy). Histological agreement between iKnife and histopathologist was very good (kappa 0.84, P < 0.001, z = 3.3). Five predominantly phosphatidic acid (PA(36:2)) and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE(34:2)) lipid species were identified as being significantly more abundant in OC compared to normal tissue or BOT (P < 0.001, q < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The REIMS iKnife distinguishes gynaecological tissues by analysing mass-spectrometry-derived lipidomes from tissue diathermy aerosols. Rapid intra-operative gynaecological tissue diagnosis may improve surgical care when histology is unknown, leading to personalised operations tailored to the individual.","Phelps, David L; Balog, Júlia; Gildea, Louise F; Bodai, Zsolt; Savage, Adele; El-Bahrawy, Mona A; Speller, Abigail Vm; Rosini, Francesca; Kudo, Hiromi; McKenzie, James S; Brown, Robert; Takáts, Zoltán; Ghaem-Maghami, Sadaf",British journal of cancer,431,1

PURPOSE To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a pharmacy clinical decision support tool designed to increase naloxone coprescription among people at risk for opioid overdose in a large healthcare system. SUMMARY The Military Health System Opioid Registry and underlying presentation layer were used to develop a clinical decision support capability to improve naloxone coprescription at the pharmacy point of care. Pharmacy personnel use a patient identification card barcode scanner or manually enter a patient's identification number to quickly visualize information on a patient's risk for opioid overdose and medical history related to pain and, when appropriate, receive a recommendation to coprescribe naloxone. The tool was made available to military treatment facility pharmacy locations. An interactive dashboard was developed to support monitoring, utilization, and impact on naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose. CONCLUSION Initial implementation of the naloxone tool was slow from a lack of end-user awareness. Efforts to increase utilization were, in part, successful owing to a number of enterprise-wide educational initiatives. In early 2020, the naloxone tool was used in 15% of all opioid prescriptions dispensed at a military pharmacy. Data indicate that the frequency of naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose was significantly higher when the naloxone tool was used than when the tool was not used.","Rittel, Alexander; Highland, Krista; Maneval, Mark S; Bockhorst, Archie; Moreno, Agustin; Sim, Alan; Easter, Peter; Nichols, Chris; Costantino, Ryan C",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,431,1

Assessments to inspect the oral cavity have been designed for non-dental healthcare professionals, like nurses. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the content and the measurement properties of oral health assessments for use by non-dental healthcare professionals in assessing older peoples' oral health, in order to provide recommendations for practice, policy, and research. METHODS A systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE.com, and Cinahl (via Ebsco) has been performed. Search terms referring to 'oral health assessments', 'non-dental healthcare professionals' and 'older people (60+)' were used. Two reviewers individually performed title/abstract, and full-text screening for eligibility. The included studies have investigated at least one measurement property (validity/reliability) and were evaluated on their methodological quality using ""The Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments"" (COSMIN) checklist. The measurement properties were then scored using quality criteria (positive/negative/indeterminate). RESULTS Out of 879 hits, 18 studies were included in this review. Five studies showed good methodological quality on at least one measurement property and 14 studies showed poor methodological quality on some of their measurement properties. None of the studies assessed all measurement properties of the COSMIN. In total eight oral health assessments were found: the Revised Oral Assessment Guide (ROAG); the Minimum Data Set (MDS), with oral health component; the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT); The Holistic Reliable Oral Assessment Tool (THROAT); Dental Hygiene Registration (DHR); Mucosal Plaque Score (MPS); The Brief Oral Health Screening Examination (BOHSE) and the Oral Assessment Sheet (OAS). Most frequently assessed items were: lips, mucosa membrane, tongue, gums, teeth, denture, saliva, and oral hygiene. CONCLUSION Taken into account the scarce evidence of the proposed assessments, the OHAT and ROAG are most complete in their included oral health items and are of best methodological quality in combination with positive quality criteria on their measurement properties. Non-dental healthcare professionals, policymakers and researchers should be aware of the methodological limitations of the available oral health assessments and realize that the quality of the measurement properties remains uncertain.","Everaars, Babette; Weening-Verbree, Linet F; Jerković-Ćosić, Katarina; Schoonmade, Linda; Bleijenberg, Nienke; de Wit, Niek J; van der Heijden, Geert J M G",BMC geriatrics,431,24

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), a new component of the RAS, catabolizes the vasoconstrictor peptide ANG II to form the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 [ANG-(1-7)]. We examined whether adipocytes express ACE2 and its regulation by manipulation of the RAS and by high-fat (HF) feeding. ACE2 mRNA expression increased (threefold) during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was not regulated by manipulation of the RAS. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed low- (LF) or high-fat (HF) diets for 1 wk or 4 mo. At 1 wk of HF feeding, adipose expression of angiotensinogen (twofold) and ACE2 (threefold) increased, but systemic angiotensin peptide concentrations and blood pressure were not altered. At 4 mo of HF feeding, adipose mRNA expression of angiotensinogen (twofold) and ACE2 (threefold) continued to be elevated, and liver angiotensinogen expression increased (twofold). However, adipose tissue from HF mice did not exhibit elevated ACE2 protein or activity. Increased expression of ADAM17, a protease responsible for ACE2 shedding, coincided with reductions in ACE2 activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and an ADAM17 inhibitor decreased media ACE2 activity. Moreover, ADAM17 mRNA expression was increased in adipose tissue from 4-mo HF-fed mice, and plasma ACE2 activity increased. However, HF mice exhibited marked increases in plasma angiotensin peptide concentrations (LF: 2,141 +/- 253; HF: 6,829 +/- 1,075 pg/ml) and elevated blood pressure. These results demonstrate that adipocytes express ACE2 that is dysregulated in HF-fed mice with elevated blood pressure compared with LF controls.","Gupte, Manisha; Boustany-Kari, Carine M; Bharadwaj, Kalyani; Police, Sara; Thatcher, Sean; Gong, Ming C; English, Victoria L; Cassis, Lisa A","American journal of physiology.

A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.,18.715334,9.6657295,2015,"In backyard farms of Lao People's Democratic Republic, mixed-species rearing of poultry is a breeding-ground for cross-species transmission. Here, the epidemiology of viruses circulating among backyard poultry in Vientiane Province was assessed to guide future control strategies. Oral/tracheal and cloacal swabs, collected from 605 poultry (308 ducks, 297 chickens) between 2011 and 2015, were screened by PCR for Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Coronavirus (CoV) and Chicken Anemia Virus (CAV). Chicken sera were screened for anti-NDV antibodies by ELISA. Statistical and phylogenetic analyses revealed transmission patterns and relationships. Closely related strains co-circulated in chickens and ducks. While CoV RNA was detected in oral/tracheal swabs of 9.3% of the chickens and 2.4% of the ducks, rates were higher in fecal swabs of both species (27.3% and 48.2%). RNA of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and duck CoV was found in fecal swabs of chickens (19.7% and 7.1%) and of ducks (4.1% and 44.1%). Moreover, DNA of the generally chicken-specific CAV was detected in oral/tracheal swabs of chickens (18.1%) and sporadically of ducks (2.4%). Despite serological evidence of NDV circulation or vaccination (86.9%), NDV RNA was not detected. We found a high prevalence and indication for cross-species transmission of different CoV strains in backyard poultry. Interestingly, ducks served as biological or at least mechanical carrier of viral strains closely related not only to IBV, but also to CAV. Animal containment and poultry species separation could be first steps to avoid cross-species transmission and emergence of novel strains with broad host range and enhanced pathogenicity.","Pauly, Maude; Snoeck, Chantal J; Phoutana, Vannaphone; Keosengthong, Amphone; Sausy, Aurélie; Khenkha, Latdavone; Nouanthong, Phonethipsavanh; Samountry, Bounthome; Jutavijittum, Prapan; Vilivong, Keooudomphone; Hübschen, Judith M; Black, Antony P; Pommasichan, Sisavath; Muller, Claude P",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,431,16

For uncemented prosthesis, alternative antimicrobial approaches are necessary in order to prevent PJI; however, despite elution of drug from the surface of the device being shown one of the most promising approach, no effective antimicrobial eluting uncemented device is currently available on the market. Consequently, there is a clinical need for non-antibiotic antimicrobial uncemented prosthesis as these devices present numerous benefits, particularly for young patients, over cemented artificial joints. Moreover, non-antibiotic approaches are driven by the need to address the growing threat posed by antibiotic resistance. We developed a multilayers functional coating on titanium surfaces releasing chlorhexidine, a well-known antimicrobial agent used in mouthwash products and antiseptic creams, embedding the drug between alginate and poly-beta-amino-esters. Chlorhexidine release was sustained for almost 2 months and the material efficacy and safety was proven both in vitro and in vivo. The coatings did not negatively impact osteoblast and fibroblast cells growth and were capable of reducing bacterial load and accelerating wound healing in an excisional wound model. As PJI can develop weeks and months after the initial surgery, these materials could provide a viable solution to prevent infections after arthroplasty in uncemented prosthetic devices and, simultaneously, help the fight against antibiotic resistance.","Perni, Stefano; Alotaibi, Hadil Faris; Yergeshov, Abdulla A; Dang, Trinh; Abdullin, Timur I; Prokopovich, Polina",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,431,12

In the laboratory, each individual lobe was perfused with Ringer's solution at body temperature and protectively ventilated through a tube (frequency: 20 1/min, p insp = 20 mbar, PEEP +5 mbar). Non-anatomic resection was carried out in the periphery of the lung lobe. The two control groups (12 lobes per group; Group 1-stapler, Group 2-parenchyma suture) were compared to three groups in which different bipolar sealing instruments were used. They were Group 3-MARSEAL(®) 10 mm (KLS Martin, Tuttlingen); Group 4-MARSEAL(®) 5 mm; and Group 5-MARCLAMP(®) (KLS Martin, Tuttlingen). The SealSafe(®) G3 electric current was used in all cases. Ventilation was continued for 20 min following parenchymal resection. Parenchymal sealing was then judged visually in a water bath and given a score (0-3). Burst pressure (mbar) was measured by increasing the inspiration pressure stepwise. Group mean values were compared (nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.005). RESULTS Parenchymal seals were airtight under ventilation throughout the observation period in all groups. Mean burst pressures were as follows: Group 1: 47.1 ± 6.2 mbar; Group 2: 32.9 ± 3.9 mbar; Group 3: 38.8 ± 2.2 mbar; Group 4: 25.0 ± 6.4 mbar; and Group 5: 32.9 ± 5.8 mbar. Group 1, the stapler group, thus exhibited the highest burst pressures. Burst pressures for Group 3 were significantly greater than those for Group 2 (p < 0.006). Burst pressures for groups 2 and 5 were similar (p = 0.97). However, the burst pressures for Group 4 were significantly lower than those for Group 2 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION MARSEAL(®) 10 mm and MARCLAMP(®) achieved adequate burst pressures compared to the two control groups and thus might be suitable for clinical use.","Kirschbaum, A; Clemens, A; Steinfeldt, T; Pehl, A; Meyer, C; Bartsch, D K",Surgical endoscopy,431,15

METHODS The ABO phenotype was determined with the tube method. The coding regions of the ABO and FUT1 genes were analyzed by PCR-sequence based typing. The ABO alleles of the proband were determined by allele-specific primer sequencing. The full sequences of the ABO gene of the proband and her mother were determined through next generation sequencing. RESULTS The red blood cells of the proband did not agglutinate with anti-H, and the sequence of the FUT1 gene was homozygous for c.551_552delAG.The proband was thereby assigned as para-Bombay. Bi-directional sequencing also found that she was heterozygous for c.261G/del,467C>T,c.526C>G,c.657C>T,c.703G>A,c.796C>A,c.803G>C and c.930G>A of the coding regions of the ABO gene. Allele-specific primer sequencing also found her to carry a ABO*A1.02 allele and a recombinant allele from ABO*O.01.01 and ABO*B.01. The recombination site was located between nucleotide c.375-269 and c.526, and the allele was maternally derived. CONCLUSION An recombinant allele of the ABO gene has been identified, which has originated from recombination of ABO*O.01.01 with the ABO*B.01 allele.","Hong, Xiaozhen; He, Yanmin; Chen, Shu; Chen, Yan; Ying, Yanling; Xu, Xianguo; He, Ji; Zhu, Faming",Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,431,16

The study also examined routinely collected activity data for the chronic disease programs before COVID (January-February 2020) and for the first 3 months of the COVID-19 response (March-May 2020).ResultsChronic disease programs continued to provide similar numbers of appointments over the COVID-19 response period, but there was a marked increase in the proportion of appointments that were delivered virtually, either by telephone or video conference. Most patients were satisfied with their virtual care experiences and felt that their health care needs were met.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 response provided an opportunity to learn and further develop models of virtual care. Staff and patients were generally supportive of continuing to include virtual appointments in the future. Ongoing concerns were predominantly around the support available to patients and staff to ensure they are trained and equipped to manage the technology and new mode of communicating.What is known about the topic?Emerging evidence suggests that virtual models of health care delivery, such as telephone and video consultations and remote patient monitoring, can be safe and cost-effective alternatives to traditional face-to-face chronic disease management programs. Virtual care is associated with equal or improved clinical outcomes, as well as efficiency improvements, such as reduced failure to attend rates.What does this paper add?The increasing burden of chronic disease across Australia, as well as the need to minimise the risk of vulnerable patient groups attending in-hospital appointments where it is safe and appropriate to do so, means that expanding the delivery of virtual chronic disease management will become increasingly necessary. The results of this study provide an opportunity to learn from a rapid rollout of virtual care for these staff and patient groups and will help inform advances in this area.What are the implications for practitioners?Existing evidence, demographic pressures and the COVID-19 pandemic response all point to virtual care as a viable and safe alternative to traditional models of chronic disease management. The lessons presented here provide more detailed guidance on the support that staff and patients require to ensure virtual care is a seamless and safe alternative or adjunct to traditional chronic disease management programs.","Smithson, Rachael; Roche, Elisha; Wicker, Christina",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,431,5

Our purpose was to evaluate the rate of infection in pediatric patients with type I open fractures treated nonoperatively at our institution without admission from the emergency department (ED). METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who sustained a type I open fracture of the forearm or tibia from 2000 through 2013. Forty patients fit the inclusion criteria: <18 years old with type I open fracture treated nonoperatively with irrigation and debridement, followed by closed reduction and casting of the fracture under conscious sedation in the ED. All patients were discharged home. The primary outcome was presence of infection. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of a delayed union, time to union, complications, and residual angulation. RESULTS There were no reported or documented infections. There was one case of a retained foreign body (<1 cm) in a mid-diaphyseal forearm fracture, which was removed in clinic at 4 weeks after the patient developed a granuloma with no infectious sequela. There was one case of a delayed union; all patients eventually had complete bony union. There was minimal residual angulation in both upper and lower extremities at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Nonoperative treatment of type I open fractures in pediatric patients can be performed safely with little risk of infection. This preliminary evidence may serve as a foundation for future prospective studies.","Bazzi, Ahmed A; Brooks, Jaysson T; Jain, Amit; Ain, Michael C; Tis, John E; Sponseller, Paul D",Journal of children's orthopaedics,431,1

Cd9 and Cd81 are highly expressed in breast cancer cells; however, their expression in healthy mammary glands is unclear. In this study, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to analyze the expression levels of Cd9 and Cd81. Histological techniques were employed to identify Cd9- and Cd81-expressing cells in rat mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation. It was observed that Cd9 and Cd81 were expressed in the mammary glands, and their expression levels correlated with mammary gland development. To identify cells expressing Cd9 and Cd81 in the mammary glands, we performed double immunohistochemical staining for CD9 and CD81, prolactin receptor long form, estrogen receptor alpha, or Ki67. The results showed that CD9 and CD81 were co-expressed in proliferating mammary epithelial cells. Next, we attempted to isolate CD9-positive epithelial cells from the mammary gland using pluriBead cell-separation technology based on antibody-mediated binding of cells to beads of different sizes, followed by isolation using sieves with different mesh sizes. We successfully isolated CD9-positive epithelial cells with 96.8% purity. In addition, we observed that small-interfering RNAs against Cd9 and Cd81 inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of CD9-positive mammary epithelial cells. Our current findings may provide novel insights into the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation as well as in pathological processes associated with breast cancer.","Horiguchi, Kotaro; Yoshida, Saishu; Tsukada, Takehiro; Nakakura, Takashi; Fujiwara, Ken; Hasegawa, Rumi; Takigami, Shu; Ohsako, Shunji",The Journal of reproduction and development,431,7

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of HCQ and other immunosuppressive drugs on the incidence of COVID-19. Methods The data were collected from the South Korea National Health Insurance Sharing-COVID-19 database. All individuals who underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19 from January 2020 to May 2020 are included. The association between COVID-19 risk and HCQ use was examined in a propensity score-matched population. Factors associated with COVID-19 were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Total 8,070 patients with COVID-19 and 121,050 negative controls were included from the database. Among all participants, 381 were HCQ users. In a propensity score-matched population, the incidence of COVID-19 was 7.1% in HCQ users and 6.8% in non-users. The odds ratio (OR) for HCQ use was 1.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.58 to 1.89.

OBJECTIVE To review available data on cost-effectiveness of uterine tamponade devices when used for PPH treatment. SEARCH STRATEGY PubMed and EMBASE were searched (1980 to January 2020), as well as the National Health Services Economic Evaluation database from inception (1995) to March 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA Eligible studies were any type of economic evaluation, or effectiveness studies that provided cost or economic data. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. MAIN RESULTS Eleven studies using a range of devices (condom catheter, uterine suction devices, Bakri, Inpress, Ellavi) were identified. Cost of condom catheter devices or kits ranged from US$0.64 to US$6, while purpose-designed devices were up to US$400. Two studies that took a health system perspective assessed cost-effectiveness of using uterine balloon tamponade and suggested it was highly cost-effective due to low cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted, though both used effect estimates from case series.

Our study was designed to determine the effect of metformin on the cell autophagy and autophagic flux via the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods MHCC97H and HepG2 cell lines were cultured and treated without and with metformin at various concentrations (2, 5, 10 and 20 mM) for 48 h. Then, 10 mM was determined as the optimal concentration and the HCC cells were treated with metformin for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. MTT assay was used to assess the cell viability and Western blotting was used to determine the expression of proteins (LC3-II, p62, phospho-AMPKα, phospho-mTOR, mTOR, phospho-p70 S6 Kinase, p70 S6 Kinase, PARP1, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3). Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, EGFP-LC3 and mCherry-GFP-LC3B plasmid transfection were used for further study. Results Metformin inhibited significantly the viability of MHCC97H and HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. For the apoptotic properties, activation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were not observed after treatment with metformin. MHCC97H cells were transfected with a EGFP-LC3 plasmid and treatment with metformin could lead to the increased level of LC3-II and decreased level of p62. In metformin-induced autophagy, AMPK expression was activated, and the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and p70 S6 Kinase were inhibited. Metformin treatment and mCherry-GFP-LC3B plasmid transfection showed that metformin could induce the autophagic flux. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) partly abolished this effect. Conclusion Metformin could induce the autophagy, autophagic flux, and activate the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway in human HCC cells.","Gao, Chun; Fang, Long; Zhang, Hui; Zhang, Wei-Shuo; Li, Xiao-Ou; Du, Shi-Yu",Cancer management and research,431,27

We have developed vagus nerve-preserving laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (VLSD). This study aimed to evaluate whether VLSD is effective and safe, and to determine whether a reduction in the incidence of postoperative complications improves postoperative quality of life compared with CLSD. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in 72 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive bleeding and secondary hypersplenism who underwent CLSD (n = 40) or VLSD (n = 32) between April 2015 and December 2016. Their demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared. RESULTS No patients required conversion to laparotomy in CLSD and VLSD. There was no difference in estimated intraoperative blood loss, volume of intraoperative blood transfused, time to first flatus, time to off-bed activity, and postoperative hospital stay between the two groups. VLSD was associated with a shorter operation time (P = 0.020) and less postoperative complications (P < 0.0001), including less diarrhea (P < 0.0001), epigastric fullness (P < 0.0001), and delayed gastric emptying (P < 0.0001), compared with CLSD. With VLSD, there was a significant increase in body weight and plasma albumin levels at 6 months postoperatively compared with preoperative values (all P < 0.05). The curative effect of improving esophageal/gastric variceal bleeding was similar in the groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Whole-blood samples were collected from 36 patients at three time points: before ablation, after ablation (within 48 hours), and at follow-up (1-5 weeks after ablation). Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using cytokine level as the dependent variable and sample collection, time, age, sex, primary diagnosis, metastatic status, ablation site, and ablation type as the independent variables. RESULTS There was a significant increase in the plasma level of IL-6 after ablation compared with before ablation (9.6-fold ± 31-fold, P<.002). IL-10 also showed a significant increase after ablation (1.9-fold ± 2.8-fold, P<.02). Plasma levels of IL-1α, IL-2, and TNF-α were not significantly changed after ablation. Cryoablation resulted in the largest change in IL-6 level (>54-fold), whereas radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation showed 3.6-fold and 3.4-fold changes, respectively. Ablation of melanomas showed the largest change in IL-6 48 hours after ablation (92×), followed by ablation of kidney (26×), liver (8×), and lung (6×) cancers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases and reviewed articles from the Spanish Network of Cancer Registries (REDECAN) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated and statistical heterogeneity was measured using the I(2) index. A random-effects model was used to perform the meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of the data. RESULTS Thirty-two papers were included in the systematic review. The crude incidence rate for basal cell carcinoma was 113.05 (95% CI, 89.03-137.08) cases per 100 000 person-years for the studies based on the registration methodology normally used by registries (in which only 1 tumor with histological confirmation is counted per person). However, the same incidence rate calculated on the basis of clinical and histologic criteria and counting tumors rather than individual patients was 253.23 (95% CI, 273.01-269.45) cases per 100 000 person-years. The incidence was 38.16 (95% CI, 31.72-39.97) cases per 100 000 person-years for squamous cell carcinoma, 8.76 (95% CI, 7.50-10.02) cases per 100 000 person-years for melanoma, and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.15-0.40) cases per 100 000 person-years for Merkel cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS The registration methodology normally used by cancer registries probably underestimates the incidence rates of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma in Spain. The incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma are lower in Spain than in other European countries.","Tejera-Vaquerizo, A; Descalzo-Gallego, M A; Otero-Rivas, M M; Posada-García, C; Rodríguez-Pazos, L; Pastushenko, I; Marcos-Gragera, R; García-Doval, I",Actas dermo-sifiliograficas,431,29

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,18.673908,9.922126,2020-09-16,"BACKGROUND Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to participate in the regulation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Here, we endeavored to explore the character of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its function. METHODS A total of 68 nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and adjacent normal nasopharyngeal tissues were collected. Expressions of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 in these tissues were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between the expression level of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 and clinical pathological characteristics was analyzed. Inhibition of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 was done using small interference RNA. RESULTS lncRNA ILF3-AS1 expression was significantly up-regulated in the 68 nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue samples compared to their adjacent normal tissue samples. Increased lncRNA ILF3-AS1 level was related to the advanced tumor node metastasis stage and the metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Also, increased lncRNA ILF3-AS1 indicated poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Inhibition of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 reduced proliferation, invasion and migration of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. MicroRNA-320a (miR-320a) was determined as a direct target for lncRNA ILF3-AS1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Furthermore, lncRNA ILF3-AS1 could sponge miR-320a to promote BMI1 expression. The expression of BMI1 was significantly inhibited by the down-regulation of lncRNA ILF3-AS1. CONCLUSIONS For the first time, we demonstrated that lncRNA ILF3-AS1 was markedly over-expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cells. Elevated lncRNA ILF3-AS1 expression was correlated with severe cancer stage and poor prognosis. lncRNA ILF3-AS1 could promote proliferation, invasion, and migration of cells, which might indicate a novel target site for the future diagnosis and therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Yang, Xuewen; Lin, Feng; Gao, Feng",The International journal of biological markers,431,1

Hepatic stellate cells are the main precursors of myofibroblasts. Cellular senescence is the terminal cell fate in which proliferating cells undergo irreversible cell cycle arrest. Senescent hepatic stellate cells were identified in liver fibrosis. Senescent hepatic stellate cells display decreased collagen production and proliferation. Therefore, induction of senescence could be a protective mechanism against progression of liver fibrosis and the concept of therapy-induced senescence has been proposed to treat liver fibrosis. In this review, characteristics of senescent hepatic stellate cells and the essential signaling pathways involved in senescence are reviewed. Furthermore, the potential impact of senescent hepatic stellate cells on other liver cell types are discussed. Senescent cells are cleared by the immune system. The persistence of senescent cells can remodel the microenvironment and interact with inflammatory cells to induce aging-related dysfunction. Therefore, senolytics, a class of compounds that selectively induce death of senescent cells, were introduced as treatment to remove senescent cells and consequently decrease the disadvantageous effects of persisting senescent cells. The effects of senescent hepatic stellate cells in liver fibrosis need further investigation.","Zhang, Mengfan; Serna-Salas, Sandra; Damba, Turtushikh; Borghesan, Michaela; Demaria, Marco; Moshage, Han",Mechanisms of ageing and development,431,16

Queensland has only had 1,067 cases as of June 30, 2020, of which 78% have been overseas acquired. Australia and Queensland acted early to address COVID-19 by putting in place a range of strategies including travel bans (international and domestic), isolation measures, testing regimes, advice to business, economic support, and research funding. Agriculture was designated an essential business and as such has continued operating throughout the pandemic. They have however had to develop and implement COVID plans to keep workers safe. To help agricultural business establish plans information was developed by Safe Work Australia, National Farmers Federation and the Queensland Department of Workplace Health and Safety. Workforce issues were identified early, particularly seasonal workers (those who travel from their usual place of residence to another place to work). The Queensland Government enacted a directive about how seasonal workers were to be managed and also developed a guide specifically for horticulture to help manage their COVID-19 response. We provide two case studies demonstrating how agriculture has responded to COVID-19. Agriculture has successfully, in Queensland, adapted quickly to the changing work conditions due to COVID-19. This is due to all levels of government coming together with industry to find solutions. Some changes have had wider benefits such as improved sanitation, better communication and a greater recognition of seasonal worker needs.

By doing this, viruses limit the production of antiviral proteins and increase production capacity for viral proteins. Coronaviruses from the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), establish host shutoff via their nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). The Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus genomes, however, do not encode nsp1, and it has been suggested that these viruses do not induce host shutoff. Here, we show that the Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) does induce host shutoff, and we find that its accessory protein 5b is indispensable for this function. Importantly, we found that 5b-null viruses, unlike wild-type viruses, induce production of high concentrations of type I interferon protein in vitro, indicating that host shutoff by IBV plays an important role in antagonizing the host's innate immune response. Altogether, we demonstrate that 5b is a functional equivalent of nsp1, thereby answering the longstanding question of whether lack of nsp1 in gammacoronaviruses is compensated for by another viral protein. As such, our study is a significant step forward in the understanding of coronavirus biology and closes a gap in the understanding of some IBV virulence strategies. IMPORTANCE Many viruses inhibit protein synthesis by their host cell to enhance virus replication and to antagonize antiviral defense mechanisms. This process is referred to as host shutoff. We studied gene expression and protein synthesis in chicken cells infected with the important poultry pathogen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We show that IBV inhibits synthesis of host proteins, including that of type I interferon, a key component of the antiviral response. The IBV-induced host shutoff, however, does not require degradation of host RNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that accessory protein 5b of IBV plays a crucial role in the onset of host shutoff. Our findings suggest that inhibition of host protein synthesis is a common feature of coronaviruses and primarily serves to inhibit the antiviral response of the host.","Kint, Joeri; Langereis, Martijn A; Maier, Helena J; Britton, Paul; van Kuppeveld, Frank J; Koumans, Joseph; Wiegertjes, Geert F; Forlenza, Maria",Journal of virology,431,16

Methods A total of 8 centers in China enrolled 84 patients with OAB. Following test stimulation 70 patients underwent implantation using BetterStim. All patients returned for follow-up at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. After that, the visits were conducted by telephone. Outcomes of voiding diaries, the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), questionnaires regarding OAB-related quality of life (OAB-qol), and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated at each visit. The clinical therapeutic success was defined as ≥50% improvement from baseline in any of the voiding diary variables or average voids/day return to normal voiding (<8 voids/day). The analysis is a modified Completers analysis. Results At the 36-month follow-up, the success rate was 79% for overall OAB symptoms, 69% for urge urinary incontinence (UUI) and 42% for urgency frequency (UF). The average number of voids/day decreased from 29.2±14.9 at baseline to 17.6±11.2 at 3 years, the average volume/void increased from 94.7±54.2 to 151.4±80.8 mL, the urgency reduced from 3.0±1.4 to 1.8±1.7 (all P<0.001). For patients with urge incontinence, mean leaking episodes/day decreased from 8.1±7.6 at baseline to 2.1±3.5 at three years (P<0.05). The devices were explanted in 8 (11.4%) patients. There were no remote programming-related AEs or device-related serious AEs that occurred.

In simple and choice reaction tasks, aerobic exercise appears to increase speed of movement execution while speed of processing is unaffected. In the flanker task, aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce response time on incongruent trials more than congruent trials, purportedly reflecting a selective influence on speed of processing related to cognitive control. However, it is unclear how changes in speed of processing and movement execution contribute to these exercise-induced changes in response time during the flanker task. This study examined how a single session of aerobic exercise influences speed of processing and movement execution during a flanker task using electromyography to partition response time into reaction time and movement time, respectively. Movement time decreased during aerobic exercise regardless of flanker congruence but returned to pre-exercise levels immediately after exercise. Reaction time during incongruent flanker trials decreased over time in both an aerobic exercise and non-exercise control condition indicating it was not specifically influenced by exercise. This disparate influence of aerobic exercise on movement time and reaction time indicates the importance of partitioning response time when examining the influence of aerobic exercise on speed of processing. The decrease in reaction time over time independent of aerobic exercise indicates that interpreting pre-to-post exercise changes in behavior requires caution.","Beyer, Kit B; Sage, Michael D; Staines, W Richard; Middleton, Laura E; McIlroy, William E",Neuroscience,431,22

The Solitaire AB stent (Covidien, Irvine, California), the only fully retrieved stent, assists in the coiling of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mid-term angiographic follow-up of wide-necked aneurysms treated with the Solitaire AB stent. METHODS SOLARE (SOLitaire Aneurysm Remodeling) is a consecutive, prospective study conducted in 7 European centers. A core laboratory evaluated the postoperative and mid-term (6 month ± 15 days) angiographic results by using the Raymond classification Scale. Recanalization was defined as worsening, and progressive thrombosis was defined as improvement in the Raymond scale score. RESULTS The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of the aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Angiographic mid-term follow-up was obtained in 55 of 65 aneurysms (85.9%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (60%); a neck remnant was seen in 16 aneurysms (29.1%) and an aneurysm remnant in 6 aneurysms (10.9%). Of 55 aneurysms, recanalization was observed in 8 aneurysms (14.5%), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 17 aneurysms (30.9%). No bleeding or rebleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms was found to be safe and effective with the Solitaire AB stent at 6-month follow-up. Angiographic results improve with time due to progressive thrombosis of the aneurysm.","Gory, Benjamin; Klisch, Joachim; Bonafé, Alain; Mounayer, Charbel; Beaujeux, Remy; Moret, Jacques; Lubicz, Boris; Riva, Roberto; Turjman, Francis",Neurosurgery,431,29

The Malaysian Ministry of Health had implemented a range of measures, such as the use of masks and social distancing, to reduce the risk of transmission. Traditionally, newborns are evaluated for neonatal jaundice using visual assessment, a capillary heel prick and serum bilirubin (SB) sampling in primary health-care clinics. This approach requires the physical presence of both parents and their newborns in the primary health-care clinics, causing crowding and increasing the risk of COVID-19 infections. To alleviate crowding, we implemented the transcutaneous bilirubin drive-through (DT) service, which is an established, non-invasive, painless and rapid method to determine the bilirubin levels. Throughout the screening, both parents and baby will be confined to their car. A total of 1842 babies were screened in our DT setting from April to July 2020. Of the total babies, 298 (16.1%) required venesection for SB measurement and 85 required admission for phototherapy. None with severe jaundice were missed since the implementation of this service. The average test duration per neonate was less than 5 min, while conventional venous bilirubin laboratory testing required an average of 1.5 h per neonate. The cost of the SB laboratory test and consumables was approximately USD 5 per test, with an estimated cost savings of USD 7720. DT screening may be introduced in health-care settings to reduce crowding and eliminate the need of painful blood sampling in newborns.","Chua, Bee-Sim; Song, Li-Herng; Chang, Chee-Tao; Lim, Xin-Jie; Nachiappan, Jeyaseelan",Journal of paediatrics and child health,431,1

DESIGN Clinical assessment in the surgeon's office in 2009 (≥12 years after LAGB). SETTING University obesity center in Brussels, Belgium. PATIENTS A total of 151 consecutive patients who had benefited from LAGB between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1997, were contacted for evaluation. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mortality rate, number of major and minor complications, number of corrective operations, number of patients who experienced weight loss, evolution of comorbidities, patient satisfaction, and quality of life were evaluated. RESULTS The median age of patients was 50 years (range, 28-73 years). The operative mortality rate was zero. Overall, the rate of follow-up was 54.3% (82 of 151 patients). The long-term mortality rate from unrelated causes was 3.7%. Twenty-two percent of patients experienced minor complications, and 39% experienced major complications (28% experienced band erosion). Seventeen percent of patients had their procedure switched to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Overall, the (intention-to-treat) mean (SD) excess weight loss was 42.8% (33.92%) (range, 24%-143%). Thirty-six patients (51.4%) still had their band, and their mean excess weight loss was 48% (range, 38%-58%). Overall, the satisfaction index was good for 60.3% of patients.

CONCLUSION Based on a follow-up of 54.3% of patients, LAGB appears to result in a mean excess weight loss of 42.8% after 12 years or longer. Of 78 patients, 47 (60.3%) were satisfied, and the quality-of-life index was neutral. However, because nearly 1 out of 3 patients experienced band erosion, and nearly 50% of the patients required removal of their bands (contributing to a reoperation rate of 60%), LAGB appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes.","Himpens, Jacques; Cadière, Guy-Bernard; Bazi, Michel; Vouche, Michael; Cadière, Benjamin; Dapri, Giovanni",Archives of surgery,431,24

BACKGROUND CVH has an increased risk of postoperative infection. CVH repair with synthetic or biologic meshes has reported chronic biomaterial infections and high hernia recurrence rates. METHODS Patients with a contaminated or clean-contaminated operative field and a hernia defect at least 9 cm had a biosynthetic mesh (open, sublay, retrorectus, or intraperitoneal) repair with fascial closure (n = 104). Endpoints included overall Kaplan-Meier estimates for hernia recurrence and postoperative wound infection rates at 24 months, and the EQ-5D and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12). Analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population, and health outcome measures evaluated using paired t tests. RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 58 years, body mass index of 28 kg/m, 77% had contaminated wounds, and 84% completed 24-months follow-up. Concomitant procedures included fistula takedown (n = 24) or removal of infected previously placed mesh (n = 29). Hernia recurrence rate was 17% (n = 16). At the time of CVH repair, intraperitoneal placement of the biosynthetic mesh significantly increased the risk of recurrences (P ≤ 0.04).

Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted. Therefore, rapid antibody tests have been suggested as an efficient screening tool during pregnancy. CASES We analysed the clinical performance during pregnancy of a rapid, lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. We performed a universal screening including 169 patients during their last trimester of pregnancy. We present a series of fourteen patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 ICA rapid test result. ICA results were always confirmed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays (CMIA) for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies as the gold standard. We observed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 50% in pregnant women, involving a significantly lower diagnostic performance than reported in non-pregnant patients. DISCUSSION Our data suggest that although ICA rapid tests may be a fast and profitable screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they may have a high false positive rate and low positive predictive value in pregnant women. Therefore, Immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies must be verified by other test in pregnant patients.","Fabre Estremera, Marta; Ruiz-Martinez, Sara; Monserrat, Maria Esther; Cortizo Garrido, Sandra; Beunza Fabra, Zara; PerÃ N, Maria; Benito, Rafael; Mateo, Purificacion; Paules, Cristina; OrÃ S, Daniel",Annals of clinical biochemistry,431,27

METHODS We conducted a qualitative study that used nominal group technique (NGT) and focus groups to apply the person-based approach for intervention development. NGT methods were used to determine prioritized pediatric transfer handoff elements to design the initial intervention prototype. Five focus group sessions were then held to solicit feedback on the intervention, perceptions on implementing the intervention, and outcomes for evaluating the intervention. Data were analyzed by using content analysis. Iterative improvements were made to the intervention prototype as data emerged. RESULTS Forty-two clinical providers in total participated in NGT and focus group sessions, including physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, and a respiratory therapist. The initial intervention prototype was a handoff mnemonic tool, ""SHARING"" (short introduction, how the patient appeared, action taken, responses and results, interpretation, next steps, gather documents). Perceived benefits of the intervention included clarifying handoff expectations, reducing handoff deficits, supporting less experienced clinical providers, and setting the stage for ongoing effective communication. Outcomes perceived to be meaningful were related to triage appropriateness, workflow and use, and communication and information sharing. The final version of the intervention consisted of a SHARING reference card and a SHARING electronic medical record note template. CONCLUSIONS Using qualitative methods to apply the person-based approach to intervention development, we developed a transfer handoff intervention. Future research is needed to examine impacts of this tool; outcomes can include those identified as meaningful by participants in our present study.","Rosenthal, Jennifer L; Sauers-Ford, Hadley S; Hamline, Michelle Y; Natale, JoAnne E; Marcin, James P; Li, Su-Ting T",Hospital pediatrics,431,16

We investigated suitable patients for single-port laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, focusing on the anatomy and distribution of the renal artery and vein. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in 52 consecutive patients who underwent single-port radical nephrectomy by the transperitoneal approach. In patients undergoing right nephrectomy, a 2-mm port was added for liver retraction. We retrospectively re-evaluated all of the recorded surgical videos and preoperative computed tomography images. The pneumoperitoneum time (PT) was used as an objective index of surgical difficulty. Results The PT was significantly shorter for right nephrectomy than left nephrectomy (94 vs. 123 min, P = 0.004). With left nephrectomy, dissection of the spleno-renal ligament to mobilize the spleen medially required additional time. Also, the left renal vein could only be divided after securing the adrenal, gonadal and lumbar veins. In patients whose renal artery was located cranial to the renal vein, PT tended to be longer than in the other patients (131 vs. 108 min, P = 0.070). In patients with a superior renal artery, the inferior renal vein invariably covered the artery and made it difficult to ligate the renal artery via the umbilical approach at the first procedure. Conclusions These findings indicate that patients undergoing right nephrectomy in whom the renal artery is not located cranial to the renal vein are suitable for single-port laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.","Matsumoto, Kazuhiro; Miyajima, Akira; Fukumoto, Keishiro; Komatsuda, Akari; Niwa, Naoya; Hattori, Seiya; Takeda, Toshikazu; Kikuchi, Eiji; Asanuma, Hiroshi; Oya, Mototsugu",Japanese journal of clinical oncology,431,5

Accordingly, abnormal expression or function of miR-146a results in the incidence and progression of immune and non-immune inflammatory diseases. Its deregulated expression pattern and inefficient function have been reported in a wide spectrum of these illnesses. Based on the existing evidence, this miRNA qualifies as an ideal biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and activity evaluation of immune and non-immune inflammatory disorders. Moreover, much attention has recently been paid to therapeutic potential of miR-146a and several researchers have assessed the effects of different drugs on expression and function of this miRNA at diverse experimental, animal, besides human levels, reporting motivating results in the treatment of the diseases. Here, in this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of miR-146a role in the pathogenesis and progression of several immune and non-immune inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Inflammatory bowel disease, Multiple sclerosis, Psoriasis, Graves' disease, Atherosclerosis, Hepatitis, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc., discuss about its eligibility for being a desirable biomarker for these disorders, and also highlight its therapeutic potential.

OBJECTIVE We examine the use of a nature and art-related activity retreat designed for researchers. The purpose was to evaluate if and how researchers perceived different workshop experiences set in nature as meaningful and important with regards to their self-care. METHODS A mixed group of six researchers from Sweden, Finland, and the United States met for a three-day retreat consisting of self-selected nature and art-related activities. From data constituted from participant reflections, a focus group interview, a three months follow-up questionnaire, and an analysis of the workshops undertaken, three major themes were identified: ""Sharing and connection"", ""Embodiment"" and ""Nature"". RESULTS Analysis of the workshop-style exercises did not show significant variance in reported meaningfulness and usefulness related to the activity itself. However, there was a strong correlation between perceived value and shared experience where the sharing of the natural space was felt to put humanity into perspective. CONCLUSION Organizing and systematizing health preventive retreats for researchers in academia may be an important part of the sustainabile academic community in which the researcher needs to be better taken care of in a more embodied way.

They possess anthropogenic compounds which are hazardous, result in poor soil quality, poor crop nutrition and pollutes the water table. Currently, food crops that lack in micro-nutrients (Zn, silicates and Se) can be enriched with micronutrients by use of fertilizers. Eco-friendly bio-fertilizers have been proved to provide a known population of microorganisms that create a mutual benefit to the plants & the rhizosphere soil. Nanomaterials are often used in plant fertilizer formulation, allowing for controlled release and targeted delivery of beneficial nanoscale components, as well as to boost plant production and reduce environmental pollutants. In the present study we identified a multipotent micronutrient solubilizing bacterium (MSB) - Pseudomonas gessardi and Pseudomonas azotoformans as a bio-fertiliser. Comparative study of the formulated MSB, with nanocomposite prepared with the soya chunks as natural carrier material and chemically synthesized cerium oxide was performed on the growth of fenugreek for its effectiveness. The SEM images of nanocomposite showed the non-uniform distribution of CeO2 in bio-inoculant with an average size of 25.24 nm. The current study deals with increase in the shoot and root length of the fenugreek plant with only 75 ppm of CeO2 in nanocomposite, thereby preventing bioaccumulation of Ce in soil.

It is often assumed that geospatial datasets are accurate and complete. Furthermore, GIS datasets regularly lack metadata on the temporal specificity. Data is usually provided 'as is', and therefore may be unsuitable for retrospective or longitudinal studies of health outcomes. In this paper we outline a practical approach to both fill gaps in geospatial datasets, and to test their temporal validity. This approach is applied to both district council and open-source datasets in the Taranaki region of Aotearoa New Zealand. METHODS We used the 'streetview' python script to download historic Google Street View (GSV) images taken between 2012 and 2016 across specific locations in the Taranaki region. Images were reviewed and relevant features were incorporated into GIS datasets. RESULTS A total of 5166 coordinates with environmental features missing from council datasets were identified. The temporal validity of 402 (49%) environmental features was able to be confirmed from council dataset considered to be 'complete'. A total of 664 (55%) food outlets were identified and temporally validated. CONCLUSIONS Our research indicates that geospatial datasets are not always complete or temporally valid. We have outlined an approach to test the sensitivity and specificity of GIS datasets using GSV images. A substantial number of features were identified, highlighting the limitations of many GIS datasets.","Whitehead, Jesse; Smith, Melody; Anderson, Yvonne; Zhang, Yijun; Wu, Stephanie; Maharaj, Shreya; Donnellan, Niamh",International journal of health geographics,431,17

The ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates several well-defined cellular mechanisms of ethanol stress response (ESR); however, the involved regulatory control remains to be characterized. Here, we report a new transcription factor of ethanol stress adaptation called Znf1. It plays a central role in ESR by activating genes for glycerol and fatty acid production (GUP1, GPP1/2, GPD1, GAT1, and OLE1) to preserve plasma membrane integrity. Importantly, Znf1 also activates genes implicated in cell wall biosynthesis (FKS1, SED1, and SMI1) and the unfolded protein response (HSP30/104, KAR1, and LHS1) to protect cells from proteotoxic stress. The znf1Δ strain displays increased sensitivity to ethanol, ER-stressor β-mercaptoethanol, and cell wall-perturbing agent calcofluor white. To compensate for defective cell wall, the strain lacking ZNF1 or its target SMI1 displays increased glycerol levels of 16.4% and 29.2%, respectively. Znf1 collectively regulates an intricate network of target genes essential for growth, protein refolding, and production of key metabolites. Overexpression of ZNF1 not only confers tolerance to high ethanol but also increases ethanol production by 4.6% (8.43 g/L) or 2.8% (75.78 g/L) when using 2% or 20% (w/v) glucose as a substrate, respectively, compared to the wild-type strain. Mutually, stress-responsive transcription factors Msn2/4, Hsf1, and Yap1 are associated with some promoters of Znf1's target genes to promote ethanol stress tolerance. In conclusion, this work has implicated the novel regulator Znf1 in coordinating expression of ESR genes and illuminates the unifying transcriptional reprogramming during alcoholic fermentation. IMPORTANCE The yeast S. cerevisiae is a major microbe widely used in food and non-food industries. However, accumulation of ethanol has a negative effect on its growth and limits ethanol production. Znf1 transcription factor has been implicated in utilization of different carbon sources, including glucose, the most abundant sugar on earth, and non-fermentable substrates, as a key regulator of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Here, role of Znf1 in ethanol stress response is defined. Znf1 actively reprograms expression of genes linked to UPR, heat shock response, glycerol and carbohydrate metabolism, and biosyntheses of cell membrane and cell wall components. A complex interplay among transcription factors of ESR indicates transcriptional fine-tuning as the main mechanism of stress adaptation, and Znf1 plays a major regulatory role in the coordination. Understanding the adaptive ethanol stress mechanism is crucial to engineering robust yeast strains for enhanced stress tolerance or increased ethanol production.","Samakkarn, Wiwan; Ratanakhanokchai, Khanok; Soontorngun, Nitnipa",Applied and environmental microbiology,431,1

This retrospective study aimed to assess the outcome of immunocompromised critically ill patients with candidemia. Secondary objectives were to describe clinical phenotypes of these patients, Candida ecology, and factors associated with mortality. RESULTS Overall, 121 patients were included in this study. Median delay from candidemia to first antifungal therapy was 3 days, in line with the observed delay of blood culture positivity. Candia albicans was the main Candida specie identified (54%), and susceptibility of Candida to fluconazole and echinocandins was of, respectively, 70% and 92%. Hospital mortality was of 60%. After adjustment for confounders, severity as assessed by the need for vasopressors (HR 1.8, CI95% 1.1-3.1), need for mechanical ventilation (HR 2.0, CI95% 1.1-3.8) and allogenic stem cell transplantation (HR 2.5, CI95% 1.1-6.0) were independently associated with poor outcome. Candida specie, susceptibility and treatment strategies were not associated with outcome. CONCLUSIONS Candidemia in immunocompromised critically ill patients is associated with a grim outcome. Despite the high prevalence of Candida non-albicans species, neither C. species nor its susceptibility was associated with outcome. Conversely, severity and preexisting allogeneic stem cell transplantation were independently associated with poor outcome. Despite antifungal prophylaxis and use of preemptive antifungal therapy in neutropenic patients, antifungal therapy was initiated three days after symptoms onset suggesting needs for specific strategies aiming to reduce this delay.","Ghrenassia, Etienne; Mokart, Djamel; Mayaux, Julien; Demoule, Alexandre; Rezine, Imène; Kerhuel, Lionel; Calvet, Laure; De Jong, Audrey; Azoulay, Elie; Darmon, Michael",Annals of intensive care,431,1

Patient-ventilator asynchrony was analyzed by comparing the ventilator pressure curve and the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) signal with (1) a manual analysis and (2) using a standardized fully automated method. RESULTS Fifty-two patients (median age 6 months) were included in the analysis. Eighteen patients had a very low ventilatory drive (i.e., peak Edi < 2 µV on average), which prevented the calculation of patient-ventilator asynchrony. Children spent 27% (interquartile 22-39%) of the time in conflict with the ventilator. Cycling-off errors and trigger delays contributed to most of this asynchronous time. The automatic algorithm provided a NeuroSync index of 45%, confirming the high prevalence of asynchrony. No association between the severity of asynchrony and ventilator-free days at day 28 or any other clinical secondary outcomes was observed, but the proportion of children with good synchrony was very low. CONCLUSION Patient-ventilator interaction is poor in children supported by conventional ventilation, with a high frequency of depressed ventilatory drive and a large proportion of time spent in asynchrony. The clinical benefit of strategies to improve patient-ventilator interactions should be evaluated in pediatric critical care.","Mortamet, Guillaume; Larouche, Alexandrine; Ducharme-Crevier, Laurence; Fléchelles, Olivier; Constantin, Gabrielle; Essouri, Sandrine; Pellerin-Leblanc, Amélie-Ann; Beck, Jennifer; Sinderby, Christer; Jouvet, Philippe; Emeriaud, Guillaume",Annals of intensive care,431,1

Caution: The Intersection of Diabetes and COVID-19.,18.673908,6.537283,2021-03-17,"PROBLEM The University of Houston College of Medicine (UH COM) began its first admissions cycle after receiving preliminary accreditation in February 2020. With the advent of remote learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the school moved its admissions process, including the multiple mini-interview (MMI), from an in-person to online format in mid-March 2020. APPROACH The UH COM selected Zoom as the video conferencing platform for its virtual admissions process, including the MMI. On each interview day (3-4 hours), 14-16 applicants joined administrators, faculty, and staff in a virtual meeting room. Applicants were divided into two groups: one viewed short presentations about the school, curriculum, and departments, while the other participated in 7 MMI stations (one-on-one interactions with interviewers) via virtual breakout rooms; the groups then switched. The MMI stations were the same as those used in person in early March. Applicants were able to ask questions at multiple points during the day. Technical support was provided for participants with connectivity issues or unfamiliar with Zoom. OUTCOMES Of the 180 applicants interviewed in March-April 2020, 134 (74%) participated in the virtual process and 46 (26%) in the on-site process. Twenty-five (83%) of the 30 members of the inaugural class of 2025 interviewed virtually. Advantages of the virtual format included ease of access for faculty and more flexibility and less expense for applicants. Challenges included the need for applicants to decide whether to accept an offer of admission from a new school without visiting and missed opportunities for faculty to have relatively unstructured interactions with applicants. NEXT STEPS This virtual admissions process was a feasible alternative for the inaugural class but is not sustainable. The UH COM plans to leverage lessons learned to refine the virtual format for use in future admissions cycles, even when in-person interviews are possible.","Carroll Turpin, Michelle A; Steele, Kenya; Matuk-Villazon, Omar; Rowland, Kevin; Dayton, Catherine; Horn, Kathryn",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,431,1

We aim to share our institutional experience with robotic ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease (CD) and compare it to a laparoscopic cohort. We identified patients who underwent ileocolic resection for CD with a purely robotic (R) or laparoscopic (L) approach between February 2015 and 2018. Chart review was performed and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data was collected. A total of 47 patients with a mean age of 35.2 years old were identified and 61% were female. Seventy percent [n = 33, (23 females, 69.6%)] of the cases were performed robotically and 30% of the cases [n = 14, (6 females, 42.8%)] were performed laparoscopically. The groups were well matched for age, gender, BMI as well as disease related factors (CD duration; clinical classification and location), perioperative immunosuppression, and surgical history. Time to bowel function was shorter by about 1 day in the robotic group (R: 1.9 ± 0.88 days vs. L: 2.7 ± 0.8 days, p = 0.003). Mean operative time was longer in the robotic group by 51 min and this difference was significant (p = 0.03), however 30.3% of patients underwent ureteral stent placement, which can account for added time in robotic cases. There were less conversions in the robotic group [R: 1(4.3%) vs. L: 1(7%)], but this was not significant. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. Complication (L: 21.4% vs. R: 15.1%, p = 0.605) and reoperation rates (L: 0% vs. R: 3.03%, p = 0.429) were similar. Robotic ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease is as safe and feasible as the laparoscopic approach. This was accomplished with no leaks, major morbidity or mortality and comparable length of stay, with 1 day shorter return of bowel function, and with a lower overall complication rate. The robotic approach offers advantages in Crohn's disease which should be studied further in prospective studies.","Aydinli, H Hande; Anderson, Marissa; Hambrecht, Amanda; Bernstein, Mitchell A; Grucela, Alexis L",Journal of robotic surgery,431,16

Here we compare the results of mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever (SR) and manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) using a large-bore aspiration catheter system as a first-line recanalization method in acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO). METHODS The records of 50 patients with acute BAO who underwent mechanical thrombectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were assigned to one of two groups based on the first-line recanalization method. The treatment and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS Sixteen (32%) patients were treated with MAT with a large-bore aspiration catheter and 34 (68%) with a SR as the first-line treatment method. The MAT group had a shorter procedure time (28 vs. 65 min; p = 0.001), higher rate of first-pass recanalization (68.8% vs. 38.2%, p = 0.044), and lower median number of passes (1 vs 2; p = 0.008) when compared with the SR group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of any hemorrhagic complication (6.3% vs. 8.8%; p = 0.754) between the groups. However, there were four cases of procedure-related subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the SR group and one death occurred due to massive hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Selection of MAT using a large-bore aspiration catheter for acute BAO may be a safe and effective first-line treatment method with higher first-pass recanalization rate and shorter procedure time than SR.","Choi, Jin Wook; Han, Miran; Park, Jung Hyun; Jung, Woo Sang",BMC neurology,431,1

We examined the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, followed by recombinant expression of the most frequent HLA-A alleles, i.e., HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, to study differences in mycobacterial peptide presentation and CD8(+) T-cell recognition. We screened a peptide library (9-mer peptides with an 8-amino-acid overlap) for binding, affinity, and off-rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-associated antigen TB10.4 and identified only three TB10.4 peptides with considerable binding to HLA-A*3001. In contrast, 22 peptides bound to HLA-A*3002. This reflects a marked difference in the binding preference between the two alleles, with A*3002 tolerating a more promiscuous peptide-binding pattern and A*3001 accommodating only a very selective peptide repertoire. Subsequent analysis of the affinity and off-rate of the binding peptides revealed a strong affinity (8 nM to 7 μM) and moderate off-rate (20 min to 3 h) for both alleles. Construction of HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 tetramers containing selected binding peptides from TB10.4, including a peptide which was shared among both alleles, QIMYNYPAM (TB10.4(3-11)), allowed us to enumerate epitope-specific T cells in HLA-A*3001- and HLA-A*3002-typed patients with active TB. HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes were recognized in individuals with active TB, irrespective of their homozygous HLA-A*3001 or HLA-A*3002 genetic background. The antigen-specific T cells exhibited the CD45RA(+) CCR7(+) precursor phenotype and the interleukin-7 receptor (CD127), which were different from the phenotype and receptor exhibited by the parental CD8(+) T-cell population.","Axelsson-Robertson, Rebecca; Ahmed, Raija K; Weichold, Frank F; Ehlers, Marthie M; Kock, Marleen M; Sizemore, Donata; Sadoff, Jerry; Maeurer, Markus",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,431,11

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize them using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS A total of 90 patients with intact cerebellar hemispheres and intracranial dural sinuses underwent thin-sliced, contrast-enhanced MRI. RESULTS The BVs were classified into six routes based on the draining pattern into the dural sinuses. The superior vermian vein emptying into the straight sinus was delineated in 100% of the patients. The inferior vermian vein emptying into the confluence of the sinuses was identified in 66.7% of the patients. The inferior hemispheric and cerebellar cortical veins emptying into the transverse sinus were identified in 54.4% and 26.7% of the patients, respectively. The inferior vermian and cerebellar cortical veins emptying into the straight sinus were identified in 77.8% and 12.2% of the patients, respectively. The cerebellar cortical vein emptying into the tentorial sinus was identified in 83.3% of the patients; it was delineated on 54 sides with an average number per right hemisphere of 1.9 and 63 sides with an average number per left hemisphere of 2. The pontine-trigeminal and anterior hemispheric veins emptying into the superior petrosal sinus were identified in 42.2% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS The BVs of the cerebellum can be classified into six distinct routes. Radiological classification may be useful for understanding the drainage pattern of the cerebellum.","Tsutsumi, Satoshi; Ono, Hideo; Ishii, Hisato",Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,431,17

Generally, patients infected with HPIVs are treated in outpatient clinics, yet also contribute to ARTI-associated hospitalization in children. Although HPIV infections are well studied in developed countries, these infections remain under-investigated and not considered in the routine laboratory diagnosis of childhood ARTI in many developing countries in Asia. We performed an extensive literature search on the prevalence, epidemiology, and burden of HPIV infections in children less than 5 years in Asia using PubMed and PubMed Central search engines. Based on the literature, the prevalence of HPIV infection in Asia ranges from 1% to 66%. According to many studies, HPIV-3 is the major virus circulating among children; however, several studies failed to detect HPIV-4 due to unavailability of diagnostic tools. In Asian countries, HPIV contributes a substantial disease burden in children.

We argue that flight-as-fever is unlikely to explain why bats harbor more viruses than other mammals on the basis of two lines of reasoning. First, flight temperatures reported in the literature overestimate true flight temperatures because of methodologic limitations. Second, body temperatures in bats are only high relative to humans, and not relative to many other mammals. We provide examples of mammals from diverse habitats to show that temperatures in excess of 40 C during activity are quite common in species with lower viral diversity than bats. We caution scientists against stating the flight-as-fever hypothesis as unquestioned truth, as has repeatedly occurred in the popular media in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Levesque, Danielle L; Boyles, Justin G; Downs, Cynthia J; Breit, Ana M",Journal of wildlife diseases,431,16

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, including primary RNA elements that are recognized by the viral replicase proteins, are not well understood. Here, we used aptamer pulldown assays with membrane fractionation and protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation in a cell-free viral translation/replication system to investigate how viral replicase proteins recognize the bipartite genomic RNAs of the Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV). RCNMV replicase proteins bound specifically to a Y-shaped RNA element (YRE) located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA2, which also interacted with the 480-kDa replicase complexes that contain viral and host proteins. The replicase-YRE interaction recruited RNA2 to the membrane fraction. Conversely, RNA1 fragments failed to interact with the replicase proteins supplied in trans. The results of protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation assays suggest that RNA1 interacts with the replicase proteins coupled with their translation. Thus, the initial template recognition mechanisms employed by the replicase differ between RCNMV bipartite genomic RNAs and RNA elements are primary determinants of the differential replication mechanism.","Iwakawa, Hiro-Oki; Mine, Akira; Hyodo, Kiwamu; An, Mengnan; Kaido, Masanori; Mise, Kazuyuki; Okuno, Tetsuro",Journal of virology,431,24

Past research suggests that recovery processes start after stressors abate and can take months or years to unfold. In contrast, we build on autonomy restoration theory to suggest that recovery of impaired autonomy starts immediately even as a stressor is ongoing. Using growth curve modeling, we examined the temporal trajectories of two manifestations of impaired autonomy-powerlessness and (lack of) authenticity-to test whether recovery began as the pandemic unfolded. We tested our predictions using a unique experience-sampling dataset collected over a 2-week period beginning on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a ""global pandemic"" by the World Health Organization and a ""national emergency"" by the U.S. Government (March 16-27, 2020). Results suggest that autonomy restoration was activated even as the pandemic worsened. Employees reported decreasing powerlessness and increasing authenticity during this period, despite their subjective stress-levels not improving. Further, the trajectories of recovery for both powerlessness and authenticity were steeper for employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism, a personality characteristic central to stress reactions. Importantly, these patterns do not emerge in a second experience-sampling study collected prior to the COVID-19 crisis (September 9-20, 2019), highlighting how the pandemic initially threatened employee autonomy, but also how employees began to recover their sense of autonomy almost immediately. The present research provides novel insights into employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests that psychological recovery can begin during a stressful experience.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare immune-mediated disorder, and ILD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) has been described to have a poor prognosis in SSc-ILD patients. This study undertook to compare serial changes in KL-6 in SSc-ILD patients with and without PPFE, to verify its prognostic value as a disease biomarker. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-five SSc-ILD patients (median IQR, 62 (56-58); 20% males) were retrospectively enrolled. 12 SSc-ILD patients (48%) had also a radiological diagnosis of PPFE. Serum KL-6 concentrations were measured by KL-6 reagent assay (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium). RESULTS Serum KL-6 measurements were increased in SSc-ILD patients with and without PPFE compared with healthy controls (P < .0001). Comparative analysis of the rate of variation of KL-6 over the 6 years of follow-up was performed by serial two-yearly KL-6 measurements: Δ1(t1-t0), Δ2(t2-t1) and Δ3(t3-t2). In SSc-ILD patients with PPFE pattern, Δ3 was significantly different than those without PPFE pattern (P = .0020). Serum KL-6 levels were significantly different (P = .0455) either at Δ2 and Δ3 in the PPFE group. In SSc-ILD patients with PPFE, at t3 serum KL-6 concentrations were inversely correlated with FEV1 (r = -.76; P = .037) and FVC percentages (r = -.79; P = .028). CONCLUSION These results suggest that serial measurements of KL-6 in the follow-up of these patients may help to monitor disease progression. In real life, in SSc-ILD patients PPFE should be always evaluated at CT and when present should suggest a tight follow-up to monitor its evolution.","d'Alessandro, Miriana; Bellisai, Francesca; Bergantini, Laura; Cameli, Paolo; D'Alessandro, Roberto; Mazzei, Maria Antonietta; Gentili, Francesco; Conticini, Edoardo; Selvi, Enrico; Frediani, Bruno; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco; Bargagli, Elena",European journal of clinical investigation,431,16

We aimed to determine the frequency, clinical aspects and morphology of ID in endovascular AIS treatment and to identify predictors of this complication. METHODS Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of ID carried out during endovascular treatment between January 2000 and March 2012 have been re-evaluated. The ID localization and morphology were analyzed and related to the interventional techniques. Baseline clinical and radiological findings, treatment modality and outcome were compared with patients without ID. RESULTS Out of 866 patients 18 (2%) suffered an ID (44% female, median age 64 years). Localization was extracranial in 15 (83%, 14 internal carotid artery and 1 vertebral artery) and intracranial in 3 (17%; 1 vertebrobasilar dissection and 2 in the anterior circulation). Of the IDs 5 (28%) resulted in a high-degree, 3 (17%) in a moderate, 5 (28%) in a mild and 5 (28%) in no stenosis and 8 IDs were stented in the acute phase. At 3 months 7 (42%) patients had a favorable outcome (modified Rankin score mRS ≤ 2) and 6 (33%) patients had died. Patients with ID had a different stroke etiology (p = 0.041), were more likely to be smokers (44% versus 19%, p = 0.015) and were more likely to be treated with mechanical thrombectomy (100% versus 60%, p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol prolonged release (PR) in the management of patients with MBD suffering from moderate-to-severe cancer pain. METHODS A 12-week prospective study was carried out in 25 opioid-naïve MBD patients. Patients initially received twice-daily doses of tapentadol PR 50 mg. Doses were then managed to maintain adequate relief or dose-limiting toxicity. The following parameters were recorded at weekly intervals for 4 weeks, and then at weeks 8 and 12: pain, opioid-related adverse effects, use of other analgesics, DN4 (Douleur Neuropathique 4) score. Quality of life (SF-36 [36-item short-form health survey]) was measured at baseline and at final evaluation. RESULTS Of 25 patients, 22 completed the study. Pain intensity significantly decreased from baseline to all the week intervals (P<0.01). Quality of life significantly improved with respect to all SF-36 subscale parameters (P<0.01), and so did both the physical and mental status (P<0.01). Tapentadol PR significantly reduced DN4 mean value (P<0.01) and the number of patients with neuropathic component (DN4 ≥4) (P<0.01). After 8 weeks of treatment, all patients were negative for the DN4 score. Tapentadol PR was well tolerated, and the use of other analgesics was reduced during the study period.

We develop and validate a measure of stroke severity at hospital discharge (Stroke Administrative Severity Index [SASI]) for use in billing data. METHODS We used the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) as the theoretical framework and identified 285 relevant International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnosis and procedure codes, grouping them into 23 indicator variables using cluster analysis. A 60% sample of stroke patients in Medicare data were used for modeling risk of 30-day postdischarge mortality or discharge to hospice, with validation performed on the remaining 40% and on data with NIHSS scores. RESULTS Model fit was good (p > 0.05) and concordance was strong (C-statistic = 0.76-0.83). The SASI predicted NIHSS at discharge (C = 0.83). CONCLUSION The SASI model and score provide important tools to control for stroke severity at time of hospital discharge. It can be used as a risk-adjustment variable in administrative data analyses to measure postdischarge outcomes.","Simpson, Annie N; Wilmskoetter, Janina; Hong, Ickpyo; Li, Chih-Ying; Jauch, Edward C; Bonilha, Heather S; Anderson, Kelly; Harvey, Jillian; Simpson, Kit N",Journal of comparative effectiveness research,431,1

Unlike the paradigmatic enveloped virus fusion proteins, the FAST proteins position the majority of their mass within and internal to the membrane in which they reside, resulting in extended C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (CTs). Using tail truncations, we demonstrate that the last 8 residues of the 36-residue CT of the avian reovirus p10 FAST protein and the last 20 residues of the 68-residue CT of the reptilian reovirus p14 FAST protein enhance, but are not required for, pore expansion and syncytium formation. Further truncations indicate that the membrane-distal 12 residues of the p10 and 47 residues of the p14 CTs are essential for pore formation and that a residual tail of 21 to 24 residues that includes a conserved, membrane-proximal polybasic region present in all FAST proteins is insufficient to maintain FAST protein fusion activity. Unexpectedly, a reextension of the tail-truncated, nonfusogenic p10 and p14 constructs with scrambled versions of the deleted sequences restored pore formation and syncytiogenesis, while reextensions with heterologous sequences partially restored pore formation but failed to rescue syncytiogenesis. The membrane-distal regions of the FAST protein CTs therefore exert multiple effects on the membrane fusion reaction, serving in both sequence-dependent and sequence-independent manners as positive effectors of pore formation, pore expansion, and syncytiogenesis.","Barry, Christopher; Duncan, Roy",Journal of virology,431,1

We have investigated the use of L. gasseri as a vaccine vector for oral immunization against mucosal pathogens. Recent research has shown that the immune response to different lactobacilli can vary widely depending on the species or subspecies of Lactobacillus being studied. While some lactobacilli seem to induce oral tolerance, others induce an adaptive immune response. This study characterized the systemic and mucosal immune response to wild-type and genetically modified L. gasseri. L. gasseri primarily activates TLR2/6, with additional activation through the TLR2 homodimer. To expand the Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation profile of L. gasseri and the immunogenicity of the vector, a plasmid containing fliC, the gene encoding bacterial flagellin, was introduced which resulted in the strong activation of TLR5. The treatment of human myeloid dendritic cells with recombinant lactobacilli expressing flagellin triggered phenotypic maturation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, bacterial treatment also resulted in a statistically significant increase in IL-10 production. In vivo studies established that treatment with L. gasseri led to a diversification of B-cell populations in the lamina propria of the murine colon. Furthermore, treatment with genetically modified L. gasseri led to a significant decrease in the percentage of FoxP3(+) colonic lymphocytes. Taken together, these data clarify the interaction of L. gasseri with the host immune system and support further investigation of the in vivo immunogenicity of L. gasseri expressing both flagellin and candidate vaccine antigens.","Stoeker, Laura; Nordone, Shila; Gunderson, Sara; Zhang, Lin; Kajikawa, Akinobu; LaVoy, Alora; Miller, Michael; Klaenhammer, Todd R; Dean, Gregg A",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,431,8

Since the introduction of gynecologic robotic surgery, there have been more data comparing robotic surgery to laparoscopy in the management of endometrial cancer. This study reviewed clinical outcomes in endometrial cancer in a program that moved from laparotomy to robotic surgery. METHODS A retrospective review was performed on 124 consecutive endometrial cancer patients. Preoperative data and postoperative outcomes of 34 patients undergoing robotic surgical staging were compared with 90 patients who underwent open endometrial cancer staging during the same period and in the year before the introduction of robotics. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the mean age, body mass index, rates of diabetes, hypertension, previous surgery, parity, medical conditions, size of specimens, histologic type, or stage of cancer between the robotic and the open surgery groups. The first 20 robotic-assisted cases had a mean (SD) operative time of 196 (60) minutes, and the next 14 cases had a mean time of 124 (64) minutes comparable to that for open surgery. The mean number of lymph nodes retrieved during robot-assisted staging was smaller than open laparotomy in the first 20 cases but not significantly different for the subsequent 14 cases. Robot-assisted surgery was associated with lower intraoperative blood loss (110 [24] vs 250 [83] mL, P < 0.05), a lower rate of postoperative complications (8.8% vs 26.8%, P = 0.032), a lower wound complication rate (0% vs 9.9%, P = 0.044), a decreased requirement for postoperative parenteral analgesia (5.9% vs 51.1, P < 0.001), and shorter length of hospitalization (2.0 [1.1] vs 6.0 [4.5] days, P < 0.001) compared to patients in the open laparotomy group. CONCLUSIONS Our series shows that outcomes traditionally associated with laparoscopic endometrial cancer staging are achievable by laparoscopy-naive gynecologic cancer surgeons moving from laparotomy to robot-assisted endometrial cancer staging after a relatively small number of cases.","Mok, Zhun Wei; Yong, Eu Leong; Low, Jeffrey Jen Hui; Ng, Joseph Soon Yau",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,431,1

The study aimed at determining the LUTS prevalence and the influencing factors in nurses and civil servants working at a hospital. Methods This cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted with 158 female nurses and 105 female civil servants. The data were obtained with a data collection form and the Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms-Short Form. Results This paper exposes that the prevalence of at least one LUTS was 94.2% in nurses and 97.1% in civil servants. The most common LUTS symptoms of nurses and civil servants were urgency (60.1% nurses, 81.9% civil servants) and urge incontinence (59.5% nurses, 81.9% civil servants). Nurses (60.8%) expressed significantly higher rates of having inadequate time going to the toilet due to their work conditions compared to the civil servants (41.9%) (p<0.05). BFLUTS-SF scores in terms of age, BMI, parity, having cesarean and vaginal delivery and urinary incontinence in their previous pregnancies were compared between two groups, statistically significant differences were found (p<0.05).

METHODS Twenty-two out of 27 consecutive patients with PSS received PMT using the Trellis-8 peripheral infusion system (Covidien) between 2010 and 2014. Subsequent surgery was performed in 18 of those patients, 9 patients were treated with thoracoscopic, 7 patients with subclavicular, and 2 patients with transaxillary first rib resection, 4 patients were treated with PMT and anticoagulation alone. Technical success, complications, and patency were registered. RESULTS PMT was successful in 21 (95 %) patients; 1 patient with unsatisfactory lysis received further catheter-directed thrombolysis, which, however, did not improve the result. The mean endovascular procedure time was 105 ± 33 min (range 70-200 min), and the required median amount of thrombolytic agent was 500,000 international unit (IU; range 250,000-1,000,000 IU). Adjunctive balloon venoplasty and aspiration were used in 18 (82 %) and 7 (32 %) cases, respectively. One patient had an intimal tear of the subclavian vein that was discovered and repaired during surgery. There were no other complications related to the endovascular procedure. At follow-up, 18 of 21 patients (86 %) with follow-up imaging available had patent subclavian vein, and all except 1 of the 22 patients were asymptomatic. The mean follow-up time was 25 ± 17 months. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, PMT is effective for early thrombus removal in PSS. Surgical decompression must be considered after PMT.","Kärkkäinen, Jussi M; Nuutinen, Henrik; Riekkinen, Teemu; Sihvo, Eero; Turtiainen, Johanna; Saari, Petri; Mäkinen, Kimmo; Manninen, Hannu",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,431,28

Depressive symptoms affect motivation to engage in healthy behaviors and self-management of symptoms. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of women with depressive symptoms who participated in a 12-week mindful physical activity intervention (Mindful Moms) throughout their pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN In this qualitative study, we explore the lived experience of women with depressive symptoms who participated in Mindful Moms, a self-management intervention involving nurse-led motivational sessions and group-based mindful physical activity (yoga). METHODS Semistructured interviews conducted at approximately 6 weeks postpartum provided rich qualitative data that was analyzed using a phenomenological approach. RESULTS Twenty-five women participated. Findings suggest that participants in Mindful Moms felt empowered to manage their depressive symptoms through the combination of four key factors: a newly recognized need for help, a felt sense of physical and emotional benefit from participation, the power of shared safe space with other pregnant women, support from study staff, and an overall sense of empowerment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Mindful Moms appears to be a feasible and acceptable approach to enhancing motivation to self-manage depressive symptoms in pregnant women. Nurses working with childbearing women should be aware of the potential benefits of self-management strategies, such as mindful physical activity and motivational interviewing, for women facing perinatal depressive symptoms.","Russell, Sasha; Aubry, Christine; Rider, Amy; Mazzeo, Suzanne E; Kinser, Patricia A",MCN.

Coiling is currently quantified by a volumetric porosity measure called packing density (pd). Blood flow through a coil mass depends on the permeability of the coil mass, and not just its pd. The permeability of coil masses has not yet been quantified. Here we measure coil permeability with a traditional falling-head permeameter modified to incorporate idealized aneurysms. METHODS Silicone replicas of idealized aneurysms were manufactured with three different aneurysm diameters (4, 5, and 8 mm). Four different coil types (Codman Trufill Orbit, Covidien Axium, Microvention Microplex 10, and Penumbra 400) were deployed into the aneurysms with a target pd of 35%. Coiled replicas were installed on a falling-head permeameter setup and the time taken for a column of fluid above the aneurysm to drop a certain height was recorded. Permeability of the samples was calculated based on a simple modification of the traditional permeameter equation to incorporate a spherical aneurysm. RESULTS The targeted 35% pd was achieved for all samples (35%±1%, P=0.91). Coil permeabilities were significantly different from each other (P<0.001) at constant pd. Microplex 10 coils had the lowest permeability of all coil types. Data suggest a trend of increasing permeability with thicker coil wire diameter (not statistically significant). CONCLUSIONS A simple in vitro setup was developed to measure the permeabilities of coil masses based on traditional permeametry. Coil permeability should be considered when evaluating the hemodynamic efficacy of coiling instead of just packing density. Coils made of thicker wires may be more permeable, and thus less effective, than coils made from thinner wires. Whether aneurysm recurrence is affected by coil wire diameter or permeability needs to be confirmed with clinical trials.","Sadasivan, Chander; Swartwout, Erica; Kappel, Ari D; Woo, Henry H; Fiorella, David J; Lieber, Barry B",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,431,1

Under conditions of intensified anthropogenic activity and climate change, it is critical to understand the driving mechanisms of GPP in alpine lakes. In this study, we investigated GPP and associated environmental factors of 23 lake systems in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) along an altitudinal range (from 2500 m to 4500 m). Results showed an increase in chlorophyll a (Chl a) content as altitude increased and a corresponding decrease as salinity increased. Furthermore, geographical patterns of GPP were higher at the mid-gradient and lower at the extreme gradient. Higher solar radiation and water temperatures, stronger evaporation and higher salinity levels, and lower pH and higher nutrient content were all driving mechanisms of GPP in low altitudinal lake systems within high latitudinal regions. Such conditions have collectively resulted in the current GPP pattern via the promotion or inhibition of phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis. Specifically, geographical features and climate change jointly drive algal growth and GPP of alpine lake systems via internal circulation processes; however, anthropogenic activities interfere with external circulation processes for most of lower-middle altitudinal lake systems, thus playing a certain role in regulating environmental factors and GPP alongside climate change.","Jia, Junjie; Wang, Yafeng; Lu, Yao; Sun, Kun; Lyu, Sidan; Gao, Yang",The Science of the total environment,431,1

For young drivers, crash risk peaks immediately after licensure and declines during the next two years, making the point of licensure an important safety intervention opportunity. Legislation in Ohio established a unique health-transportation partnership among the State of Ohio, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Diagnostic Driving, Inc., to identify underprepared driver license applicants through a virtual driving assessment system. The system, a computer-based virtual driving test, exposes drivers to common serious crash scenarios to identify critical skill deficits and is delivered in testing centers immediately before the on-road examination. A pilot study of license applicants who completed it showed that the virtual driving assessment system accurately predicted which drivers would fail the on-road examination and provided automated feedback that informed drivers on their skill deficits. At this time, the partnership's work is informing policy changes around integrating the virtual driving assessment system into licensing and driver training with the aim of reducing crashes in the first months of independent driving. The system can be developed to identify deficits in safety-critical skills that lead to crashes in new drivers and to address challenges that the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has introduced to driver testing and training.","Walshe, Elizabeth A; Romer, Daniel; Kandadai, Venkatesh; Winston, Flaura K",Health affairs,431,31

RESULTS Forty-five abnormal edges with significant P-values of FCs weight scores are discovered. There is abnormal thalamic-cortical FCs in SZs. Importantly, hippocampus L, hippocampus R, and parahippocampal gyrus L are endowed with significantly different node efficiency scores in SZs patients. The scores of hippocampus L is consistent with motor retardation, lack of judgment and insight, and poor impulse control.

Sixteen articles were available for the literature review: 10 case series, 2 comparative studies, 3 case reports, and 1 surgical technique demonstration. In recent years, however, improvements in traditional laparoscopic techniques and availability of more advanced instruments has made single-incision laparoscopy more feasible and safer for the patient. There is increasing interest in LESS surgery both as an alternative to traditional laparoscopy and as an adjunct to robotic surgery when performing complicated procedures through a single incision.

People with higher perceptions of COVID-19 severity exhibited higher levels of worry in contrast to those who perceived a greater control over the possibility of infection. Multiple regression analysis indicated that coping styles, emotion regulation strategies and personality traits significantly contributed to explain the variance in worry scores. Findings supported that cognitive reappraisal, emotion-focused coping and extraversion were protective factors for worry, while expressive suppression, dysfunctional and problem-focused coping, and neuroticism were related to high worry.

The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with an overview of the spectrum of activity of polyether antibiotics, their mechanism of action, toxicity and potential as drug candidates to combat drug-resistant infectious diseases. CONCLUSION Polyether ionophores show a high degree of promise for the potential control of drug-resistant bacterial and parasitic infections. Despite the long history of use of this class of drugs, very limited medicinal chemistry and drug optimization studies have been reported, thus leaving the door open to these opportunities in the future. Scifinder and PubMed were the main search engines used to locate articles relevant to the topic presented in the present review. Keywords used in our search were specific names of each of the 88 compounds presented in the review as well as more general terms such as polyethers, ionophores, carboxylic polyethers and polyether antibiotics.","Kevin Ii, Dion A; Meujo, Damaris Af; Hamann, Mark T",Expert opinion on drug discovery,431,33

The flavanone naringenin is presented in citrus fruits and has been studied to combat recurrent diseases that still lack effective treatment. Research groups have been investing efforts to the development of new, safe and active candidates to combat these agents or conditions and despite good results recently reported against the Zika virus (ZIKV) and tumor cells, the use of citrus naringenin is limited due to its low bioavailability. Structural exchanges through functionalization, for example, attaching lipophilic groups instead of hydroxyl groups, can further enhance biological properties. Here, the synthesis and characterization of regioselective naringenin mono-7-O-ethers and both mono and di-fatty acid esters, structurally lipophilic ones were demonstrated. Finally, in vitro studies of anti-ZIKV action and antiproliferative activities against melanoma (B16-F10) and breast carcinoma (4T1) cells showed the ether derivatives were actives, with IC50 ranging from 6.76, 18.5 and 22.6 μM to 28.53, 45.1 and 32.3 μM referring to ZIKV, B16-F10 and 4T1 cell lines, respectively. The lipophilic ethers present the ability to inhibit selectively ZIKV-replication in human cells and inhibitions. This class of modifications in flavonoid molecules could be further explore in the future development of specific anti-ZIKV compounds.","Albuquerque de Oliveira Mendes, Larissa; Ponciano, Carolina Sousa; Depieri Cataneo, Allan Henrique; Wowk, Pryscilla Fanini; Bordignon, Juliano; Silva, Heveline; Vieira de Almeida, Mauro; Ávila, Eloah Pereira",Chemico-biological interactions,431,23

Mechanical thrombectomy offers a treatment alternative for these patients; however, only few data are available on its safety and efficacy. AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESIS The aim of this study was to compare safety and efficacy of stent retrievers as device class with best medical care alone in acute stroke patients with large intracranial vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation who are not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator up to eight-hours of symptom onset. DESIGN 'Thrombectomy in patients ineligible for iv tPA' is a prospective, open-label, blinded end-point, binational (Germany and Austria), two-arm, randomized, controlled, post-market study. STUDY OUTCOME(S) Primary end-point is the modified Rankin Score shift analysis 90 days (±14) after stroke. Secondary end-points are excellent neurological outcomes (modified Rankin Score ≤ 1), good neurological outcomes (modified Rankin Score ≤ 2 or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement ≥ 10), difference between predicted infarct volume and actual core infarct volume (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) at 30 (±6) h post-ictus, successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b or 3), functional health status 90 (±14) days after stroke (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions) as well as common safety end-points (adverse event, serious adverse event, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage at 30 (±6) h, death, or dependency). DISCUSSION Whether mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke who are not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator improves clinical outcomes is unclear. 'Thrombectomy in patients ineligible for iv tPA' may change clinical practice by providing evidence of an effective and safe treatment for such patients.","Bendszus, Martin; Thomalla, Götz; Knauth, Michael; Hacke, Werner; Bonekamp, Susanne; Fiehler, Jens",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,431,1

In recent years, the emerging fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown good effects in UC treatment and is therefore accepted by increasing numbers of patients. Our hospital has carried out FMT since 2017, and has achieved good results in UC treatment. We have found in our clinical work that the efficacy of re-FMT after recurrence decreased. This is difference from reported literatures. In order to attract clinical attention, here we selected typical cases for analysis. METHODS Among all UC patients who received FMT in our hospital, 12 patients with moderate to severe UC were selected. They all received multiple FMT and were followed up for 52 weeks. Besides, none of them had other underlying diseases. Colonoscopy images of patients were presentated, SCCAI and UCDAI were used assess the effect of FMT. RESULTS On the whole, FMT has a significant effect on moderate to severe UC. Of the 12 patients, 11 (91.7%) achieved a clinical response, 9 (75.0%) achieved clinical remission, and only one patient did not respond to FMT treatment. However, 6 patients relapsed within 52 weeks after remission, with a recurrence rate of 54.5%. Four of the six relapsed patients received FMT again, but the efficacy of FMT after relapse was significantly lower than that of the initial FMT. Fortunately, compared to before the initial FMT treatment, the severity of the disease after relapse was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION FMT has a good effect on the relief of moderate to severe UC. However, the effect of FMT treatment after relapse is reduced. For patients who relapse after remission, the efficacy of FMT reapplication requires more experiments to verify.","Dang, Xiao-Fei; Qing-Xi Wang,; Yin, Zhao; Sun, Lin; Yang, Wei-Hua",BMC gastroenterology,431,19

The Covid-19 pandemic put a lot of pressure on festivals, forcing an entire industry to adapt and recreate itself. In the restricted sanitary context, the pandemic festivals redefine the sense of events, of community and of social interactions. The empirical data, comprising in-depth interviews with the organisers of the first festival in Romania after lockdown, have revealed the prioritisation of social benefits and the growing connection between festival and community. This study therefore suggests that festivals could be involved more deeply in the community by assuming social charitable causes. Festivals create their own communities of fans but also shape the local communities where they take place. © 2021, Editura Lumen.

Many so far healthy undertakings have had to face the looming lack of liquidity. In order to counter the damage inflicted on undertakings and to perverse the continuity of economic activity during and after the coronavirus pandemic, public authorities were forced to step in and launch various types of support measures for entrepreneurs. This has raised particular issues from the State aid regime perspective. The article seeks to answer the question what is the EU response to the coronavirus pandemic in terms of the revised state aid policy. To this end, it is discussed what types of public instruments for entrepreneurs constitute state aid and thus fall within the EU control;what concrete support measures for business are utilized by member states in these troubled times and what are the guiding principles in deciding on their approval by the European Commission. Considerations are based on literature review, the analysis of relevant legal provisions and guidelines as well as selected state aid cases related to coronavirus. © 2021 IBIMA Business Review.

Little is known about protective antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in tears after infection or vaccination. We analysed SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA responses in human tears after either COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Methods We recruited 16 subjects with COVID-19 infection an average of 7 months previously and 15 subjects before and 2 weeks after Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNtech) vaccination. Plasma, saliva and basal tears were collected. Pre-pandemic plasma, saliva and basal tears from 11 individuals were included as healthy controls. Antibody responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 antigens were measured via multiplex. Results IgG antibodies to Spike and Nucleoprotein were detected in tears, saliva and plasma from subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to uninfected controls. While RBD-specific antibodies were detected in plasma, minimal RBD-specific antibodies were detected in tears and saliva. In contrast, high levels of IgG antibodies to Spike and RBD, but not Nucleoprotein, were induced in tears, saliva and plasma of subjects receiving 2 doses of the Comirnaty vaccine. Increased levels of IgA1 and IgA2 antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in plasma following infection or vaccination, but were unchanged in tears and saliva. Conclusion Both infection and vaccination induce SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in tears. RBD-specific IgG antibodies in tears were induced by vaccination but were not present 7 months post-infection. This suggests neutralising antibodies may be low in the tears late following infection.","John Selva, K.; Davis, S. K.; Haycroft, E. R.; Lee, W. S.; Lopez, E.; Reynaldi, A.; Davenport, M.

A systematic review.,18.695112,6.229276,2021-09-06,"Introduction: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, large geographic differences in mortality rates have emerged, with higher rates in predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods. In this analysis we examined community-level differences across the city of Chicago to better understand how geographic differences are associated with COVID19 mortality. Hypothesis: We hypothesized there would be an association between higher community-level social vulnerability and COVID19 mortality rates. Methods: We examined publicly available data from the Cook County Medical Examiner data (Illinois) of all known COVID-19 deaths as of August 21, 2020. Decedent addresses (N = 2397) were restricted to the city of Chicago, geocoded, and classified according to the 77 recognized community areas in the city. Poisson regression models were used to determine significant community-level predictors of COVID19 mortality based on community-level demographic, social, health, and healthcare characteristics collected from the Chicago Health Atlas. Results: There was at least one COVID19-related death in each Chicago community area, with a crude mortality rate ranging from 0.571-24.5 deaths per 10,000 persons. In the fully adjusted model with 14 community-level predictors, higher community-level population density, percentage of males, living in crowded housing, and limited food access were associated with higher rates of COVID19 mortality. Higher community-level proportion of the population aged 65+ years and havinga primary care provider were associated with lower COVID19 mortality. Differences by Black and Latinx race/ethnicity community-level demographics were not significant in the final model. Conclusions: Community-level factors of greater social vulnerability (crowded living conditions,limited food access) are strong predictors of community-level COVID19 mortality. These factors maylimit effective social distancing and increase the necessity to enter public areas, raising community-level COVID19 mortality.","Sunderraj, A.; Yang, X.; Krefman, A.; Kershaw, K.

Arguably, spending is the primary policy tool of governments in providing effective health. We argue that the effectiveness of spending in reducing COVID deaths is conditional on the existence of healthcare equity and lower political corruption, because the health sector is particularly susceptible to political spending. Our results, obtained using ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation, suggest that higher spending targeted at reducing inequitable access to health has reduced COVID deaths. Consistent with the findings of others, our results indirectly suggest that health spending is necessary, but not sufficient unless accompanied by building resilience against the spread of deadly disease. Equitable health systems ease the effects of COVID presumably because they allow states to reach and treat people. Spending aimed at increasing health system capacity by increasing access thus seems a sound strategy for fighting the spread of disease, ultimately benefiting us all.","Cooray, A.; Vadlamannati, K.

It has been established that global trends in informatization, intellectualization, innovation and digitalization are quite interrelated and interdependent. The social economy serves to meet social needs, as well as help realize the individual potential of each person. The research of global trends in the social economy makes it possible to analyse in a holistic way the trajectory of the social economy models' development, as well as to use in practice the potential of global trends to enhance the social component of the economic development of countries in the global dimension. The intensification of integration processes, regional and interregional transformations lead to changes in the national economy structure and shifts in socialization processes at the macro- and meso-level followed by different practical results and impact on the social economy development of the countries all over the world. A scientific and technological progress, Industries 4.0 and 5.0 development, the creation of smart enterprises and cities, digital transformations affect the socialization of the economy in a global environment.

The available drugs are used only for symptomatic relief. Among all the targets, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has been proved as an optimistic drug target against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to manage its replication process. There are number of molecules which have been approved by the FDA as RdRp inhibitors such as ribavirin, remdesivir, sofosbuvir, etc. The reported inhibitors for RdRp enzyme is being used by the various researchers for repurposing of drugs against SARS-Cov-2 RdRp enzyme by implementing different computational methodologies. Molecular modeling and cheminformatics approaches have been used for the design and identification of novel molecules having medicinal applications in various areas. The preliminary studies in computational drug discovery (CDD) and in silico approaches are important parts of the modern drug discovery practices, and they are frequently applied in the identification of new drugs or for the prediction of biological activity of chemical series. Now, in the ongoing corona pandemic, in silico modeling is being proved very helpful for easy identification of novel inhibitors. The current chapter presents recent reports on the application of computational modeling approaches for the design and identification of ligands against RdRp associated with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we will illustrate recently published computational studies for the identification or development of novel RdRp inhibitors applying different computational approaches, encompassing homology modeling, molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations. The chapter will also provide the reader an overall idea about a successful computational drug discovery research in this particular area of applications.","Kumar, V.; Roy, K.",Methods Pharmacol.

Methods: Using two widely published models (Harvard and PRIME) to estimate HPV vaccination impact, we simulated a vaccination scenario of 90% annual coverage among 9-year-old girls from 2021-2030 in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. We estimated the potential health impact in terms of cervical cancer cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted among vaccinated cohorts from the time of vaccination until 2100. We also conducted a comparative modelling analysis to understand the differences in vaccine impact estimates generated by the two models. Results: Prior to harmonising model assumptions, the range between the PRIME model and the Harvard model for the potential health impact of HPV vaccination in terms of the number of cervical cancer cases averted among girls vaccinated 2021-2030 between the year of vaccination and 2100 was: 262,000 to 270,000 in Ethiopia; 1,640,000 to 1,970,000 in India; 330,000 to 336,000 in Nigeria; and 111,000 to 133,000 in Pakistan. When harmonising model assumptions, alignment on HPV type distribution significantly narrowed the differences in vaccine impact estimates. Conclusions: The main difference in estimates for cases, deaths, and DALYs averted by vaccination between the models are due to variation in interpretation around data on cervical cancer attribution to HPV-16/18; differences in estimates for DALYs averted are additionally due to differences in age-specific remaining life expectancy over time between the two models. As countries make progress towards the World Health Organization targets for cervical cancer elimination, continued explorations of underlying differences in model inputs, assumptions, and results when examining cervical cancer prevention policy will be critical.","Portnoy, A.; Abbas, K.; Sweet, S.; Kim, J.; Jit, M.",,431,1
178989,178989,178989,A Novel Severity Scoring Derived from Chest Radiographic Findings in COVID 19 Patients Admitted to a COVID Care University Hospital in India,18.270021,6.3049836,2021,"Motor inhibition is a key control mechanism that allows humans to rapidly adapt their actions in response to environmental events. One of the hallmark signatures of rapidly exerted, reactive motor inhibition is the non-selective suppression of cortico-spinal excitability (CSE): unexpected sensory stimuli lead to a suppression of CSE across the entire motor system, even in muscles that are inactive. Theories suggest that this reflects a fast, automatic, and broad engagement of inhibitory control, which facilitates behavioral adaptations to unexpected changes in the sensory environment. However, it is an open question whether such non-selective CSE suppression is truly due to the unexpected nature of the sensory event, or whether it is sufficient for an event to be merely infrequent (but not unexpected). Here, we report data from two experiments in which human subjects experienced both unexpected and expected infrequent events during a simple reaction time task while CSE was measured from a task-unrelated muscle. We found that expected infrequent events can indeed produce non-selective CSE suppression – but only when they occur during movement initiation. In contrast, unexpected infrequent events produce non-selective CSE suppression even in the absence of movement initiation. Moreover, CSE suppression due to unexpected events occurs at shorter latencies compared to expected infrequent events. These findings demonstrate that unexpectedness and stimulus infrequency have qualitatively different suppressive effects on the motor system. They also have key implications for studies that seek to disentangle neural and psychological processes related to motor inhibition and stimulus detection.","Iacullo, Carly; Diesburg, Darcy A.; Wessel, Jan R.",bioRxiv,431,1

Therefore, strategies to tackle vaccine hesitancy based on evidence from high income countries are unlikely to serve the purpose adequately in LMICs. We use district level evidence on COVID-19 vaccine uptake rates from an LMIC - India to provide evidence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We argue that vaccination rates during the different phases of COVID-19 vaccination across the districts is likely to be related to vaccine hesitancy. Districts with larger rural population and lower literacy rates had lower vaccination rates. High past child immunization rates were positively correlated with COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Across the four phases of vaccination drive, vaccine hesitancy was the highest during the third phase of the vaccination drive, and therefore the above correlations were strongest during the third and the fourth phase. Measures of family planning indicators too seem to be correlated with vaccine uptakes during the third phase which indicate the regions most susceptible to vaccine hesitancy.","Agarwal, S.

The unknown nature of the COVID-19 infection, the high impreciseness of available information, and not simply recognizing the relevant factors and their effectiveness may cause overestimating and underestimating of factors. This paper puts forward a development of a model with fewer limitations that are more consistent with progressive knowledge about COVID-19. Dealing with the situation of updating the statistical dataset daily, the proposed approach can effectively use the subjectivity inherent in the fuzzy probability interpretation of risk factors using expert knowledge in addition to the statistical dataset. Second, to this uncertainty handling improvement, a specificity-based parameter learning based on the learning network is also added to deal with the complexity aspect of the COVID-19 infection. The learning process helps the proposed structure better adjust the effectiveness of factors. From the achieved results, it is verified that people with advanced age, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and those having cancer treatments are at higher risk of death if they are infected by COVID-19. Undoubtedly, for vaccination, these three groups should be considered in order to prevent death situations.","Sabahi, Farnaz",Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control,431,1

It has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma as a single agent and in combination. Here we report on the preliminary results of a prospective multi-center, phase II study of isatuximab in previously treated patients with AL amyloidosis (NCT03499808). Methods: Eligibility included age ≥ 18 years, relapsed or refractory systemic AL amyloidosis, ≥ 1 prior line of therapy, measurable disease (defined as a positive monoclonal serum immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) or urine IFE, a serum free light chain ratio outside of the normal range (0.25-1.65), and a difference in the involved versus the uninvolved serum free light chain of ≥ 4.5 mg/dL), at least one organ involved, not refractory to daratumumab, ECOG performance status 0-2, creatinine clearance ≥25 mL/min as measured by 24-hour urine collection or as estimated by Cockcroft and Gault formula, and NT-proBNP ≤8500 pg/mL. Patients received isatuximab intravenously 20 mg/kg weekly during the first 28 day cycle and every other week during cycles 2 through 24 for a maximum of 24 cycles. The primary objective was hematologic response with secondary objectives of organ response, safety, progression free survival, and overall survival. Results: At data cut-off (July 24, 2020), 43 patients were registered from March 2018 to September 2019 at 14 institutions. Thirty six patients were eligible with 35 patients receiving at least one dose of isatuximab. Of the eligible patients, the median age was 70 (range 40-81). Prior therapies included proteasome inhibitors in 32 patients (89%), high dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant in 17 patients (47%), immunomodulatory therapy in 9 patients (25%), and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy in 2 patients (6%). Single organ system involvement was seen in 19 patients (53%), ≥ 2 organ systems in 17 patients (47%), 16 patients (44%) had renal involvement, and 24 (67%) had cardiac involvement. For those with cardiac involvement, 7 patients (29%) had cardiac biomarker stage II and 9 patients (38%) had stage III disease using the Revised Mayo Staging (Kumar S et al., J Clin Oncol, 2012). A total of 17 patients remain on therapy. The median duration on treatment for eligible patients is currently 11.8 months (current range, 0.3-22.1). Of the 19 patients who discontinued treatment, the most common reasons included adverse events in 5 patients (26%), disease progression in 4 patients (21%), sub-optimal response in 2 patients (11%), and concerns related to COVID-19 in 2 patients (11%). The current median follow up is 16.3 months. The most common drug-related AEs were infusion related reactions in 18 patients (50%) with the majority (16/18) being grade I or II, anemia in 9 patients (25%) with the majority (8/9) being grade I, and lymphopenia in 8 patients (22%). Patient characteristics and preliminary safety data were previously presented at the International Symposium on Amyloidosis. The overall hematologic response rate was 77%. Hematological complete response (CR) was observed in 1 of 35 evaluable (completing at least 1 dose) patients (3%), very-good-partial response (VGPR) in 19 patients (54%), and partial response (PR) in 7 patients (20%). Conclusions: Isatuximab demonstrates encouraging efficacy in previously treated patients with AL amyloidosis. The administration of isatuximab in these patients is associated with a good safety profile similar to other monoclonal antibodies against CD38. The data will be updated at the meeting.

It has recently been reported that the organization of the Golgi complex is disrupted in cells treated with the fungal metabolite, brefeldin-A. Under these conditions, it was shown that resident enzymes of the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi return to the ER. We report here that 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors, when pulse- labeled within the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, acquired numerous N- linked galactose residues with a half time of approximately 2 h, as measured by their ability to bind to RCA-I lectin affinity columns. In contrast, Limax flavus lectin chromatography revealed that less than 10% of these receptors acquired sialic acid after 8 h in brefeldin-A. Two lines of evidence suggested that proteins within and beyond the TGN did not return to the ER in the presence of brefeldin-A. First, the majority of 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors present in the TGN and endosomes did not return to the ER after up to 6 h in brefeldin-A, as determined by their failure to contact galactosyltransferase that had relocated there. Moreover, although mannose 6-phosphate receptors did not acquire sialic acid when present in the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, they were readily sialylated when labeled at the cell surface and transported to the TGN. These experiments indicate that galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme, returns to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin-A, while the bulk of sialyltransferase, a resident of the TGN, does not. Our findings support the proposal that the TGN is a distinct, fourth compartment of the Golgi apparatus that is insensitive to brefeldin-A.",,J Cell Biol,431,16

Little data is available about contingency protocols to minimize the spread of the virus in these centers. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the preventive and management measures adopted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) to minimize the risk of transmission of Covid-19. METHODS A team of specialists in Preventive and Internal Medicine established a protocol for active surveillance, identification of suspected and confirmed cases, and follow-up of contacts. Also, a Unit for the care of confirmed cases was created with personnel specifically trained in Covid-19, to achieve better patient care and optimize the available resources. Descriptive statistical measures have been used to analyze the data. RESULTS The prevalence of Covid-19 was 12.2%, with a cumulative incidence of 8.2%. After the protocol was established, control of the disease was achieved without hospital transmission after its application. Due to the alarm generated at the start of the pandemic, up to 45% of the requested RT-PCRs did not meet the criteria of the Ministry of Health, all of which were negative. The clinical characteristics of our patients differed slightly from those observed in other studies published in the general population, with cough and asthenia being the most frequent symptoms, present in 69.2% and 38.5%, respectively. 100% of the infected patients did not present complications that required assistance in the Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS With the application of preventive and organizational actions, we consider that we have presented a low incidence of those infected. The preparation of protocols and their supervision is essential for the rapid identification of cases and optimization of the tests requested. Despite being a medium and long-stay hospital, we have not presented any mortality or complications that required admission to the Intensive Care Unit.","Ruiz Moruno, Antonio José; Rodríguez Cola, Miguel; Jiménez Velasco, Irena; Ruíz Delgado, Rosa María; González Rubio, Alicia",Revista espanola de salud publica,431,0

However, experimental identification and characterization of protease substrates is often difficult and time-consuming. Thus solving the ""substrate identification"" problem is fundamental to both understanding protease biology and the development of therapeutics that target specific protease-regulated pathways. In this context, bioinformatic prediction of protease substrates may provide useful and experimentally testable information about novel potential cleavage sites in candidate substrates. In this article, we provide an overview of recent advances in developing bioinformatic approaches for predicting protease substrate cleavage sites and identifying novel putative substrates. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the current methods and detail how more accurate models can be built by deriving multiple sequence and structural features of substrates. We also provide some suggestions about how future studies might further improve the accuracy of protease substrate specificity prediction.","Song, Jiangning; Tan, Hao; Boyd, Sarah E; Shen, Hongbin; Mahmood, Khalid; Webb, Geoffrey I; Akutsu, Tatsuya; Whisstock, James C; Pike, Robert N",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,431,19

METHODS A total of 509 primarily Hispanic households participated. Participants reported symptoms twice weekly, and nasal swabs were collected from those with an influenza-like illness (ILI). Households were followed for up to 19 months and home visits were made at least every two months. RESULTS We recorded 5034 URIs, of which 669 cases reported ILIs and 78 were laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. Demographic factors significantly associated with infection rates included age, gender, birth location, education, and employment. The Hand Sanitizer group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms (p < 0.01), but there were no significant differences in rates of infection by intervention group in multivariate analyses. Knowledge improved significantly more in the Hand Sanitizer group (p < 0.0001). The proportion of households that reported > or = 50% of members receiving influenza vaccine increased during the study (p < 0.001). Despite the fact that compliance with mask wearing was poor, mask wearing as well as increased crowding, lower education levels of caretakers, and index cases 0-5 years of age (compared with adults) were associated with significantly lower secondary transmission rates (all p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In this population, there was no detectable additional benefit of hand sanitizer or face masks over targeted education on overall rates of URIs, but mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations. During the study period, community concern about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was occurring, perhaps contributing to the use of hand sanitizer in the Education control group, and diluting the intervention's measurable impact.","Larson, Elaine L; Ferng, Yu-hui; Wong-McLoughlin, Jennifer; Wang, Shuang; Haber, Michael; Morse, Stephen S",Public health reports,431,12

Five week old pigs with and without maternal antibodies were inoculated by aerosol or directly into the intestinal lumen. In aerosol inoculated pigs, virus replication was observed to high titres in the respiratory tract. Replication occurred in epithelial cells of nasal mucosa, trachea, bronchi bronchioli and alveoli and in alveolar macrophages.

This evolution can be monitored by detection of a viral quasispecies of spike deletion variants (SDVs) (C. L. Rowe, S. C. Baker, M. J. Nathan, and J. O. Fleming, J. Virol. 71:2959-2969, 1997). We and others have found that the deletions cluster in the region from 1,200 to 1,800 nucleotides from the 5' end of the spike gene sequence, termed the ""hypervariable"" region. To address how SDVs might arise, we generated the predicted folding structures of the positive- and negative-strand senses of the entire 4,139-nt spike RNA sequence. We found that a prominent, isolated stem-loop structure is coincident with the hypervariable region in each structure. To determine if this predicted stem-loop is a ""hot spot"" for RNA recombination, we assessed whether this region of the spike is more frequently deleted than three other selected regions of the spike sequence in a population of viral sequences isolated from the CNS of acutely and persistently infected mice. Using differential colony hybridization of cloned spike reverse transcription-PCR products, we detected SDVs in which the hot spot was deleted but did not detect SDVs in which other regions of the spike sequence were exclusively deleted. Furthermore, sequence analysis and mapping of the crossover sites of 25 distinct patterns of SDVs showed that the majority of crossover sites clustered to two regions at the base of the isolated stem-loop, which we designated as high-frequency recombination sites 1 and 2. Interestingly, the majority of the left and right crossover sites of the SDVs were directly across from or proximal to one another, suggesting that these SDVs are likely generated by intramolecular recombination. Overall, our results are consistent with there being an important role for the spike RNA secondary structure as a contributing factor in the generation of SDVs during persistent infection.","Rowe, C L; Fleming, J O; Nathan, M J; Sgro, J Y; Palmenberg, A C; Baker, S C",Journal of virology,431,10

Diagnostic criteria include onset within one week of a known insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary opacities on radiography, and inability to explain respiratory failure by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is thought to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammatory cell accumulation in the alveoli and microcirculation of the lung. Inflammatory cells damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and decreased gas exchange. Most cases are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. ARDS is responsible for one in 10 admissions to intensive care units and one in four mechanical ventilations. In-hospital mortality for patients with severe ARDS ranges from 46% to 60%. ARDS often must be differentiated from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, which typically has signs of fluid overload. Treatment of ARDS is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure improve outcomes. Prone positioning is recommended for some moderate and all severe cases. As patients with ARDS improve and the underlying illness resolves, a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated to assess eligibility for ventilator weaning. Patients who survive ARDS are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.","Saguil, Aaron; Fargo, Matthew V",American family physician,431,19

More than ninety vaccines are currently being developed against Sars-Cov2 by universities and companies around the world. They are protein-based vaccines, viral vector vaccines, DNA or RNA vaccines and inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines. The development of a vaccine starts from the identification and characterization of the microorganism that causes the disease. The second step is the preclinical phase. Then, there is the phase of clinical experimentation, which allows to study the posology, efficacy and safety of the vaccine, on an increasingly larger sample. In the European Union, vaccines are authorized through two procedures (EU and national) based on the quality, safety and efficacy requirements defined by the European and international guidelines. Timing of realization, authorization and marketing of new vaccines can be shortened in cases of particular need, through an accelerated evaluation known as ""Priority Medicines"". In this period, it is crucial not to neglect current vaccinations. In fact, during the pandemic period, many countries postponed vaccination campaigns against many vaccine-preventable diseases, causing a marked decrease in routine immunizations in childhood.","Terracciano, Elisa; Amadori, Fabiana; Zaratti, Laura; Franco, Elisabetta",Igiene e sanita pubblica,431,33

MATERIAL AND METHODS The web-based survey COVIDRA was developed to assess 5 domains including RA symptoms, attitudes towards medication, employment status, physical exercise and mental health. The questionnaire was sent to RA patients through e-mail and social media of the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology and two patient associations; and it was filled locally at two rheumatology centers in Lisbon. Recruitment took place during June and July 2020. RESULTS We obtained 441 valid questionnaires. Most respondents were female (88.4%), caucasian (93.6%) with a mean age of 58 years. The majority had disease lasting >10 years and were treated with csDMARDs (63.2%) and/or bDMARDs/tsDMARDS (23.7%). Over 40% experienced symptom worsening during confinement, almost half considered moderate or severe. Mobility restriction and increased stress, anxiety or depression were responsible for this worsening. Only 2.5% reduced or withheld their immunosuppressive medication due to fear of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. After confinement, 16.2% of those previously employed were in a lay-off regime and 3% lost their jobs. Most employed RA patients practiced telework during confinement. The majority of patients decreased or did not practice any physical exercise (80.5%). Symptoms of anxiety and depression developed or worsened in 67.3% and 51.9% respectively, approximately one third were considered moderate or severe. CONCLUSIONS Portuguese RA patients experienced significant symptom worsening, anxiety and depression during the first wave confinement. Only a minority changed their immunosuppressive treatment for fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS In order to choose the sensitive cell strain and the best infection dose of the virus, Vero, Vero-E6 and 2BS cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV. The cultivation temperature was selected among 25 degrees C, 33 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The best inactivating time and effect were observed with beta-propiolactone whose concentration ranged from 1:2000 to 1:20,000 at room temperature. RESULTS Vero and Vero-E6 cell lines were sensitive to SARS-CoV. The cytopathic changes of the cells were 75% at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 incubator after infection. SARS-CoV was inactivated completely in beta-propiolactone (1:4000). The toxicity of beta-propiolactone was hydrolyzed completely when the inactivated virus was cultured for 16 hours at 2 degrees C, 8 degrees C and in water bath for 2 hours at 37 degrees C. CONCLUSION The titer of SARS-CoV was the highest when it was cultured in Vero or Vero-E6 cells for 72 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 incubator. SARS-CoV was inactivated completely in beta-propiolactone when its concentration was 1:4000 and the interaction time was 1 hour.","Zhang, Song-le; Ma, Li-juan; Tian, Guang; Zhang, Liang-yan; Zhang, Xue-ying; Wang, Xi-liang",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,431,28

Total face masks (TFMs) are considered to be a very comfortable NIV interface. However, due to their large internal volume and consequent increased CO2 rebreathing, their orifices allow proximal leaks to enhance CO2 elimination. The ventilators used in the ICU might not adequately compensate for such leakage. In this study, we attempted to determine whether ICU ventilators in NIV mode are suitable for use with a leaky TFM. METHODS This was a bench study carried out in a university research laboratory. Eight ICU ventilators equipped with NIV mode and one NIV ventilator were connected to a TFM with major leaks. All were tested at two positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and three pressure support levels. The variables analyzed were ventilation trigger, cycling off, total leak, and pressurization. RESULTS Of the eight ICU ventilators tested, four did not work (autotriggering or inappropriate turning off due to misdetection of disconnection); three worked with some problems (low PEEP or high cycling delay); and one worked properly. CONCLUSIONS The majority of the ICU ventilators tested were not suitable for NIV with a leaky TFM.","Nakamura, Maria Aparecida Miyuki; Costa, Eduardo Leite Vieira; Carvalho, Carlos Roberto Ribeiro; Tucci, Mauro Roberto",Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia,431,1

The study took the form of a cross-sectional community-based survey in Doha International Airport and primary health care centres situated in urban and semi-urban areas of Qatar. The survey was conducted among travellers arriving at Doha International Airport and community residents visiting health centres from April to September 2003. A total of 1,800 subjects were approached for the study of which 1,386 (77.0%) responded to the questionnaire. The study showed that although 79.4% of the total subjects claimed to know about SARS, only 8.0% had accurate knowledge about all of the symptoms of SARS. The respondents' satisfaction with the preventive measures taken by the health authorities was only 66.6%. Overall, 73.0% of the total subjects knew that SARS was highly infectious; 69.9% knew that it could spread through close contact; 67.4% were aware that high fever was the early symptom; and 60.8% thought SARS could be cured. Half of the subjects said they had gained most of their knowledge on SARS through television and radio programmes (52.2%). Three-fifths (60.1%) were afraid to travel for fear of being affected by SARS. The level of awareness of SARS among Qataris was poor (31.7%) compared to that among non-Qataris (68.3%). The level of knowledge about SARS was better among educated subjects. The survey found a high level of stress and fear among the respondents.

In this study, we have characterized the origin of this wrapping cisterna by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry using lectins, antibodies against endocytic organelles, and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing proteins which behave as Golgi resident proteins. No labelling for endocytic marker proteins could be detected on the wrapping membrane. However, the wrapping membrane labelled significantly for a trans Golgi network (TGN) marker protein. The recycling pathway from endosomes to the TGN appears to be greatly increased following vaccinia virus infection, since significant amounts of endocytic fluid-phase tracers were found in the lumen of the TGN, Golgi complex, and the wrapping cisternae. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we localized the vaccinia virus membrane proteins VV-p37, VV-p42, VV-p21, and VV-hemagglutinin (VV-HA) in large amounts in the wrapping cisternae, in the outer membranes of the IEV, and in the outermost membrane of the EEV. The bulk of the cellular VV-p37, VV-p21, and VV-p42 were in the TGN, whereas VV-HA was also found in large amounts on the plasma membrane and in endosomes. Collectively, these data argue that the TGN becomes enriched in vaccinia virus membrane proteins that facilitate the wrapping event responsible for the formation of the IEV.","Schmelz, M; Sodeik, B; Ericsson, M; Wolffe, E J; Shida, H; Hiller, G; Griffiths, G",Journal of virology,431,16

The objective of this article is to establish general recommendations for surgical teams to manage the kidney transplant program duringthe COVID-19 era. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This document is based on the scientific evidence available on the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the experience of authors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web and Pubmed search was performed using the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2"","" COVID-19"", ""COVID Urology"", ""COVID-19 surgery"", and ""kidney transplantation."" A modified nominal group technique was used. RESULTS: When health system saturation occurs, kidney transplants should be deferred, except in patients with low transplant possibilities and an optimal kidney available, combined transplants or life-threatening situations. Screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be done in all those donors and recipients with clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19, who have visited or live inhigh-risk areas, or who have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Donation and transplantation will not proceed in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Surgeries should be based on general recommendations in the COVID-19 era and will be efficient, short, and focused on those with the shortest hospital stay. In emergencies, protective measures will be taken with persona lprotection equipment. Surgical staff will be only the strictly necessary, and permanence in the OR should be minimized. Transplant urology consultations will be conducted by teleconsultation when possible. CONCLUSION: The safety of potential donors and recipients must be guaranteed, adopting individual protection measures and screening for SARS-CoV-2. Kidney transplant surgery must be efficient in terms of health, human resources, and clinical benefit. All non-urgent transplant activities should be delayed until the improvement of the local condition of each center.","Ponce Díaz-Reixa, José Luis; Domínguez Gil, Beatriz; Coll, Elisabeth; Musquera, Mireia; García, E; Cabello, Ramiro; León, Eduardo; Parra, Loreto; Cuevas, Ángel; Antón, Beatriz; Campos, Juan",Archivos espanoles de urologia,431,16

Method: In an analytical cross-sectional design, the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Mexico from February 29 to July 24, 2020 was studied, and compared with sentinel cases calculated from the Rt. A descriptive and comparative analysis of prevalence, cumulative incidence and case fatality was performed to summarize the epidemiological data for Mexico and in relation to information for Italy, Spain, and the United States of North America. Results: In Mexico, until July 24, 2020, there are a total of 390,516 cases of COVID-19 and 43,680 deaths from this disease; with the use of Rt to calculate the correction of cases and unidentified deaths, the figure increases to 3,780,195 cases (p = 0.0002) and 211,469 deaths (p = 0.001). This suggests underreporting in the identification of cases and deaths and is associated with one of the highest case fatality rates in the world for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: In Mexico, the sentinel model presents a significant loss of unquantified information. It is necessary to reinforce epidemiological surveillance through a better case detection strategy in our country and continue to apply measures that allow the containment and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ornelas-Aguirre, José M; Vidal-Gómez-Alcalá, Alejandro",Cir Cir,431,10

Since there is no effective medication yet, to minimize and control the transmission of the COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are followed globally. However, for the implementation of needful NPIs through effective management strategies and planning, space-time-based information on the nature, magnitude, pattern of transmission, hotspots, the potential risk factors, vulnerability, and risk level of the pandemic are important. Hence, this study was an attempt to in-depth assess and analyze the COVID-19 outbreak and transmission dynamics through space and time in Bangladesh using 154 day real-time epidemiological data series. District-level data were analyzed for the geospatial analysis and modelling using GIS. Getis-Ord Gi* statistics was applied for the hotspot analysis, and on the other hand, the analytical hierarchy process-based weighted sum method (AHP-WSM) was used for the modelling of vulnerability zoning of COVID-19. In Bangladesh, the status of the pandemic COVID-19 still is in exposure level. Disease transmitted at a high rate (20.37%), and doubling time of the cases were 11 days (latest week of the study period). The fatality rate was comparatively low (1.3%), and the recovery rate was about 57.50%. Geospatial analysis exhibits the disease propagates from the central parts, and Dhaka was the most exposed district followed by Chattogram, Narayanganj, Cumilla, and Bogra. A single strong clustering pattern in the central part, which spread out mainly to the south-eastern part, was identified as a prime hotspot in both the cases and deaths distributions. Additionally, potential linkages between the transmission of disease and the selected factors that gear up the spreading of the disease were identified. The central, eastern, and south-eastern parts were recognized as high vulnerable zone, and conversely, the western, south-western, north-western, and north-eastern parts as medium vulnerable zone. The vulnerable zoning exercise made it possible to identify vulnerable areas with the different magnitude that require urgent intervention through proper management and action plan, and accordingly, comprehensive management strategies were anticipated. Thus, this study will be a useful guide towards understanding the space-time-based investigations and vulnerable area delineation of the COVID-19 and assist to formulate an effective management action plan to reduce and control the disease propagation and impacts. By appropriate adjustment of some factors with local relevance, COVID-19 vulnerability zoning derived here can be applied to other regions, and generally can be used for any other infectious disease. This method was applied at a regional scale, but the availability of larger scale data of the determining factors could be applied in small areas too, and accordingly, management strategies can be formulated.","Rahman, Md Rejaur; Islam, A H M Hedayutul; Islam, Md Nazrul",Model Earth Syst Environ,431,16

We aimed to describe the changes in liver care before and after COVID-19 restricted access to health care. We obtained data on the number of liver clinic visits, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging using electronic query or clinic registry at three medical centers in the United States, Japan, and Singapore for the following periods: February 1 to March 14, 2018, 2019, and 2020; and March 15 to May 1, 2018, 2019, and 2020. We performed trend analysis using logistic regression. In total, 14,403 visits were made to the liver clinics at the three centers: 5,900 in 2018, 5,270 in 2019, and 3,233 in 2020. Overall, there were no significant changes in the distribution of males and females between February 1 and May 1 from 2018 to 2020, but there was a lower proportion of seniors ages 65 years and older (P < 0.001). There were significant decreasing trends in the total number of liver clinic visits overall (p-trend = 0.038) and in the subanalysis for chronic hepatitis B, C, and other liver diseases. HCC/cirrhosis visits also dropped from 883 to 538 (39.07% decrease) overall and 665 to 355 (46.62% decrease) for the US site. In addition, there was a significant decreasing trend in the number of abdominal ultrasounds (P-trend = 0.004) and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (P-trend = 0.007) performed overall. Conclusion: Liver clinic visits, hepatoma surveillance, and diagnostic abdominal imaging fell dramatically as social distancing measures were instituted.

However, compliance with these guidelines has been inconsistent. This correlational study examined whether individual differences in risky decision-making and motivational propensities predicted compliance with COVID-19 preventative behaviors in a sample of US adults (N = 404). Participants completed an online study from September through December 2020 that included a risky choice decision-making task, temporal discounting task, and measures of appropriate mask-wearing, social distancing, and perceived risk of engaging in public activities. Linear regression results indicated that greater temporal discounting and risky decision-making were associated with less appropriate mask-wearing behavior and social distancing. Additionally, demographic factors, including personal experience with COVID-19 and financial difficulties due to COVID-19, were also associated with differences in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. Path analysis results showed that risky decision-making behavior, temporal discounting, and risk perception collectively predicted 55% of the variance in appropriate mask-wearing behavior. Individual differences in general decision-making patterns are therefore highly predictive of who complies with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.","Byrne, Kaileigh A; Six, Stephanie G; Anaraky, Reza Ghaiumy; Harris, Maggie W; Winterlind, Emma L",PLoS One,431,4

By using a mean-field approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic models for a general adaptive strategy, which strongly depends on the correlations between activity and attractiveness in the susceptible and infected states. We focus on strong social distancing, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards nonquarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of the active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one and that in the SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to reach containment.","Mancastroppa, Marco; Burioni, Raffaella; Colizza, Vittoria; Vezzani, Alessandro",Phys Rev E,431,32

In this simulation study, we analyze how mobility restrictions mitigate epidemic processes and how this mitigation is influenced by the epidemic's degree of dispersion. We find that (even imperfect) mobility restrictions are generally efficient in mitigating epidemic spreading. Notably, the effectiveness strongly depends on the dispersion of the offspring distribution associated with the epidemic. We also find that mobility restrictions are useful even when the pathogen is already prevalent in the whole population. However, also a delayed implementation is more efficient in the presence of overdispersion. Conclusively, this means that strategies based on mobility restrictions, like green zones, are easier to implement when the transmission dynamics admits overdispersion (e.g., in the case of COVID-19). To study these relationships at an appropriate level of abstraction, we propose a spatial branching process model combining the flexibility of stochastic branching processes with an agent-based approach allowing a conceptualization of locality, saturation, and interaction structure. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Großmann, G.; Backenköhler, M.; Wolf, V.","24th ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems Computation and Control, HSCC 2021, held as part of the 14th Cyber Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things Week, CPS-IoT Week 2021",431,22

Most prior studies of companions in clinical encounters focus on non-Hispanic White patients. However, there is generally lower-quality patient-physician communication during encounters with Black patients; these communication differences may contribute to racial health disparities. The purpose of the present study was to examine effects of the presence and active participation of companions on encounters between Black patients with cancer and non-Black oncologists. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data collected during a larger intervention study. Participants were Black patients with breast, colon, or lung cancer who had a treatment-discussion encounter with a participating non-Black medical oncologist. Video recordings of encounters were coded for patient, companion, and oncologist communication. After the encounter, patients reported perceptions of the recommended treatment; patients and oncologists reported perceptions of each other. RESULTS: Data from 114 patients and 19 oncologists were included in analyses. Only 47% of patients brought a companion to the encounter. Oncologists spent more time with accompanied Black patients, used more patient-centered communication with them, and perceived them as having more social support compared with unaccompanied Black patients. Oncologists reported that accompanied patients asked more questions. When companions participated more actively in the encounter, oncologists used more patient-centered communication. DISCUSSION: Bringing a companion to oncology appointments may be beneficial to Black patients because oncologists spend more time with patients, use more patient-centered communication, and perceive patients more positively, all of which may ultimately improve patient health and well-being outcomes.","Otto, Amy K; Reblin, Maija; Harper, Felicity W K; Hamel, Lauren M; Moore, Tanina F; Ellington, Lee; Eggly, Susan",JCO Oncol Pract,431,1

It allows physicians (for example) to identify groups of patients for whom a given drug or treatment is likely to be effective and groups of patients for which it is not. Most of the current methods of subgroup analysis begin with a particular algorithm for estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) and identify subgroups by maximizing the difference across subgroups of the average treatment effect in each subgroup. These approaches have several weaknesses: they rely on a particular algorithm for estimating ITE, they ignore (in)homogeneity within identified subgroups, and they do not produce good confidence estimates. This paper develops a new method for subgroup analysis, R2P, that addresses all these weaknesses. R2P uses an arbitrary, exogenously prescribed algorithm for estimating ITE and quantifies the uncertainty of the ITE estimation, using a construction that is more robust than other methods. Experiments using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets (based on real data) demonstrate that R2P constructs partitions that are simultaneously more homogeneous within groups and more heterogeneous across groups than the partitions produced by other methods. Moreover, because R2P can employ any ITE estimator, it also produces much narrower confidence intervals with a prescribed coverage guarantee than other methods.","Lee, Hyun-Suk; Zhang, Yao; Zame, William; Shen, Cong; Lee, Jang-Won; Schaar, Mihaela van der",,431,29

Although acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 fulfills the criteria of the Berlin definition, in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19, there is a dissociation between their relatively well-preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxaemia. The extent of pneumococcal related morbidity and mortality is largely unknown. Respiratory comorbidities that increase the risk of severe disease and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis and fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, regardless of aetiology. Pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccinations are useful in preventing a substantial burden of mortality in high-risk populations, while general quarantine and social distancing can reduce the infiltration of the virus within the community. To date, several therapeutic agents have been studied or are currently examined, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, ritonavir/lopinavir, remdesivir, colchicines and interleukin-6 inhibitors. However, the usage of most of these into clinical practice was not based on randomised clinical trials and their results should be viewed with extreme caution; remdesivir seems to be the more promising option.

Little information is available from Southern African countries which have similar climatic and occupational characteristics to CKDu-endemic countries. We investigated whether CKDu is prevalent in Malawi and identified its potential risk factors in this setting. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from January-August 2018 collecting bio samples and anthropometric data in two Malawian populations. The sample comprised adults > 18 years (n = 821) without diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria. Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Linear and logistic regression models were applied with potential risk factors, to estimate risk of reduced eGFR. RESULTS: The mean eGFR was 117.1 ± 16.0 ml/min per 1.73m2 and the mean participant age was 33.5 ± 12.7 years. The prevalence of eGFR< 60 was 0.2% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.1, 0.9); the prevalence of eGFR< 90 was 5% (95% CI =3.2, 6.3). We observed a higher prevalence in the rural population (5% (3.6, 7.8)), versus urban (3% (1.4, 6.7)). Age and BMI were associated with reduced eGFR< 90 [Odds ratio (OR) (95%CI) =3.59 (2.58, 5.21) per ten-year increment]; [OR (95%CI) =2.01 (1.27, 3.43) per 5 kg/m2 increment] respectively. No increased risk of eGFR < 90 was observed for rural participants [OR (95%CI) =1.75 (0.50, 6.30)]. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced kidney function consistent with the definition of CKDu is not common in the areas of Malawi sampled, compared to that observed in other tropical or sub-tropical countries in Central America and South Asia. Reduced eGFR< 90 was related to age, BMI, and was more common in rural areas. These findings are important as they contradict some current hypothesis that CKDu is endemic across tropical and sub-tropical countries. This study has enabled standardized comparisons of impaired kidney function between and within tropical/subtropical regions of the world and will help form the basis for further etiological research, surveillance strategies, and the implementation and evaluation of interventions.","Hamilton, Sophie A; Nakanga, Wisdom P; Prynn, Josephine E; Crampin, Amelia C; Fecht, Daniela; Vineis, Paolo; Caplin, Ben; Pearce, Neil; Nyirenda, Moffat J",BMC Nephrol,431,16

Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid combination is the most commonly used dual antiplatelet therapy recommended by international guidelines and in Chinese clinical practice. Poor adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy or premature interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy is an important contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lethal cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid fixed-dose combination enhances adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. Herein, we aimed to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel in fixed-dose combination compared with simultaneous administration of their individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. METHODS: This was a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study with a washout period of 10 days conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive Co-Plavix® (test formulation- fixed-dose combination of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) once and reference formulations (coadministration of individual formulations of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) twice during the study period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for acetylsalicylic acid, its metabolite salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and its metabolite SR26334. As acetylsalicylic acid shows high intrasubject variability, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) approach was implemented for acetylsalicylic acid analysis, while bioequivalence of clopidogrel was assessed using the average bioequivalence method. Point ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC, AUClast, and Cmax for acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 171 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized and 170 subjects were treated with test or reference formulation; 164 subjects completed the study. Regarding acetylsalicylic acid exposure, as reference within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was at least 0.294 for acetylsalicylic acid Cmax, AUClast, and AUC, the RSABE analysis method was used to assess bioequivalence for all three parameters. The point estimates were within the 0.80-1.25 range (1.19, 1.09, and 1.04, respectively), and upper one-sided 95% CIs of scaled average bioequivalence metric were at most 0 (- 0.30, - 0.14, and - 0.10, respectively). Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated with acetylsalicylic acid. Bioequivalence was also achieved with clopidogrel as the 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios of clopidogrel Cmax, AUClast, and AUC were within the bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25). CONCLUSION: Application of the reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid in Chinese male and female healthy volunteers under fasting conditions demonstrated bioequivalence of test and reference formulations.

The disease has claimed many fatalities as it has transcended from one country to another since it was first discovered in China in late 2019. To prevent further morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, most of the countries initiated a countrywide lockdown. While physical distancing and lockdowns helped in curbing the spread of this novel coronavirus, it led to massive economic losses for the nations. Positive impacts have been observed due to lockdown in terms of improved air quality of the nations. In the current research, ten tropical and subtropical countries have been analysed from multiple angles, including air pollution, assessment and valuation of health impacts and economic loss of countries during COVID-19 lockdown. Countries include Brazil, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Validated Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) binning model is used on data collated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) for all the countries for the month of January to May 2019 and 2020. The concentration results of PM2.5 show that air pollution has drastically reduced in 2020 post lockdown for all countries. The highest average concentration obtained by converting aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2020 is observed for Thailand as 121.9 µg/m3 and the lowest for Mexico as 36.27 µg/m3. As air pollution is found to decrease in the April and May months of 2020 for nearly all countries, they are compared with respective previous year values for the same duration to calculate the reduced health burden due to lockdown. The present study estimates that cumulative about 100.9 Billion US$ are saved due to reduced air pollution externalities, which are about 25% of the cumulative economic loss of 435.9 Billion US$.","Bherwani, Hemant; Kumar, Suman; Musugu, Kavya; Nair, Moorthy; Gautam, Sneha; Gupta, Ankit; Ho, Chang-Hoi; Anshul, Avneesh; Kumar, Rakesh",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The reason is that the abnormal tumor microenvironment prevents nanoparticles from effective concentrating and reaching tumor area. Therefore, it's very necessary to better understand the effect of the abnormal tumor microenvironment on the transvascular transport of nanoparticles to overcome this critical problem. METHODS: In this paper, a tumor abnormal vascular-interstitial model was established, and the transvascular transport process of nanoparticles was simulated in the model by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. RESULTS: The simulation results showed that the transport efficiency of nanoparticles decreased with increasing interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), and nanoparticles could not cross the blood vessel wall when the IFP approached the blood vessel wall pressure. Interestingly, the transport efficiency of nanoparticles first increased with blood flow velocity, and then decreased with blood flow velocity. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that with the continuous malignant development of tumors, the ability of nanoparticles to passively diffuse has almost disappeared. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of the nanoparticles disappeared with the disappearance of the pressure gradient inside the tumor. These results provided guidance for future research on the vascular transport pathways and mechanisms of nanoparticles.","Gao, Yan; Shi, Yanbin; Fu, Mengguang; Feng, Yihua; Lin, Guimei; Kong, Deyin; Jiang, Bo",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,431,24

To manage the Covid-19 pandemic-imposed backlog of postponed colonoscopy examinations, an efficient approach is needed. The practice of on-demand sedation with benzodiazepines and/or opiates will allow most patients to complete a water-aided examination with minimal or no sedation. Other methods reported to minimize patient discomfort during colonoscopy can be used, in addition to water-aided techniques. Unsedated or minimally sedated patients who do not require recovery or require a shorter one allow rapid turnaround. The practice obviates the need for assistance with deep sedation from anesthesiologists, who may be in short supply. Trainee education in water-aided colonoscopy has been demonstrated to confer benefits.

This study reports change in air quality and its impact on the environment during the unique lockdown scenario at Bhubaneswar, a coastal smart city in east India. The urban air shows a remarkable reduction in the mean pollutant levels influenced by traffic emission viz. NOx (~ 67 %) and BC (~ 47 %) during lockdown over the pre-lockdown. Comparatively, a lower reduction of CO (~ 14 %) is attributed to the dominance of natural atmospheric chemical regulation and biogenic sources in addition to anthropogenic contributions. In addition to the lockdown, frequent rain events due to depression in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) also had a significant role in the reduction of the primary pollutants over the study site. An enhancement of secondary pollutant viz. O3 (~ 3%) with a distinct diurnal pattern was observed during the first phase of lockdown over the pre-lockdown period. An anti-correlation between O3 and NOx during pre-lockdown points to a higher O3 production potential with decreasing NOx. While a reduction in the titration of O3 due to suppression of fresh NO emissions led to accumulation of O3 in the first phase of lockdown, inhibited photochemistry due to cloudy skies as well as reduction in precursors led to lower O3 values during the later phases of lockdown.","Panda, Subhasmita; Mallik, Chinmay; Nath, Jyotishree; Das, Trupti; Ramasamy, Boopathy",Air Qual Atmos Health,431,16

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on patients with COVID-19 hospitalized between February and April 2020 in an outbreak hospital in North-East Italy. Pre-existing diabetes was defined by self-reported history, electronic medical records, or ongoing medications. Newly-diagnosed diabetes was defined by HbA1c and fasting glucose. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or death. RESULTS: 413 subjects were included, 107 of whom (25.6%) had diabetes, including 21 newly-diagnosed. Patients with diabetes were older and had greater comorbidity burden. The primary outcome occurred in 37.4% of patients with diabetes compared to 20.3% in those without (RR 1.85; 95%C.I. 1.33-2.57; p < 0.001). The association was stronger for newly-diagnosed compared to pre-existing diabetes (RR 3.06 vs 1.55; p = 0.004). Higher glucose level at admission was associated with COVID-19 severity, with a stronger association among patients without as compared to those with pre-existing diabetes (interaction p < 0.001). Admission glucose was correlated with most clinical severity indexes and its association with adverse outcome was mostly mediated by a worse respiratory function. CONCLUSION: Newly-diagnosed diabetes and admission hyperglycemia are powerful predictors of COVID-19 severity due to rapid respiratory deterioration.","Fadini, Gian Paolo; Morieri, Mario Luca; Boscari, Federico; Fioretto, Paola; Maran, Alberto; Busetto, Luca; Bonora, Benedetta Maria; Selmin, Elisa; Arcidiacono, Gaetano; Pinelli, Silvia; Farnia, Filippo; Falaguasta, Daniele; Russo, Lucia; Voltan, Giacomo; Mazzocut, Sara; Costantini, Giorgia; Ghirardini, Francesca; Tresso, Silvia; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Vianello, Andrea; Avogaro, Angelo; Vettor, Roberto",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,431,26

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection causing symptoms like dry cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, tiredness, fever, loss of taste, and smell etc. The disease was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The infection is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population. Coronaviruses are viruses with a positive RNA envelope assigned to &#945;, ß, Î³, and Î´ genera. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the ß genus. The four structural proteins of ß coronavirus are membrane (M), envelope (E), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) protein, mediation of coronavirus host infection is established by spike (S) protein. Therefore, the search for drug development targets and repositioning of existing therapeutics is essential for fighting the present pandemic. It was reviewed that therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 receptor, viral RNA synthesis and replication, 3CLpro, RdRp, and helicase will play a crucial role in the development of treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the RdRp and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are the most promising targets for drug development and repositioning and vaccine development. Remdesivir combination with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are promising drug repositioning for the treatment of COVID-19, and mRNA-1273 targeting spike protein is the promising vaccine. However, as patient management and drug repositioning are taking place, it is imperative to identify other promising targets used by SARS-CoV-2 to establish infection, to develop novel therapeutics.","Muhammed, Yusuf",,431,12

Montefiore Medical Center recognized the urgent need for mental health support to mitigate and treat psychological distress among staff. Various mental health support services were implemented. This report provides an overview of the interventions implemented at Montefiore and provides preliminary insights on the utilization and value of these ongoing services. OUTCOMES: The interventions instituted at Montefiore included psychoeducational resources, a phone support line, Staff Support Centers (SSCs), a clinical treatment program, team support sessions, peer support outreach, mental health and wellness programs, and clergy support. The most heavily used service during the pandemic were the SSCs, and the least used service was the clergy support. INSIGHTS: With institutional encouragement and the collective efforts of more than 150 mental health professionals and other staff, it was possible to set up durable mental health supports with multiple points of access. Although many services were available to both clinical and nonclinical staff, outreach was primarily to clinical staff. Additional efforts in the future are needed to more fully reach nonclinical frontline workers. NEXT STEPS: The organization's next steps include evaluation of emotional health and distress among clinical and nonclinical staff using validated self-report measures administered over multiple time intervals. Lessons learned about staff support during COVID-19 will also be integrated into future efforts to support staff well-being more broadly.","Bernstein, Carol A; Bhattacharyya, Sriya; Adler, Shelby; Alpert, Jonathan E",Jt.

However, some women are not able to breastfeed, or choose not to. Few studies have examined the experiences of non-breastfeeding mothers, including their challenges, supports, and mental health sequelae. We sought to identify women's experiences with breastfeeding, specifically their reasons for not breastfeeding, challenges faced, and supports received, and the association between breastfeeding and postpartum mental health. Self-identified postpartum women (N = 70) completed a questionnaire investigating perinatal health. Open-ended responses were analyzed using thematic analysis and quantitative measures were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Qualitative analysis identified two main themes reflecting reasons for not breastfeeding (maternal factors and infant factors) and three primary challenges associated with not breastfeeding (emotional health, physical health, and perceived lack of support). Authors identified two main themes categorizing non-breastfeeding mothers' experiences with support (sources of support and type of support). A MANOVA revealed significantly greater levels of distress, anxiety, and depression, and lower levels of social support, among non-breastfeeding, relative to breastfeeding mothers. Findings reveal limitations in the availability of information and resources for non-breastfeeding mothers. It is possible that the pressure women may experience regarding breastfeeding may contribute to increased psychological distress for mothers who cannot or choose not to breastfeed. Based on our findings, future research and applied action should target the development and evaluation of informational resources and supports for non-breastfeeding women.","Penniston, Trinda; Reynolds, Kristin; Pierce, Shayna; Furer, Patricia; Lionberg, Carrie",,431,17

This study aimed to build and validate a simple tool that can quickly predict the deterioration and survival of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 351 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Yichang between 9 January to 25 March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were randomly grouped into training (n = 246) or a validation (n = 105) dataset. Risk factors associated with deterioration were identified using univariate logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The factors were then incorporated into the nomogram. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the survival of patients between the low- and high-risk groups divided by the cut-off point. RESULTS: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to construct the nomogram via four parameters (white blood cells, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte&#8805;0.8 × 109/L, and lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;400 U/L). The nomogram showed good discriminative performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.945 (95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.98), and good calibration (P = 0.539). Besides, the nomogram showed good discrimination performance and good calibration in the validation and total cohorts (AUROC = 0.979 and AUROC = 0.954, respectively). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model had clinical application value. Kaplan-Meier analysis illustrated that low-risk patients had a significantly higher 8-week survival rate than those in the high-risk group (100% vs 71.41% and P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: A simple-to-use nomogram with excellent performance in predicting deterioration risk and survival of COVID-19 patients was developed and validated. However, it is necessary to verify this nomogram using a large-scale multicenter study.","Zeng, Zhiyong; Wu, Chaohui; Lin, Zhenlv; Ye, Yong; Feng, Shaodan; Fang, Yingying; Huang, Yanmei; Li, Minhua; Du, Debing; Chen, Gongping; Kang, Dezhi",BMC Infect Dis,431,29

Given the developmentally sensitive periods of early childhood and adolescence, adolescent motherhood in conflict-affected contexts may put a family at risk intergenerationally. We propose that the specifics of normative neuroendocrine development during adolescence, including increased sensitivity to stress, pose additional risks to adolescent girls and their young children in the face of war and displacement, with potential lifelong consequences for health and development. This paper proposes a developmental, dual-generational framework for research and policies to better understand and address the needs of adolescent mothers and their small children. We draw from the literature on developmental stress physiology, adolescent parenthood in contexts of war and displacement internationally, and developmental cultural neurobiology. We also identify culturally meaningful sources of resilience and provide a review of the existing literature on interventions supporting adolescent mothers and their offspring.

In the last few years, deep learning based semantic segmentation methods have significantly advanced the skin lesion segmentation results. However, the current performance is still unsatisfactory due to some challenging factors such as large variety of lesion scale and ambiguous difference between lesion region and background. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, named Dual Objective Networks (DONet), to improve the skin lesion segmentation. Our DONet adopts two symmetric decoders to produce different predictions for approaching different objectives. Concretely, the two objectives are actually defined by different loss functions. In this way, the two decoders are encouraged to produce differentiated probability maps to match different optimization targets, resulting in complementary predictions accordingly. The complementary information learned by these two objectives are further aggregated together to make the final prediction, by which the uncertainty existing in segmentation maps can be significantly alleviated. Besides, to address the challenge of large variety of lesion scales and shapes in dermoscopic images, we additionally propose a recurrent context encoding module (RCEM) to model the complex correlation among skin lesions, where the features with different scale contexts are efficiently integrated to form a more robust representation. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DONet. In particular, our DONet achieves 0.881 and 0.931 dice score on ISIC 2018 and $\text{PH}^2$, respectively.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 is widely affecting global healthcare systems. AIM: This study assesses effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. hospice agencies, staff, and patients as reported by hospice agency staff. DESIGN: An anonymous electronic survey was developed. Free-text comments were assessed for impacts on hospice agencies, staff, and patients and their families. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The target audience was members of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association who self-identified as being active with hospice agencies in the United States. RESULTS: Reported impacts include inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment, changes in hospice services, and decreased access by hospice personnel to patients in long term care facilities. Flow of patients through hospice care settings was impeded. Agencies experienced changes in workforce availability and increased emotional support needs of staff. Patient and families experienced increased bereavement needs. Nearly one-third of respondents reported negative effects on patient outcomes, such as inadequate symptom management and negative psychosocial effects. CONCLUSION: Respondents indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic had negative effects on both hospice patient care and hospice agency functioning. Hospice agencies appear to face challenges unique among U.S. healthcare agencies due to their service delivery model and focus on interdisciplinary care.

Methods: Using the TCMSP and ETCM to retrieve the chemical constituents of Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma Rubra and Ophiopogonis Radix in Shenmai Injection. The target of the compound was predicted through the SwissTargetPrediction database. The target of COVID-19 with coronary heart disease was screened through the NCBI database and the GeneCards database, and the targets of compound and disease were mapped to obtain the target of the compound for treating the disease. FunRich software and DAVID database were used to perform GO function enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and Excel software and Tableau software to draw bar charts and bubble charts for visualization. Finally, Cytoscape 3.7.1 software was used to build compound-target-pathway network. Glide was used to dock the components of Shenmai Injection with 3CL hydrolase (Mpro). Results: The results showed that ophiopogonin D', ophiopogonin D, ginsenoside Rg 2, methyl ophiopogonanone A, ophiogenin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1→2)-β-D-glucopyranoside, ginsenoside Rb 2, ginsenoside R 0, ophiopogon A, sanchinoside Rd, ophiopogonanone E, and ginsenoside Re showed higher degrees in the analysis and stronger binding with 3CL hydrolase. Those compounds were the main effective components in the treatment of COVID-19 combined with coronary heart disease, involving 77 targets such as IL6, GAPDH, ALB, TNF, MAPK1, MAPK3, TP53, EGFR, CASP3, and CXCL8. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that there were 124 (P &lt; 0.05) signaling pathways involving HIF-1 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, sphingolipid signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, apoptosis, Ras signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and prolactin signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that the affinity between the 17 components of Shenmai Injection and the 3CL hydrolase of SARS-CoV-2 was less than -25 kJ/mol. Conclusion: Shenmai Injection can achieve simultaneous intervention of COVID-19 and coronary heart disease by inhibiting cytokine storms, maintaining cardiac function homeostasis, regulating immunity, and antivirals. It presents the network regulation mechanism of mutual influence and complex correlation. This study can provide a scientific basis for the treatment of Shenmai Injection in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Han, Li-Wen; Zhang, You-Gang; Li, Hao-Nan; Wang, Hai-Yang; Li, Xiao-Bin; Wang, Xiao-Jing; Yao, Qing-Qiang",Chin.

A total of 119 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from symptomatic patients. A subset of samples, positive with two RT-qPCR assays were then tested with isothermal PCR and rapid antigen tests. Of the 119 specimens, 65 were positive by at least two PCR assays. All PCR assays showed substantial or perfect match, although some variations in the clinical performance was observed. Of the 37 and 32 remnant nasopharyngeal samples positive by RT-qPCR, respectively, three were positive by the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag and 14 were detected by the isothermal amplification assay. In conclusion, in the clinical settings we recorded that each of the RT-qPCR assays was superior to other test formats, in particular, the routine use of the DNA-technology assay is recommended.

Our study aimed to evaluate the utility of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Long Form (IPAQ-L) for its physical activity (PA) quantification in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. (2) Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 110 patients aged between 34 and 69 years admitted to the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Clinic. All patients underwent a clinical examination, blood tests, a cycle ergometer exercise stress test and individual assessment of their weekly PA level using the IPAQ-L. (3) Results: Obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes were highly prevalent in our study group but did not influence the IPAQ-L results. In terms of physical performance, moderate intensity was the most common level of intensity found in our study group. Regarding the data on the relationship between the IPAQ-L questionnaire and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) parameters, vigorous PA was correlated with predicted maximal oxygen uptake (p = 0.025) and moderate PA, in addition to walking, were correlated with heart rate reserve (p = 0.005 and p = 0.009, respectively). (4) Conclusions: IPAQ-L can be used for the evaluation of individual PA levels within a cardiovascular rehabilitation program, but cannot substitute for the importance and utility of CPET.","Manta, Andrei Cojocaru Elena Leon-Constantin Maria Magdalena Maștaleru Alexandra Roca Mihai Rusu Cristina Cojocariu Sabina Alexandra Mitu Florin",Applied Sciences,431,1

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has added unique challenges to this procedure. The presence of the virus in high concentrations in the aerodigestive tract and the need for an open airway during surgery can increase the risk of aerosolization of the virus and subsequent infection of the surgical, anesthetic, and operating room (OR) personnel. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent airway interventions between March and October 2020. INTERVENTIONS: A protocolized strategy was initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate the consistent management of all patients undergoing airway interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During a seven-month period, 34 patients were managed with this policy. All threatened airways were managed successfully and no healthcare workers dealing with such procedures were infected. Priorities during the current novel coronavirus pandemic are ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals and offering urgent bronchoscopic and surgical airway interventions for patients with progressive symptoms and threatened airways. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical and bronchoscopic management of laryngotracheal stenosis presents a unique challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring careful consideration of patient triage and the development of protocols that minimize risk to patients and healthcare professionals. Close collaboration between thoracic surgeons and anesthesiology teams is essential to safely navigate and handle these threatened airways while mitigating the risk of viral aerosolization.","Elsayed, Hany Hasan; Moharram, Assem Adel",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,431,24

METHODOLOGY: Multicenter, prospective study, which included critical COVID-19 patients in 9 ICUs in northwestern Spain. The clinical characteristics, treatments, and evolution of patients admitted to the ICU during the months of March-April 2020 (period 1) were compared with patients admitted in January-February 2021 (period 2). RESULTS: 337 patients were included (98 in period 1 and 239 in period 2). In period 2, fewer patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (65% vs 84%, p <0.001), using high-flow nasal cannulas (CNAF) more frequently (70% vs 7%, p <0.001), ventilation non-invasive mechanical (NIMV) (40% vs 14%, p <0.001), corticosteroids (100% vs 96%, p = 0.007) and prone position in both awake (42% vs 28%, p = 0.012), and intubated patients (67% vs 54%, p = 0.034). The days of IMV, ICU stay and hospital stay were lower in period 2. Mortality was similar in the two periods studied (16% vs 17%). CONCLUSIONS: After 1 year of pandemic, we observed that in patients admitted to the ICU, CNAF, NIMV, use of the prone position, and corticosteroids have been used more frequently, reducing the number of patients in IMV, and the length of stay in the ICU and hospital stay.

We compared the number of patients in 2020 to the average number of patients from 2016 to 2019. Numbers were compared in three periods: before the first COVID-19 patient was reported in Japan (January 1 to January 16), after the government encouraged social distancing (February 26 to March 10), and the interval between them (January 17 to February 25).

The distinct features of pulmonary biology in COVID-19 ARDS compared to other causes of ARDS, including other lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), are not well understood. Methods: Tracheal aspirates (TA) and plasma were collected within five days of intubation from mechanically ventilated adults admitted to one of two academic medical centers. ARDS and LRTI diagnoses and were verified by study physicians. Subjects were excluded if they received immunosuppression. TA from subjects with COVID-ARDS was compared to gene expression in TA from subjects with other causes of ARDS (OtherARDS) or mechanically ventilated control subjects without evidence of pulmonary pathology (NoARDS). Plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and protein C also were compared between these groups. Upstream regulator and pathway analysis was performed on significantly differentially expressed genes with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Subgroup analyses were performed to compare gene expression in COVID to ARDS associated with other viral LRTIs and bacterial LRTIs. The association of interferon-stimulated gene expression with SARS-CoV2 viral load was compared to the same association in nasopharyngeal swabs in a cohort of subjects with mild SARS-CoV2. Results: TA sequencing was available from 15 subjects with COVID, 32 subjects with other causes of ARDS (OtherARDS), and 5 mechanically ventilated subjects without evidence of pulmonary pathology (NoARDS). 696 genes were differentially expressed between COVID and OtherARDS (Figure 1A). IL-6, IL-8, B-cell receptor, and hypoxia inducible factor-1a signaling were attenuated in COVID compared to OtherARDS. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and PTEN signaling were higher in COVID compared to OtherARDS (Figure 1B). Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, and protein C were not significantly different between COVID and OtherARDS. In subgroup analyses, IL-8 signaling was higher in COVID compared to viral LRTI, but lower than bacterial LRTI. Type I/III interferon was higher in COVID compared to bacterial ARDS, but lower compared to viral ARDS (Figure 1C). Compared to nasopharyngeal swabs from subjects with mild COVID-19, expression of several interferon stimulated genes was less strongly correlated with SARS-CoV2 viral load in TA (Figure 1D). IPA identified several candidate medications to treat COVID-19, including dexamethasone, G-CSF, and etanercept. Conclusions: TA sequencing identifies unique features of the host response in COVID-19. These differentially expressed pathways may represent potential therapeutic targets. An impaired interferon response in the lung may increase susceptibility to severe SARS-COV2.","Sarma, A.; Christenson, S.; Mick, E.; DeVoe, C.; Deiss, T.; Pisco, A.; Ghale, R.; Byrne, A.; Moazed, F.; Spottiswoode, N.; Sinha, P.; Zha, B.

PROCEDURES: Included in this retrospective study were 53 patients with endometrial cancers who underwent [18F]-FDG PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) before treatment. Since two different PET scanners were used, post-reconstruction harmonization was performed for all PET parameters using the ComBat harmonization method. Four clinical (age, histological type, stage, and treatment method) and 40 [18F]-FDG PET-based radiomic features were ranked, and a subset of useful features was selected based on the decrease in the Gini impurity in terms of associations with disease progression. The machine learning algorithms (random forest, neural network, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machine) were compared using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and validated by the random sampling method. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by the Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The five best predictors of disease progression were coarseness, gray-level run length nonuniformity, stage, treatment method, and gray-level zone length nonuniformity. The kNN model obtained the best performance classifier for predicting the disease progression (AUC =0.890, accuracy =0.849, F1 score =0.848, precision =0.857, and recall =0.849). Coarseness which was the first ranked radiomic feature was selected for survival analyses, and only coarseness remained as a significant and independent factor for both PFS (hazard ratios (HR), 0.65; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.86; p=0.003) and OS (HR, 0.52; 95 % CI, 0.36-0.76; p<0.001) at multivariate Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: [18F]-FDG PET-based radiomic analysis using a machine learning approach may be useful for predicting tumor progression and prognosis in patients with endometrial cancers.","Nakajo, Masatoyo; Jinguji, Megumi; Tani, Atsushi; Kikuno, Hidehiko; Hirahara, Daisuke; Togami, Shinichi; Kobayashi, Hiroaki; Yoshiura, Takashi",Mol. imaging biol,431,24

As health inequities grow, it is imperative that we develop an empirically-driven mechanistic understanding of the determinants of health disparities, and capture disease burden in at-risk populations to prevent exacerbation of disparities. Past work has been limited in data or scope and has thus fallen short of generalizable insights. Here, we integrate empirical data from observational studies and large-scale healthcare data with models to characterize the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of health disparities in an infectious disease case study: influenza. We find that variation in social and healthcare-based determinants exacerbates influenza epidemics, and that low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals disproportionately bear the burden of infection. We also identify geographical hotspots of influenza burden in low SES populations, much of which is overlooked in traditional influenza surveillance, and find that these differences are most predicted by variation in susceptibility and access to sickness absenteeism. Our results highlight that the effect of overlapping factors is synergistic and that reducing this intersectionality can significantly reduce inequities. Additionally, health disparities are expressed geographically, and targeting public health efforts spatially may be an efficient use of resources to abate inequities. The association between health and socioeconomic prosperity has a long history in the epidemiological literature; addressing health inequities in respiratory-transmitted infectious disease burden is an important step towards social justice in public health, and ignoring them promises to pose a serious threat.","Zipfel, Casey M; Colizza, Vittoria; Bansal, Shweta",PLoS Comput Biol,431,1

The objectives of the study are to assess PEMs of geriatric associations' websites and determine whether they are above the GRL recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health. DESIGN: Descriptive and correlational methodology. PEMs from 10 major geriatric associations were assessed for their GRL using 10 scales. Eight of the scales provide a numerical GRL while two of the scales provide a visual representation of the GRLs. Analysis was conducted using Readability Studio 2019.3. SETTING: Analysis was conducted February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Identified 10 geriatric associations and 884 PEMs. MEASUREMENTS: GRLs were measured by 10 validated readability indices: the Degrees of Reading Power and Grade Equivalent test, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook test, Coleman-Liau Index, Gunning Fog Index, New Fog Count, New Dale-Chall readability formula, Ford, Caylor, Sticht scale, Raygor readability estimate graph, and Fry readability graph. RESULTS: The mean of all PEMs using the numerical scales was 11.1 ± 2.4. Ninety-nine percent of PEMs are above the 6th GRL. PEMs ranged from a grade 3.0 to 19.0 reading level. Analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference between associations (P < .0001), and multiple comparison analysis identified the National Institute on Aging as the content easiest to read (9.5 ± 1.6). CONCLUSION: PEMs from geriatric association websites are written above the recommended 6th GRL.

Methods: Survey of outpatient MH/SUD clinicians (psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers; N = 107) at a psychiatric hospital. Clinician satisfaction and experiences using telehealth across a variety of services (individual, group or family therapy, initial assessments, evaluation and management, and neuropsychological assessment) were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. Results: Across services, a majority agreed/strongly agreed that telehealth provided an opportunity to build rapport with patients (67-88%) and they could treat their patients' needs well (71-88%). The interest in continuing to use telehealth when in-person visits resume varied by type of service provided (50-71%). Group therapy and initial assessment were lowest (50% and 51%, respectively). Clinicians noted telehealth improved access to care for patients with logistical barriers, competing demands, mobility difficulties, and medical concerns; but was more challenging to care for patients with certain psychiatric characteristics (e.g., psychosis, paranoia, catatonia, high distractibility, and avoidance), high symptom severity, or who needed to improve social skills. Telehealth influenced the therapeutic process (e.g., observations of family dynamic, increased patient/clinician therapeutic alliance). Discussion and Conclusions: MH/SUD clinicians who quickly transitioned to telehealth care during the pandemic were largely satisfied with telehealth, but also identified challenges related to specific patient characteristics, or types of MH/SUD services. These observations warrant additional study to better delineate the role for an expanded use of telehealth postpandemic.","Sugarman, Dawn E; Horvitz, Lisa E; Greenfield, Shelly F; Busch, Alisa B",Telemed. j. e. health,431,1

In this ecological study of 140 countries using publicly available national-level data, higher vaccine coverage, representing estimated proportion of people vaccinated during the last 14 years, was associated with lower COVID-19 deaths. The associations attenuated for both vaccine variables, and MCV coverage became no longer significant once adjusted for published estimates of the Healthcare access and quality index (HAQI), a validated summary score of healthcare quality indicators. The magnitude of association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 death rate varied according to HAQI, and MCV coverage had little effect on the association between BCG and COVID-19 deaths. While there are associations between live vaccine coverage and COVID-19 outcomes, the vaccine coverage variables themselves were strongly correlated with COVID-19 testing rate, HAQI and life expectancy. This suggests that the population-level associations may be further confounded by differences in structural health systems and policies. Cluster randomised studies of booster vaccines would be ideal to evaluate the efficacy of trained immunity in preventing COVID-19 infections and mortality in vaccinated populations and on community transmission.","Ogimi, Chikara; Qu, Pingping; Boeckh, Michael; Bender Ignacio, Rachel A; Zangeneh, Sahar Z",Epidemiol Infect,431,16

Therefore, we conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of 40 MS patients with confirmed COVID-19. Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death. 19/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6/40(15%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P = 0.0121, P = 0.0373).

Abnormal liver tests, mainly transaminase elevations, have been reported in hospitalized patients. We describe a syndrome of cholangiopathy in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 characterized by marked elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) accompanied by evidence of bile duct injury on imaging. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020, on whom the hepatology service was consulted for abnormal liver tests. Bile duct injury was identified by abnormal liver tests with serum ALP > 3x upper limit of normal and abnormal findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography. Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological findings were recorded in a Research Electronic Data Capture database. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified, 11 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 58 years. Mean time from COVID-19 diagnosis to diagnosis of cholangiopathy was 118 days. Peak median serum alanine aminotransferase was 661 U/L and peak median serum ALP was 1855 U/L. Marked elevations of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers were common. Magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography findings included beading of intrahepatic ducts (11/12, 92%), bile duct wall thickening with enhancement (7/12, 58%), and peribiliary diffusion high signal (10/12, 83%). Liver biopsy in 4 patients showed acute and/or chronic large duct obstruction without clear bile duct loss. Progressive biliary tract damage has been demonstrated radiographically. Five patients were referred for consideration of liver transplantation after experiencing persistent jaundice, hepatic insufficiency, and/or recurrent bacterial cholangitis. One patient underwent successful living donor liver transplantation. DISCUSSION: Cholangiopathy is a late complication of severe COVID-19 with the potential for progressive biliary injury and liver failure. Further studies are required to understand pathogenesis, natural history, and therapeutic interventions.","Faruqui, Saamia; Okoli, Fidelis C; Olsen, Sonja K; Feldman, David M; Kalia, Harmit S; Park, James S; Stanca, Carmen M; Figueroa Diaz, Viviana; Yuan, Sarah; Dagher, Nabil N; Sarkar, Suparna A; Theise, Neil D; Kim, Sooah; Shanbhogue, Krishna; Jacobson, Ira M",Am J Gastroenterol,431,24

A case control study in a major trauma centre,18.508837,6.6513214,2021,"Antithrombin (AT) is a major plasma glycoprotein of the serpin superfamily that regulates the proteolytic activity of the procoagulant proteases of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Two important structural features that participate in the regulatory function of AT include a mobile reactive center loop that binds to active site of coagulation proteases, trapping them in the form of inactive covalent complexes, and a basic D-helix that binds to therapeutic heparins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on vascular endothelial cells. The binding of D-helix of AT by therapeutic heparins promotes the reactivity of the serpin with coagulation proteases by several orders of magnitude by both a conformational activation of the serpin and a template (bridging) mechanism. In addition to its essential anticoagulant function, AT elicits a potent anti-inflammatory signaling response when it binds to distinct vascular endothelial cell HSPGs, thereby inducing prostacyclin synthesis. Syndecans-4 has been found as a specific membrane-bound HSPG receptor on endothelial cells that relays the signaling effect of AT to the relevant second messenger molecules in the signal transduction pathways inside the cell. However, following cleavage by coagulation proteases and/or by spontaneous conversion to a latent form, AT loses both its anti-inflammatory activity and high-affinity interaction with heparin and HSPGs. Interestingly, these low-affinity heparin conformers of AT elicit potent proapoptotic and antiangiogenic activities by also binding to specific HSPGs by unknown mechanisms. This review article will summarize current knowledge about mechanisms through which different conformers of AT exert their serine protease inhibitory and intracellular signaling functions in these biological pathways.","Rezaie, Alireza R; Giri, Hemant",J. thromb. haemost,431,20

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal cohort study; seven fortnightly online surveys of a representative sample of 1296 Australian adults from the beginning of COVID-19-related restrictions in late March 2020 to mid-June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales; trajectories of symptom change. RESULTS: Younger age, being female, greater COVID-19-related work and social impairment, COVID-19-related financial distress, having a neurological or mental illness diagnosis, and recent adversity were each significantly associated with higher baseline depression and anxiety scores. Growth mixture models identified three latent trajectories for depression symptoms (low throughout the study, 81% of participants; moderate throughout the study, 10%; initially severe then declining, 9%) and four for anxiety symptoms (low throughout the study, 77%; initially moderate then increasing, 10%; initially moderate then declining, 5%; initially mild then increasing before again declining, 8%). Factors statistically associated with not having a low symptom trajectory included mental disorder diagnoses, COVID-19-related financial distress and social and work impairment, and bushfire exposure. CONCLUSION: Our longitudinal data enabled identification of distinct symptom trajectories during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Early intervention to ensure that vulnerable people are clinically and socially supported during a pandemic should be a priority.","Batterham, Philip J; Calear, Alison L; McCallum, Sonia M; Morse, Alyssa R; Banfield, Michelle; Farrer, Louise M; Gulliver, Amelia; Cherbuin, Nicolas; Rodney Harris, Rachael M; Shou, Yiyun; Dawel, Amy",Med. j.

For hard, non-porous surfaces, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated to undetectable levels on plastic and glass with a UV dose of 34.9 mJ/cm2 and stainless steel with a dose of 52.5 mJ/cm2. We also observed that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirator material to undetectable levels with a dose of 103 mJ/cm2. We included UV dosimeter cards that provide a colorimetric readout of UV dose and demonstrated their utility as a means to confirm desired levels of exposure were reached.

We argue that the model of the neoliberal university is unsustainable if left to continue in its current form, and which Covid-19 has done little to decelerate or dismantle.

Although tracheostomy is frequently needed for critically ill patients requiring extended mechanical ventilation, it has been described as an aerosol-generating procedure that puts health care professionals at an increased risk of viral transmission. In addition, the delivery of aerosolized medications to this patient population has become controversial because of concerns on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via droplets. Although aerosol therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 was described in recent publications, innovations in aerosol drug delivery to COVID-19 patients with tracheostomy have not been presented. Therefore, empirically based guidance on how to deliver aerosols safely and effectively to tracheotomized patients with COVID-19 is still lacking.

He presented with a 10-day history of fever (up to 39.7 °C), productive cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, myalgias and hypoxemia. The patient received supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone, remdesivir and empirical antibiotic treatment according to protocol. Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia developed on hospital day 3 (namely, heart rate 39/min compared to 92/min on admission). Secondary causes of bradycardia were excluded based on the absence of relevant evidence from laboratory work-up and echocardiographic examination. The patient's rhythm restored to normal 9 days after the discontinuation of remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the frequent use of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19, physicians should be aware of this possible adverse event.","Barkas, Fotios; Styla, Chrysoula-Paraskevi; Bechlioulis, Aris; Milionis, Haralampos; Liberopoulos, Evangelos",,431,17

Traumatic events (TEs) are frequently experienced within the population and are known to dysregulate the stress response system and to be associated with psychiatric and physical disorders. GPs may feel reluctant to confront TEs for a variety of reasons, such as a lack of sufficient training in trauma-informed care or a fear of causing harm when discussing a patient's more complicated issues, among others. This perspective paper aims to review the existing studies that support the practice of trauma-informed healthcare and to summarise best practices. Studies have shown that patients appreciate the questions that clinicians ask them about trauma-related issues and that they understand that this can be important for their healthcare. Furthermore, asking about trauma-related issues in a patient-centered and empathic way can result in better doctor-patient relationships, which improves the levels of satisfaction of both the patient and the doctor with the consultation, as well as improved health-related outcomes. As past traumatic experiences increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder on exposure to a new TE, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to trauma-informed care becoming even more important if the strategy is to continue to invest in preventive medicine.","Tomaz, Teresa; Castro-Vale, Ivone",,431,24

Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC) experienced an unprecedented surge, resulting in resource strain. At EHC 2,409 patients (1501, COVID-19 positive) were newly admitted between March 1st to May 29, 2020, drastically surpassing hospital capacity. Herein, we compare patient outcomes before and after assistance. METHODS A retrospective review of cardiopulmonary resuscitation code team data was carried out for admitted adults requiring code response team between March 11 to May 25. A total of 145 cases were analyzed with respect to different grades of FEMA assistance to determine impacts of ancillary staff to patient ratios on survival. RESULTS Prior to FEMA support (3/11-3/25), code survival was 47% (8/17) and survival to discharge was 0% (0/17). The first wave of FEMA support (3/26-4/8) brought 221 Critical Care providers. Code survival was 39% (24/62) and survival to discharge was 5% (3/62). The second wave (4/9-4/23) included both 86 providers and volunteers, after which code survival was 56% (28/50) and survival to discharge was 2% (1/50). A third wave of 79 additional providers (4/24-5/10) resulted in decreased number of codes, code survival to 38% (3/8) and improved survival to discharge 38% (3/8). During the subsequent weeks while FEMA support staff remained at EHC (5/11-5/25), code survival was 50% (4/8), and the improved survival to discharge of 38% (3/8) was maintained. Overall, while the probability of code survival remained relatively constant (38-56%), survival to discharge showed significant and sustained improvement with additional provider support. CONCLUSION Given the exponential rise in COVID-19 admissions, hospitals are likely to become overwhelmed and medical practice is forced to adapt.(3) Swift action from FEMA and optimal ancillary staff deployment was critical to improving survival to discharge in critically ill patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation.(4) Flexibility in step-up planning with timely high acuity capacity and appropriately trained provider staffing is vital to ensuring proper care during a pandemic surge.","Johnson, K.; Durrance, R.

Peritonitis is associated with higher mortality risk and added treatment costs and limits more widespread PD utilization. Optimizing the prevention of peritonitis in the United States will first require standardization of peritonitis definitions, key data elements, and outcomes in an effort to facilitate nationwide reporting. Standardized reporting can also help describe the variability in peritonitis rates and outcomes across facilities in the United States in an effort to identify potential peritonitis prevention strategies and engage with stakeholders to develop strategies for their implementation. Here, we will highlight considerations and challenges in developing standardized definitions and implementation of national reporting of peritonitis rates by PD facilities. We will describe existing peritonitis prevention evidence gaps, highlight successful infection-reporting initiatives among patients receiving in-center hemodialysis or PD, and provide an overview of nationwide quality improvement initiatives, both in the United States and elsewhere, that have translated into a reduction in peritonitis incidence.

The NO2 decrease in South Korea was found but not significant, which indicates the effects of spontaneous social distancing under the maintenance of ordinary life. The AODs in 2020 were normally high in January, but they became lower starting from February. Since the atmosphere over Eastern Asia was unusually stagnant in January and February 2020, the AOD decrease in February 2020 clearly reveals the positive effect of the COVID-19. Considering the insignificant NO2 decrease in South Korea and the relatively long lifetime of aerosols, the AOD decrease in South Korea may be more attributed to the improvement of the air quality in neighboring countries. In March, regional atmosphere became well mixed and ventilated over South Korea, contributing to large enhancement of air quality. While the social activity was reduced after the COVID-19 outbreak, the regional meteorology should be also examined significantly to avoid the biased evaluation of the social impact on the change of the regional air quality.","Koo, Ja-Ho; Kim, Jhoon; Lee, Yun Gon; Park, Sang Seo; Lee, Seoyoung; Chong, Heesung; Cho, Yeseul; Kim, Jaemin; Choi, Kyungbae; Lee, Taegyung",Sci Rep,431,20

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were obtained from a health survey conducted in July 2020 among the staff members of a designated medical institution for COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1228 hospital workers. EXPOSURE OF INTEREST: Engagement in COVID-19-related work (qualitatively (ie, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work or affiliation to related departments) as well as quantitatively (ie, working hours)) and job categories. OUTCOME MEASURES: Depressive symptoms. RESULTS: There was no significant association between depressive symptoms and engagement in work with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or affiliation to COVID-19-related departments. However, working for longer hours in March/April, when Japan witnessed a large number of infected cases, was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (&#8805;11 hours/day: prevalence ratio (PR)=1.45, 95% CI=1.06 to 1.99, compared with &#8804;8 hours/day). Nurses were more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms than did doctors (PR=1.70, 95% CI=1.14 to 2.54). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work or having an affiliation to related departments might not be linked with a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms among Japanese hospital workers; contrarily, long working hours appeared to increase the prevalence of depressive symptoms.","Inoue, Yosuke; Yamamoto, Shohei; Fukunaga, Ami; Hoang, Dong Van; Miki, Takako; Islam, Zobida; Miyo, Kengo; Ishii, Masamichi; Ishiwari, Hironori; Konishi, Maki; Ohmagari, Norio; Mizoue, Tetsuya",BMJ Open,431,16

The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with the one which produced the 2003 outbreak (SARS CoV-1). Both coronaviruses also share the same cellular receptor, which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) one. In spite of these similarities, the new coronavirus has expanded more widely, more faster and more lethally than the previous one. Many researchers across the disciplines have used diverse modeling tools to analyze the impact of this pandemic at global and local scales. This includes a wide range of approaches – deterministic, data-driven, stochastic, agent-based, and their combinations – to forecast the progression of the epidemic as well as the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop or mitigate its impact on the world population. The physical complexities of modern society need to be captured by these models. This includes the many ways of social contacts – (multiplex) social contact networks, (multilayers) transport systems, metapopulations, etc. – that may act as a framework for the virus propagation. But modeling not only plays a fundamental role in analyzing and forecasting epidemiological variables, but it also plays an important role in helping to find cures for the disease and in preventing contagion by means of new vaccines. The necessity for answering swiftly and effectively the questions: could existing drugs work against SARS CoV-2? and can new vaccines be developed in time? demands the use of physical modeling of proteins, protein-inhibitors interactions, virtual screening of drugs against virus targets, predicting immunogenicity of small peptides, modeling vaccinomics and vaccine design, to mention just a few. Here, we review these three main areas of modeling research against SARS CoV-2 and COVID-19: (1) epidemiology; (2) drug repurposing; and (3) vaccine design. Therefore, we compile the most relevant existing literature about modeling strategies against the virus to help modelers to navigate this fast-growing literature. We also keep an eye on future outbreaks, where the modelers can find the most relevant strategies used in an emergency situation as the current one to help in fighting future pandemics.","Estrada, Ernesto",Phys.

These works are currently at different clinical trial stages, and their results may be determined by the outcome of the ongoing trial process. There is the need for a collection of information regarding the availlable therapeutic options related to COVID-19. this article therefore reviewed emerging and re-emerging therapeutic compounds/drugs used in COVID-19 management and reports of clinical trials, with the view to summarize and highlight their prospect and possible adverse effects to allow more extensive choice by clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The approach used involved retrieval of related collections found in selected repositories including, Medline, Scopus, PubMed, and Google scholar. Only experimental or clinical studies were included. Out of the 39 materials retrieved, 26 (66.67%) studies were based on clinical trials, 12 (30.77%) were classified as in vitro studies, and only one (2.56%) involved experimental animal study. Of the agents evaluated for COVID-19 therapeutics, 15 (38.46%) were anti-viral, four (10.26%) antimalarial, four studies were immunotherapeutics (10.26%), two studies (5.13%) were antibacterial, while, one (2.56%) study wasfor antiparasitic , anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral/antimalarial, and anti-viral/herbal combination for each. Also, eight studies (20.51%) were antibiotic/antimalarial.. This review indicates that there is both a race and quest in the test of antiviral agents against COVID-19 and that arbidol seems to have dominated in the studies analyzed. The use of anticoagulants and antibiotics, such as teicoplanin and azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine were reported to also play a leading role in the management of the disease. Likewise, dexamethasone has been recently claimed to be effective in patients in need of respiratory assistance. Based on unresolved controversies and inconclusive findings, it could be said that generally, a single and specific therapeutics to COVID-19 is still a mirage. There is, thus, an urgent need to test more potent compounds and agents to establish much safer and highly efficacious drugs/agents for the disease, even as we continue to learn more about the disease as well as the characteristic of the virus.","Ismaila, Muhammad Sani; Bande, Faruku; Ishaka, Aminu; Sani, Aminatu Abubakar; Georges, Karla",J Chemother,431,1

METHODS: The COVID-19 Imaging Registry Study Aachen (COVID-19-Bildgebungs-Register Aachen, COBRA) collects data on imaging in patients with COVID-19. Two of the COBRA partner hospitals (RWTH Aachen University Hospital and Dueren Hospital) systematically perform reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs as well as LDCT in all patients presenting with manifestations that are compatible with COVID-19. In accordance with the COV-RADS protocol, the LDCT scans were prospectively evaluated before the RT-PCR findings were available in order to categorize the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS: From 18 March to 5 May 2020, 191 patients with COVID-19 manifestations (117 male, age 65 ± 16 years) underwent RT-PCR testing and LDCT. The mean time from the submission of the sample to the availability of the RT-PCR findings was 491 minutes (interquartile range [IQR: 276-1066]), while that from the performance of the CT to the availability of its findings was 9 minutes (IQR: 6-11). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in 75/191 patients (39%). The LDCT was positive in 71 of these 75 patients and negative in 106 of the 116 patients without COVID-19, corresponding to 94.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [86.9; 98.5]), 91.4% specificity [84.7; 95.8], positive and negative predictive values of 87.7% [78.5; 93.9] and 96.4% [91.1; 98.6], respectively, and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.959 [0.930; 0.988]. The initial RT-PCR test results were falsely negative in six patients, yielding a sensitivity of 92.0% [83.4; 97.0]; these six patients had positive LDCT findings. 47.4% of the LDCTs that were negative for COVID-19 (55/116) exhibited pathological pulmonary changes, including infiltrates, that were correctly distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 related changes. CONCLUSION: In patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, LDCT can esablish the diagnosis of COVID-19 with comparable sensitivity to RT-PCR testing. In addition, it offers a high specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases associated with the same or similar clinical symptoms. We propose the systematic use of LDCT in addition to RT-PCR testing because it helps correct false-negative RT-PCR results, because its results are available much faster than those of RT-PCRtesting, and because it provides additional diagnostic information useful for treatment planning regardless of the type of the infectious agent.","Schulze-Hagen, Maximilian; Hübel, Christian; Meier-Schroers, Michael; Yüksel, Can; Sander, Anton; Sähn, Marwin; Kleines, Michael; Isfort, Peter; Cornelissen, Christian; Lemmen, Sebastian; Marx, Nikolaus; Dreher, Michael; Brokmann, Jörg; Kopp, Andreas; Kuhl, Christiane",Dtsch Arztebl Int,431,24

The clinically-proven protease inhibitor Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. However, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate metabolites and potential viral resistance have not been analyzed. Moreover, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate in human lung tissue remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We used recombinant TMPRSS2, reporter particles bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or authentic SARS-CoV-2 to assess inhibition of TMPRSS2 and viral entry, respectively, by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA. FINDINGS: We show that several TMPRSS2-related proteases activate SARS-CoV-2 and that two, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13, are robustly expressed in the upper respiratory tract. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by Camostat mesylate. The Camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to Camostat mesylate. In contrast, both inhibitors exhibited similar antiviral activity and this correlated with the rapid conversion of Camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum. Finally, Camostat mesylate and GBPA blocked SARS-CoV-2 spread in human lung tissue ex vivo and the related protease inhibitor Nafamostat mesylate exerted augmented antiviral activity. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 and closely related proteases for spread in the upper respiratory tract and that spread in the human lung can be blocked by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA.

However, the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in older individuals are not fully understood, and national data on these aspects in older Korean adults are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in older adults using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), which is a nationwide cross-sectional epidemiological study conducted by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. METHODS: Data from a total of 62,825 participants of the 2007-2016 KNHANES were compiled and analyzed to investigate differences in participant characteristics and potential risk factors for anemia. Differences in clinical characteristics of participants were compared across subgroups using the chi-square test for categorical variables and independent t-test for continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to identify related clinical factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia was higher in the population aged &#8805;65 years than in the younger population. Anemia was also more prevalent among females than among males, but this difference was not significant in people aged > 85 years. Being underweight, receiving a social allowance, living alone, and having comorbidities such as hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, and chronic renal failure (CRF) were more common among older adults with anemia than among the population without anemia. In univariate and multivariate analyses, older age, female sex, underweight, and presence of comorbidities including rheumatoid arthritis, DM, cancer, and CRF were associated with an increased risk of anemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that age, female sex, underweight, and the presence of comorbidities such as rheumatoid arthritis, DM, cancer, and CRF were associated with an increased risk of anemia in older Korean adults. Further study on causal relationships between anemia and other variables in the older population is necessary.","Chueh, Hee Won; Jung, Hye Lim; Shim, Ye Jee; Choi, Hyoung Soo; Han, Jin Yeong",BMC Geriatr,431,30

We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China, over a one- and five-year time horizon. METHODS: Regional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of all sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%), but initial data indicated no change in viral suppression. A mathematical model of HIV transmission/treatment among MSM was used to estimate the impact of disruptions on HIV infections/HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over one and five years for 3/4/6-month disruption periods, starting from 1 January 2020. RESULTS: Our model predicted new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions (25% virally suppressed MSM stop taking ART) for a three-month period increasing HIV infections by 5% to 14% over one year and deaths by 7% to 12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5% to 14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility HIV testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11% to 23% fewer infections and 0.4% to 1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods (4/6 months) amplified the impact of disruption scenarios. When realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections occurred over one year (3% to 17%), but not for five years (1% increase to 4% decrease), whereas deaths mostly increased over one year (1% to 2%) and five years (1.2 increase to 0.3 decrease). CONCLUSIONS: The overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19-related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.","Booton, Ross D; Fu, Gengfeng; MacGregor, Louis; Li, Jianjun; Ong, Jason J; Tucker, Joseph D; Turner, Katherine Me; Tang, Weiming; Vickerman, Peter; Mitchell, Kate M",J Int AIDS Soc,431,1

In addition to being the first European country to be heavily swept by the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy was the first to introduce stringent lockdown measures. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and related COVID-19 pandemic have been the worst public health challenge endured in recent history by Italy. Two months since the beginning of the first wave, the estimated excess deaths in Lombardy, the hardest hit region in the country, reached a peak of more than 23,000 deaths.

Almost all previous reports showed that in ICU less than half of patients were treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and the rest of them with non-invasive respiratory support. This highlighted the role of respiratory intensive care units (RICUs), where patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure can be treated with non-invasive respiratory support, avoiding ICU admission. In this report, we describe baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of 97 patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 admitted to the RICU of the Policlinico of Bari from March 11th to May 31st 2020. In our population, most of the subjects were male (72%), non-smokers (76%), with a mean age of 69.65±14 years. Ninety-one percent of patients presented at least one comorbidity and 60% had more than two comorbidities. At admission, 40% of patients showed PaO2/FiO2 ratio between 100 and 200 and 17% showed Pa02/FiO2 ratio <100. Mean Pa02/FiO2 ratio at admission was 186.4±80. These patients were treated with non-invasive respiratory support 40% with CPAP, 38% with BPAP, 3% with HFNC, 11% with standard oxygen therapy or with IMV through tracheostomy (patients in step down from ICU, 8%). Patients discharged to general ward (GW) were 51%, 30% were transferred to ICU and 19% died. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few described experiences of patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 treated outside the ICU, in a RICU. Outcomes of our patients, characterized by several risk factors for disease progression, were satisfactory compared with other experiences regarding patients treated with non-invasive respiratory support in ICU. The strategical allocation of our RICU, between ED and ICU, might have positively influenced clinical outcomes of our patients.","Di Lecce, Valentina; Carpagnano, Giovanna Elisiana; Pierucci, Paola; Quaranta, Vitaliano Nicola; Barratta, Federica; Zito, Annapaola; Buonamico, Enrico; Resta, Onofrio",Multidiscip Respir Med,431,7

Many repurposed drugs have progressed rapidly to Phase 2 and 3 trials without characterisation of Pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD) including safety in COVID-19. One such drug is Nafamostat Mesylate (Nafamostat), a synthetic serine protease inhibitor with anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. Preclinical data has demonstrated that it is has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 by directly inhibiting the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) dependent stage of host cell entry. MethodsWe present the findings of a phase Ib/II open label, platform randomised controlled trial (RCT), exploring the safety of intravenous Nafamostat in hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonitis. Patients were assigned randomly to standard of care (SoC), Nafamostat or an alternative therapy. Secondary endpoints included clinical endpoints such as number of oxygen free days and clinical improvement/ deterioration, PK/PD, thromboelastometry, D Dimers, cytokines, immune cell flow cytometry and viral load. ResultsData is reported from 42 patients, 21 of which were randomly assigned to receive intravenous Nafamostat. The Nafamostat group developed significantly higher plasma creatinine levels, more adverse events and a lower number of oxygen free days. There were no other statistically significant differences in the primary or secondary endpoints between Nafamostat and SoC. PK data demonstrated that intravenous Nafamostat was rapidly broken down to inactive metabolites. We observed an antifibrinolytic profile, and no significant anticoagulant effects in thromboelastometry. Participants in the Nafamostat group had higher D Dimers compared to SoC. There were no differences in cytokine profile and immune cell phenotype and viral loads between the groups. ConclusionIn hospitalised patients with COVID-19, we did not observe evidence of anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant or antiviral activity with intravenous Nafamostat. Given the number of negative trials with repurposed drugs, our experimental medicine trial highlights the value of PK/PD studies prior to selecting drugs for efficacy trials. Given the mechanism of action, further evaluation of Nafamostat delivered via a different route may be warranted. This trial demonstrates the importance of experimental trials in new disease entities such as COVID-19 prior to selecting drugs for larger trials.","Quinn, Tom Michael; Gaughan, Erin E; Bruce, Annya; Antonelli, Jean; O'Connor, Richard; Li, Feng; McNamara, Sarah; Koch, Oliver; MacIntosh, Claire; Dockrell, David; Walsh, Timothy; Blyth, Kevin; Church, Colin; Schwarze, Jürgen; Boz, Cecilia; Valanciute, Asta; Burgess, Matthew; Emanuel, Philip; Mills, Bethany; Rinaldi, Giulia; Hardisty, Gareth; Mills, Ross; Findlay, Emily; Jabbal, Sunny; Duncan, Andrew; Plant, Sinéad; Marshall, Adam D.L.; Young, Irene; Russell, Kay; Scholefield, Emma; Nimmo, Alastair F; Nazarov, Islom B.; Churchill, Grant C; McCullagh, James S.O.; Ebrahimi, Kourosh; Ferrett, Colin; Templeton, Kate; Rannard, Steve; Owen, Andrew; Moore, Anne; Finlayson, Keith; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Norrie, John; Parker, Richard A; Akram, Ahsan R; Anthony, Daniel C; Dear, James W; Hirani, Nik; Dhaliwal, Kevin",,431,23

The virus contains five major protein classes viz., four structural proteins [nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E) and spike glycoprotein (S)] and replicase polyproteins (R), synthesized as two polyproteins (ORF1a and ORF1ab). Due to the severity of the pandemic, most of the SARS-CoV-2-related research are focused on finding therapeutic solutions. However, studies on the sequences and structure space throughout the evolutionary time frame of viral proteins are limited. Besides, the structural malleability of viral proteins can be directly or indirectly associated with the dysfunctionality of the host cell proteins. This dysfunctionality may lead to comorbidities during the infection and may continue at the post-infection stage. In this regard, we conduct the evolutionary sequence-structure analysis of the viral proteins to evaluate their malleability. Subsequently, intrinsic disorder propensities of these viral proteins have been studied to confirm that the short intrinsically disordered regions play an important role in enhancing the likelihood of the host proteins interacting with the viral proteins. These interactions may result in molecular dysfunctionality, finally leading to different diseases. Based on the host cell proteins, the diseases are divided in two distinct classes: (i) proteins, directly associated with the set of diseases while showing similar activities, and (ii) cytokine storm-mediated pro-inflammation (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome, malignancies) and neuroinflammation (e.g. neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases). Finally, the study unveils that males and postmenopausal females can be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the androgen-mediated protein transmembrane serine protease 2.","Sen, Sagnik; Dey, Ashmita; Bandhyopadhyay, Sanghamitra; Uversky, Vladimir N; Maulik, Ujjwal",Brief. bioinform,431,1

As the world mobilizes to contain the COVID-19, scientists and public health experts are increasingly alarmed about the potentially catastrophic effects of an outbreak in Africa. The establishment of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention by the Africa Union in 2017 was an unprecedented move toward strengthening national responses, so far enabling all fifty member states with confirmed cases of COVID-19 to adequately respond, break chains of transmission and effectively contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We enter an uncertain and challenging period that may severely test the preparedness, organizational resource and resilience of African states and the fabric of their societies. However, we speculate that the fear associated with COVID-19 may also lead to some of the long-standing messages about simple measures to reduce the spread, such as hand washing, finally becoming absorbed and more universally adopted by health workers and the public. Is it possible that regardless of the terrible threat posed by SARS-CoV-2, the increased adoption of these health protection measures may result in a reduction in the spread of other infectious diseases?","Wadoum, Raoul Emeric Guetiya; Clarke, Andrew",Pan Afr Med J,431,10

Thirty-five school aged children with at least three months of weightlifting experience were randomized to one of three training conditions: VF-PA, VF or the Control group (CONT). Subjects underwent test sessions one week before (T0) and one day after (T1) a six-session training period and a retention test session a week later (T2). During each test session, the Kinovea version 0.8.15 software measured the kinematic parameters of the snatch performance. Following distance learning sessions (T1), the VF-PA improved various kinematic parameters (i.e., barbell horizontal displacements, maximum height, looping and symmetry) compared with T0 (p < 0.5; Cohen's d = 0.58-1.1). Most of these improvements were maintained during the retention test (T2) (p<0.01, Cohen's d = 1.2-1.3) when compared withT0. However, the VF group improved only twoparameters (i.e., barbell symmetry and horizontal displacement) at T1 (p < 0.05; Cohen's d = 0.9), which were not maintained at T2. Better horizontal displacement and looping values were registered during the retention test in the VF-PA group compared with theCONT group (p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 1.49-1.52). The present findings suggest combining video feedback with pedagogical activity during the pandemic induced online coaching or physical education to improve movement learning in school aged children.","Souissi, Mohamed Abdelkader; Ammar, Achraf; Trabelsi, Omar; Glenn, Jordan M; Boukhris, Omar; Trabelsi, Khaled; Bouaziz, Bassem; Zmijewski, Piotr; Souissi, Hichem; Chikha, Anis Ben; Driss, Tarak; Chtourou, Hamdi; Hoekelmann, Anita; Souissi, Nizar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),431,24

This protein is present in a number of cell types, including those from the respiratory tract. Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the disease Covid-19, scientists found that ACE2 was also used by the new coronavirus to infect cells. This opened some interesting possibilities to explain the striking variation in risks of catching and dying from Covid-19. The best recognised of these are the much higher risk of serious illness in older than younger people, in men than women, and in those with pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. There are several ways in which the ACE2 protein might contribute to this variation. The most obvious would be if there is more ACE2, there would be more entry points for the virus to infect the cell, e.g. in older people or in men. However, the evidence for this is rather small, partly because it is not that easy to obtain representative healthy tissues. Alternatively, it could be related to ACE2 membership of a family of proteins that has one end of the protein anchored inside the cell while most of the protein protrudes from the outside of the cell which therefore can be shed when cleaved by proteases at the cell membrane. Herein we review current evidence and theories of ACE2 role on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and Covid-19 severity.","Azizan, E; Brown, M",Malays J Pathol,431,32

However, its excessive existence often leads to the destruction of human physiological mechanisms. In recent years, the developed luminescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO- are not only conducive to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of HClO/ClO- detection, but also play a crucial role in understanding the biological functions of HClO/ClO-. In addition, luminescent probe-based biological imaging for HClO/ClO- at sub-cellular resolution has become a powerful tool for biopathology and medical diagnostic research. This article reviews a variety of luminescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO-in vitro and in vivo with different design principles and mechanisms, including fluorescence, phosphorescence, and chemiluminescence.

This paper provides evidence on the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hepatocytes and its direct cytopathic activity, as well as the degree of liver damage due to drug toxicity, inflammation and hypoxia in COVID-19. A review of clinical trials has quantified liver damage through both pathology and biochemistry studies. Additionally, we briefly present the results of a study conducted in our clinic on 849 patients admitted for COVID-19 treatment, of which 31 patients had pre-existing chronic liver disease and 388 patients had values above the normal limit for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin. It was observed that patients with abnormal liver tests were significantly statistically older, had more comorbidities and had a higher percentage of unfavourable evolution (death or transfer to intensive care). The conclusion of this paper is that the main causes of liver damage are direct viral aggression, coagulation dysfunction and endothelial damage, and patients with impaired liver function develop more severe forms of COVID-19 which requires special care by a multidisciplinary team that includes a hepatologist","Baroiu, L.; Drăgănescu, M.; Anghel, L.; Dumitru, C.; Iancu, A.; Leșe, A.

We used total RNA sequencing (""meta-transcriptomics"") to reveal the full spectrum of microbes associated with paediatric ARI. Throat swabs were collected from 48 paediatric ARI patients and 7 healthy controls. Samples were subjected to meta-transcriptomics to determine the presence and abundance of viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens, and to reveal mixed infections, pathogen genotypes/subtypes, evolutionary origins, epidemiological history, and antimicrobial resistance. We identified 11 RNA viruses, 4 DNA viruses, 4 species of bacteria, and 1 fungus. While most are known to cause ARIs, others, such as echovirus 6, are rarely associated with respiratory disease. Co-infection of viruses and bacteria and of multiple viruses were commonplace (9/48), with one patient harboring 5 different pathogens, and genome sequence data revealed large intra-species diversity. Expressed resistance against eight classes of antibiotic was detected, with those for MLS, Bla, Tet, Phe at relatively high abundance.

We examined different network properties that might affect the successful dissemination by and adoption of public health messages from public health officials and health agencies. METHODS: We focused on conversations on Twitter during 3 key communication events from late January to early June of 2020. We used Netlytic, a Web-based software that collects publicly available data from social media sites such as Twitter. RESULTS: We found that the network of conversations around COVID-19 is highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected; these characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public health messages in a network. Competing conversations and misinformation can hamper risk communication efforts in a way that imperil public health. CONCLUSIONS: Looking at basic metrics might create a misleading picture of the effectiveness of risk communication efforts on social media if not analyzed within the context of the larger network. Social network analysis of conversations on social media should be an integral part of how public health officials and agencies plan, monitor, and evaluate risk communication efforts.","Pascual-Ferrá, Paola; Alperstein, Neil; Barnett, Daniel J",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,431,16

In this paper, we described a rare case of simultaneous presentation of COVID-19 with pulmonary metastasis. CASE PRESENTATION: A Persian patient with a history of chondrosarcoma presented to our clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic with a new-onset cough. He had experienced no recurrence during previous follow-up visits. Chest CT scan revealed numerous bilateral small peripheral and perilymphatic pulmonary nodules, unilateral ground-glass patch, and nodular interlobular septal thickening. Biopsy of the pulmonary nodules established pulmonary metastasis of chondrosarcoma origin, and pharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive for COVID-19.

We start by overviewing the status quo on UAV communications from an industrial standpoint, providing fresh updates from the 3GPP and detailing new 5G NR features in support of aerial devices. We then show the potential and the limitations of such features. In particular, we demonstrate how sub-6 GHz massive MIMO can successfully tackle cell selection and interference challenges, we showcase encouraging mmWave coverage evaluations in both urban and suburban/rural settings, and we examine the peculiarities of direct device-to-device communications in the sky. Moving on, we sneak a peek at next-generation UAV communications, listing some of the use cases envisioned for the 2030s. We identify the most promising 6G enablers for UAV communication, those expected to take the performance and reliability to the next level.

In this pilot study, we sought to characterize the presence of education regarding sun safety in the curricula of US public high schools. Cross-sectional survey administered to random sample stratified by state of public high schools in the US. 31 high schools from 22 states submitted survey responses (Fig. 1). Ten high schools (32.2%) provided curricula regarding sun safety. Southern high schools were less likely to provide sun safety education (p = 0.01). The lack of an association between sociodemographic characteristics of the high school and the provision of sun safety curricula suggests that the lack of sun safety education may be widespread. These findings support a call to action regarding further research to better characterize the efficacy of implementing sun safety education in high school curricula. Educational interventions designed to inform high school students about sun safety present a unique opportunity to intervene in the rising skin cancer rates in the AYA population.

Together with the quest for an effective treatment, the question of the post-infectious evolution of affected patients in healing process remains uncertain. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a high molecular weight mucin-like glycoprotein produced by type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells. Its production is raised during epithelial lesions and cellular regeneration. In COVID-19 infection, KL-6 serum levels could therefore be of interest for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study retrospectively compared KL-6 levels between a cohort of 83 COVID-19 infected patients and two other groups: healthy subjects (n = 70) on one hand, and a heterogenous group of patients suffering from interstitial lung diseases (n = 31; composed of 16 IPF, 4 sarcoidosis, 11 others) on the other hand. Demographical, clinical and laboratory indexes were collected. Our study aims to compare KL-6 levels between a COVID-19 population and healthy subjects or patients suffering from interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Ultimately, we ought to determine whether KL-6 could be a marker of disease severity and bad prognosis. RESULTS: Our results showed that serum KL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients were increased compared to healthy subjects, but to a lesser extent than in patients suffering from ILD. Increased levels of KL-6 in COVID-19 patients were associated with a more severe lung disease. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KL-6 could be a good biomarker to assess ILD severity in COVID-19 infection. Concerning the therapeutic response prediction, more studies are necessary.","Frix, A N; Schoneveld, L; Ladang, A; Henket, M; Duysinx, B; Vaillant, F; Misset, B; Moutschen, M; Louis, R; Cavalier, E; Guiot, J",Respir Res,431,16

The subject of this study was to examine the proliferation change of oral cancer cells while using the combined treatment of UVC (254 nm) with our previously developed sulfonyl chromen-4-ones (CHW09), namely UVC/CHW09. Cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage for the individual and combined treatments for UVC and/or CHW09 were examined in oral cancer Ca9-22 cells. In 24 h MTS assay, UVC (30 J/m2; UVC30), or CHW09 (25 and 50 µg/mL; namely, CHW09-25 and CHW09-50) show 54%, 59%, and 45% viability. The combined treatment (UVC30/CHW09-25 and UVC30/CHW09-50) show lower cell viability (45% and 35%). Mechanistically, UVC/CHW09 induced higher apoptosis than individual treatments and untreated control, which were supported by the evidence of flow cytometry for subG1, annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D, pancaspase and caspases 3/7 activity, and western blotting for cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover, this cleaved PARP expression was downregulated by pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. UVC/CHW09 showed higher oxidative stress than individual treatments and untreated control in terms of flow cytometry for reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial mass. Furthermore, UVC/CHW09 showed higher DNA damage than individual treatments and untreated control in terms of flow cytometry for H2A histone family member X and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine. In conclusion, combined treatment UVC/CHW09 suppresses proliferation, and promotes apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage against oral cancer cells, providing a novel application of sulfonyl chromen-4-ones in order to sensitize UVC induced proliferation inhibition for oral cancer therapy.","Wang, Sheng-Chieh; Wang, Yen-Yun; Lin, Li-Ching; Chang, Meng-Yang; Yuan, Shyng-Shiou F; Tang, Jen-Yang; Chang, Hsueh-Wei",,431,33

Methods: Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data from Regensburg (city/county) on age and initial symptoms as reported during case investigation for containment. Observed periods: March 7, 2020 to June 6, 2020 and August 12, 2020 to October 9, 2020. Results: The proportion of asymptomatic persons who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 in the second period was 55% (286 of 520 cases), whereas during the first wave from March to June 2020 this percentage was 14.4% (169 of 1,170 cases). A comparison of typical symptoms shows that the most common symptoms of COVID-19 in the first wave (cough, fever and generally feeling ill) were less often reported in the second period: cough 14% vs. 42%, fever 17% vs. 38%, general signs of illness 14% vs. 22% in the second vs. first period, respectively overall cases were younger in the second period, the median age of asymptomatic cases was comparable in both periods. The case fatality rate for the first period was 2.1%, in the second it was 0.2%. Discussion: The epidemiological situation in the second period is different from that during the first wave. We observed a considerable proportion of questionable cases in August/September 2020 (asymptomatic cases, high ct values, often only detection of one gene). False positive cases/non-contagious cases have to be taken into account for this period. On-demand or free-of-charge testing for asymptomatic persons will lower the positive predictive value of tests and place a high burden on finite capacities.","Lampl, Benedikt M J; Salzberger, Bernd",GMS Hyg Infect Control,431,15

We now report the comparative performance of five real-time diagnostic assays. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from persons seeking a diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Lagos, Nigeria. The comparison was performed on the same negative, low, and high-positive sample set, with viral RNA extracted using the Qiagen Viral RNA Kit. All five assays are one-step reverse transcriptase real-time PCR assays. Testing was done according to each assay's manufacturer instructions for use using real-time PCR platforms. 63 samples were tested using the five qPCR assays, comprising of 15 negative samples, 15 positive samples (Ct = 16-30; one Ct = 35), and 33 samples with Tib MolBiol E-gene Ct value ranging from 36-41. All assays detected all high positive samples correctly. Three assays correctly identified all negative samples while two assays each failed to correctly identify one different negative sample. The consistent detection of positive samples at different Ct/Cq values gives an indication of when to repeat testing and/or establish more stringent in-house cut-off value. The varied performance of different diagnostic assays, mostly with emergency use approvals, for a novel virus is expected. Comparative assays' performance reported may guide laboratories to determine both their repeat testing Ct/Cq range and/or cut-off value.","Onwuamah, Chika Kingsley; Okwuraiwe, Azuka Patrick; Salu, Olumuyiwa B; Shaibu, Joseph O; Ndodo, Nnaemeka; Amoo, Samuel O; Okoli, Leona C; Ige, Fehintola A; Ahmed, Rahaman A; Bankole, Munir Akinwale; Sokei, Judith O; Mutiu, Bamidele Paul; Ayorinde, James; Saka, Babatunde Akeem; Obiekea, Celestina; Mba, Nwando; Adegbola, Richard A; Omilabu, Sunday; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Salako, Babatunde Lawal; Audu, Rosemary",PLoS One,431,22

Based on early observations among healthcare utilization on stroke and other healthcare services, we hypothesized that there would be a persistent significant decline in AIS patients presenting to hospitals as the pandemic has progressed for over a year. Method TriNetX, a large research network, is used to collect real-time electronic medical data. Data on utilization of acute ischemic stroke service was collected for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 for variables including overall stroke volume and the number of patients that received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Result We found a 13.2-15.4% decrease in total number of AIS patients in 2020 (n 77231) compared with the years 2018 and 2019 (n 88948 and 91270 respectively, p&lt;0.001). In the year 2020 Stroke volume was significantly lower in Q4 comparing to Q1 (Q1 vs Q4, p&lt;0.01, while there were no significant differences in stroke volume between Quarters 2, 3, and 4 in 2020 (Q2 vs Q3, p=0.39, Q2 vs Q4, p=0.61, Q3 vs Q4, p=0.18). The Proportion of patients receiving tPA in 2020 was significantly lower compared to prior years (5.4% in 2020 vs 6.4% in 2018 and 6.0% in 2019, p&lt;0.01), however, the proportion of patients receiving MT was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2018 (0.024 vs 0.022, p&lt;0.01). Conclusion Despite significant alteration in practices to optimize healthcare delivery and mitigate the collateral impact of the pandemic on care for other conditions, a persistent decline in AIS volumes remains. Delayed presentation, fear-of-contagion, reallocation, and poor availability of health care resources are potential contributors. Prospective evaluation and further investigation for these trends is needed.","Sheng, Sen Wang Xixi Tommee Carolina Gil Arulprakash Naren Kamran Mudassar Jasti Madhu Yadala Sisira Brown Aliza Onteddu Sanjeeva Nalleballe Krishna","Brain, Behavior, &amp; Immunity - Health",431,20

The reason for this proposal is the usual scientific argument claiming that these trials are the most efficient method to obtain reliable results, and individuals in these countries will continue to get the local standard of care, meaning no vaccination, and thus participants are not being left worse off. We refute this argument on two counts. First the global equity and justice issue, that the scarcity of vaccines in most countries is created by the rich nations that have hoarded vaccines. Second, the science versus research ethics issue, that there are valid scientific methods like non-inferiority trials which can give reliable results, and that applying a standard of care imposed by rich nations is both unethical and possibly exploitative. Thus, we feel that the WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group is wrong in proposing to continue placebo-controlled Covid-19 vaccine trials.","Ahmad, Aasim; Dhrolia, Murtaza F",Indian J Med Ethics,431,16

Unfortunately, no effective drugs or vaccines have been reported yet. The main protease (MPRO) remains the most validated pharmacological target for the design and discovery of inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to find a prospective natural scaffold as an inhibitor for MPRO main protease in SARS-CoV-2 and compare it with repurposed antiviral drugs lopinavir and nelflinavir. METHODS: Natural compound libraries were screened for potential scaffold against MPRO main protease. Molecular dynamics simulation, MM-GBSA and principle component analyses of enzyme-ligand complexes were carried out with the top-ranking hits and compared with the repurposed antiviral drugs lopinavir and nelfinavir. RESULTS: The structure-based virtual screening indicated phenylbenzopyrone of flavonoids as one of the top-ranking scaffolds that have the potential to inhibit the main protease with O-glycosidic form performing better than corresponding aglyconic form. Simulation studies indicated that glycosidic form of flavonoid as more suitable inhibitor with compounds rutin, procyanidin B6, baicalin and galloylquercetin, demonstrating high affinity and stability, and rutin emerging as one of the best candidate compound. Interestingly, rutin was reported to have inhibitory activity against similar protease (3Cprotease of enterovirus A71) as well as implicated in lung fibrosis. CONCLUSION: The present study displaying flavonoids, possessing a potential scaffold for inhibiting main protease activity for all betacoronavirus is an attempt to provide new and safe drug leads within a reasonably short period.","Potshangbam, Angamba Meetei; Nongdam, Potshangbam; Kumar, A Kiran; Rathore, R S",Curr pharm. biotechnol,431,2

The COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba was addressed through an integrated all-society action plan that to date has been largely successful with a low incidence of COVID-19 and mortality rates several-fold lower than worldwide averages. Despite downsizing many other health components all oncology services were maintained. Between March 11, when the first case was detected, until July 23, Cuba reported 2,449 cases of COVID-19 that included 28 (1.14%) with a diagnosis of cancer. Distribution among cancer diagnoses did not deviate from that expected according to cancer epidemiology in Cuba. However, although the probability of getting infected with the coronavirus for a cancer patient (0.012%), was not higher than that of the general population (0.020%), 9 of the 28 (32.1%) died, a lethality higher than that of COVID-19 patients without cancer (3.5%) a difference that is statistically significant (P< .001). We argue that going forward scientific research on the relationship of aging, inflammation and cancer, including identification of biomarkers and the development of novel therapeutic interventions, should become one of the priorities in the post-COVID agenda of both oncologists and infectious disease scientists.","Rubio, Maria Caridad; Sanchez, Lizet; Abreu-Ruíz, Gisela; Bermejo-Bencomo, Walkiria; Crombet, Tania; Lage, Agustin",Semin Oncol,431,31

Despite the sensitivity of habits to context changes, little remains known about the influence of a context change on the interplay between PA habits and behaviours. We investigated the evolution of PA habits amidst the spring COVID-19 lockdown, a major context change. Moreover, we examined the association of PA behaviours and autonomous motivation with this evolution. DESIGN: Three-wave observational longitudinal design. METHODS: PA habits, behaviours, and autonomous motivation were collected through online surveys in 283 French and Swiss participants. Variables were self-reported with reference to three time-points: before-, mid-, and end-lockdown. RESULTS: Mixed effect modelling revealed a decrease in PA habits from before- to mid-lockdown, especially among individuals with strong before-lockdown habits. Path analysis showed that before-lockdown PA habits were not associated with mid-lockdown PA behaviours (ß = -.02, p = .837), while mid-lockdown PA habits were positively related to end-lockdown PA behaviours (ß = .23, p = .021). Autonomous motivation was directly associated with PA habits (ps < .001) and withto before- and mid-lockdown PA behaviours (ps < .001) (but not with end-lockdown PA behaviours) and did not moderate the relations between PA behaviours and habits (ps > .072). CONCLUSION: PA habits were altered, and their influence on PA behaviours was impeded during the COVID-19 lockdown. Engagement in PA behaviours and autonomous motivation helped in counteracting PA habits disruption.","Maltagliati, Silvio; Rebar, Amanda; Fessler, Layan; Forestier, Cyril; Sarrazin, Philippe; Chalabaev, Aïna; Sander, David; Sivaramakrishnan, Hasmini; Orsholits, Dan; Boisgontier, Matthieu P; Ntoumanis, Nikos; Gardner, Benjamin; Cheval, Boris",Br. j. health psychol,431,1

Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research on the COVID-19 impact on people with dementia and their care partners. OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter, the purpose of this study is to understand the experiences of COVID-19 for people with dementia and their care partners. METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 and dementia using the GetOldTweets application in Python from February 15 to September 7, 2020. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the tweets. RESULTS: From the 5063 tweets analyzed with line-by-line coding, we identified 4 main themes including (1) separation and loss; (2) COVID-19 confusion, despair, and abandonment; (3) stress and exhaustion exacerbation; and (4) unpaid sacrifices by formal care providers. CONCLUSIONS: There is an imminent need for governments to rethink using a one-size-fits-all response to COVID-19 policy and use a collaborative approach to support people with dementia.

Our study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and provide predictors of mortality for young adults with severe COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 77 young adults with confirmed severe COVID-19 were recruited retrospectively at Tongji Hospital. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records. The prognostic effects of variables were analyzed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort, non-survivors showed higher incidence of dyspnea and co-existing laboratory abnormalities, compared with young survivals in severe COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lymphopenia, elevated level of d-dimer, hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-CTnI) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were independent predictors of mortality in young adults with severe COVID-19. Further analysis showed that severely young adults with two or more factors abnormalities above would be more prone to death. The similar predictive effect of above four factors had been observed in all-age patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia, elevated level of d-dimer, hs-CTnI and hs-CRP predicted clinical outcomes of young adults with severe COVID-19.","Lu, Yanjiao; Huang, Zhenli; Wang, Meijia; Tang, Kun; Wang, Shanshan; Gao, Pengfei; Xie, Jungang; Wang, Tao; Zhao, Jianping",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,431,24

Tanreqing Capsule (TRQC) was used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of TRQC in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 82 patients who had laboratory-confirmed mild and moderate COVID-19; patients were treated with TRQC in one designated hospital. The treatment and control groups consisted of 25 and 57 cases, respectively. The treatment group was given TRQC orally three times a day, three pills each time, in addition to conventional Western medicine treatments which were also administered to the control group. The clinical efficacy indicators, such as the negative conversion time of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid, the negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid, the duration of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid, and the improvement in the level of immune indicators such as T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD45) were monitored. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients in the treatment group, compared to the control group, had a shorter negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid (4 vs. 9 days, P = 0.047) and a shorter interval of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid (0 vs. 2 days, P = 0.042). The level of CD3+ T cells increased in the treatment group compared to the control group ([317.09 ± 274.39] vs. [175.02 ± 239.95] counts/µL, P = 0.030). No statistically significant differences were detected in the median improvement in levels of CD4+ T cells (173 vs. 107 counts/µL, P = 0.208) and CD45+ T cells (366 vs. 141 counts/µL, P = 0.117) between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in the negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid and the duration of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid were identified in the treatment group as compared to the control group, illustrating the potential therapeutic benefits of using TRQC as a complement to conventional medicine in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19. The underlying mechanism may be related to the improved levels of the immune indicator CD3+ T cells.","Zhang, Xing; Xue, Yan; Chen, Xuan; Wu, Jia-Min; Su, Zi-Jian; Sun, Meng; Liu, Lu-Jiong; Zhang, Yi-Bao; Zhang, Yi-le; Xu, Gui-Hua; Shi, Miao-Yan; Song, Xiu-Ming; Lu, Yun-Fei; Chen, Xiao-Rong; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Qi",J.

This study evaluated the socio-demographic characteristics, as well as residual spatial correlation in pregnancy termination among Bangladeshi women. METHODS: Secondary data was obtained from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey for the survey year 2014. Data included 17,863 samples of ever-married women between the ages of 15-49 years, which is a national representative sample in Bangladesh. Bayesian spatial logistic regression was used to assess the associations between socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy termination. We flexibly modeled the non-linear effects of the continuous covariates while accounting for residual spatial correlation at the district level. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that about 19% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported ever had a pregnancy terminated. The risk of pregnancy termination was higher among women who had been working, had a higher wealth index, were in a conjugal relationship, had no children, were older and started their cohabitation earlier. Residual spatial patterns revealed the areas at a higher risk of pregnancy termination, including Panchagarh, Habiganj, and Sylhet after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of pregnancy termination remains considerably high in Bangladesh. The study revealed significant associations of women's age at survey time, age at first cohabitation, occupational status, socio-economic status, marital status and the total number of children ever born with reporting having a history of terminated pregnancy among Bangladeshi ever-married women. The identified socio-demographic characteristics and districts at an increased likelihood of pregnancy termination can inform localized intervention and prevention strategies to improve the reproductive healthcare of women in Bangladesh.","Zahan, Rifat; Feng, Cindy Xin",BMC Public Health,431,2

METHODS: We used mass spectrometry to analyse a selection of RNA-modifying enzymes and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in carotid atherosclerotic lesion samples representing early and advanced stages of atherosclerosis as compared to non-atherosclerotic arteries from healthy controls. FINDINGS: (i) the detection of different levels of several enzymes involved in methylations occurring in rRNA and mRNA; (ii) these findings included changes in the levels of methyltransferases ('writers'), binding proteins ('readers') and demethylases ('erasers') during atherosclerosis as compared to non-atherosclerotic control arteries, with generally the most prominent differences in samples from early atherosclerotic lesions; and (iii) these changes were accompanied by a marked downregulation of m6A in rRNA, the most abundant and well-studied modification in mRNA with a wide range of effects on cell biology. INTERPRETATION: We show for the first time that RNA-modifying enzymes and the well-studied RNA modification m6A are differentially regulated in atherosclerotic lesions, which potentially could help creating new prognostic and treatment strategies.","Quiles-Jiménez, Ana; Gregersen, Ida; Mittelstedt Leal de Sousa, Mirta; Abbas, Azhar; Kong, Xiang Yi; Alseth, Ingrun; Holm, Sverre; Dahl, Tuva B; Skagen, Karolina; Skjelland, Mona; Aukrust, Pål; Bjørås, Magnar; Halvorsen, Bente",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,431,7

Simple metrics for characterizing volatility in blood components within the hospital transfusion service have not been established. METHODS: We measured the volatility of demand for blood services at a large academic urban general hospital over a 6-month period from July 2019 to December 2019 prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. RESULTS: Among 4416 consecutive hours assessed, there were 693 h (16%) with spikes in demand for blood components with a mean (sd) of 3.8 (2.7) spikes/day. Spikes in demand were frequently clustered. The median number of hours between spikes differed by shift (6 h for days; 3 h for evenings; 3 h for nights). The percentage of shift hours with demand spikes also differed (9% day; 19% evening; 18% night). During the study, 32,447 components were distributed to 19,431 patients. Of these, 11,819 components (36%) were distributed during hours of peak demand. Hours with a simultaneous spike in both component demand and patient demand occurred in 5% of hours or approximately once each day. CONCLUSION: Demand for transfusion services was highly volatile in an unpredictable fashion. We provide an approach that could be used to benchmark spikes in demand for blood services at hospitals. Consideration of the frequency, unpredictability, and magnitude of spikes in demand may be relevant for hemovigilance programs and for strategies to determine the laboratory staffing needed for good patient care.","Walter, 039; Sunny039,; Dzik,",Transfusion,431,20

METHODS: To overcome the insolubility of lopinavir/ritonavir in water, ethanol and glycerol have been used as additional excipients. To define the best excipient proportion and best preparation method, three different formulations (ethanol 7.1-7.5%, glycerol 6-15%, and water) and two different preparation procedures (two step vs one step) have been studied. Each formulation has been compared with Kaletra oral solution (lopinavir 80 mg/mL, ritonavir 20 mg/mL) by NMR spectroscopy. API content and stability were measured. RESULTS: The presence of ethanol and glycerol as co-solvents is crucial both to improve solubilisation and promote the stability of the oral form. In the two-step preparation method, when crushed tablets were first dispersed in the ethanol/glycerol mixture and then in water, the content of solubilised active ingredients was equal or only slightly lower than the standard Kaletra (range 89-100%). The one-step method provided a comparable API content (65%) to that obtained by using water as the sole dispersing medium. CONCLUSIONS: The two-step setup method with final 7.1% ethanol and 11% glycerol concentration is an efficient procedure for extemporaneous preparation of lopinavir/ritonavir liquid formulations from crushed tablets. The method combines simplicity of preparation and reconstitution in the hospital ward with good solubilisation, comparable to the commercial solution, and stability of active ingredients over time.","Desideri, Ielizza; Martinelli, Cristina; Ciuti, Stefania; Uccello Barretta, Gloria; Balzano, Federica",,431,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the prevention strategy, which adopted healthcare staff protective measures, including patient triage and correct usage of personal preventive equipment, was evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing. Patients who visited the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, between January 31 and March 1 (lockdown period) and March 2 and April 27 (reopening period) in 2020 and in the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Patients' diagnosis, age, gender, and several undergoing aerosol-generating procedures during the study period were collected from the hospital's database. Corresponding data were compared year-on-year (2020-on-2019). A total of 757 hospital staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing on April 28-29, 2020. RESULTS: During the lockdown and reopening period in 2020, the number of hospital visits was dramatically decreased to about 6% and 58%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. However, emergency visits were increased 16- and 6.4-fold. A total of at least 6654 patients (13.58%) underwent aerosol-generating procedures during the study period in the year 2020. All hospital staff were negative according to SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing (IgG, IgM) data. CONCLUSION: During the study period in 2020, the total number of hospital visits dramatically reduced but emergency visits significantly increased. The prevention strategy implemented successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection spread among healthcare workers in a dental hospital. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prevention strategy indicated patient triage and how to adopt preventive measures for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread among healthcare workers. These data can be used as a reference for other sectors suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Ling; Xu, Yuedan; Jin, Xinyang; Shi, Zhiwei; Wu, Mengting; Xu, Ning; Yu, Xuefen; Deng, Shuli; Zhang, Kai; Zhang, Liefen; Hannig, Matthias; Chen, Qianming; Fu, Baiping",Clin. oral investig,431,16

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Although RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for detection of COVID-19, CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the therapeutic effect of COVID-19. Diagnosis and localization of COVID-19 on CT images using deep learning can provide quantitative auxiliary information for doctors. This article proposes a novel network with multi-receptive field attention module to diagnose COVID-19 on CT images. This attention module includes three parts, a pyramid convolution module (PCM), a multi-receptive field spatial attention block (SAB), and a multi-receptive field channel attention block (CAB). The PCM can improve the diagnostic ability of the network for lesions of different sizes and shapes. The role of SAB and CAB is to focus the features extracted from the network on the lesion area to improve the ability of COVID-19 discrimination and localization. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on two datasets. The accuracy rate of 97.12%, specificity of 96.89%, and sensitivity of 97.21% are achieved by the proposed network on DTDB dataset provided by the Beijing Ditan Hospital Capital Medical University. Compared with other state-of-the-art attention modules, the proposed method achieves better result. As for the public COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 dataset, 95.16% for accuracy, 95.6% for F1-score and 99.01% for AUC are obtained. The proposed network can effectively assist doctors in the diagnosis of COVID-19 CT images.","Ma, Xia; Zheng, Bingbing; Zhu, Yu; Yu, Fuli; Zhang, Rixin; Chen, Budong",Optik (Stuttg),431,24

Care home residents and staff, frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were vaccinated first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation evaluation of two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of advanced age. METHODS: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression analysis, controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and care residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care residency status. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 39557. FINDINGS: Between Dec 18, 2020, and Feb 26, 2021, 466 adults were eligible (144 test-positive and 322 test-negative). 18 (13%) of 135 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 90 (34%) of 269 controls received one dose of BNT162b2. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 71·4% (95% CI 46·5-90·6). Nine (25%) of 36 people with COVID-19 infection and 53 (59%) of 90 controls received one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 80·4% (95% CI 36·4-94·5). When BNT162b2 effectiveness analysis was restricted to the period covered by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the estimate was 79·3% (95% CI 47·0-92·5). INTERPRETATION: One dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 resulted in substantial risk reductions of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in people aged at least 80 years.

There is limited data on pathogenesis and the cellular responses of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to determine the variation of metabolites between healthy control and COVID-19 via the untargeted metabolomics method. Serum samples were obtained from 44 COVID-19 patients and 41 healthy controls. Untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed by LC/Q-TOF/MS method. Data acquisition, classification, and identification were achieved by the METLIN database and XCMS. Significant differences were determined between patients and healthy controls in terms of purine, glutamine, leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and glutathione metabolisms. Down regulations were determined in R-S lactoglutathione and glutamine. Up-regulations were detected in hypoxanthine, inosine, and LTD4. Identified metabolites indicate roles for purine, glutamine, LTD4, and glutathione metabolisms in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19. The use of selective leukotriene D4 receptor antagonists, targeting purinergic signaling as a therapeutic approach and glutamine supplementation may decrease the severity and mortality of COVID-19.

To increase political legitimacy and accountability, public support is important. This study examines what criteria beyond medical need are deemed important to be perceived of priority COVID-19 healthcare access. METHOD: Two conjoint experiments about priority over ICU treatment and early COVID-19 vaccination were implemented in a probability-based sample of 1461 respondents representative of the Netherlands. Respondents were asked who should receive treatment out of two fictitious healthcare claimants that differed in in age, weight, complying with corona policy measures, and occupation, all randomly assigned. Average marginal coefficient effects are estimated to assess the relative importance of the attributes; attributes were interacted with relevant respondent characteristics to find whether consensus exists in this relative ranking. RESULTS: The Dutch penalize those not complying with coronavirus policy measures, and the obese, but prioritize those employed in 'crucial' sectors. For these conditions, there is consensus among the population. For age, young people are prioritized for ICU treatment, while the middle-aged are given priority over a vaccine, with younger respondents favoring healthcare for elderly claimants, while older respondents favor support for young cohorts. CONCLUSION: People who have no control over their social risk and are able to reciprocate to society are considered as more deserving of priority of COVID-19 healthcare. Our findings provide fair support for the implemented ethical guidelines about ICU-treatment and COVID-19 vaccines.","Reeskens, Tim; Roosma, Femke; Wanders, Evelien",BMC Public Health,431,25

Our aim was to estimate the positivity rate of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing among people admitted to hospital without symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Alberta, Canada. METHODS: Between Apr. 9 and May 24, 2020, we screened for COVID-19 symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all consecutive adult patients (&#8805; 18 yr) admitted via emergency department to 3 Alberta hospitals. We summarized the parameters of the epidemic curve and assessed the performance of symptom screening versus RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: The study period encompassed Alberta's initial epidemic curve, with peak active cases per 100 000 of 71.4 (0.07%) on Apr. 30, 2020, and 14.7 and 14.6 at the beginning (Apr. 9, 2020) and end (May 24, 2020), respectively. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection (64.9% throat and 35.1% nasopharyngeal swabs) was done on 3375 adults (mean age 51, standard deviation 21, yr; 51.5% men). None of the asymptomatic patients (n = 1814) tested positive, and 71 of those with symptoms tested positive (n = 1561; 4.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6%-5.7%). Sensitivity of symptom screening (v. RT-PCR) was 100% (95% CI 95%-100%), and specificity was 55% (95% CI 53%-57%). Posttest probabilities for prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from 1.5 to 14 times the peak prevalence of active cases during the study did not change when we assumed lower sensitivity (92%). INTERPRETATION: In a region with low disease prevalence where protocolized symptom assessment was in place during the admission process, we did not identify people admitted to hospital without COVID-19 symptoms who were RT-PCR positive. There may not be additive benefit to universal testing of asymptomatic patients on hospital admission in a setting of low pretest probability and strong public health containment.","Ravani, Pietro; Saxinger, Lynora; Chandran, Uma; Fonseca, Kevin; Murphy, Stephanie; Lang, Eddy; McDougall, Laura; Manns, Braden",CMAJ Open,431,1

Drawing on critical insights from science and technology studies, we maintain that the rise of digital health technologies has been catalyzed by broad shifts in global health governance that have expanded the role of market forces in public health and a unique set of political and economic crises that have accelerated the adoption of digital technologies—often under the guise of appeals to technological innovation to address “unprecedented” crises.

It is arduous for such methods to track targets with various appearance variations. To address this limitation, another type of methods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into equal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is inferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential limitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for tracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In this paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are discriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency mining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a saliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies together to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar and the search image for state estimation. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers.","Zhou, Zikun; Pei, Wenjie; Li, Xin; Wang, Hongpeng; Zheng, Feng; He, Zhenyu",,431,21

We found that cotton masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks all have a protective effect with respect to the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols of SARS-CoV-2 and that the protective efficiency was higher when masks were worn by a virus spreader. Importantly, medical masks (surgical masks and even N95 masks) were not able to completely block the transmission of virus droplets/aerosols even when completely sealed. Our data will help medical workers understand the proper use and performance of masks and determine whether they need additional equipment to protect themselves from infected patients.IMPORTANCE Airborne simulation experiments showed that cotton masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks provide some protection from the transmission of infective SARS-CoV-2 droplets/aerosols; however, medical masks (surgical masks and even N95 masks) could not completely block the transmission of virus droplets/aerosols even when sealed.","Ueki, Hiroshi; Furusawa, Yuri; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Imai, Masaki; Kabata, Hiroki; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro",MSphere,431,16

Thus, there is urgent requirement of novel treatment strategies to combat against these emerging respiratory viral infections. Nanocarriers come under the umbrella of nanotechnology and offer numerous benefits compared to traditional dosage forms. Further, unique physicochemical properties (size, shape and surface charge) of nanocarriers provide additional advantage for targeted delivery. This review discusses in detail about the respiratory viruses, their transmission mode and cell invasion pathways, survival strategies, available therapies, and nanocarriers for the delivery of therapeutics.

This report discusses the key elements of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 that can be readily treated: viral entry, the immune system and inflammation, and the cytokine storm. It is shown that the essential nutrients zinc, &#969;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D and magnesium provide the ideal combination for prevention and treatment of COVID-19: prevention of SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells, prevention of proliferation of SARS-CoV-2, inhibition of excessive inflammation, improved control of the regulation of the immune system, inhibition of the cytokine storm, and reduction in the effects of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated non-communicable diseases. It is emphasized that the non-communicable diseases associated with COVID-19 are inherently more prevalent in the elderly than the young, and that the maintenance of sufficiency of zinc, &#969;-3 PUFAs, vitamin D and magnesium is essential for the elderly to prevent the occurrence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases and cancer. Annual checking of levels of these essential nutrients is recommended for those over 65 years of age, together with appropriate adjustments in their intake, with these services and supplies being at government cost.

People with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may frequently require treatment with psychotropic medications, but are at the same time at higher risk for safety issues because of the complex underlying medical condition and the potential interaction with medical treatments. METHODS: In order to produce evidence-based practical recommendations on the optimal management of psychotropic medications in people with COVID-19, an international, multi-disciplinary working group was established. The methodology of the WHO Rapid Advice Guidelines in the context of a public health emergency and the principles of the AGREE statement were followed. Available evidence informing on the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, infective, hemostatic, and consciousness alterations related to the use of psychotropic medications, and drug-drug interactions between psychotropic and medical treatments used in people with COVID-19, was reviewed and discussed by the working group. RESULTS: All classes of psychotropic medications showed potentially relevant safety risks for people with COVID-19. A set of practical recommendations was drawn in order to inform frontline clinicians on the assessment of the anticipated risk of psychotropic-related unfavorable events, and the possible actions to take in order to effectively manage this risk, such as when it is appropriate to avoid, withdraw, switch, or adjust the dose of the medication. CONCLUSIONS: The present evidence-based recommendations will improve the quality of psychiatric care in people with COVID-19, allowing an appropriate management of the medical condition without worsening the psychiatric condition and vice versa.","Ostuzzi, Giovanni; Papola, Davide; Gastaldon, Chiara; Schoretsanitis, Georgios; Bertolini, Federico; Amaddeo, Francesco; Cuomo, Alessandro; Emsley, Robin; Fagiolini, Andrea; Imperadore, Giuseppe; Kishimoto, Taishiro; Michencigh, Giulia; Nosé, Michela; Purgato, Marianna; Dursun, Serdar; Stubbs, Brendon; Taylor, David; Thornicroft, Graham; Ward, Philip B; Hiemke, Christoph; Correll, Christoph U; Barbui, Corrado",BMC Med,431,6

An appraisal from New York city,18.785856,6.379384,2020,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients frequently develop cardiopulmonary system complications such as acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the mechanism by which TBI causes ALI/ARDS is not fully understood. Here, we used a severe TBI model to examine the effects of a low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, on inflammasome activation and lung injury damage. We investigated whether enoxaparin inhibits ALI and inflammasome signaling protein expression in the brain and lungs after TBI in mice. C57/BL6 mice were subjected to severe TBI and were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin 30 min after injury. Lung and brain tissue were collected 24 h post-TBI and were analyzed by immunoblotting for expression of the inflammasome proteins, caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1ß. In addition, lung tissue was collected for histological analysis to determine ALI scoring and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration post-injury. Our data show that severe TBI induces increased expression of inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1ß in the brain and lungs of mice after injury. Treatment with enoxaparin attenuated inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs 24 h after injury. Enoxaparin significantly decreased ALI score as well as neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in lungs at 24 h after injury. This study demonstrates that enoxaparin attenuates ALI and inhibits inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs after TBI. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibition of the neural-respiratory inflammasome axis that is activated after TBI may have therapeutic potential.","Kerr, Nadine A; de Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo; Weaver, Cailey; Dietrich, W Dalton; Ahmed, Tahir; Keane, Robert W",J. neurotrama,431,21

METHODS: Ten sound, extracted human premolars were selected and submitted to occlusal tooth wear simulation in 0.5-mm steps (0/0.5/1.0/1.5 mm). At each step, enamel thickness on the buccal cusp tips was evaluated using cross-polarization optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and micro-computed tomography (µ-CT). The occlusal surface of each premolar was also scanned at each step using a 3D digital intraoral scanner, followed by morphological characterization using standard topography attributes (Slope, Relief, RFI, OPCr). Repeated measures ANOVA assessed differences in simulated wear levels for the µ-CT and CP-OCT data as well as the topography values. Correlations were also calculated between the µ-CT/CP-OCT and topography data RESULTS: : Significant differences were observed for enamel thickness at each simulation wear stage, for both CP-OCT (p < 0.001) and µ-CT (p < 0.001), with good agreement between methods (intraclass correlation: 0.89). For topography analysis, as wear increased, the average Slope, RFI, and Relief values decreased, and average OPCr values increased, with more significant differences shown for Slope. Slope showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations with CP-OCT. OPCr showed significant negative correlations with µ-CT, and CP-OCT (p < 0.05). RFI and Relief were not correlated with either µ-CT or CP-OCT (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the potential of PS-OCT for measuring enamel thickness changes in the cusp tips of the occlusal surface. Similarly, conventional intraoral scanners can serve effectively for monitoring overall tooth wear when combined with dental topographic analyses of resultant point clouds.","Alwadai, Ghadeer S; Roberts, Grace; Ungar, Peter S; González-Cabezas, Carlos; Lippert, Frank; Diefenderfer, Kim E; Eckert, George J; Hara, Anderson T",J Dent,431,10

Although still debated, an increase in D-dimer has been proposed as a first-line hemostasis test associated with thromboembolic risk and unfavorable prognosis. We aim to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the association between thrombin generation parameters and the inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, as well as their prognostic value in COVID-19 patients. A total of 127 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 24 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative pneumonia and 12 healthy subjects were included. Clinical characteristics, thrombin generation triggered by tissue factor with and without soluble thrombomodulin, and also by silica, as well as other biochemical parameters were assessed. Despite the frequent use of heparin, COVID-19 patients had similar thrombin generation to healthy controls. In COVID-19 patients, the thrombin generation lag-time positively correlated with markers of cell lysis (LDH), inflammation (CRP, IL-6) and coagulation (D-dimer), while the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) inversely correlated with D-dimer and LDH, and positively correlated with fibrinogen levels. Patients with more prolonged lag-time and decreased ETP had higher peak ISTH-DIC scores, and had more severe disease (vascular events and death). The ROC curve and Kaplan Meier estimate indicated that the D-dimer/ETP ratio was associated with in-hospital mortality (HR 2.5; p = 0.006), and with the occurrence of major adverse events (composite end-point of vascular events and death) (HR 2.38; p = 0.004). The thrombin generation ETP and lag-time variables correlate with thromboinflammatory markers, and the D-dimer/ETP ratio can predict major adverse events in COVID-19.","de la Morena-Barrio, María Eugenia; Bravo-Pérez, Carlos; Miñano, Antonia; de la Morena-Barrio, Belén; Fernandez-Perez, María Piedad; Bernal, Enrique; Gómez-Verdu, José Miguel; Herranz, María Teresa; Vicente, Vicente; Corral, Javier; Lozano, María Luisa",Sci Rep,431,29

This work proposes deep CNN based multi-phase mitosis detection framework ""MP-MitDet"" for mitotic nuclei identification in breast cancer histopathological images. The workflow constitutes: (1) label-refiner, (2) tissue-level mitotic region selection, (3) blob analysis, and (4) cell-level refinement. We developed an automatic label-refiner to represent weak labels with semi-sematic information for training of deep CNNs. A deep instance-based detection and segmentation model is used to explore probable mitotic regions on tissue patches. More probable regions are screened based on blob area and then analysed at cell-level by developing a custom CNN classifier ""MitosRes-CNN"" to filter false mitoses. The performance of the proposed ""MitosRes-CNN"" is compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs that are adapted to cell-level discrimination through cross-domain transfer learning and by adding task-specific layers. The performance of the proposed framework shows good discrimination ability in terms of F-score (0.75), recall (0.76), precision (0.71) and area under the precision-recall curve (0.78) on challenging TUPAC16 dataset.

The target of neutralising antibodies is usually located in the Envelope protein on the viral surface, which mediates cell entry. As such, presentation of the Envelope protein on a lentiviral particle represents a convenient alternative to handling of a potentially high containment virus or for those viruses with no established cell culture system. The flexibility, relative safety and, in most cases, ease of production of lentiviral pseudotypes, have led to their use in serological assays for many applications such as the evaluation of candidate vaccines, screening and characterization of anti-viral therapeutics, and sero-surveillance. Above all, the speed of production of the lentiviral pseudotypes, once the envelope sequence is published, makes them important tools in the response to viral outbreaks, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of the serological applications of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, with a brief discussion on their production and batch quality analysis.

Among these, we identified 19 TFs that are targets of FDA approved drugs. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs and 25 drugs combinations on inflammatory cytokine production, which revealed two drugs that inhibited cytokine production and numerous combinations that show synergistic efficacy in downregulating cytokine production. Further studies of these candidate repurposable drugs could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients.","Santoso, C. S.; Li, Z.; Rottenberg, J. T.; Liu, X.; Shen, V.

This study included 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed to have COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission. Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs); the other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and were defined as asymptomatic patients (APs). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of APs (39.0, interquartile range (IQR) 37.5-39.5) was significantly higher than that of APIs (34.5, IQR 32.2-37.0), indicating a lower viral load in APs. However, the duration of viral shedding remained similar in the two groups (7 days, IQR 5-14 days vs. 8 days, IQR 5-16 days). The study findings demonstrated that although APs with COVID-19 have a lower viral load, they still have certain period of viral shedding, which suggests the possibility of transmission during their asymptomatic period. Further longitudinal surveillance of these asymptomatic cases via virus nucleic acid testing are warranted.","Zhou, Rui; Li, Furong; Chen, Fengjuan; Liu, Huamin; Zheng, Jiazhen; Lei, Chunliang; Wu, Xianbo",Int J Infect Dis,431,15

STUDY DESIGN: We performed an observational retrospective review of patients younger than 18 years old seen in a New York City pediatric ED from March 7th to May 6th 2020, and during the same time period in 2018 and 2019. Demographics, visit details, diagnoses, and dispositions were compared. Validated algorithms were utilized to create practical diagnosis groupings and to determine the probability of a visit requiring emergent evaluation. RESULTS: ED visits during the pandemic decreased by 56% to an average daily census of 67 patients, from an anticipated 152. Admission rates rose from 13.3% to 17.4% (p<0.001), and the proportion of triage Emergency Severity Index level 1 and 2 patients increased by 23.7% (p<0.001). Non-emergent visits dropped from 32.3% to 27.5% (p<0.001). Several common, often low-acuity diagnoses saw disproportionate reductions in visits including headache, chest pain, and minor injuries. Concerningly, visits for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or self-harm increased by 100% (p<0.001) and visits for evaluating abuse or neglect decreased by 89% (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric ED utilization substantially deceased during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, but left relatively higher patient acuity. Healthcare systems in early epicenters must also prepare for the disproportionate impact a pandemic has on the most vulnerable pediatric patients, particularly those at risk for self-harm or abuse.","Sokoloff, William C; Krief, William I; Giusto, Kimberly A; Mohaimin, Tasnima; Murphy-Hockett, Cole; Rocker, Joshua; Williamson, Kristy A",Am J Emerg Med,431,9

A comparative study of a quantitative nature was used, associating two samples composed of students of higher education in Portugal, the data were obtained before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the results permits us to conclude: (1) in the circumstances of macroeconomic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, entrepreneurial activity does not decrease;(2) respondents are less interested in being employed by others and more attracted to being entrepreneurs;(3) there is a growing concordance with the values that society places on entrepreneurship;and (4) there is now a greater aptitude for entrepreneurial activity.

A manual ventilator is a simple type of ventilator that is operated manually and uses a bag and mask to open the airway and generate significant ventilation. Bag-Mask Ventilation (BMV) is an essential part of manual ventilation, so it improves both airflow and respiration. In this work, a simplified mechanism of a mechanical ventilator with a BMV is proposed and designed for ventilation. The bag is operated by DC motor-driven rack and pinion mechanism. According to a control signal, the rack and pinion simultaneously compresses and decompress the bag. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the response of BMV for ventilation. The proposed design was simulated by using MATLAB for the tidal volume, it is similar to the manual ventilator of the BMV.

This group, along with those with pre-existing heart and lung disease and diabetes, have accounted for 80% of hospitalizations and an even higher percentage of COVID-19 related deaths in the USA. West Virginia, the only state in the USA located completely within Appalachia, has a higher percentage of elderly than all but two states in the nation. Rural seniors are hesitant to use hospital emergency departments and attend routine care visits for fear of exposure to the virus. Restricted cell phone and internet service may limit effective technological outreach to more isolated rural older adults. More information is needed to develop effective, safe, and acceptable approaches to care for rural, isolated older adults. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with 124 community-dwelling residents in four counties in rural Appalachia between 1 and 22 April 2020. Participants were aged 75 years or older. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Fisher's Exact Test was used to examine for associations among variables. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 86 (69.4%) women and 38 (30.6%) men with an average age of 82.5 years. Telephone contact was the preferred method of contact among all but four participants (96.8%). Seventeen calls (13.7%) resulted in some form of intervention, including arranging for emergent home repairs, treatment of severe hypertension, scheduling urgent laboratory testing, arranging for terminal care, treating acute conditions, and providing durable medical equipment. The 17 participants requiring intervention were significantly more likely to be aged 85 years or older (p=0.004), and report two or more chronic conditions (p<0.001). Those describing themselves as 'lonely' were significantly more likely to live alone (p=0.009) and describe themselves as 'anxious' or 'depressed' (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A telephone call appears to be the most effective means of communication with patients in these rural Appalachian counties. Patients aged 85 years or older and those living alone should be given highest priority for regular outreach by healthcare providers. In this population, systematically calling rural elderly patients during the COVID-19 epidemic and its aftermath represents an effective strategy for providers who care for elderly rural patients.","Walker, Robert B; Grome, Michael; Rollyson, William; Baus, Adam D",Rural Remote Health,431,0

No specific studies have been found that evaluate the impact of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic on AA and its surgical management. An analysis was made on the influence of this new pathology on the clinical course of AA. Material and methods: Retrospective observational study was conducted on patients operated on for AA from January to April 2020. They were classified according to the time of the appendectomy, before the declaration of the state of alarm (Pre-COVID-19), and after its declaration (Post-COVID-19) in Spain, one the most affected countries in the world. An evaluation was made of demographic variables, duration of symptoms, type of appendicitis, surgical time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Results: The study included 66 patients (41 Pre-COVID-19; 25 Post-COVID-19) with mean age of 10.7â¯±â¯3 and 9.3â¯±â¯3.1; Pâ¯=â¯.073, respectively. Fever was found in a higher number of post-COVID-19 patients (52 vs 19.5%; Pâ¯=â¯.013), as well as a higher CRP (72.7â¯±â¯96.2 vs 31.3â¯±â¯36.2â¯mg/dL; Pâ¯=â¯.042). This group presented with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis when compared to Pre-COVID-19 (32 vs 7.3%; Pâ¯=â¯.015). The mean hospital stay was longer in the Post-COVID-19 group (5.6â¯±â¯5.9 vs 3.2â¯±â¯4.3 days; Pâ¯=â¯.041). No differences were found in the time of onset of symptoms or surgical time. Conclusions: The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic influenced the time of diagnosis of appendicitis, as well as its course, and mean hospital stay. Peritonitis was more frequently seen. As a result of the significant circumstances, delaying diagnosis and treatment of AA during SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, inappropriate management of this common surgical disorder has been noticed.","Velayos, M; Muñoz-Serrano, A J; Estefanía-Fernández, K; Sarmiento Caldas, M C; Moratilla Lapeña, L; López-Santamaría, M; López-Gutiérrez, J C",,431,16

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-Î³ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-Î³ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).","Chen, Guang; Wu, Di; Guo, Wei; Cao, Yong; Huang, Da; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huilong; Yu, Haijing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Minxia; Wu, Shiji; Song, Jianxin; Chen, Tao; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin",J Clin Invest,431,24

The LiFi network is a high-capacity and security platform. A COVID-19 surveillance system using LiFi is proposed, which consists of two switching modes: communication and surveillance. Firstly, the communication targets are to accommodate the electromagnetic interference (EMI) immunity and high-capacity and security data transmission, where secondly the COVID-19 surveillance can be applied. In operation, the up and downlink system uses a metamaterial antenna embedded by Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI). An antenna consists of silver bars embedded at the microring center with two-phase modulators at its sides. The entangled source namely a dark soliton is applied to form the transmission, where the information security based on quantum cryptography can be managed. By using the suitable parameters, the whispering gallery modes (WGMs) are generated and the up and downlink nodes are formed. The input information is multiplexed with time to form the multiplexed signals, where the big data transmission (40 Pbit s - 1 ) can be employed. By using the surveillance mode, the plasmonic antenna can be applied for temperature and electric force sensors, which can offer the disinfectant spray and temperature sensor for COVID-19 applications. The optimum plasma force sensitivity is 0.16 N kg-1 mW-1. The center frequencies of 191.48 THz and 199.41 THz are obtained for uplink and downlink antennas, respectively. The optimum temperature sensitivity is 0.05 rads-1 °C-1. In conclusion, the novelty of proposed work is that the integrated sensor circuits are employed for COVID-19 surveillance in the hospital. The fuzzy-based system is designed for critical patient monitoring alert using this surveillance and management inside the hospital for COVID-19 patients.","Garhwal, A; Bunruangses, M; Arumona, A E; Youplao, P; Ray, K; Suwandee, S; Yupapin, P",Cognit Comput,431,24

However, these drugs may cause electrocardiogram QT prolongation (QTp) and torsade de Pointes (TdP). We examined potential safety signals for these cardiac arrhythmias. Methods: Using the OpenVigil 2.1 MedDRA platform, we mined data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from December 2019 to June 2020. We extracted individual case safety reports based on exposures of seven antimalarial drugs, azithromycin, and combinations. All other drugs in FAERS served as controls. Events of interest included QTp and TdP, with associations between drug exposures and events expressed as adjusted Reporting-Odds-Ratios (aRORs) and confidence intervals. The lower end of aROR 95% confidence interval >1 was used as the statistically significant signal detection threshold. Results: QTp safety signals were found for hydroxychloroquine[aROR:11.70 (10.40-13.16)], chloroquine[aROR:18.97 (11.30-31.87)], quinine[aROR:16.66 (10.18-27.25)], atovaquone[aROR:6.91 (4.14-11.56)], azithromycin alone [aROR:28.02 (22.87-34.32)] and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin [aROR:75.23 (51.15-110.66)]. TdP safety signals were found for hydroxychloroquine [aROR: 5.62 (4.94-6.38)], chloroquine[aROR:49.37 (30.63-79.58)], and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin[aROR:33.09 (21.22-51.61)]. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and/or azithromycin was associated with QTp/TdP safety signals and their use should be monitored carefully.","Diaby, Vakaramoko; Almutairi, Reem D; Chen, Ziyan; Moussa, Richard K; Berthe, Abdrahmane",Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,431,1

However, the digital-based schemes have an issue called the cliff effect, where the 3D reconstruction quality will be a step function in terms of wireless channel quality. To prevent the cliff effect subject to channel quality fluctuation, we have proposed soft point cloud delivery called HoloCast. Although the HoloCast realizes graceful quality improvement according to wireless channel quality, it requires large communication overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for soft point cloud delivery to simultaneously realize better quality and lower communication overheads. The proposed scheme introduces an end-to-end deep learning framework based on graph neural network (GNN) to reconstruct high-quality point clouds from its distorted observation under wireless fading channels. We demonstrate that the proposed GNN-based scheme can reconstruct clean 3D point cloud with low overheads by removing fading and noise effects.","Fujihashi, Takuya; Koike-Akino, Toshiaki; Chen, Siheng; Watanabe, Takashi",,431,16

Methodology: A forum-based online format with group and individual tasks was chosen, which was didactically designed according to the problem-oriented design by Reinmann and Mandl. Results: The seminar was attended by 14 people, 13 of whom took part in the evaluation. The overall evaluation was, with one exception, a grade of 2 (and better). The three items ""practical relevance"", ""subjective learning success"" and the question of recommendation also received very high approval ratings. The weekly workload reported by the participants was very heterogeneous (mean=2.4 hours; SD=1.1). For some participants, the use of the learning platform was not intuitive and group collaboration was somewhat faltering. Conclusion: The experiences made show that courses on medical didactics can be implemented online and are gladly accepted by the participants. Based on the experience gained, online seminars or blended learning formats will certainly continue to be part of the FAM course program in the future.","Kollewe, Thomas; Ochsendorf, Falk",GMS J Med Educ,431,1

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequent supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and the potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity, but the second cohort (n = 227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS, and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either. Virus stability in saliva was also investigated, with and without the addition of commercially available stabilizing solutions. The virus was stable in saliva at both 4°C and room temperature for up to 7 days. The addition of stabilizing solutions did not enhance stability and, in some situations, reduced detectable virus levels.","Griesemer, Sara B; Van Slyke, Greta; Ehrbar, Dylan; Strle, Klemen; Yildirim, Tugba; Centurioni, Dominick A; Walsh, Anne C; Chang, Andrew K; Waxman, Michael J; St George, Kirsten",J. clin. microbiol,431,24

We describe the rapid planning and deployment of a school-based COVID-19 surveillance system in a metropolitan US county. METHODS: In 2020, we used several data sources to construct disease- and school-based indicators for COVID-19 surveillance in Franklin County, an urban county in central Ohio. We collected, processed, analyzed, and visualized data in the COVID-19 Analytics and Targeted Surveillance System for Schools (CATS). CATS included web-based applications (public and secure versions), automated alerts, and weekly reports for the general public and decision makers, including school administrators, school boards, and local health departments. RESULTS: We deployed a pilot version of CATS in less than 2 months (August-September 2020) and added 21 school districts in central Ohio (15 in Franklin County and 6 outside the county) into CATS during the subsequent months. Public-facing web-based applications provided parents and students with local information for data-informed decision making. We created an algorithm to enable local health departments to precisely identify school districts and school buildings at high risk of an outbreak and active SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school settings. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Piloting a surveillance system with diverse school districts helps scale up to other districts. Leveraging past relationships and identifying emerging partner needs were critical to rapid and sustainable collaboration. Valuing diverse skill sets is key to rapid deployment of proactive and innovative public health practices during a global pandemic.","Hyder, Ayaz; Trinh, Anne; Padmanabhan, Pranav; Marschhausen, John; Wu, Alexander; Evans, Alexander; Iyer, Radhika; Jones, Alexandria",Public Health Rep,431,9

Therefore, cooling or freezing the samples is recommended in case of longer transportation times. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 detectability by RT-PCR was assessed after prolonged unfrozen storage or repetitive freeze-thawing of SARS-CoV-2 samples. SARS-CoV-2-positive patient swabs stored in viral transport medium were exposed to different temperatures (4°C, 25°C, and 35°C) and to repetitive freeze-thawing, to assess the effect of storage conditions on RT-PCR detection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still reliably detected by RT-PCR after 21 days of storage in viral transport medium, even when the samples had been stored at 35°C. The maximum observed change in cycle threshold value per day was 0.046 (±0.019) at 35°C, and the maximum observed change in cycle threshold value per freeze-thaw cycle per day was 0.197 (±0.06).

Aim and methods: A case-series of 61 patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) between August 12 and September 12, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and rapidly evolving ARF requiring oxygen support therapy and/or mechanical ventilation was retrospectively analyzed. We examined whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab, a monoclonal interleukin-6 receptor antibody, was associated with improved outcome. All patients received empiric antivirals, dexamethasone 6 mg/day for 7 days, antibiotics, and prophylactic anticoagulation. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg [two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart]. Outcome measures such as mortality on day-14, ICU length of stay, and rate of nosocomial acquired bacterial infections were also analyzed. Results: Patients were males (88.2%) aged 51 [interquartile range (IQR): 42.5-58.75)], with admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) 4 score of 53 (IQR: 37.75-72.5), and had more than one comorbidity (62.3%). On admission, twenty nine patients (47.5%) were mechanically ventilated, and thirty two patients (52.5%) were receiving oxygen therapy. No serious adverse effects due to tocilizumab therapy were recorded. However, twelve patients (19.6%) developed nosocomial acquired infections. ICU length of stay was 13 (IQR: 9-17) days, and mortality on day-14 was 24.6%. Six patients were shifted to other hospitals but were followed-up. The overall mortality on day-30 was 31.1%. Non-mechanically ventilated patients had higher survival rates compared to mechanically ventilated patients although results were not significant [hazards ratio = 2.6 (95% confidence intervals: 0.9-7.7), p = 0.08]. Tocilizumab did not affect the mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Tocilizumab could be an adjunct safe therapy in rapidly evolving COVID-19 pneumonia and associated critical illness.","Mady, Ahmed; Aletreby, Waleed; Abdulrahman, Basheer; Lhmdi, Mohammed; Noor, Alfateh M; Alqahtani, Saleh A; Soliman, Ibrahim; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Karakitsos, Dimitrios; Memish, Ziad A",Ann Med Surg (Lond),431,23

Using data on cases and tests in France for the period between the first and second lock-downs-May 13 to October 25, 2020-our acceleration index shows that the pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers that the pandemic acceleration was stronger than national average for the [59-68] and especially the 69 and older age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19-28] age group was the lowest and is about half that of the [69-78]. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French ""départements"" (roughly counties), based on both the acceleration index and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based. We argue that both our acceleration index and our allocation algorithm are useful tools to guide public health policies as France might possibly enter a third lock-down period with indeterminate duration.","Baunez, Christelle; Degoulet, Mickael; Luchini, Stéphane; Pintus, Patrick A; Teschl, Miriam",PLoS One,431,1

The researcher who offered more than 100 class hours of English instruction realized that the students did not participate in online courses as much as expected. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the level of students' online learning readiness (OLR) and the factors predicting their participation in online English courses. Method: The study employed a correlational research design to discover the relationship between variables. The sample included 177 students selected from the Departments of Civil Aviation and Translation and Interpreting. Data were collected using a validated and reliable OLR scale. This instrument was conducted as an online form, which included an additional part to obtain information about some characteristics of the sample, which were used to examine relationships. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Findings: The findings revealed that the students had an average level of OLR. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that students' department type, previous experience in online courses, computer ownership, computer/internet self-efficacy (CIS) and motivation for learning (ML) influenced students' participation in online courses, while internet limit, self-directed learning (SDL), learner control (LC) and online communication self-efficacy (OCS) were not significant variables influencing their participation frequency.

Typically, these methods use a suspension of the test organism to assess the bactericidal, fungicidal or virucidal activity of a given preparation. However, such suspension methods do not fully imitate real-life conditions. To address this issue, carrier methods have been developed, in which microorganisms are applied to the surface of a carrier (e.g., stainless steel, glass and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) and then dried.

This new strain of coronavirus is not completely understood and to date, there is no treatment of coronavirus. Traditional ayurvedic medicines mainly essential oils and Chinese herbs have always played a vital role in the prevention and treatment of several epidemics and pandemics. In the meantime, guidelines of the ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha and homoepathy) include a traditional medicinal treatment for flu and fever and also recommended to boost immunity to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It is not possible to find which essential oil will offer the best level of protection. However, it is likely to assume that some essential oils are likely to offer a measurable level of defense in the same way they do with many other known viruses. METHODS: Literature relevant to various essential oils having antiviral activity has been collected and compiled. Various nanocarriers of essential oils have also been stated. The database was collected using various search engines such as jgate, google scholar, scihub, pubmed, sciencedirect etc. Results: Essential oils contain active constituents such as phenolics compounds, terpenoids, alkaloids, phenyl propanoids etc., which are responsible for their biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antioxidant activities and many more. But the use of essential oils has always been limited due to poor solubility, solvent toxicity, volatility and low solubility. Many nanotechnology based carriers especially, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and microemulsion etc. have been evidenced to overcome limitations associated with essential oils. CONCLUSION: Several essential oils possess potent antiviral activity and are characterized by fewer side effects and are safe to human use. The nanocarrier systems of these oils have proved the potential to treat viral and bacterial infections.","Kaur, Malkiet; Devi, Gayatri; Nagpal, Manju; Singh, Manjinder; Dhingra, Gitika Arora; Aggarwal, Geeta",Pharm.

A cross-sectional survey was carried out on 103 participants to validate the questionnaire that used a 5-point Likert scale for the response option. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to establish construct validity. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to test the internal consistency of the whole questionnaire. RESULTS: A questionnaire with 20 items to assess the lifestyle-related behaviour of people was developed. The questionnaire shows a satisfactory validity and a good internal consistency with the Cronbach's alpha value of 0.72. CONCLUSION: The developed tool is valid and reliable to assess the changes in lifestyle-related behaviour of individuals during COVID 19 pandemic.","Kumari, Archana; Ranjan, Piyush; Vikram, Naval K; Kaur, Divjyot; Sahu, Anamika; Dwivedi, Sada Nand; Baitha, Upendra; Goel, Aastha",Diabetes Metab Syndr,431,16

It can cause acute respiratory infection. Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by rapidly progressing ascending paralysis that is triggered by an infection or immune stimulation which produces an abnormal immune response that targets peripheral nerves. In most cases, it is preceded by a bacterial or viral infection. This is a case of a 36-year-old male patient from India who developed progressive acute flaccid paralysis after SARS-COVID-19 infection. Clinical examination and lab studies lead to the diagnosis of GBS. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and supportive treatment. Following treatment, there was a substantial improvement in weakness as reported by the patient and was confirmed by clinical evaluation. This is an uncommon manifestation of SARS-COVID-19 infection and suggests the presence of an immune-mediated process leading to damage of the nervous system.

Background: The ongoing coronavirus outbreak is an important threat to health worldwide. Epidemiological data representing greater risk of liver failure in patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: Electronic databases were comprehensively searched using Medline, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to July 2020. Outcomes from each relevant study were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was analyzed by Q test and I2 statistics. Sensitivity analysis was also evaluated. Results: A total of 24 studies were included (4,246 patients) in this study. We found a significant association of COVID-19 severity with increased levels of ALT [SMD: 1.40 U/L; 95% CI (0.93, 1.88); P < 0.05, I2 = 96.5%, P Heterogenity = 0.000 ], AST [SMD: 2.11 U/L; 95% CI (1.40, 2.83); P < 0.05, I2 = 97.9%, P Heterogenity = 0.000], LDH [SMD: 3.88 U/L; 95% CI (2.70, 5); P < 0.05, I2 = 98.7%, P Heterogenity = 0.000] and TBil [SMD: 1.08 mol/L; 95% CI (0.44, 1.72); P = 0.001, I2 = 97.7, P Heterogenity = 0.000], whereas, ALP values [SMD: 0.31; 95% CI (-1.57, 2.20); P = 0.74] was not significant between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Moreover, elevated liver enzymes were found more in males [OR: 1.52, (95% CI 1.26, 1.83), P < 0.05] with severe COVID-19 infection than in females.

Remdesivir is an investigational drug studied in clinical trials for COVID-19 and is available to children and pregnant women through compassionate-use access but is not yet FDA approved. In early May, the US Department of Health and Human Services began to distribute remdesivir, donated by Gilead Sciences, Inc., to hospitals and state health departments for emergency use; multiple shipments have since been distributed. This process has raised questions of how remdesivir should be allocated. The Minnesota Department of Health has collaborated with the Minnesota COVID Ethics Collaborative and multiple clinical experts to issue an Ethical Framework for May 2020 Allocation of Remdesivir in the COVID-19 Pandemic. The framework builds on extensive ethical guidance developed for public health emergencies in Minnesota before the COVID-19 crisis. The Minnesota remdesivir allocation framework specifies an ethical approach to distributing the drug to facilities across the state and then among COVID-19 patients within each facility. This article describes the process of developing the framework and adjustments in the framework over time with emergence of new data, analyzes key issues addressed, and suggests next steps. Sharing this framework and the development process can encourage transparency and may be useful to other states formulating and refining their approach to remdesivir EUA allocation.","Lim, Sarah; DeBruin, Debra A; Leider, Jonathon P; Sederstrom, Nneka; Lynfield, Ruth; Baker, Jason V; Kline, Susan; Kesler, Sarah; Rizza, Stacey; Wu, Joel; Sharp, Richard R; Wolf, Susan M",Mayo Clin Proc,431,21

The COVID-19 outbreak impacted the 2021 IVSR match due to travel restrictions. We sought to better understand pre-pandemic applicant recruitment strategies, logistics of away rotations, and the residency interview process to identify areas for improvement in the application process. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent to matched students in 2020, inquiring about motivations for pursuing VS, logistic of away rotations and interviews, and factors influencing students' rank lists. RESULTS: Seventy of the 73 matched students completed the survey (95.9% response rate). The median age was 27 (25-41), 32.9% were female, 91.4% were US medical students, and 77.1% were from institutions with a VS training program. Factors most strongly influencing the decision to choose VS as a career were interest in open vascular procedures, endovascular procedures, perceived job satisfaction, emerging technologies, and influence of a mentor. The prospect of the job market, future salary, and competitiveness of the application process had the least impact. Of the matched students, 82.9% completed an away rotation (median 2; range 1-4), with 51.7% of students paying a total cost of more than $2500. Fifty percent of students matched either at their home institution or where they had performed an away rotation. Students reported application submissions to a median of 50 programs (range 1-70) and interviewed at 17 (range 1-28), with 40% of students paying a total of more than $4000 for interview costs. The most significant factors affecting students' rank lists included: program culture, open aortic surgical volume, geography, and complex endovascular procedure volume. Tours of facilities, resident salary, and male/female distribution had the least importance. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully matched applicants in 2020 prioritized operative case volume and program collegiality when ranking programs. Despite their high cost, away rotations played an important role in the Match, suggesting that time spent at potential institutions allowed ideal assessment of factors for students. The high average number of away rotations and in-person interviews performed in 2019-2020 was limited for the 2021 Match due to COVID-19 restrictions. Programs will have to continue developing creative alternatives or additions to away rotations and the application processes to assure continued success in future post-pandemic Match cycles.","Fereydooni, Arash; Ramirez, Joel L; Morrow, Katherine L; Chandra, Venita; Coleman, Dawn M; Lee, Jason T",J. vasc. surg,431,16

However, a reduction in air pollution has been found in many regions on a global scale. This study is focused on how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on the air quality in Ecuador, one of the most alarming cases of COVID-19 contagion in Latin America, occupying the first place as regards deaths per capita. The spatio-temporal variations in NO 2concentrations in 12 highly populated cities were evaluated by comparing the NO 2tropospheric concentrations before (2019) and after (2020) the COVID-19 lockdown. The atmospheric data was collected from the TROPOMI on the Sentinel-5P satellite of the European Space Agency. A reduction in NO 2concentrations (−13%) was observed as a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdown in Ecuador. However, this reduction occurred to the greatest extent in the cases of Guayaquil (−23.4%) and Quito (−22.4%), the two most highly populated cities. Linking NO 2levels to confirmed cases/deaths of COVID-19, a strong correlation between air NO 2concentrations and the cases/mortality caused by coronavirus (r = 0.91; p&lt;0.001) was observed. This work highlights the crucial role played by air quality as regards human health.","Pacheco, Henry; Díaz-López, Stephanie; Jarre, Emilio; Pacheco, Henyerlin; Méndez, Williams; Zamora-Ledezma, Ezequiel",Urban Clim.,431,9

In the United States, strict social distancing during the first wave of virus spread has resulted in different types of infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. Here we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection ""corridors"", resulting in plateau dynamics. Further, we show that plateau dynamics are observed only if interventions start sufficiently early; late intervention leads to a ""peak and decay"" pattern. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase. The network models analyzed here allow us to interpret and reconcile different infection dynamics during social distancing observed in various US states.","Komarova, Natalia L; Azizi, Asma; Wodarz, Dominik",Epidemics,431,10

The impact was studied for pre-lockdown (1st Mar-24th Mar 2020), lockdown (25th Mar-31st May 2020), and unlocking (1st Jun-31st Aug 2020) phases. The lockdown period comprises 4 lockdown phases with distinct measures, whereas the unlocking period had 3 phases. PM2.5 concentration reduced significantly in all megacities and met the national standards during the lockdown period. The maximum reduction in PM2.5 level was observed in Kolkata (62%), followed by Mumbai (49%), Chennai (34%), and New Delhi (26%) during the lockdown period. Comparatively, Hyderabad exhibited a smaller reduction in PM2.5 concentration, i.e., 10%. The average PM2.5 levels during the lockdown in the peak hour (i.e., 07:00-11:00 h) in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad decreased by 21.3%, 48.5%, 63.4%, 56.4%, and 23.8%, respectively, compared to those before lockdown period. During the unlocking period, except for Chennai, all megacities showed a reduction in average PM2.5 levels compared to concentrations in the lockdown period, but these reductions were mainly linked with monsoon rains in India. The current study provided an opportunity to study air pollution in the absence of major anthropogenic activities and during limited activities in monsoon season having an ecological design. The study reports a new baseline of PM2.5, except for monsoon, and explores this knowledge to plan future air pollution reduction strategies.

We aimed to synthesise, combine, and assess this large corpus of data. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and five preprint servers for articles published in English between Dec 1, 2019, and Dec 22, 2020. Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in humans after the first identified case in the area were included. Studies that only reported serological responses among patients with COVID-19, those using known infection status samples, or any animal experiments were all excluded. All data used for analysis were extracted from included papers. Study quality was assessed using a standardised scale. We estimated age-specific, sex-specific, and race-specific seroprevalence by WHO regions and subpopulations with different levels of exposures, and the ratio of serology-identified infections to virologically confirmed cases. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020198253. FINDINGS: 16 506 studies were identified in the initial search, 2523 were assessed for eligibility after removal of duplicates and inappropriate titles and abstracts, and 404 serological studies (representing tests in 5 168 360 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis. In the 82 studies of higher quality, close contacts (18·0%, 95% CI 15·7-20·3) and high-risk health-care workers (17·1%, 9·9-24·4) had higher seroprevalence than did low-risk health-care workers (4·2%, 1·5-6·9) and the general population (8·0%, 6·8-9·2). The heterogeneity between included studies was high, with an overall I2 of 99·9% (p<0·0001). Seroprevalence varied greatly across WHO regions, with the lowest seroprevalence of general populations in the Western Pacific region (1·7%, 95% CI 0·0-5·0). The pooled infection-to-case ratio was similar between the region of the Americas (6·9, 95% CI 2·7-17·3) and the European region (8·4, 6·5-10·7), but higher in India (56·5, 28·5-112·0), the only country in the South-East Asia region with data. INTERPRETATION: Antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached in most settings. Estimates of the ratio of serologically detected infections per virologically confirmed cases across WHO regions can help provide insights into the true proportion of the population infected from routine confirmation data.

The severity of the situation has become so substantial that many or even most of the patients with mild to moderate symptoms had to self-isolate without specific medical treatments or even without being tested for COVID-19. Many patients joined internet membership groups to exchange information and support each other. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to determine the benefits and limits of using social media to understand the symptoms of patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms and, in particular, their symptoms of anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) and ageusia (loss of the sense of taste). The voluntary reports on an internet website of a membership group will be the platform of the analyses. METHODS: Posts and comments of members of an internet group known as COVID-19 Smell and Taste Loss, founded on March 24, 2020, to support patients with suspected COVID-19 were collected and analyzed daily. Demographic data were collected using the software mechanism called Group Insights on the membership group website. RESULTS: Membership groups on social media have become rare sources of support for patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. These groups provided mental support to their members and became resources for information on COVID-19 tests and medicines or supplements. However, the membership was voluntary, and often the members leave without notification. It is hard to be precise from the free voluntary reports. The number of women in the group (6995/9227, 75.38% as of October 12, 2020) was about three times more than men (2272/9227, 24.62% as of October 12, 2020), and the peak age of members was between 20-40 years in both men and women. Patients who were asymptomatic other than the senses comprised 14.93% (53/355) of the total patients. Recovery of the senses was higher in the patients who were asymptomatic besides having anosmia and ageusia. Most (112/123, 91.06%) patients experienced other symptoms first and then lost their senses, on average, 4.2 days later. Patients without other symptoms tended to recover earlier (P=.02). Patients with anosmia and ageusia occasionally reported distorted smell and taste (parosmia and dysgeusia) as well as experiencing or perceiving the smell and taste without the sources of the smell or taste (phantosmia and phantogeusia). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the social media database of suspected COVID-19 patients' voices demonstrated that, although accurate diagnosis of patients is not always obtained with social media-based analyses, it may be a useful tool to collect a large amount of data on symptoms and the clinical course of worldwide rapidly growing infectious diseases.","Koyama, Sachiko; Ueha, Rumi; Kondo, Kenji",J Med Internet Res,431,1

Building on this assumption, this paper aimed to compare fear of COVID-19 and remote teaching burnout across sample characteristics and relate fear of COVID-19 to the remote teaching burnout. Following comparative and correlational research designs, a sample of 1069 K to 12 teachers from Mindanao, Philippines was selected to participate in the online survey. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results showed that the teachers have a high level of fear of COVID-19 and a moderate level of remote teaching burnout. Furthermore, COVID-19 fear of teachers did not significantly differ across all sample characteristics tested;however, remote teaching burnout significantly differed across age, monthly income, educational attainment, and teaching experience, except gender. It was further revealed that there is a positive and moderate significant relationship between fear of COVID-19 and remote teaching burnout. This linear association implies that as fear of COVID-19 of teachers increases, their remote teaching burnout also increases. Considering the current persistence of COVID-19 cases and the role of teachers in the anticipated recovery phase of education, the results of the study indicate the urgent attention of education authorities to develop measures to address the needs of teachers who may have psychological issues brought by fear of COVID-19 and remote teaching burnout.","Carreon, T.; Rotas, E.; Cahapay, M.; Garcia, K.; Amador, R.; Anoba, J.

Therefore, the traditional face-to-face patient-physician care model has had to be re-examined in many countries, with digital technology and new models of care being rapidly deployed to meet the various challenges of the pandemic. This Viewpoint highlights new models in ophthalmology that have adapted to incorporate digital health solutions such as telehealth, artificial intelligence decision support for triaging and clinical care, and home monitoring. These models can be operationalised for different clinical applications based on the technology, clinical need, demand from patients, and manpower availability, ranging from out-of-hospital models including the hub-and-spoke pre-hospital model, to front-line models such as the inflow funnel model and monitoring models such as the so-called lighthouse model for provider-led monitoring.

Therapeutic benefits of intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG) have been demonstrated in wide range of diseases. The present study is conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia. METHODS: An open-label, multicenter, comparative, randomized study was conducted on COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia. 100 eligible patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio either to receive IVIG + standard of care (SOC) or SOC. RESULTS: Duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in IVIG group to that of SOC alone (7.7 Vs. 17.5 days). Duration for normalization of body temperature, oxygen saturation and mechanical ventilation were significantly shorter in IVIG compared to SOC. Percentages of patients on mechanical ventilation in two groups were not significantly different (24% Vs. 38%). Median time to RT-PCR negativity was significantly shorter with IVIG than SOC (7 Vs.18 days). There were only mild to moderate adverse events in both groups except for one patient (2%), who died in SOC.

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how it interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 8 patients with SARS-CoV-2, and also analyzed data from 25 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 20 healthy controls for comparison. RESULTS: The median number of intrahost variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, ranged from 0 to 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data. However, very few intrahost variants were observed in the population as polymorphisms, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intrahost variants in a possible person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. Microbiotas in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intrahost variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.","Shen, Zijie; Xiao, Yan; Kang, Lu; Ma, Wentai; Shi, Leisheng; Zhang, Li; Zhou, Zhuo; Yang, Jing; Zhong, Jiaxin; Yang, Donghong; Guo, Li; Zhang, Guoliang; Li, Hongru; Xu, Yu; Chen, Mingwei; Gao, Zhancheng; Wang, Jianwei; Ren, Lili; Li, Mingkun",Clin Infect Dis,431,5

Phyllostomidae accounted for the largest number of species and individuals, Phyllostominae being the most speciose, and Stenodermatinae the most abundant. The analysis of species distribution patterns and comparisons with lists for other Amazonian localities indicate that the assemblage reported here is almost entirely composed for species widely distributed in different zoogeographical Amazonian provinces, occurring yet in other Neotropical rainforests.

Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients;however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management. Taken together, the present review summarizes neurological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications, specifically in elderly patients, and underlines the need for their clinical management in advance.","Kalra, R.

The impact on people's mental health is expected to be high. This paper sought to systematically review community-based studies on depression conducted during the COVID-19 and estimate the pooled prevalence of depression. Method: We searched for cross-sectional, community-based studies listed on PubMed or Web of Science from January 1, 2020 to May 8, 2020 that reported prevalence of depression. A random effect model was used to estimate the pooled proportion of depression. Results: A total of 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis, with prevalence rates of depression ranging from 7.45% to 48.30%. The pooled prevalence of depression was 25% (95% CI: 18% - 33%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 99.60%, p < .001). Conclusions: Compared with a global estimated prevalence of depression of 3.44% in 2017, our pooled prevalence of 25% appears to be 7 times higher, thus suggesting an important impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people's mental health. Addressing mental health during and after this global health crisis should be placed into the international and national public health agenda to improve citizens' wellbeing.","Bueno-Notivol, Juan; Gracia-García, Patricia; Olaya, Beatriz; Lasheras, Isabel; López-Antón, Raúl; Santabárbara, Javier",International journal of clinical and health psychology (Internet),431,20

Moreover, heparanase levels correlate with shorter postoperative survival of cancer patients, encouraging the development of heparanase inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. Heparanase-inhibiting heparin/heparan sulfate-mimicking compounds and neutralizing antibodies are highly effective in animal models of cancer progression, yet none of the compounds reached the stage of approval for clinical use. The present study focused on newly synthesized triazolo–thiadiazoles, of which compound 4-iodo-2-(3-(p-tolyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)phenol (4-MMI) was identified as a potent inhibitor of heparanase enzymatic activity, cell invasion, experimental metastasis, and tumor growth in mouse models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a marked decrease in primary tumor growth in mice treated with small molecules that inhibit heparanase enzymatic activity. This result encourages the optimization of 4-MMI for preclinical and clinical studies primarily in cancer but also other indications (i.e., colitis, pancreatitis, diabetic nephropathy, tissue fibrosis) involving heparanase, including viral infection and COVID-19.","Barash, U.; Rangappa, S.; Mohan, C.

Exchanges by e-mail and interviews were aimed at collecting testimonies from parents for a better understanding of their difficulties and the help provided by the mobilization of professionals. Methods and results: Eight parents of autistic children living in the Seine-Saint-Denis area agreed to testify about their experience, either in person, taking into account the barrier measures after the first lockdown, or by telephone during the second lockdown. By way of comparison, e-mails were exchanged with a mother and two fathers of autistic children from higher socio-economic backgrounds living in other parts of France or Belgium. While at the beginning of the first lockdown, some children may have felt soothed by being at home with their parents, the extension of the situation led to crises related to feelings of anxiety or boredom. Despite the closure of many medical-social facilities, professionals mobilized to continue helping families and children whose routines were disrupted. Conclusion: Depending on the conditions of lockdown, the families' experiences differed and evolved over time. The major problems encountered by some families were the worsening of their child's troubles (self-harm, tantrums, violence, and shouting). Pedagogical tools were adapted by the teachers, activity sheets were sent out, group workshops were organized, and consultations were given at a distance. The teams of the child psychiatry services and the medico-social services have mobilized themselves and have shown reactivity and inventiveness in order to ensure the care and follow-up of children and their families.","Chamak, B",Neuropsychiatr. enfance adolesc,431,2

With this study we investigated the perceptions of doctors and nurses on hybridization in clinical directorates (CDs) in hospitals. METHODS: We investigated the attitudes of healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses) towards eight hospital CDs in the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Bologna (Emilia Romagna, Italy) 6 years after their implementation. We used a validated questionnaire by Braithwaite and Westbrook (2004). Drawing on Palmer et al. (2007), we added a section about the characteristics of department heads. In all, 123 healthcare professionals in managerial roles completed and returned the questionnaire. The return rate was 47.4% for doctors and 31.6% for nurses. RESULTS: Doctors reported an increase in clinical governance, interdisciplinarity collaboration, and standardization of clinical work. Hybridization of practices was noted to have taken place. While doctors did not see these changes as a threat to professional values, they felt that hospital managers had taken greater control. There was a large overlap of attitudes between doctors and nurses: inter-professional integration in CDs fostered alignment of values and aims. The polarity index was higher for responses from the doctors than from the nurses. CONCLUSION: The study findings have implications for policy makers and managers: mission and strategic mandate of CDs; governance of CDs, leadership issues; opportunities for engaging healthcare professionals; changes in managerial involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss the limitations of the present study and future areas for research into hybrid structures.","Prenestini, Anna; Sartirana, Marco; Lega, Federico",BMC Health Serv Res,431,1

METHODS: We retrospectively identified COVID-19-positive patients 18 years and older that had neurology symptoms on presentation requiring neurology consultation between March 14, 2020 and May 18, 2020. The patients were then classified into those with typical COVID-19 symptoms and those without. Demographic, clinical symptoms, laboratory result, and clinical outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Out of 282 patients who had neurology consult during this period, we identified 56 (mean age 69.2 years, 57% women) who tested COVID-19-positive and had neurologic symptoms on initial presentation. Of these, 23 patients (mean age 65.2 years, 52% women) had no typical COVID-19 symptoms while 33 did (mean age 72.2 years, 60% woman). In both groups, impaired consciousness was the most common initial neurologic symptom, followed by stroke, unsteady gait, headache, seizure, syncopal event, acute vision changes, and intracranial hemorrhage. Out of the 23 patients without typical COVID-19 symptoms on presentation, 10 went on to develop typical symptoms with 8 needing supplemental oxygen and one requiring mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Patients who have COVID-19 can present with serious neurologic symptoms such as impaired consciousness and stroke even without typical COVID-19 symptoms. Those without typical COVID-19 symptoms can later develop typical symptoms severe enough to need respiratory support.","Chuang, David T; Aydemir, Seyhmus; Magda, Paul; Thomas, Crystal; Zarnegar, Reza",Acta Neurol Scand,431,15

The present work aims to elucidate the community behavioural response towards COVID-19 lockdown in India and presents comprehensive observations. Protection motivational theory has been used to build a conceptual framework. It was observed that community behavioural response includes maladaptive, adaptive and prosocial behaviours. In addition, we conclude that the effective strategy against the prevention, spread and control of pandemics and strategic management is still lacking.

Clinical factors associated with severity of the disease remain unclear. The aim of the study was to characterize Polish patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and to evaluate potential prognostic factors of severe course of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the Pulmonology and Allergology Department of the University Hospital in Kraków, Poland. Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection were enrolled, and data about past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, imaging studies results, in-hospital management and outcomes was prospectively gathered. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 100 patients at the mean age of 59.2 (SD 16.1) years among whom 63 (63.0%) were male. Among them 10 (10.0%) died, 47 (47%) presented respiratory failure, 15 (15.0%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 17 (17.0%) developed acute kidney injury, 7 (7.0%) had sepsis and 10 (10.0%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Multivariable analysis revealed age (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.01-1.15), body mass index (BMI; OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.53), modified early warning score (MEWS; OR 3.95; 95% CI 1.48-12), the highest d-dimer value (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.03-2.9) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.03-1.3) to be associated with severe course of COVID-19.

Although centers use strict selection criteria, there is a risk of recurrence, reaching up to 20% which are mostly observed within two years following the procedure. The survival after the recurrence is poor and it has been reported to be between 7-16 months. This poor prognosis is due to the systemic course of the recurrence even its presentation is local initially. RESULTS: The clinical management and treatment algorithm of recurrence is challenging and there is no guideline regarding the situation. Staging of the disease and multi-disciplinary approach are important. The decision for choice of treatment is given depending on the localization and spread of the recurrence. Adjusting and switching the immunosuppressive therapy should be the first attempt. When the recurrence is limited or confined to resectable regions, surgery should be the choice of treatment. Multiple recurrence sites such as adrenal glands, lung, lymph nodes are not contraindication for curative surgery. Resection of the graft for intrahepatic recurrence is the most beneficial procedure for survival. If resection is not possible due to advanced hepatic disease, loco-regional therapies such as TACE, RF, microwave ablation should be considered. SBRT may be an alternative both for hepatic and extra-hepatic recurrence. In case of systemic disease, sorafenib should be the drug choice.","Sarici, Baris; Isik, Burak; Yilmaz, Sezai",,431,22

RESULTS: Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility. Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

With the internet harvesting large amounts of data from the general population in real time, public databases such as Google Trends (GT) and the Baidu Index (BI) can be an expedient tool to assist public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to apply digital epidemiology to the current COVID-19 pandemic to determine the utility of providing adjunctive epidemiologic information on outbreaks of this disease and evaluate this methodology in the case of future pandemics. METHODS: An epidemiologic time series analysis of online search trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was performed from January 9, 2020, to April 6, 2020. BI was used to obtain online search data for China, while GT was used for worldwide data, the countries of Italy and Spain, and the US states of New York and Washington. These data were compared to real-world confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. Chronologic patterns were assessed in relation to disease patterns, significant events, and media reports. RESULTS: Worldwide search terms for shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia and ageusia, headache, chest pain, and sneezing had strong correlations (r>0.60, P<.001) to both new daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. GT COVID-19 (search term) and GT coronavirus (virus) searches predated real-world confirmed cases by 12 days (r=0.85, SD 0.10 and r=0.76, SD 0.09, respectively, P<.001). Searches for symptoms of diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, cough, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea all had a negative lag greater than 1 week compared to new daily cases, while searches for anosmia and dysgeusia peaked worldwide and in China with positive lags of 5 days and 6 weeks, respectively, corresponding with widespread media coverage of these symptoms in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of digital epidemiology in providing helpful surveillance data of disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Although certain online search trends for this disease were influenced by media coverage, many search terms reflected clinical manifestations of the disease and showed strong correlations with real-world cases and deaths.","Higgins, Thomas S; Wu, Arthur W; Sharma, Dhruv; Illing, Elisa A; Rubel, Kolin; Ting, Jonathan Y",JMIR Public Health Surveill,431,10

Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the perspectives of United States PGY1s regarding the impact of the pandemic on these experiences. Our secondary aims were to understand how desire to practice medicine was impacted by the pandemic and whether PGY1s felt that they were able to meaningfully contribute to the COVID-19 response as students. METHOD: We conducted a national, cross-sectional study of PGY1s who had recently graduated from medical school in 2020. A survey was distributed to PGY1s from across specialties, in programs distributed throughout the United States. It included questions about medical school training during the pandemic, impact on graduation timing and transition to internship, concerns about caring for patients with COVID-19, desire to practice medicine, and ability to meaningfully contribute to the pandemic. Findings are presented using descriptive statistics and univariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: 1980 PGY1s consented to participate, 1463 completed the survey (74%), and 713 met criteria for this analysis. 77% of PGY1s reported that the pandemic adversely affected their connection with their medical school communities, and 58% reported that the pandemic impeded their preparation for intern year. 4% of PGY1s reported graduating medical school and practicing as an intern earlier than their expected graduation date. While the majority of PGY1s did not have a change in desire to practice medicine, PGY1s with concerns regarding personal health or medical conditions (OR 4.92 [95% CI 3.20-7.55] p < 0.0001), the health or medical conditions of others in the home (OR 4.41 [2.87-6.77], p < 0.0001]), and PGY1s with children (OR 2.37 [1.23-4.58], p < 0.0001) were more likely to report a decreased desire. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID pandemic disrupted the social connectedness and educational experiences of a majority of PGY1 residents in a sample of trainees in United States training programs. Those with health concerns and children had particularly challenging experiences. As the current and subsequent classes of PGY1s affected by COVID-19 proceed in their training, ongoing attention should be focused on their training needs, competencies, and well-being.","Winn, Ariel S; Weaver, Matthew D; O039,; Donnell, Katherine A; Sullivan, Jason P; Robbins, Rebecca; Landrigan, Christopher P; Barger, Laura K",BMC Med Educ,431,23

The aim of this study was to describe attitudes and behaviours towards the Canadian COVID-19 public health response, and identify risk-modifying behaviours based on socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was administered in May 2020 to members of a paid panel representative of the Canadian population by age, gender, official language, and region of residence. A total of 4981 respondents provided responses for indicators of self-reported risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours towards COVID-19 public health measures. RESULTS: More than 90% of respondents reported confidence in the ability to comply with a variety of public health measures. However, only 51% reported preparedness for illness in terms of expectation to work if sick or access to paid sick days. Risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours varied by demographic variables. Men, younger age groups, and those in the paid workforce were less likely to consider public health measures to be effective, and had less confidence in their ability to comply. Approximately 80% of respondents reported that parents provided childcare and 52% reported that parents in the workforce provided childcare while schools were closed. CONCLUSION: Policies to help address issues of public adherence include targeted messaging for men and younger age groups, social supports for those who need to self-isolate, changes in workplace policies to discourage presenteeism, and provincially co-ordinated masking and safe school policies.","Brankston, Gabrielle; Merkley, Eric; Fisman, David N; Tuite, Ashleigh R; Poljak, Zvonimir; Loewen, Peter J; Greer, Amy L",Can J Public Health,431,16

METHODS: The study was conducted at Canakkale University Hospital in Turkey. Included in the study were 82 non-metastatic breast cancer patients whose clinical outcomes were followed-up after primary treatment, but suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. FCR, SWB and psychological resilience were assessed using the FCR inventory-short form (FCRI-SF), SWB scale and the brief resilience scale (BRS), respectively. RESULTS: The mean scores of breast cancer survivors concerning FCR, SWB, and psychological resilience were 17.77 ± 5.38, 36.20 ± 6.21 and 20.01 ± 4.51, respectively. A significant negative correlation was noted between the scores of FCR and SWB and psychological resilience (r = -0.329, p < 0.001 and r = -0.316, p = 0.004, respectively). Additionally, a significantly positive correlation was identified between psychological resilience and SWB (r = 0.501, p = 0.003). A hierarchical linear regression analysis with FCRI-SF as the dependent variable, and SWB and BRS as explanatory variables, indicated that SWB affects FCRI-SF scores and is a potential predictor of FCR. A mediation analysis revealed that SWB partially mediated the relationship between psychological resilience and FCR. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors with high SWB and psychological resilience scores experience less FCR, despite their failure to maintain the medical follow-up due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Efforts should be made to increase the psychological resilience and SWB of patients diagnosed with breast cancer.","Koral, Lokman; Cirak, Yalcin",Psycho-oncol. (Chichester),431,16

Ableist Logic Used in Misguided Attempt to Combat Ageism During COVID-19,18.50055,6.148481,2020,"Aims A full lockdown was forced in Greece due to the COVID-19 pandemic for 53 days and specifically from 03/13/2020 to05/04/2020. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of lockdown on the number of patients visiting theEmergency Surgical Specialties Department (ESSD) of a tertiary Greek hospital. It is common sense that the vast majority of patients examined in the ESSD have no symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2. In the Emergency Department (ED) of ourhospital, there are 6 different surgical specialties domains;Vascular Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Urology, Opthalmology, General Surgery, and Otorhinolaryngology. Methods In this retrospective study, data exported from the Sismanogleio General Hospital's Emergency Department werestudied during 4 different periods;a) the full lockdown period of 53 days, from 03/13/2020 to 05/04/2020, b) the period of53 days right before the lockdown, from 01/20/2020 to 03/12/2020, c) the period of 53 days right after the lockdown, from05/05/2020 to 06/26/2020 and d) the time period of the previous year that is analogous with the lockdown duration, from03/13/2019 to 05/04/2019. Results The number of patients visiting the ESSD of our hospital was significantly altered during the lockdown period([ Tab. 1 ]). The reduction of this number is remarkable compared to the rest time periods of the study. To be exact, thisdecrease is 54.74 %, 51.53 %, and 61.93 % compared to the pre-traffic ban duration, the post-ban span, and the previousyear's similar time period. Conclusions Data provided by our ED is congruent with many other reports all over the world showing a dramaticlessening of people attending the ESSD amid the outbreak of COVID-19. People's angst about contracting the disease wasundoubtedly the most obvious reason for that.","Tsekouras, K.; Orfanos, S.; Karlis, G.; Tsitsinakis, G.",Endoscopy,431,7

METHODS: Forty-nine second-year student pharmacists were enrolled in a pharmacy communication laboratory course and 8 undergraduate students were recruited during Fall 2019. The first communication laboratory interaction consisted of student pharmacists using their normal mode of communication with role-played patients who are deaf/hard of hearing to establish baseline measures; a pretest survey was administered to each participant at the conclusion of this 10-minute laboratory interaction. In the second laboratory interaction, student pharmacists used the app to assist in communicating with the simulated patients who are deaf/hard of hearing. Posttests were administered at the conclusion of this laboratory interaction. RESULTS: Most student pharmacists and simulated patients who are deaf/hard of hearing reported feeling able to effectively communicate their needs to the other individual in their dyad (pharmacist or patient) during their health care interactions. Using an iPad (Apple Inc) app to communicate significantly increased student pharmacist and simulated patient comfort with health care communication from preintervention to postintervention.

This led to the UK government advising patients with blood cancers to shield, massive re-organisation of NHS haematology and cancer services, and changes in treatment plans for thousands of patients. Given the unknown effects that relaxation of social distancing measures will have on the infection rate, we review the evidence to date to see whether a history of haematological malignancy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Multivariable analysis of large population studies, taking other known risk factors into account do indicate that patients with haematological malignancy, especially those diagnosed recently are at increased risk of death with COVID-19 compared to the general population. The evidence that this risk is higher than for those with solid malignancies is conflicting. There is suggestive evidence from smaller cohort studies that those with myeloid malignancy may be at increased risk within the blood cancer population, but this needs to be confirmed on larger studies. Ongoing large collaborative efforts are required to gain further evidence regarding specific risk factors for severe complications of COVID-19.","El-Sharkawi, Dima; Iyengar, Sunil",Br. j. haematol,431,12

Aim Of The Study: evaluate the preliminary impact of CoVID-19 in three Italian Orthopedics and Traumatology Departments in the first 10 weeks of the national lockdown. We focused on proximal humerus fractures, analyzing data and results in comparison with the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 22nd to May 3rd 2020, 55 patients were admitted to our departments for promixal humerus fractures. Our cohort of patients is composed by 13 males (23.6%) and 42 females (76.4%), with an average age of 73.8 ± 11.7 years (range 44 - 94). Trauma occurred at home in 43 cases (78.2%), by the roadside in 10 cases (18.2%), in a retirement home in 1 case (1.8%), and at work in 1 case (1.8%). We proposed surgical treatment in 15/55 cases, but 4 patients refused hospitalization, mainly because of the risk of contracting n-CoV19 infection. RESULTS: We noticed a decrease in proximal humerus fractures compared to 2019 (-37.5%). Particularly, we observed a significant drop in traumas occurred on the road and at work respectively 23.9% and 3.4%% in 2019, and 18.2% and 1.8% in 2020, probably due to the consequences of the national lockdown. Sports traumas had a reset during the pandemic (6 cases in 2019, 0 in 2020). As consequence, surgical treatment had a decrease due to the reduction in number of fractures, indications and patient's consent. CONCLUSION: The incidence of proximal humerus fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread. We assume that the reasons of this reduction are to be found in the national lockdown (since March 10th, 2020) and Ministerial Decrees that limited the access to the E.R. only in case of severe traumas in order to avoid CoVID-19 spread.","Maniscalco, Pietro; Ciatti, Corrado; Gattoni, Serena; Quattrini, Fabrizio; Puma Pagliarello, Calogero; Patane039,; Caterina, Angela; Capelli, Patrizio; Banchini, Filippo; Rivera, Fabrizio; Sanna, Francesco; Nonne, Daniela; Di Maggio, Bruno; Scaravilli, Gabriele",Acta Biomed,431,1

By the use of different valves incorporated to the circuit, the device enables the restriction of possible cross contamination and the individualization of tidal volumes, driving pressures, and positive end expiratory pressure PEEP. Possible interactions in the expiratory dynamics of different pairs of patients are evaluated in terms of the characteristic exhalatory times. These characteristic times can not be easily established using simple linear lumped element models. For this purpose, a 1D model using the Hydraulic and Mechanical libraries in Matlab Simulink was developed. In this sense, experiments accompany this study to validate the model and characterize the different valves of the circuit. Our results show that connecting two patients in parallel to a ventilator always resulted in delays of time during the exhalation. The size of this effect depends on different parameters associated with the patients, the circuit and the ventilator. The dynamics of the exhalation of both patients is determined by the ratios between patients exhalatory resistances, compliances, driving pressures and PEEPs. Adverse effects on exhalations became less noticeable when respiratory parameters of both patients were similar, flow resistances of valves added to the circuit were negligible, and when the ventilator exhalatory valve resistance was also negligible. The asymmetries of driving pressures, compliances or resistances exacerbated the possibility of auto-PEEP and the increase in relaxation times became greater in one patient than in the other. In contrast, exhalatory dynamics were less sensitive to the ratio of PEEP imposed to the patients.","Garcia Eijo, Pedro M; D039,; Adamo, Juan; Bianchetti, Arturo; Duriez, Thomas; Cabaleiro, Juan M; Irrazabal, Célica; Otero, Pablo; Artana, Guillermo",PLoS One,431,26

I provide four responses that clinicians may offer their patients: 1) Ethical analyses of moral complicity and COVID vaccines. 2) Altruism and protecting others from a virus that is often transmitted while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. 3) Religious texts and many religious leaders support prevention and, therefore, vaccination. 4) Administration of vaccines not developed in fetal cell lines.

However, some patients fail to normalize, and their condition is often referred to as tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THPT). Surgical consensus on the timing of post-transplant parathyroidectomy (PTX) for THPT has not been reached. Herein, we report a case of a 58-year-old post-transplant woman, considering the concrete timing of PTX for both SHPT and THPT. She initiated hemodialysis with end-stage renal disease at the age of 24, and underwent first kidney transplantation at the age of 28. When peritoneal dialysis (PD) was induced due to the worsening kidney function at the age of 50, the serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level remarkably increased (2332 pg/mL). Although cinacalcet was administered, the patient's iPTH levels were not sufficiently suppressed for seven years. Diagnostic images including ultrasound, computed tomography, and 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy indicated THPT as the reason for prolonged post-transplant hypercalcemia. Therefore, PTX was performed 14 months after the second transplantation. Histology showed nodular hyperplasia of all parathyroid glands, indicating autonomous secretion of parathyroid hormone. In general, patients with more severe THPT are recognized with more severe SHPT prior to transplantation during the dialysis period. We should consider a referral for surgery based on the individual risk factors. We recommend to perform parathyroidectomy earlier, before the kidney transplantation in the clinical suspicion of severe SHPT.","Masaki, Chiaki; Ogawa, Shoto; Shima, Hisato; Banno, Taro; Tsuyuguchi, Masaru; Nagasaka, Naoki; Tashiro, Manabu; Inoue, Tomoko; Tada, Hiroaki; Wariishi, Seiichiro; Miya, Keiko; Kawahara, Kazuhiko; Takamatsu, Norimichi; Okada, Kazuyoshi; Minakuchi, Jun",CEN case reports,431,1

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We asked representative samples in 7 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands and the UK) about their blood donation activity and motivation to donate using an online survey. We analysed donor turnout during the COVID-19 period descriptively and using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 7122 people that responded to the survey, 1205 (16·9%) blood donors were identified, with 33·8% donating during the first 4-5 months of the COVID-19 period. We observed that around half of donors donated less than normal. The vast majority of donors that did donate made a special effort to do so in response to COVID-19. The majority of donors were also not aware of their blood being tested for COVID-19 antibodies. Although the perceived risk of infection among all respondents whilst donating blood was relatively low, those who anticipated a high risk of infection were much less likely to donate (OR = 0·540; P-value = 0·006). Furthermore, those that were adherent to COVID guidelines were also less likely to donate (OR = 0·583; P-value = 0·000). DISCUSSION: We suggest that blood collection services consider specialist campaigns that focus on the altruistic motivation of donors during the crisis and that they continue to communicate the additional safety measures in place with the aim of reducing the fear of infection whilst donating blood.","Chandler, Torsten; Neumann-Böhme, Sebastian; Sabat, Iryna; Barros, Pedro Pita; Brouwer, Werner; van Exel, Job; Schreyögg, Jonas; Torbica, Aleksandra; Stargardt, Tom",Vox sang,431,10

As pressures mount on healthcare systems to provide treatment to patients, mHealth is seen as one of the possible solutions to addressing these challenges. Given the sensitivity of health data, the rapid development of the mHealth sector raises privacy concerns. The aims of this research were to investigate privacy threats/concerns in the context of mHealth and the management of chronic diseases and to propose a novel privacy framework to address these concerns. Subject and method: The study adopted a modified version of the engineering design process. After defining the problem, information was gathered through literature reviews, and analyses of existing regulatory (privacy) frameworks and past research on privacy threats/concerns. Requirements for a new framework were then specified leading to its development and comparison with existing frameworks. Results: A novel future-proof privacy framework was developed and illustrated. Using existing regulatory frameworks for privacy and privacy threats/concerns from research studies, privacy principles and their resulting requirements were identified. Furthermore, mechanisms and associated technologies needed to implement the privacy principles/requirements into a functional prototype were also identified. A comparison of the proposed framework with existing frameworks, showed that it addressed privacy threats/concerns in a more comprehensive manner. Conclusion: This research makes a valuable contribution to protecting privacy in mHealth. The novel framework developed is an improvement on existing frameworks. It is also future-proof since its foundations are built on regulatory frameworks and privacy threats/concerns existing at the time of its deployment/revision.","Jusob, Farad Rafique; George, Carlisle; Mapp, Glenford",Z Gesundh Wiss,431,1

METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. A list of emotional states was compared in HCW and non-HCW and within HCW roles. The relationship between COVID-19 related symptoms, information, and protective measures and the emotional state was analyzed. RESULTS: Fear (p < .001, &#966;c = .11), irritability (p = .001, &#966;c = .08), frustration (p < .001, &#966;c = .10), anger (p = .013, &#966;c = .06), and helplessness (p < .001, &#966;c = .13) appear significantly more frequently in HCW compared to non-HCW. Within HCW, a higher percentage of physicians, especially the less experienced, significantly perceived uncertainty and frustration (p = .001, &#966;c = .13 and p = .025, &#966;c = .10, respectively), while a higher percentage of nurses significantly experienced sadness (p = .024, &#966;c = .10). Having a confirmatory diagnosis of the disease was related to hypochondria sensation (p = .026, &#966;c = .10). Sadness (p = .035, &#966;c = .09), intolerance (p = .058, &#966;c = .09), anger (p = .024, &#966;c = .10), and helplessness (p = .028, &#966;c = .10) appeared as the most relevant emotions when information was perceived as insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of the most prevalent different emotional patterns in HCW, as well as in the general population, will allow the detection of subjects at risk for the development of mental disorders and the implementation of therapeutic approaches in future similar situations of pandemic or outbreak of the current one.

Continuing to deliver time-critical surgical care is important to avoid excess morbidity and mortality from pathologies unrelated to COVID-19. We describe the implementation and short-term surgical outcomes from a system to deliver time-critical elective surgical care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A protocol for the prioritisation and safe delivery of time-critical surgery at a COVID-19 'clean' site was implemented at the Nuffield Health Exeter Hospital, an independent sector hospital in the southwest of England. Outcomes to 30 days postoperatively were recorded, including unplanned admissions after daycase surgery, readmissions and complications, as well as the incidence of perioperative COVID-19 infection in patients and staff. RESULTS: A total of 128 surgical procedures were performed during a 31-day period by a range of specialties including breast, plastics, urology, gynaecology, vascular and cardiology. There was one unplanned admission and and two readmissions. Six complications were identified, and all were Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2. All 128 patients had preoperative COVID-19 swabs, one of which was positive and the patient had their surgery delayed. Ten patients were tested for COVID-19 postoperatively, with none testing positive. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the implementation of a safe system for delivery of time-critical elective surgical care at a COVID-19 clean site. Other healthcare providers may benefit from implementation of similar methodology as hospitals plan to restart elective surgery.","Burden, E G; Walker, R W; Ferguson, D J; Goubran, Amf; Howell, J R; John, J B; Khan, F; McGrath, J S; Evans, J P",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,431,16

Here, with a focus on Israel, we sequence 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. We find that travelers returning from the United States of America significantly contributed to viral spread in Israel, more than their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimate that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around 2.5, dropping by more than two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. We further report high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 2-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections. Overall, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures for reducing viral spread.","Miller, Danielle; Martin, Michael A; Harel, Noam; Tirosh, Omer; Kustin, Talia; Meir, Moran; Sorek, Nadav; Gefen-Halevi, Shiraz; Amit, Sharon; Vorontsov, Olesya; Shaag, Avraham; Wolf, Dana; Peretz, Avi; Shemer-Avni, Yonat; Roif-Kaminsky, Diana; Kopelman, Naama M; Huppert, Amit; Koelle, Katia; Stern, Adi",Nat Commun,431,24

Older adults are the most sedentary age group, and decreasing sitting time represents an intervention target for improving health. Determinants of sedentary behavior have been examined in older adults living in their own homes, yet less is known about sedentary behavior of older adults in residential care facilities. The purpose of this study was to explore factors contributing to sedentary behavior among residents of independent and assisted living facilities. We conducted eight focus groups with residents (n = 44) and semi-structured interviews with staff (n = 6) across four living facilities. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative, inductive approach. Three salient themes were identified. Residents and staff both viewed sedentary behavior negatively unless it was in the context of social engagement. Additionally, fear of falling was discussed as a significant contributor to sedentary behavior. Finally, residents felt the community living environment contributed to their sedentary behavior while staff did not. Our findings provide valuable insight for designing targeted interventions for older adults in residential facilities and suggest thinking beyond the individual and considering environmental influences on sedentary behavior in the residential care setting.","Kotlarczyk, Mary P; Hergenroeder, Andrea L; Gibbs, Bethany Barone; Cameron, Flor de Abril; Hamm, Megan E; Brach, Jennifer S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),431,16

In February 2020, the World Health Organization acronymed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, for coronavirus disease 2019. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many cases of COVID-19 resolve quickly. However, the disease, which, like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. Infection with COVID-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. Moreover, because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself, such as pulmonary embolism, or its treatment, such as nausea and diarrhea, diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Potential COVID-19 rule out criteria, based on the Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism, another protean disease entity, are provided as a decision-making aid.

Its rapid replication and high transmissibility can lead to serious consequences not only to the individual but also to collective health, causing deep economic impacts. In this scenario, diagnosis tools are of significant importance, allowing the rapid, precise, and low-cost testing of a substantial number of individuals. Currently, PCR-based techniques are the gold standard for the diagnosis of viral diseases. Although these allow the diagnosis of different illnesses with high precision, they still present significant drawbacks. Their main disadvantages include long periods for obtaining results and the need for specialized professionals and equipment, requiring the tests to be performed in research centers. In this scenario, biosensors have been presented as promising alternatives for the rapid, precise, low-cost, and on-site diagnosis of viral diseases. This critical review article describes the advancements achieved in the last five years regarding electrochemical biosensors for the diagnosis of viral infections. First, genosensors and aptasensors for the detection of virus and the diagnosis of viral diseases are presented in detail regarding probe immobilization approaches, detection methods (label-free and sandwich), and amplification strategies. Following, immunosensors are highlighted, including many different construction strategies such as label-free, sandwich, competitive, and lateral-flow assays. Then, biosensors for the detection of viral-diseases-related biomarkers are presented and discussed, as well as point of care systems and their advantages when compared to traditional techniques. Last, the difficulties of commercializing electrochemical devices are critically discussed in conjunction with future trends such as lab-on-a-chip and flexible sensors.","Brazaca, Laís Canniatti; Dos Santos, Pãmyla Layene; de Oliveira, Paulo Roberto; Rocha, Diego Pessoa; Stefano, Jéssica Santos; Kalinke, Cristiane; Abarza Muñoz, Rodrigo Alejandro; Bonacin, Juliano Alves; Janegitz, Bruno Campos; Carrilho, Emanuel",Anal Chim Acta,431,1

We present a comparison of electronic adherence data of stroke patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 in Switzerland. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis using data from the ongoing MAAESTRO study, in which stroke patients with atrial fibrillation electronically monitor their adherence to DOAC treatment. Eligible patients for this analysis had at least four weeks of adherence data prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Three adherence metrics (taking adherence, timing adherence, drug holidays) were calculated and compared descriptively. RESULTS: The analysis included eight patients (median age 81.5 years, IQR 74.8-84.5). Five patients had a pre-lockdown taking adherence over 90% (mean 96.8% ± 2.9), with no change during lockdown, high timing adherence in both periods and no drug holidays. The remaining three patients had pre-lockdown taking and timing adherence below 90%. Of those, two patients showed a moderate decline either in taking or timing adherence compared to pre-lockdown. One showed a substantial increase in taking and timing adherence during lockdown (both + 25.8%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that a major disruption of social life (i.e., the imposed COVID-19 lockdown) is unlikely to relevantly affect the medication intake behaviour of patients with high pre-established adherence, but might have an impact in patients with previously suboptimal adherence.

DESIGN: We reviewed how the pandemic adversely influences many of these behaviors, specifically physical activity, sedentary behaviors, sleep, and dietary intakes, and provided individual level strategies that may be used to mitigate them. RESULTS: At the community level and higher, public health and health care professionals need to advocate for intervention strategies and policy changes that address these behaviors, such as increasing nutrition assistance programs and creating designated areas for recreation and active transportation, to reduce disparities among vulnerable populations. CONCLUSIONS: The long-lasting impact of the pandemic on health behaviors, and the possibility of a second COVID-19 wave, emphasize the need for creative and evolving, multi-level approaches to assist individuals in adapting their health behaviors to prevent both chronic and infectious diseases.","Parekh, Niyati; Deierlein, Andrea L",Public Health Nutr,431,16

The implication is that the usual fixes to outbreaks of infectious diseases (ie, surveillance, pharmaceutical measures, and non-pharmaceutical measures) will be insufficient without a thorough reappraisal of and investment in planetary health. Given the heterogeneity and diversity of environments and populations, we envisage these actions as a matter for the generation of new kinds of public, requiring widespread and multiple forms of engagement to generate lasting solutions. We use and extend the concept of healthy publics to suggest a movement that can start to reclaim planetary health as a collective and ongoing issue.","Hinchliffe, Stephen; Manderson, Lenore; Moore, Martin",Lancet Planet Health,431,22

In particular, the delivery of subsidies based on biometric identification has been found to magnify exclusions, imply informational asymmetries, and reproduce policy structures that negatively affect recipients. In this paper, we use a data justice lens to study Rythu Bharosa, a social welfare scheme targeting farmers in the Andhra Pradesh state of India. While coverage of the scheme in terms of number of recipients is reportedly high, our fieldwork revealed three forms of data justice to be monitored for intended recipients. A first form is design-related, as mismatches of recipients with their registered biometric credentials and bank account details are associated to denial of subsidies. A second form is informational, as users who do not receive subsidies are often not informed of the reason why it is so, or of the grievance redressal processes available to them. To these dimensions our data add a structural one, centred on the conditionality of subsidy to approval by landowners, which forces tenant farmers to request a type of landowner consent that reproduces existing patterns of class and caste subordination. Identifying such data justice issues, the paper adds to problematisations of digital social welfare systems, contributing a structural dimension to studies of data justice in digital social protection.","Masiero, Silvia; Buddha, Chakradhar",,431,13

This virus outbreaks like an epidemic, transmitted quickly among population due to social interaction with the infected individual. This research focuses on examining virus spreading rate among the individuals accurately. In the proposed work, to analyze the behavior of the virus spreading rate, a probabilistic mathematical model is designed. It consists of three stages namely Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and formulated using mean field approximation method. Initially, to limit the virus spreading rate, a threshold value is obtained using reproductive ratio which is derived by performing stability analysis. In addition, to control the virus spreading rate of the individuals, optimization control technique is introduced on both states of the susceptible and infected individual population. It is demonstrated through simulation studies that the optimal control of the susceptible population by the proposed model is achieved in 7 to 11 days whereas the existing models have taken 20 to 45 days. Likewise, for infected population, the optimal control is achieved in 12 to 15 days by the proposed model whereas the existing models take 35 to 50 days. In order to prove the accuracy of the model, a real time Covid-19 data from France country is also demonstrated. © 2021 IEEE.","Pradeep, R.; Myilsamy, K.; Vijaykumar, V. R.; Kumar, A.

Both the continuous accumulation of point mutations, owed to the naturally imposed genomic plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary processes, as well as viral spread over time, allow this RNA virus to gain new genetic identities, spawn novel variants and enhance its potential for immune evasion. Here, through an in-depth phylogenetic clustering analysis of upwards of 200,000 whole-genome sequences, we reveal the presence of not previously reported and hitherto unidentified mutations and recombination breakpoints in Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI) from Brazil, India (Beta, Eta and Kappa) and the USA (Beta, Eta and Lambda). Additionally, we identify sites with shared mutations under directional evolution in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-encoding protein of VOC and VOI, tracing a heretofore-undescribed correlation with viral spread in South America, India and the USA. Our evidence-based analysis provides well-supported evidence of similar pathways of evolution for such mutations in all SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-lineages. This raises two pivotal points: the co-circulation of variants and sub-lineages in close evolutionary environments, which sheds light onto their trajectories into convergent and directional evolution (i), and a linear perspective into the prospective vaccine efficacy against different SARS-CoV-2 strains (ii).","Nunes, Danilo Rosa; Braconi, Carla Torres; Ludwig-Begall, Louisa; Arns, Clarice Weis; Janini, Luiz Mario Ramos; Duraes-Carvalho, Ricardo",,431,29

Therapies based on the Shenghuang Granule have proved helpful in viral infection and septic shock. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the traditional Chinese medicine, Shenhuang Granule, with standard care in hospitalized patients with severe/critical COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. At 4 medical centers, a total of 111 severe/critical patients were randomly assigned to receive Shenhuang Granule (SHG group) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or to receive standard care alone (Control group). The maximal follow up time was 75 days. The clinical endpoint was clinical improvement and mortality. RESULTS: 54 patients were assigned to the control group and 57 to the SHG group. The overall mortality was 75.9% (41/54) in the control group, and 38.6% (22/57) in the SHG group (p < 0.01 vs. control). The post hoc analysis showed that in the severe category, the mortality of the control group vs. the SHG group was 58.8% (10/17) vs. 5.3% (1/19) (p < 0.01); while in the critical category, it was 83.8% (31/37) vs. 55.3% (21/38) (p < 0.05). In the severe category, the mortality of patients who eventually received an invasive ventilator in the control vs. the SHG group was 58.8% (10/17) vs. 0 (0/19) (p < 0.01). Administration of SHG was associated with increased lymphocytes and decreased adverse events. CONCLUSION: Shenhuang Granule is a promising integrative therapy for severe and critical COVID-19.","Zhou, Shuang; Feng, Jun; Xie, Qin; Huang, Tingrong; Xu, Xiaoming; Zhou, Daixing; Zhang, Wen; Sun, Shuting; Liu, Xudong; Wu, Xinxin; Che, Jinhua; Fan, Tian; Zou, Dengxiu; Wang, Junshuai; Zhan, Daqian; Peng, Dan; Feng, Yikuan; Yu, Gang; Yuan, Zuobiao; Fang, Bangjiang",Phytomedicine,431,24

Para isto 150 isolados (123 de vacas e 27 de cabras) foram analisadas. Os fatores de virulência envolvidos na adesão às células do hospedeiro (fnbA/B e clfA/B), toxinas (sea - sei, tsst, hla e hlb) e os genes polissacáridos capsulares (cap5 e cap8 ) foram detectados pela PCR. 138 isolados de S. aureus foram avaliados quanto à formação de biofilme por espectrofotometria em microplacas e determinou-se a Concentração Mínima Inibitória (MIC) e a Concentração Mínima Bactericida (MBC) frente a nanopartículas de PPy. O potencial tóxigênico, indicado pelo número de genes de toxinas por isolado, revelou que os isolados de cabras apresentam um maior potencial. O genótipo cap8 apresentou maior potencial de virulência, indicado pelo número de genes apresentado por isolado. O genótipo cap5 foi mais frequente (70.67%), especialmente nos isolados de vacas. A MIC e a MBC do PPy frente a S. aureus foi de 125/mL para todos os isolados, independente da produção de biofilme. Novas medidas de controle deverão ser implementadas, em especial em rebanhos caprinos onde os isolados circulantes apresentaram maior potencial tóxico.

Data on daily confirmed cases, together with weather parameters, were collected from the first day of COVID confirmed cases in each country to 31 August 2020. The weather parameters were Rainfall (mm), relative humidity (%), maximum and minimum temperature (°C), surface pressure (kPa), maximum air pollutants matter PM 2.5 (µg/m3) and maximum wind speed (m/s). Data were analyzed for each investigated countries separately by using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variables (ARIMAX) model. We found that maximum wind speed had significant negative impact on COVID-19 transmission in India (-209.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): -369.13, -49.77) and Sri Lanka (-2.77, 95% CI: -4.77, -0.77). Apart from India, temperature had mixed effects (i.e., positive or negative) in four countries in South Asia. For example, maximum temperature had negative impact (-30.52, 95% CI: -60.24, -0.78) in Bangladesh and positive impact (5.10, 95% CI: 0.06, 10.14) in Afghanistan. Whereas rainfall had negative effects (-48.64, 95% CI: -80.17, -17.09) in India and mixed effects in Pakistan. Besides, maximum air pollutants matter PM 2.5 was negatively associated with the confirmed cases of COVID-19. In conclusion, maximum wind speed, rainfall, air pollutants (maximum PM 2.5) and temperature are four variables that could play a vital role in the transmission of COVID-19. Although there is a mixed conclusion regarding weather parameters and COVID-19 transmission, we recommend developing environmental policies regarding the transmission of COVID-19 in South Asian countries.","Hossain, Md Sabbir; Ahmed, Sulaiman; Uddin, Md Jamal",Sci Total Environ,431,24

METHODS: Patients who had stable pain and functional outcome scores over the preceding 2 years were enrolled in a local prospectively collected adult spinal deformity (ASD) database. A reanalysis of their SRS22, ODI and SF-36 data 14 days into confinement were compared to their last pre-confinement scores. RESULTS: 89 patients were included in this study (average age 60.7 years, 91% female) with an average time from last FU until confinement of 9.6 months. The ODI total score worsened by 5 points post-confinement with no difference seen in personal care, walking and social life. In contrast, the SRS-22 score showed small improvements in function/activity and satisfaction, but no significant differences for the other domains. Similarly, the SF-36 showed small improvements in physical function, physical and emotional role, vitality and PCS. CONCLUSION: The global COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing confinement had variable overall effects on ASD patients, without the expected marked worsening. In addition, this study illustrates that the SRS-22 questionnaire is less influenced by environmental and psychological factors than the ODI supporting its objectivity and accuracy in the evaluation of the QoL of ASD patients.","Kieser, D C; Bourghli, A; Larrieu, D; Cawley, D T; Hayashi, K; Jakinapally, S; Pizones, J; Boissiere, L; Obeid, I",Spine Deform,431,24

The monitoring station at Hateruma Island observes the outflow of Chinese emissions during winter and spring. A systematic increase in the &#916;CO2/&#916;CH4 ratio, governed by synoptic wind variability, well corroborated the increase in China's fossil-fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions during 1997-2019.

Literature has increasingly highlighted PTSD as a major issue that involves both staff and healthcare organizations; the consequences of PTSD may include medication errors and lower standards of care. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses the need for preventing PTSD in HCWs working closely with COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the latest developments in assessing and managing the occupational risk of PTSD symptoms in hospital HCWs. METHODS: We searched for publications in MEDLINE/Pubmed using selected keywords. Each article was reviewed and categorized into one or more of the following four categories based on its subject matter: risk assessment, risk management and occurrence rates. RESULTS: Our search resulted in a total of 32 publications that matched our inclusion criteria. Increased years of service, older age, previous year exposure to violence, personality traits (i.e. neuroticism), history of mental disorders, being non-graduates, were found to be workers' pre-trauma factors predicting PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the need to prioritize preventative interventions aimed to anticipate the effects of traumatic exposure by training HCWs in evidence based anticipatory methods of coping with stressful events. With regard to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we found evidence of the need to strength social support and training targeted at psychological skills of medical staff who treated COVID-19 patients.","D039,; Ettorre, Gabriele; Pellicani, Vincenza; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo",Acta Biomed,431,16

We investigated the impact of routine infant BCG vaccination on prevention of local COVID-19 spread. METHODS: Data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, annual routine infant BCG vaccine coverage (represented by the number of BCG vaccinations per live births), and other candidate factors in each prefecture were obtained from the official notifications database in Japan. We analysed the association of vaccine coverage with the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The BCG vaccine coverage in 1999-2002, 2004, and 2012 in five prefectures with no COVID-19 infections was significantly higher than that in five prefectures with a high prevalence of infections (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05).

Health systems may be uniquely suited to support these workers given their medical expertise, and mobile apps can reach local communities despite social distancing requirements. Formal evaluation of real-world mobile app-based interventions is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the adoption, acceptability, and appropriateness of an academic medical center-sponsored app-based intervention (COVID-19 Guide App) designed to support access of first responders and essential workers to COVID-19 information and testing services. We also sought to better understand the COVID-19-related needs of these workers early in the pandemic. METHODS: To understand overall community adoption, views and download data of the COVID-19 Guide App were described. To understand the adoption, appropriateness, and acceptability of the app and the unmet needs of workers, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone, by video, and in person with first responders and essential workers in the San Francisco Bay Area who were recruited through purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. Interview transcripts and field notes were qualitatively analyzed and presented using an implementation outcomes framework. RESULTS: From its launch in April 2020 to September 2020, the app received 8262 views from unique devices and 6640 downloads (80.4% conversion rate, 0.61% adoption rate across the Bay Area). App acceptability was mixed among the 17 first responders interviewed and high among the 10 essential workers interviewed. Select themes included the need for personalized and accurate information, access to testing, and securing personal safety. First responders faced additional challenges related to interprofessional coordination and a ""culture of heroism"" that could both protect against and exacerbate health vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: First responders and essential workers both reported challenges related to obtaining accurate information, testing services, and other resources. A mobile app intervention has the potential to combat these challenges through the provision of disease-specific information and access to testing services but may be most effective if delivered as part of a larger ecosystem of support. Differentiated interventions that acknowledge and address the divergent needs between first responders and non-first responder essential workers may optimize acceptance and adoption.","Vilendrer, Stacie; Amano, Alexis; Brown Johnson, Cati G; Favet, Marissa; Safaeinili, Nadia; Villasenor, Jacqueline; Shaw, Jonathan G; Hertelendy, Attila J; Asch, Steven M; Mahoney, Megan",J Med Internet Res,431,11

While rapidly growing in prominence, RT-LAMP remains a relatively new method compared to the standard RT-qPCR, and contribution to our body of knowledge on designing LAMP primer sets and assays can have significant impact on its utility and adoption. Here we evaluate 18 LAMP primer sets for SARS-CoV-2, comparing speed and sensitivity with different LAMP formulations and conditions across more than 5,000 RT-LAMP reactions and identifying several primer sets with similar high sensitivity for different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. Significantly we observe a consistent sensitivity enhancement by combining primer sets for different targets, confirming and building on earlier work to create a simple, general approach to building better and more sensitive RT-LAMP assays.","Tanner, Nathan; Zhang, Yinhua",,431,1

Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making.AimOur objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies.MethodsWe developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT90) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls.ResultsIgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT90 were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT90 tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test.ConclusionUsing IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT90, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies.","Perera, Ranawaka Apm; Mok, Chris Kp; Tsang, Owen Ty; Lv, Huibin; Ko, Ronald Lw; Wu, Nicholas C; Yuan, Meng; Leung, Wai Shing; Chan, Jacky Mc; Chik, Thomas Sh; Choi, Chris Yc; Leung, Kathy; Chan, Kin Ho; Chan, Karl Ck; Li, Ka-Chi; Wu, Joseph T; Wilson, Ian A; Monto, Arnold S; Poon, Leo Lm; Peiris, Malik",Euro surveill,431,16

Decision-makers need to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Yet little is known about the factors influencing adherence and understanding of lockdown measures among the Palestinian community. This study aimed to assess the impact and factors affecting these early public health interventions. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed throughout social media (Facebook and Instagram). We used a snowball recruiting technique to target Palestinian adult citizens during the coronavirus pandemic quarantine between 6 and 16 April 2020, which corresponded to almost the middle interval of the strict massive lockdown measures in Palestine that lasted from 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed for the outcome variables (staying home adherence, in-home precautions adherence, and quarantine understanding). Results: Our questionnaire was completed by 2,819 participants. The mean (range) age was 29.47 (18-71) years. Of them, 1,144 (40.6%), 1,261 (44.7%), and 1,283 (45.5%) reported low levels of staying home adherence, in-home precautions adherence, and quarantine understanding, respectively. Females, city residents, those with higher educational levels, and those informed by official government sources were associated significantly with higher levels of both staying home adherence and quarantine understanding. Adequate food supply was associated with a higher level of staying home adherence. Higher levels of in-home precautions adherence were noticed in the elderly and those with a high-risk group living at home. Higher monthly income was inversely associated with higher levels of in-home precautions adherence and lower levels of quarantine understanding (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The socio-economic and financial status of the general population and coordination between the major information resources (official government), social media, and the press were the major factors affecting the community in regard to quarantine adherence. For maximum effectiveness and commitment levels amongst the people to decrease the spread of infection, policymakers need to address all those factors. In addition, clear communication between policymakers and the population is essential for reassuring the people and minimizing their fears regarding the unknown future.","Al Zabadi, Hamzeh; Yaseen, Noor; Alhroub, Thair; Haj-Yahya, Maryam",Front Public Health,431,21

METHODS: A brief simulation training exercise was designed in conjunction with the development of a COVID-19 Tracheostomy Protocol. The simulation training focused primarily on provider safety, pre and post-surgical steps and the proper use of enhanced PPE. Simulation training was performed in the simulation lab at the institution over 2 days. Pre and post self-evaluations were measured using standardized clinical competency questionnaires on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from ""No knowledge, unable to perform"" up to ""Highly knowledgeable and confident, independent."" RESULTS: Physicians self-reported a significant increase in knowledge and competency immediately after completing the training exercise. Resident physicians increased from a mean score of 3.00 to 4.67, p-value 0.0041, mean increase 1.67 (CI 95% 0.81 to 2.52). Attending physicians increased from a mean score of 2.89 to 4.67, p-value 0.0002, mean increase 1.78 (CI 95% 1.14 to 2.42). Overall, all participants increased from a mean score of 3.06 to 4.71, p-value 0.0001, mean increase 1.65 (CI 95% 1.24 to 2.05). DISCUSSION: Implementation of this simulation training at our institution resulted in a significant increase in physician confidence regarding the safe performance of tracheostomy surgery in COVID-19 patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Adoption of standardized COVID-19 tracheostomy simulation training at centers treating COVID-19 patients may result in improved physician safety and enhanced confidence in anticipation of performing these procedures in real-life scenarios.","LoSavio, Phillip S; Eggerstedt, Michael; Tajudeen, Bobby A; Papagiannopoulos, Peter; Revenaugh, Peter C; Batra, Pete S; Husain, Inna",Am J Otolaryngol,431,19

The measures include instructions that individuals maintain social distance when in public, school closures, limitations on gatherings and business operations, and instructions to remain at home. Social distancing may have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime. Crimes such as residential burglary may decrease as a byproduct of increased guardianship over personal space and property. Crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact between potential offenders and victims. Understanding the impact of social distancing on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the evolving crisis. Understanding how social distancing policies impact crime may also provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures.

The possibility of a second wave of infections and deaths raises the question of what interventions can be used to significantly reduce deaths while supporting, not preventing, economic recovery. We use a five-age epidemiological model combined with sixty-six-sector economic accounting to examine policies to avert and to respond to a second wave. We find that a second round of economic shutdowns alone are neither sufficient nor necessary to avert or quell a second wave. In contrast, noneconomic NPIs, such as wearing masks and personal distancing, increasing testing and quarantine, reintroducing restrictions on social and recreational gatherings, and enhancing protections for the elderly together can mitigate a second wave while leaving room for an economic recovery. © 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

Design/methodology/approach: The contribution of the structural shocks that explain the behaviour of the main macroeconomic aggregates during 2020 are estimated, and the effects of economic policies are simulated using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model estimated for the Spanish economy. Findings: The results highlight the importance of supply and demand shocks in explaining the COVID-19 crisis. The annual fall in gross domestic product (GDP) moderates at least by 7.6 points in the most intense period of the crisis, thanks to these stabilizing policies. Finally, the potential effects of Next Generation EU in the Spanish economy are estimated. Assuming that Spain may receive from the EU between 1.5 and 2.25 percentage points (pp) of GDP, activity could increase to between 2 and 3 pp in 2024. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the exercises and findings are original. All these results show the usefulness of a DSGE model, such as the estimated rational expectation model for Spain, as a practical tool for the applied economic analysis, the macroeconomic assessment of economic policies and the understanding of the Spanish economy. © 2020, J.E.

Thus, the main purpose of the current study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of a single online counselling session in reducing psychopathological symptoms (i.e., state anxiety and negative affect) and increasing individual well-being and positive affect during the first Italian lockdown. Fifty-three subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive an online counselling session [Online Counselling Group (OCG) = 26] or to act as controls [Waiting List Group (WLG) = 27].

We finally discuss the idea of exercise as a potential adjuvant against COVID-19 and emphasize how even interrupting prolonged periods of sitting with short time breaks of very light activity could be a feasible strategy to limit the deleterious effects of the outbreak.","Methnani, Jabeur; Amor, Dorra; Yousfi, Nariman; Bouslama, Ali; Omezzine, Asma; Bouhlel, Ezdine",J. sports med. phys. fit,431,16

The Corona virus Response Team inaugurated a relief food distribution campaign, ensuing from the countrywide COVID-19 lockdown to counter the rising food insecurities in many urban and rural poor households. However, the relief response campaign has received a lot of critics from both rural and urban communities who were planned as the beneficiaries. Three months into the COVID-19 pandemic the population reports; delays in the distribution, poor quality supplies, arrests and continued restrictions, slow paced distribution among household, and a negative impact on the health care system. As a learning from the current experience, we recommend; a multisectoral engagement, better planning, a decentralized food distribution, and formulation of clear food distribution guidelines to guide the future responses. Use of mobile cash transfers to reach out to the food insecure households can support local economies and lower the cost on middlemen and interrelated corruption.","Nathan, Isabirye; Benon, Musasizi",Pan Afr Med J,431,20

METHODS: We supplemented a rapid literature search (including unpublished, non-peer reviewed and ongoing studies/reports) on dementia wellbeing in the context of COVID-19 with expert group members' consensus about future research needs. From this we generated potential research questions the group judged to be relevant that were not covered by the existing literature. RESULTS: Themes emerged from 141 studies within the six domains of the NHS England COVID-19 Dementia Wellbeing Pathway: Preventing Well, Diagnosing Well, Treating Well, Supporting Well, Living Well and Dying Well. We describe current research findings and knowledge gaps relating to the impact on people affected by dementia (individuals with a diagnosis, their carers and social contacts, health and social care practitioners and volunteers), services, research activities and organisations. Broad themes included the potential benefits and risks of new models of working including remote healthcare, the need for population-representative longitudinal studies to monitor longer-term impacts, and the importance of reporting dementia-related findings within broader health and care studies. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionately negative impact on people affected by dementia. Researchers and funding organisations have responded rapidly to try to understand the impacts. Future research should highlight and resolve outstanding questions to develop evidence-based measures to improve the quality of life of people affected by dementia.","Liu, Kathy Y; Howard, Robert; Banerjee, Sube; Comas-Herrera, Adelina; Goddard, Joanne; Knapp, Martin; Livingston, Gill; Manthorpe, Jill; O039,; Brien, John T; Paterson, Ross W; Robinson, Louise; Rossor, Martin; Rowe, James B; Sharp, David J; Sommerlad, Andrew; Suárez-González, Aida; Burns, Alistair",Int. j. geriatr. psychiatry,431,25

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which initially appeared in China at the end of 2019, exhibits a high infectivity and pathogenicity compared to other coronaviruses. As the viral coat and other viral components are recognized as being foreign by the immune system, this can lead to initial symptoms, which are induced by the very efficiently working immune defense system via the respiratory epithelium. During severe courses a systemically expressed proinflammatory cytokine storm and subsequent changes in the coagulation and complement systems can occur. Virus-specific antibodies, the long-term expression of which is ensured by the formation of B memory cell clones, generate a specific immune response that is also detectable in blood (seroconversion). Specifically effective cytotoxic CD8+ T­cell populations are also formed, which recognize viral epitopes as pathogen-specific patterns in combination with MHC presentation on the cell surface of virus-infected cells and destroy these cells. At the current point in time it is unclear how regular, robust and durable this immune status is constructed. Experiences with other coronavirus infections (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS) indicate that the immunity could persist for several years. Based on animal experiments, already acquired data on other coronavirus types and plausibility assumptions, it can be assumed that seroconverted patients have an immunity of limited duration and only a very low risk of reinfection. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of viral cycles and immunity is an important prerequisite for the development of vaccination strategies and development of effective drugs.","Ueffing, Marius; Bayyoud, Tarek; Schindler, Michael; Ziemssen, Focke",Ophthalmologe,431,26

Prior work has explored how self-trackers reflect on their logged data, but it remains unclear how much they learn from the tracking feedback, and which information is more useful. Indeed, the feedback can still be overwhelming, and making it concise can improve learning by increasing focus and reducing interpretation burden. We conducted a field study of mobile food logging with two feedback modes (manual journaling and automatic annotation of food images) and identified learning differences regarding nutrition, assessment, behavioral, and contextual information. We propose a Self-Tracking Feedback Saliency Framework to define when to provide feedback, on which specific information, why those details, and how to present them (as manual inquiry or automatic feedback). We propose SalienTrack to implement these requirements. Using the data collected from the user study, we trained a machine learning model to predict whether a user would learn from each tracked event. Using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we identified the most salient features per instance and why they lead to positive learning outcomes. We discuss implications for learnability in self-tracking, and how adding model explainability expands opportunities for improving feedback experience.","Wang, Yunlong; Liu, Jiaying; Park, Homin; Schultz-McArdle, Jordan; Rosenthal, Stephanie; Lim, Brian Y",,431,16

The world governments have adopted restrictive measures to reduce the spread of infection. These measures could affect the sexual function and quality of life of women living with their partner. AIM: The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner. METHODS: Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28-50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3 ± 1.9 to 2.3 ± 1.8, mean difference: -3.9 ± 1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2 ± 4.2 vs 19.2 ± 3.3, mean difference: -9.7 ± 2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3 ± 5.5 vs 20.1 ± 5.2, mean difference: 10.8 ± 3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2 ± 10.2 to 64.2 ± 11.8 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference: -17.8 ± 6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity &#8805;1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the home + university educational level + parity &#8805;1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

Those centers where the activity continued or was heavily restricted were obliged to screen donors and recipients, design COVID-safe clinical pathways, and promote telehealth to prevent nosocomial transmission. Despite the ever-growing literature on COVID-19, the amount of high-quality literature on LT remains limited. This review will provide an updated view of the impact of the pandemic on LT programs worldwide. Donor and recipient screening, strategies for waitlist prioritization, and posttransplant risk of infection and mortality are discussed. Moreover, a particular focus is given to the possibility of donor-to-recipient transmission and immunosuppression management in COVID-positive recipients.","De Carlis, Riccardo; Vella, Ivan; Incarbone, Niccolò; Centonze, Leonardo; Buscemi, Vincenzo; Lauterio, Andrea; De Carlis, Luciano",World J Gastroenterol,431,23

Mass transportation resources were deemed necessary. To achieve that goal, the concept of a Collective Critical Care Ambulance (CCCA) was proposed in the form of a long-distance bus re-designed and equipped to accommodate up to six intensive care patients and allow Advanced Life Support (ALS) techniques to be performed while en route. METHODS: The expected benefit of the CCCA, when compared to ALS ambulances accommodating a single patient, was to reduce the resources requirements, in particular by a lower personnel headcount for several patients being transferred to the same destination. A foreseen prospect, comparing to other collective transportation vectors such as airplanes, was the door-to-door capability, minimalizing patients' handovers for safety concerns and time efficiency. With the project of a short-distance transfer of several Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients together, the opportunity came to test the CCCA under real-life conditions and evaluate safely its technical feasibility and impact in time and resources saving, before it could be proposed for longer distances. RESULTS: Four COVID-19 patients were transported over 37 km. All patients were intubated and under controlled ventilation. One of them was under Norepinephrine support. Mean loading time was 1 min 39 s. Transportation time was 29 min. At destination, the mean unloading time was 1 min 15 s. No serious adverse effect, in particular regarding hemodynamic instability or ventilation disorder, has been observed. No harmful incident has occurred. CONCLUSIONS: It was a very instructive test. Collective medical evacuation by bus for critically ill patients under controlled ventilation is suitable and easy to implement. Design, ALS equipment, power autonomy, safety and resources saving, open the way for carrying up to 6 ICU-patients over a long distance. The CCCA could bring a real added-value in an epidemic context and could also be helpful in many other events generating multiple victims such as an armed conflict, a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.","Lentz, Thierry; Groizard, Charles; Colomes, Abel; Ozguler, Anna; Baer, Michel; Loeb, Thomas",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,431,6

The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.","Libin, Pieter J K; Willem, Lander; Verstraeten, Timothy; Torneri, Andrea; Vanderlocht, Joris; Hens, Niel",PLoS Comput Biol,431,1

Home quarantine, web-based classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered an increased incidence of mental health problems among medical students. Although there have been increasing amounts of literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources, such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, still need to be expanded. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess depression among medical students who are taking web-based classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the role of coping styles as mediators between resilience and depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students involving stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, was completed between March 20 and April 10, 2020. The participants responded to a self-administered, smartphone-based questionnaire, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Ego Resilience 89 Scale. Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling were used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression among the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. The regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in training) (P=.013), how well students adapted to web-based classes (P<.001), their levels of resilience (P=.04), and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P<.001). Resilience and positive coping styles were negatively related to depression (resilience: P=.04; positive coping styles: P<.001), and negative coping styles were positively related to depression (P<.001). The structural equation modeling analysis showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles (P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was found that the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have significant implications for future studies. Future studies and interventions should aim to improve resilience and promote positive coping styles.","Zhao, Lina; Sznajder, Kristin; Cheng, Dan; Wang, Shimeng; Cui, Can; Yang, Xiaoshi",J Med Internet Res,431,23

In vivo studies in the available literature have used avian models, but these models are difficult to scale and maintain. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the plausibility of a murine model of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis utilizing bioluminescence imaging and tissue analysis at harvest. METHODS: A 2-µL inoculate of bioluminescent Xen29 Staphylococcus aureus or sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution (sPBS) was administered to the tendon sheath of 36 male C57BL/6J mice. The infectious course was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) via an in vivo imaging system, gross anatomic deformity, and weight change. The infected hind paws were harvested at 4 time points: 24 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks for histological analysis using Alcian blue, hematoxylin, and Orange-G staining. Two-way analysis of variance with the Sidak multiple comparison test was used to assess differences in bioluminescence and weight at each time point. RESULTS: The infected cohort displayed significantly elevated bioluminescence values, had reductions in weight, and exhibited swelling of the infected digit throughout the course of infection. By day 4, most infected mice saw a substantial decrease in BLI signal intensity; however, 2 infected mice exhibited persistent BLI intensity through day 14. Histological analysis of the infected cohort showed tissue disorganization and the presence of a cellular infiltrate in and around the flexor tendon sheath. CONCLUSIONS: A murine model of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is possible and can serve as an experimental platform for further investigation of the pathophysiology of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis.

To help inform state policies and initiatives aimed at physician deployment during COVID-19, we used predictions of peak patient volume for hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) and regional physician workforce estimates to measure patient to physician ratios at the peak of the pandemic for each state. METHODS: We estimated the number of potentially available physicians based on Medicare Part B billings for the care of hospitalized and critically ill patients in 2017, adjusted for attrition due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and relevant experience. We used estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation to determine the number of hospitalized and ICU patients expected at the peak of the pandemic in each state. We then determined the expected ratio of patients per physician for each state at the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: The median number of hospitalized patients per physician was 13 (low estimate) to 18 (high estimate). At the high estimate of hospitalized patients, 35 states would have a patient to physician ratio of more than 15:1 (patient to physician ratios above 15:1 have been associated with poor outcomes). For ICU patients, the median number of patients each physician would treat across states would be 8-11 patients. Nine states would experience patient to physician ratios above 15:1 at the higher end of estimates. Patient-physician ratios decreased if the available physician pool was broadened to include physicians without recent experience treating hospitalized patients, and physicians in surgical specialties with experience treating acutely hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: We estimate that most states will have sufficient physician capacity to manage hospitalized patients at the peak of the pandemic. However, at the high estimates of hospitalized patients, some Midwestern states will experience high patient to provider ratios that may adversely affect patient outcomes.

From this perspective, retail companies operating within cities must also reorganize themselves, considering both the unpredictable requirements of environmental sustainability and the new mobility needs calling for the promotion of bicycles and electric scooters. In this context, we deal with the need to determine minimum cost routes in urban areas for delivering orders placed through e-channels. More precisely, we face a variant of the green vehicle routing problem of heterogeneous fleets, in which the objective function includes environmental impact cost components that differ by vehicle type. Moreover, as a novel issue, attention must be paid to avoid crossing and passing close to bicycle lanes;therefore, penalties are associated with the transit of vehicles near bicycle lanes. To address this problem, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model and a matheuristic associated with it. The proposed approach is then used to analyze different scenarios derived from the transportation network of the city of Milan, Italy. Milan is one of the smartest cities in Europe from the mobility point of view but also one of the most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the municipality is making a big investment to promote the use of bicycles.","Cerrone, Carmine Cerulli Raffaele Sciomachen Anna",Networks,431,20

METHODS: Twenty commonly available fabrics and materials were evaluated for their ability to reduce air concentrations of ultrafine particles at coughing face velocities. Further assessment was made on the filtration ability of selected fabrics while damp and of fabric combinations which might be used to construct home-made masks. RESULTS: Single fabric layers blocked a range of ultrafine particles. When fabrics were layered, a higher percentage of ultrafine particles were filtered. The average filtration efficiency of single layer fabrics and of layered combination was found to be 35% and 45%, respectively. Non-woven fusible interfacing, when combined with other fabrics, could add up to 11% additional filtration efficiency. However, fabric and fabric combinations were more difficult to breathe through than N95 masks.

Environmental pollution not only facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection but also increases infection-associated fatality risk, which arises due to Systemic Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) Activation Syndrome. The intracellular accumulation of endogenous kynurenic acid due to overexpression of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by AhR activation induces AhR-interleukin-6 (IL-6)-signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway.

Maternal PM2.5 exposure has been confirmed to damage the growth of somatic cells and enhance the incidence of chronic respiratory diseases in children. Here we aim to investigate the impact of in utero PM2.5 exposure on early birth weight and postnatal lung development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PM2.5 (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, or 7.5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally every 3 days until birth. Maternal and birth outcomes and somatic growth were monitored. Lungs were collected on PND1 (where PND = postnatal day) and PND28; the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (W/D) was analyzed, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured. Expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-&#954;B were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. There were no significant intergroup differences for maternal outcomes; however, offspring exposed in utero to 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg PM2.5 were significantly smaller in litter weight than the controls. In utero exposure to 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg PM2.5 led to lower body weight after birth and disrupted lung development during infancy. ROS levels were significantly increased in the 7.5 mg/kg PM2.5 group. PM2.5-treated rats showed upregulated pulmonary expression of TLR4 and NF-&#954;B. Maternal PM2.5 exposure enhances the risk of low birth weight and affects lung alveolar development.

However, previous studies on emotion and aging have found that older adults report better wellbeing than younger adults in global surveys and daily reports. To better understand older adults' wellbeing during the COVID-19 outbreak, we examined age differences in daily affective experiences in this study. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-one participants from mainland China aged 18 to 85 were recruited to participate in the 14-day daily diary study, after a pretest. Their trait affect and demographic information were measured in the pretest. Their daily affect and stress levels were measured in the daily assessments. Results: I found that older adults reported lower perceived stress related to COVID-19 in daily life, compared to younger adults.

We aimed to explore the contribution of central apnoeas and chemoreflex sensitization to ticagrelor-related dyspnoea in patients with ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty consecutive patients with ACS, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and no history of obstructive sleep apnoea, treated either with ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. (n = 30) or prasugrel 10 mg o.d. (n = 30) were consecutively enrolled. One week after ACS, all patients underwent 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, pulmonary static/dynamic testing, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity assessment, 24-hour cardiorespiratory monitoring for hypopnoea-apnoea detection, and evaluation of the chemosensitivity to hypercapnia by rebreathing technique.No differences were found in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, echocardiographic and pulmonary data between the 2 groups. Patients on ticagrelor, as compared to those on prasugrel, reported more frequently dyspnoea (43.3% versus 6.7%, p = 0.001; severe dyspnoea 23.3% versus 0%, p = 0.005), and showed higher apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) and central apnoea index (CAI) during the day, the night and the entire 24-hour period (all p < 0.001). Likewise, they showed a higher chemosensitivity to hypercapnia (p = 0.001). Among patients treated with ticagrelor, those referring dyspnoea had the highest AHI, CAI and chemosensitivity to hypercapnia (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Central apnoeas are a likely mechanism of dyspnoea and should be screened for in patients treated with ticagrelor. A drug related sensitization of the chemoreflex may be the cause of ventilatory instability and breathlessness in this setting.","Giannoni, Alberto; Borrelli, Chiara; Gentile, Francesco; Mirizzi, Gianluca; Coceani, Michele; Paradossi, Umberto; Vergaro, Giuseppe; Bramanti, Francesca; Iudice, Giovanni; Emdin, Michele; Passino, Claudio",Eur.

As a point-of-care immunodiagnostic test for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the serosurvey represents an alternative to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to measure the magnitude of COVID-19 outbreak in the communities lacking sufficient diagnostic capability for PCR testing. Methods: We assessed seropositivity for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG between April 21 and May 20, 2020, at 2 primary care clinics in Tokyo, Japan. Results: The overall positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.76-5.16) for the entire cohort (n = 1071). The 23 special wards of central Tokyo exhibited a significantly higher prevalence compared with the other areas of Tokyo after classification by residence (P = .02, 4.68% [3.08-6.79] vs 1.83 [0.68-3.95] in central and suburban Tokyo, respectively). In central Tokyo, the southern area showed the highest seroprevalence compared with the other areas (7.92% [3.48-15.01]), corresponding to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients by PCR test reported by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Conclusion: The seroprevalence surveyed in this study was too low for herd immunity, suggesting the need for robust disease control and prevention. A regional-level approach, rather than state- or prefectural-level, could be of importance in ascertaining detailed profiles of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Takita, Morihito; Matsumura, Tomoko; Yamamoto, Kana; Yamashita, Erika; Hosoda, Kazutaka; Hamaki, Tamae; Kusumi, Eiji",J Prim Care Community Health,431,22

Traditional training for students and residents has not met the demand for pharmacy leaders in this space. This article describes the partnership between UW Health (UWH) and the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy (UWSOP) in developing a specialty pharmacy elective course at UWSOP and in creating a postgraduate residency training program at UWH. Future directions for the partnership are discussed. SUMMARY: Members of the leaderships of UWH and UWSOP met to discuss expanding coursework related to specialty pharmacy business fundamentals at UWSOP. This meeting led to the development of a 2-credit elective course beginning in spring 2017. The course focused on marketplace economics, channel strategies, and specialty pharmacy practice development. Additionally, UWH identified the need to provide postgraduate training to meet the increasing demand across IDNs for specialty pharmacy leaders. The residency program was initiated in 2013 and received accreditation in 2016. The residency provides experience in specialty pharmacy leadership, managed care, finance, the revenue cycle, accreditation, and the supply chain. Future partnership opportunities include creation of a longitudinal student pharmacist track and joint project coordination between UWSOP students and UWH residents. CONCLUSION: This partnership has provided a pathway for students to gain expertise in specialty pharmacy business fundamentals as well as postgraduate training opportunities for future specialty pharmacy leaders. IDN and school of pharmacy partnerships can expand educational opportunities for future specialty pharmacy leaders and help fulfill the market gap in specialty pharmacy leaders.","Cesarz, Joseph L; Mott, David A; Friestrom, Eric D",Am J Health Syst Pharm,431,8

As in other countries, Nigerian policymakers had to make rapid and consequential decisions with limited understanding of transmission dynamics and the efficacy of available control measures. We present an account of the Nigerian COVID-19 response based on co-production of evidence between political decision-makers, health policymakers and academics from Nigerian and foreign institutions, an approach that allowed a multidisciplinary group to collaborate on issues arising in real time. Key aspects of the process were the central role of policymakers in determining priority areas and the coordination of multiple, sometime conflicting inputs from stakeholders to write briefing papers and inform effective national decision making. However, the co-production approach met with some challenges, including limited transparency, bureaucratic obstacles and an overly epidemiological focus on numbers of cases and deaths, arguably to the detriment of addressing social and economic effects of response measures. Larger systemic obstacles included a complex multitiered health system, fragmented decision-making structures and limited funding for implementation. Going forward, Nigeria should strengthen the integration of the national response within existing health decision bodies and implement strategies to mitigate the social and economic impact, particularly on the poorest Nigerians. The co-production of evidence examining the broader public health impact, with synthesis by multidisciplinary teams, is essential to meeting the social and public health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and other countries.","Abubakar, Ibrahim; Dalglish, Sarah L; Ihekweazu, Chikwe A; Bolu, Omotayo; Aliyu, Sani H",,431,29

This meant service users detained under the Mental Health Act were discharged at a higher rate than normal. We analysed whether this decision compromised the safety of this vulnerable group of service users. METHODS: We utilised a cohort study design and allocated service users to either the pre-rapid discharge, rapid discharge or post-rapid discharge group. We conducted a recurrent event analysis to assess group differences in the risk of experiencing negative outcomes during the 61 days post-discharge. We defined negative outcomes as crisis service use, re-admission to a psychiatric ward, community incidents of violence or self-harm and death by suicide. RESULTS: The pre-rapid discharge cohort included 258 service users, the rapid discharge cohort 127 and the post-rapid discharge cohort 76. We found no statistical association between being in the rapid discharge cohort and the risk of experiencing negative outcomes (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.72-1.8, p = 0.58) but a trend towards statistical significance for service users in the post-rapid discharge cohort (HR: 1.61, 95% CI: 0.91-2.83, p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that service users rapidly discharged from section experienced poorer outcomes. This raises the possibility that the Mental Health Act is applied in an overly restrictive manner, meaning that sections for some formally detained service users could be ended earlier without compromising safety.","Payne-Gill, J; Whitfield, C; Beck, A",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,431,1

METHODS: Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on the prolactin (PRL) and MAPK14 expressions of pituitary gland in C57BL/6 mice and human prolactinoma specimen. In the present study, the role of MAPK14 in prolactinoma was determined using estradiol-induced mice and dopamine D2 receptor knockout (DRD2-/-) mice models in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), MAPK14-/- and DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice. GH3 cells were transfected with different sets of MAPK14 small interfering RNA, which to study MAPK14 and PRL expression in GH3 cells. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence analysis showed that PRL and MAPK14 expression were colocalized and increased in the pituitary gland of mice and human prolactinoma specimen compared with the control specimen. It was shown that PRL and MAPK14 expression was colocalized and increased significantly in the pituitary gland of estradiol-injected prolactinoma mice compared with the control mice. Knockout of MAPK14 significantly inhibited tumor overgrowth, and PRL expression was decreased in estradiol-induced mice. Furthermore, MAPK14 knockout of DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice significantly reduced the overgrowth of pituitary gland and PRL production and secretion compared with DRD2-/- mice. MAPK14 knockout using siRNA inhibited PRL production in GH3 cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MAPK14 serves a promoting role in the formation of prolactinoma, and highlights the potential of MAPK14 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of prolactinoma.","Ding, Qiao-Yan; Zhang, Yu; Ma, Li; Chen, Yong-Gang; Wu, Jin-Hu; Zhang, Hong-Feng; Wang, Xiong",BMC Endocr Disord,431,33

Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, NYC Health + Hospitals served more than one million patients annually, including the most vulnerable New Yorkers, while billing fewer than five hundred telehealth visits monthly. Once the pandemic struck, we established a strategy to allow us to continue to serve our existing patients while treating the surge of new patients. Starting in March 2020, we were able to transform the system using virtual care platforms through which we conducted almost eighty-three thousand billable televisits in one month, as well as more than thirty thousand behavioral health encounters via telephone and video. Telehealth also enabled us to support patient-family communication, postdischarge follow-up, and palliative care for patients with COVID-19. Expanded Medicaid coverage and insurance reimbursement for telehealth played a pivotal role in this transformation. As we move to a new blend of virtual and in-person care, it is vital that the major regulatory and insurance changes undergirding our COVID-19 telehealth response be sustained to protect access for our most vulnerable patients.","Lau, Jen; Knudsen, Janine; Jackson, Hannah; Wallach, Andrew B; Bouton, Michael; Natsui, Shaw; Philippou, Christopher; Karim, Erfan; Silvestri, David M; Avalone, Lynsey; Zaurova, Milana; Schatz, Daniel; Sun, Vivian; Chokshi, Dave A",Health Aff (Millwood),431,16

BACKGROUND: Peer-reviewed studies published in the 15 years before COVID-19 indicate that Baby-Boomer nurses' retirement will increase the global nursing shortage. However, three international trends have affected Baby-Boomer nurses' decision to delay their retirement. EVALUATION: This review observed the scoping review framework. KEY ISSUES: COVID-19 further disrupts the current understanding of Baby-Boomer nurses' retirement as they recognize COVID-19's impact on health care systems and younger nurses. Technological advancements and the changing needs of health care delivery have made telecommuting a practical possibility. CONCLUSION: Baby-Boomer nurses can leverage alternative work arrangements to meet their needs and to contribute to clinical practice through telecommuting. This approach extends Baby-Boomer nurses' careers and creates a resource for bedside nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Clinical experience matters at the bedside. Telecommuting maximizes the retention of Baby-Boomer nurses' clinical expertise to benefit patients and to socialize bedside nurses. Baby-Boomer nurses can contribute to patient monitoring as well as patient education and counselling through telehealth. They can also provide asynchronous and synchronous telementoring to bedside nurses.","Gan, Ivan",J. nurs. manag,431,24

Nevertheless, there hasn't been much information on how individuals perceive WFM is affecting their daily work routine in the pandemic. By applying the stressors-strain-outcome (SSO) framework, the current study develops and tests a model that explains how misinformation and COVID-19 threat triggered the anxiety and social media fatigue of WFH employees and affected their work-related response. This study collected diary data for ten consecutive days from 56 WFH employees. Results widely supported the hypothesized model. Specifically, findings revealed that misinformation and COVID-19 threat increase anxiety and social media fatigue among these employees, resulting in a lower level of work engagement. This study also found that resilience as a coping mechanism reduces the adverse effects of anxiety on work engagement.

Methods: Parents of children aged between 2- and 14-years-old completed an online survey reporting their home environment conditions, any relation they had to the pandemic consequences, their difficulties experienced due to the quarantine, their perception of individual and parent-child dyadic stress, and their children's emotional and behavioral problems. Results: Results showed that the perception of the difficulty of quarantine is a crucial factor that undermines both parents' and children's well-being. Quarantine's impact on children's behavioral and emotional problems is mediated by parent's individual and dyadic stress, with a stronger effect from the latter. Parents who reported more difficulties in dealing with quarantine show more stress. This, in turn, increases the children's problems. Living in a more at-risk area, the quality of the home environment, or the relation they have with the pandemic consequences, do not have an effect on families' well-being. Conclusions: Dealing with quarantine is a particularly stressful experience for parents who must balance personal life, work, and raising children, being left alone without other resources. This situation puts parents at a higher risk of experiencing distress, potentially impairing their ability to be supportive caregivers. The lack of support these children receive in such a difficult moment may be the reason for their more pronounced psychological symptoms. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health, and supportive interventions for the immediate and for the future should be promoted.","Spinelli, Maria; Lionetti, Francesca; Pastore, Massimiliano; Fasolo, Mirco",Front.

Anecdotal reports suggested that students found this experience rich for learning. Previous studies have explored alternative models of student service, however this defined medical student support role is novel. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were recorded with 20 medical students at a UK medical school exploring their experiences of placement learning and experiences of working as healthcare assistants. Responses were analysed qualitatively using a framework approach. The framework was developed into a model describing key findings and their relationships. RESULTS: Interviews yielded data that broadly covered aspects of (1) Medical students' experiences of clinical placement learning (2) Medical students' experiences of working as medical student healthcare assistants (3) Learning resulting from working as a healthcare assistant (4) Hierarchies and professional barriers in the clinical environment (5) Influences on professional identity. Participants described barriers and facilitators of clinical learning and how assuming a healthcare assistant role impacted on learning and socialisation within the multidisciplinary team. Students became increasingly socialised within the healthcare team, contributing directly to patient care; the resulting social capital opened new opportunities for learning, team working and enhanced students' interprofessional identity. Students described the impact of these experiences on their aspirations for their future practice. CONCLUSIONS: Changes to work patterns in healthcare and delivery models of medical education have eroded opportunities for students to contribute to healthcare delivery and be embedded within a team. This is impacting negatively on student learning and socialisation and we suggest that medical curricula have much to learn from nursing and allied health professional training. Longitudinal embedment with a multidisciplinary team, where students have a defined role and work directly with patients may not only add value to clinical service, but also overcome current barriers to effective placement learning and interprofessional identity formation for medical students.","Nolan, Helen; Owen, Katherine",BMC Med Educ,431,16

The data collected from the study participants were analyzed quantitatively by using One-way ANOVA, Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA, Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA, and Structural Equation Model (IBM SPSS statistics 21, and Amos v.25). RESULTS: The current results showed statistically significant differences due to age in hope and well-being, in favor of the sample members belonging to the age group from 30 years old and over old, while there were no differences in religiosity and stigma due to age. There were no differences due to education level in religiosity, hope, stigma, and well-being. Results showed statistically significant differences in well-being in favor of the married group, while there were no differences in religiosity, hope, and stigma due to social status. Regarding the effect of income level in the study variables, the results showed no differences due to religiosity, hope, stigma, and well-being. Moreover, the findings found that both religiosity and hope play a mediating role. CONCLUSION: Religiosity and hope play a mediating role in the relationship between stigma associated with COVID-19 and psychological well-being. These results indicate several strategies to reduce the adverse effects of the stigma associated with COVID-19 and increase well-being among COVID-19 patients.","Al Eid, Nawal A; Arnout, Boshra A; Alqahtani, Mohammed M J; Fadhel, Fahmi H; Abdelmotelab, Abdalla S",Work,431,22

However is contrasting data about the associated mortality. Since the outbreak, our unit has maintained a prospective database recording Trauma and Orthopaedic surgical activity. Our aim was to share our experience of the first 3 months with prospective data on outcome of essential surgery during the covid-19 peak. Our focus in this report was on the mortality rate as services begin to open. Methods: We prospectively collected data during the peak of the pandemic in the UK, for fracture neck of femur patients (NOF) the most commonly performed surgical procedure and the most vulnerable during this period. We compared this Covid-19 cohort of NOFs against a cohort of NOF's during the same time in 2019 and another cohort of NOF's in 2020 outside the lockdown period to compare mortality rates and give a broader perspective. Results: During the period March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, total of 206 patients were operated. Ninety-four fracture NOF and another one hundred twelve essential surgical procedures were performed. In the NOF cohort, there were nine patients that died. Three of them were covid-19 positive, one was not tested and the rest five were covid-19 negative. There was no mortality reported in the non NOF group. Conclusion: In our unit, during the lock down period, mortality rate in patients undergoing fracture NOF was not significantly different from a similar cohort earlier in the year and similar period last year. We have not observed any mortality, to date in the Non NOF procedures carried out.","Sobti, Anshul; Memon, Kashif; Bhaskar, Rohit Reddy Pala; Unnithan, Ashwin; Khaleel, Arshad",J. Clin. Orthop.

Early detection of CVDs can reduce mortality rates by preventing or reducing the severity of the disease. Machine learning algorithms are a promising method for identifying risk factors. This paper proposes a proposed recursive feature elimination-based gradient boosting (RFE-GB) algorithm in order to obtain accurate heart disease prediction. The patients health record with important CVD features has been analyzed for the evaluation of the results. Several other machine learning methods were also used to build the prediction model, and the results were compared with the proposed model. The results of this proposed model infer that the combined recursive feature elimination and gradient boosting algorithm achieves the highest accuracy (89.7 %). Further, with an area under the curve of 0.84, the proposed RFE-GB algorithm was found superior and had obtained a substantial gain over other techniques. Thus, the proposed RFE-GB algorithm will serve as a prominent model for CVD estimation and treatment.","Theerthagiri, Prasannavenkatesan; Vidya, J",,431,24

Digitalization, which drives data analytics, provides opportunities for organizations to create new models to beat competition. On the other hand, cybersecurity is a threat to organizations’ financials, operations, and reputation. COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of digitalization, which has opened up more opportunities for hackers for cyberattacks. In another word, digitalization underlines the importance of cybersecurity. With the foresight of the government, Singapore has promoted cybersecurity as one of the pillars for the nation’s total defence to signal the government’s attention and resources committed to fighting against cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the effort from the government, losses due to cyberattacks continue to rise. Furthermore, the network of the biggest healthcare provider in the country was compromised and its data, including that of the Prime Minister, was stolen. For small organizations where resources may be limited, the risks are even higher, pointing to the urgent need to address the situations. Therefore, this article uses two small organizations in Singapore as case study, to draw insights on the obstacles to implement digitalization and cybersecurity.

Highly pathogenic CoV infections usually induce a series of immune responses, including innate immunity, humoral immunity, cellular immunity and mucosal immunity. These responses not only are critical to suppressing and eliminating the invasion of viruses, but also play an important role in immunopathological changes and disease progression. A deep understanding of the dual roles of immune responses will help to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of CoV and maintain the balance between immune protection and immunopathology, which will be conducive to the research and development of safe and effective CoV vaccines. This review summarized the dual roles of immune responses in highly pathogenic CoV infections and discussed the implications for the research and development of novel CoV vaccines.","Wen, Ziyu; Li, Yanjun; Chen, Musha; Sun, Caijun",Chin.

The sensitivity of these tests heavily depends on the viral load, extrapolated by the threshold cycle (Ct). It is therefore essential to verify their performance before their inclusion in routine. The Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette Bio-Rad, the GSD NovaGen SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Antigen Rapid Test, and the Aegle Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette were evaluated on 199 samples: 150 fresh samples from the routine and positive in quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), nine fresh samples negative in RT-qPCR, and 40 frozen samples, taken before the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 but positive for other respiratory viruses. Positive RT-qPCR samples were categorized according to their Ct: Ct < 20 (18.7%), &#8805; 20-< 25 (27.3%), &#8805; 25-< 30 (18.7%), &#8805; 30-35 (17.3%), and > 35 (18.0%). Sensitivities (95% confidence interval) for Ct below 25 were 95.7% (92.4-98.9), 97.1% (94.4-99.8), and 97.1% (94.4-99.8) for GSD NovaGen, Bio-Rad, and Aegle, respectively but drastically dropped when Ct exceeded 27. Among samples with previously diagnosed viruses, seven false-positive results were found with GSD NovaGen only (specificity 85.7%). Equivalent, high sensitivities were observed with the highest viral load samples. The GSD NovaGen assay showed less specificity. Although the three kits tested in this study are inadequate for routine testing in a high throughput laboratory, they can help to quickly identify the most infectious patients and screen their close contacts in an environment where molecular tests are not readily available.","Blairon, Laurent; Cupaiolo, Roberto; Thomas, Isabelle; Piteüs, Sébastien; Wilmet, Alain; Beukinga, Ingrid; Tré-Hardy, Marie",J. med. virol,431,16

However, to promote adoption in practice and realise benefits, there is a need to specify how digital health solutions contribute to hospital to home transitions, particularly pertinent in this era of social distancing. This rapid review will: (1) elucidate the various roles and functions that have been developed to support hospital to home transitions of care, (2) identify existing digital health solutions that support hospital to home transitions of care, (3) identify gaps and new opportunities where digital health solutions can support these roles and functions and (4) create recommendations that will inform the design and structure of future digital health interventions that support hospital to home transitions for older adults (eg, the pre-trial results of the Digital Bridge intervention; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04287192). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-phase rapid review will be conducted to meet identified aims. In phase 1, a selective literature review will be used to generate a conceptual map of the roles and functions of individuals that support hospital to home transitions for older adults. In phase 2, a search on MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL will identify literature on digital health solutions that support hospital to home transitions. The ways in which digital health solutions can support the roles and functions that facilitate these transitions will then be mapped in the analysis and generation of findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol is a review of the literature and does not involve human subjects, and therefore, does not require ethics approval. This review will permit the identification of gaps and new opportunities for digital processes and platforms that enable care transitions and can help inform the design and implementation of future digital health interventions. Review findings will be disseminated through publications and presentations to key stakeholders.","Singh, Hardeep; Armas, Alana; Law, Susan; Tang, Terence; Steele Gray, Carolyn; Cunningham, Heather V; Thombs, Rachel; Ellen, Moriah; Sritharan, Jasvinei; Nie, Jason X; Plett, Donna; Jarach, Carlotta Micaela; Thavorn, Kednapa; Nelson, Michelle L A",BMJ Open,431,11

Lockdown measures may have exacerbated negative population behaviors regarding exercise and nutrition, with risk of weight gain and obesity, collectively predisposing to increased cardiometabolic risk and mortality. At particular risk of deleterious consequences were patients such as those affected by chronic non communicable diseases (CNCD). The benefits of regular exercise are evident at several levels of CNCD prevention, however, from a public health standpoint, it is important to consider they are also related to improved stress management, work/academic performance, and reduced illegal behavior, isolation and depression. Therefore, during enforced isolation, a primary goal for all individuals is to maintain energy balance. During lockdown, several lifestyle interventions were posted online, with the internet playing a major role in exercise and fitness promotion. Among these one must recognize the ambitious ""#StayHomeStayFit"" project by the University of Milan, providing useful general information and trustworthy advice regarding nutrition, physical activity, and psychological support, for the general population in a time of need.

The compounds of each herb in XFBD were collected from TCM-PTD, ETCM, TCMSP and SymMap database. Next, the information of meridian tropisms was collected from Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2015 edition), and the target information of the major constituents of XFBD were obtained from TCM-PTD, ETCM, TCMSP and TargetNet database. Subsequently, the target network model and the major modules were generated by Cytoscape, and the functional enrichment analysis of XFBD targets were completed by DAVID and STRING. As a result, ten of the 13 herbs in XFBD belonged to the lung meridian, and 326 of the 1 224 putative XFBD targets were associated with the disease target of COVID-19, among which 109 targets were enriched in the disease pathways of viral infection and lung injury. The main biological pathways regulated by the key XFBD targets included viral infection, energy metabolism, immunity and inflammation, parasites and bacterial infections. In conclusion, the therapeutic mechanism of XFBD in COVID-19 showed a multi-herb, multi-constituent, multi-target pattern, with lung as the chief targeted organ. By regulating a series of biological pathways closely related to the occurrence and development of diseases, XFBD plays a role in balancing immunity, eliminating inflammation, regulating hepatic and biliary metabolism and recovering energy metabolism balance.","Wang, Yi; Li, Xiang; Zhang, Jun-Hua; Xue, Rui; Qian, Jing-Yang; Zhang, Xiao-Hui; Zhang, Han; Liu, Qing-Quan; Fan, Xiao-Hui; Cheng, Yi-Yu; Zhang, Bo-Li",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,431,21

Understanding differences in the way patients interact with these communication platforms can inform their use and design for hypertension management. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to explore the unique phenotypes of patient interactions with an automated text messaging platform for BP monitoring. Our secondary aim was to estimate associations between interaction phenotypes and BP control. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial for adults with poorly controlled hypertension. A total of 201 patients with established primary care were assigned to the automated texting platform; messages exchanged throughout the 4-month program were analyzed. We used the k-means clustering algorithm to characterize two different interaction phenotypes: program conformity and engagement style. First, we identified unique clusters signifying differences in program conformity based on the frequency over time of error alerts, which were generated to patients when they deviated from the requested text message format (eg, ###/## for BP). Second, we explored overall engagement styles, defined by error alerts and responsiveness to text prompts, unprompted messages, and word count averages. Finally, we applied the chi-square test to identify associations between each interaction phenotype and achieving the target BP. RESULTS: We observed 3 categories of program conformity based on their frequency of error alerts: those who immediately and consistently submitted texts without system errors (perfect users, 51/201), those who did so after an initial learning period (adaptive users, 66/201), and those who consistently submitted messages generating errors to the platform (nonadaptive users, 38/201). Next, we observed 3 categories of engagement style: the enthusiast, who tended to submit unprompted messages with high word counts (17/155); the student, who inconsistently engaged (35/155); and the minimalist, who engaged only when prompted (103/155). Of all 6 phenotypes, we observed a statistically significant association between patients demonstrating the minimalist communication style (high adherence, few unprompted messages, limited information sharing) and achieving target BP (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified unique interaction phenotypes among patients engaging with an automated text message platform for remote BP monitoring. Only the minimalist communication style was associated with achieving target BP. Identifying and understanding interaction phenotypes may be useful for tailoring future automated texting interactions and designing future interventions to achieve better BP control.","Davoudi, Anahita; Lee, Natalie S; Chivers, Corey; Delaney, Timothy; Asch, Elizabeth L; Reitz, Catherine; Mehta, Shivan J; Chaiyachati, Krisda H; Mowery, Danielle L",J Med Internet Res,431,1

METHODS: In April 2020, UK health systems were challenged to expand critical care capacity rapidly during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic so that they could accommodate patients with respiratory and multiple organ failure. Here, we describe the preparation and adaptive responses of a large critical care unit to the oncoming burden of disease. Our changes were similar to the revolution in manufacturing brought about by 'Long Shops' of 1853 when Richard Garrett and Sons of Leiston started mass manufacture of traction engines. This innovation broke the whole process into smaller parts and increased productivity. When applied to COVID-19 preparations, an assembly line approach had the advantage that our ICU became easily scalable to manage an influx of additional staff as well as the increase in admissions. Healthcare professionals could be replaced in case of absence and training focused on a smaller number of tasks. RESULTS: Compared with the equivalent period in 2019, the ICU provided 30.9% more patient days (2599 to 3402), 1845 of which were ventilated days (compared with 694 in 2019, 165.8% increase) while time from first referral to ICU admission reduced from 193.8±123.8 min (±SD) to 110.7±76.75 min (±SD). Throughout, ICU maintained adequate capacity and also accepted patients from neighbouring hospitals. This was done by managing an additional 205 doctors (70% increase), 168 nurses who had previously worked in ICU and another 261 nurses deployed from other parts of the hospital (82% increase).Our large tertiary hospital ensured a dedicated non-COVID ICU was staffed and equipped to take regional emergency referrals so that those patients requiring specialist surgery and treatment were treated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We report how the challenge of managing a huge influx of patients and redeployed staff was met by deconstructing ICU care into its constituent parts. Although reported from the largest colocated ICU in the UK, we believe that this offers solutions to ICUs of all sizes and may provide a generalisable model for critical care pandemic surge planning.","Oakley, Callum; Pascoe, Craig; Balthazor, Daivd; Bennett, Davinia; Gautam, Nandan; Isaac, John; Isherwood, Peter; Matthews, Tracie; Murphy, Nick; Oelofse, Tessa; Patel, Jaimin; Snelson, Catherine; Richardson, Carla; Willson, Jeremy; Wyton, Fiona; Veenith, Tonny; Whitehouse, Tony",,431,16

The research also coincided with the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, thus influencing the number of respondents and representation of the countries in the research sample. The research was conducted in the framework of the project ""Multilingual and Multicultural University: Preparation Platform for Prospective International Students"" (No. 1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/019) co-funded by ERDF.","Skvorcova, O.; Stavicka, A.; Odina, I.","Human, Technologies and Quality of Education, 2020",431,16

The reproductively active specimens, one male and one female, were captured at the same time in the same shelter, but had a very different color pattern each. With the actual data it would be highly speculative to try to explain the eminent color differences between our two leucistic individuals, but we assume that the population of A. lituratus in La Montañita has a fixed frequency of the albinotic allele.","López-Wilchis, Ricardo; Algel León Galván, Miguel",Chiropt. neotrop.,431,20

It was observed that the mental and physical health of the frontline workers reached levels of extreme clinical and psychological concern. OBJECTIVE: Understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on the front-line clinical team in the ICU environment, as well as reveal what proposals are being made to mitigate the clinical and psychological impacts that this group experiences. METHOD: A systematic review was made following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). We included any type of study on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with results about their mental health. We were, therefore, interested in quantitative studies examining the prevalence of problems and effects of interventions, as well as qualitative studies examining experiences. We had no restrictions related to study design, methodological quality or language. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies reported on the urgent need for interventions to prevent or reduce mental health problems caused by COVID-19 among health professionals in ICU. Eleven studies demonstrated possibilities for interventions involving organizational adjustments in the ICU, particularly linked to emotional conflicts in the fight against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The disproportion between the need for technological supplies of intensive care medicine and their scarcity promotes, among many factors, high rates of psychological distress. Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fear and anguish were observed during the pandemic, probably related to extremely high workloads and the lack of personal protective equipment.","Troglio da Silva, Flaviane Cristine; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",J Psychiatr Res,431,18

Particular attention should be placed on the obstacles faced by applicants who are underrepresented in medicine (URiM) as they may be disproportionately affected by the changes in 2020. These challenges are especially relevant in competitive surgical specialties, where racial and gender diversity already lags behind other medical specialties. Inclusive excellence is a guiding philosophy in creating equitable resident selection processes. It focuses on the multilayered processes that form the foundation of inclusive institutional culture, while recognizing that excellence and inclusivity are mutually reinforcing and not mutually exclusive.A key tenant in inclusive excellence for resident recruiting involves applying an equity lens in all decision making. An equity lens allows programs to continuously evaluate resident selection policies and processes through an intentional equity-forward approach. In addition to using an equity lens, programs should emphasize the importance of equity-focused skill building, which ensures that all individuals engaged in the resident selection process have the tools and knowledge to recognize biases. Finally, institutions should implement specific programming for URiM applicants to provide them with information about key aspects of department culture and mechanisms of support for URiM trainees.Every residency program should adopt a sustained perspective of inclusive excellence, in this application cycle and beyond. The status quo has existed for far too long, and COVID-19 offers institutions and their residency programs a unique opportunity to try new and innovative equity-forward practices.","Gerull, Katherine M; Enata, Nichelle; Welbeck, Arakua N; Aleem, Alexander W; Klein, Sandra E",Acad. med,431,16

It was an ecological study utilising spatiotemporal analysis techniques that included all deaths confirmed by COVID-19 in Sergipe, from 2 April to 14 June 2020. Mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 inhabitants and the temporal trends were analysed using a segmented log-linear model. For spatial analysis, the Kernel estimator was used and the crude mortality rates were smoothed by the empirical Bayesian method. The space-time prospective scan statistics applied the Poisson's probability distribution model. There were 391 COVID-19 registered deaths, with the majority among â©¾60 years old (62%) and males (53%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes (31%) and cardiovascular disease (15%). An increasing mortality trend across the state was observed, with a higher increase in the countryside. An active spatiotemporal cluster of mortality comprising the metropolitan area and neighbouring cities was identified. The trend of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe was increasing and the spatial distribution of deaths was heterogeneous with progression towards the countryside. Therefore, the use of spatial analysis techniques may contribute to surveillance and control of COVID-19 pandemic.","Andrade, L A; Gomes, D S; Lima, S V M A; Duque, A M; Melo, M S; Góes, M A O; Ribeiro, C J N; Peixoto, M V S; Souza, C D F; Santos, A D",Epidemiol Infect,431,7

AIM OF THE STUDY: A Mongolian folk medicinal plant named Thalictrum minus L. (TML) has been extensively used for the treatment of lung inflammation, bacterial and fungal infection and tuberculosis. Our present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of TML against particulate matter (PM)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the potential underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, HPLC-Q-TOF was applied for the qualitative analysis and HPLC was used for quantitative analysis of main components in TML. Then, the mice model of ALI was induced by PM via intratracheally instilled with 50 mg/kg body weight of Standard Reference Material1648a (SRM1648a), and TML (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) were administered orally 1 h prior to PM. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of TML were elucidated. RESULTS: Eleven main ingredients were detected in TML and the contents of homoorientin and berberine were quantified. Additionally, the results demonstrated that TML profoundly inhibited weight loss in mice and ameliorated lung pathological injury induced by PM. Furthermore, we also found that TML significantly decreased the lung wet to dry weight (W/D) ratios, reduced total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and effectively attenuated PM-induced increased leukocyte and macrophages in BALF. Meanwhile, TML could pronouncedly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues, decreased the PM-induced inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), reduced nitric oxide (NO) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in BALF. In addition, TML markedly facilitated the expression of p-AMPK-Nrf2 and suppressed the expression of KEAP, prohibited the activation of the MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and inhibited apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that TML attenuated PM-induced ALI through suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and alleviating oxidative damage correlated with the AMPK-Nrf2/KEAP signaling pathways, MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathways, as well as apoptotic pathways.","Badamjav, Rentsen; Zhang, Lu; Sonom, Dolgor; Wu, Yun-Hao; Kou, Jun-Ping; Yu, Bo-Yang; Li, Fang",J Ethnopharmacol,431,16

Lebanon experienced its largest wave of COVID-19 infections from January to April 2021. Limited genomic surveillance was undertaken, with just twenty six SARS-CoV-2 genomes available for this period, nine of which were from travellers from Lebanon detected by other countries. Additional genome sequencing is thus needed to allow surveillance of variants in circulation. MethodsNine hundred and five SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced using the ARTIC protocol. The genomes were derived from SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, selected retrospectively from the sentinel COVID-19 surveillance network, to capture diversity of location, sampling time, gender, nationality and age. ResultsAlthough sixteen PANGO lineages were circulating in Lebanon in January 2021, by February there were just four, with the Alpha variant accounting for 97% of samples. In the following two months, all samples contained the Alpha variant. However, this had changed dramatically by June and July, when all samples belonged to the Delta variant. DiscussionThis study provides a ten-fold increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from Lebanon. The Alpha variant, first detected in the UK, rapidly swept through Lebanon, causing the countrys largest wave to date, which peaked in January 2021. The Alpha variant was introduced to Lebanon multiple times despite travel restrictions, but the source of these introductions remains uncertain. The Delta variant was detected in Gambia in travellers from Lebanon in mid-May, suggesting community transmission in Lebanon several weeks before this variant was detected in the country. Prospective sequencing in June/July 2021 showed that the Delta variant had completely replaced the Alpha variant in under six weeks.","Merhi, Georgi; Trotter, Alexander J; Martins, Leonardo de Oliveira; Koweyes, Jad; Le-Viet, Thanh; Naja, Hala Abou; Buaini, Mona Al; Prosolek, Sophie J; Alikhan, Nabil-Fareed; Lott, Martin; Tohmeh, Tatiana; Badran, Bassam; Jupp, Orla J; Gardner, Sarah; Felgate, Matthew W; Makin, Kate A; Wilkinson, Janine M; Stanley, Rachael; Sesay, Abdul K; Webber, Mark A; Davidson, Rose K; Ghosn, Nada; Pallen, Mark; Hasan, Hamad; Page, Andrew J; Tokajian, Sima",,431,16

Patients with kidney failure, who often use ACEi/ARB, are at higher risk of more severe COVID-19. However, there are no data available on the association of ACEi/ARB use with COVID-19 severity in this population. Methods: Data were retrieved from the ERACODA database of kidney transplant and dialysis patients affected by COVID-19, between February 1 and October 1 2020, and had information on 28-day mortality. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the relation between ACEi/ARB use and 28-day mortality risk. Additionally, we studied the association of ACEi/ARB discontinuation with 28-day mortality. Results: We evaluated 1,511 patients, 459 kidney transplant recipients and 1,052 dialysis patients. At COVID-19 diagnosis, 189 (41%) of the transplant and 288 (27%) of the dialysis patients were on ACEi/ARB. In transplant, 88 (19%) and in dialysis patients 244 (23%) died within 28 days of initial presentation. In transplant and dialysis patients, there was no association between ACEi/ARB use and 28-day mortality in both crude and adjusted models (adjusted HR=1.12, 95%CI: 0.69-1.83 in transplant; 1.04, 95%CI: 0.73-1.47 in dialysis patients). Among transplant recipients, ACEi/ARB discontinuation was associated with higher mortality risk after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, but the association was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for COVID-19 severity (adjusted HR=1.36, 95%CI: 0.40-4.58). Among dialysis patients, ACEi/ARB discontinuation was not associated with mortality in any model. Similar results were obtained across subgroups when ACEi and ARB were studied separately and when other outcomes for COVID-19 severity were studied e.g., hospital admission, intensive care unit admission or need for ventilator support. Conclusions: Amongst kidney transplant and dialysis patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association of ACEi/ARB use or ACEi/ARB discontinuation with mortality.","Soler, Maria Jose; Noordzij, Marlies; Abramowicz, Daniel; de Arriba, Gabriel; Basile, Carlo; van Buren, Marjolijn; Covic, Adrian; Crespo, Marta; Duivenvoorden, Raphael; Massy, Ziad; Ortiz, Alberto; Sanchez, Emilio; Petridou, Emily; Stevens, Kathryn; White, Colin; Vart, Priya; Gansevoort, Ronald",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,431,1

As a result of the underlying concomitant spread of infection, SH had to rearrange the clinical services in terms of structural changes to the building, management of spaces, human resources and supplies, in order to continue providing optimal care to the patients and staff safety. The aim of this article is to describe how SH was able to adjust its services coping with the epidemiological stages of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three periods can be identified; in each one the most important organizational modifications are analyzed (hospital activities, logistical changes, communication, surveillance on HCW). RESULTS: The first period, after initial cases' identification, was characterized by the hospital isolation. In the second period the hospital reopened and it was divided into two completely separated areas, named COVID-19 and COVID-free, to prevent intra-hospital contamination. The last period was characterized by the re-organization of the facility as the largest COVID Hospital in Veneto, catching exclusively COVID-19 patients from the surrounding areas. CONCLUSIONS: SH changed its organization three times in less than two months. From the point of view of the Medical Direction of the Hospital the challenges had been many but it allowed to consolidate an organizational model which could answer to health needs during the emergency situation.","Marcon, Elena; Scotton, Francesca; Marcante, Elena; Rigo, Alberto; Monticelli, Jacopo; Buggio, Maria Emanuela; Pilerci, Claudio; Montemurro, Domenico; Benini, Patrizia",Ann Ist Super Sanita,431,20

Currently, many drug discovery approaches follow the typical protein structure-function paradigm, designing drugs to bind to fixed three-dimensional structures. However, in recent years such approaches have failed to address drug resistance and limit the set of possible drug targets and candidates. For these reasons we instead focus on targeting protein regions that lack a stable structure, known as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions are essential to numerous biological pathways that contribute to the virulence of various viruses. In this work, we discover eleven new SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates targeting IDRs and provide further evidence for the involvement of IDRs in viral processes such as enzymatic peptide cleavage while demonstrating the efficacy of our unique docking approach.","Mudide, Anish; Alterovitz, Gil",Pac Symp Biocomput,431,32

We assessed the rate and clinical presentation of COVID-19, and adherence to therapy in a large cohort of patients with ARD followed-up in a tertiary University-Hospital in Northeast Italy. METHODS: Between April 9th and April 25th, 2020, after SARS-CoV-2 infection peak, a telephone survey investigating the impact of COVID-19 on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) was administered.

However, it is amenable to psychoanalytic psychotherapy and can be effective for analyzing unconscious motivations and defenses. In addition, it lends itself to a flexible frame that reveals more about the patient and analyst than in traditional psychoanalysis. This can provide important therapeutic grist for the analytic mill or might lead to unreliable boundaries. Some patients suffering from severe childhood neglect are not able to relate meaningfully to a cyber analyst, while certain narcissistic patients feel validated by the world's Coronavirus disease (COVID) consensus that human contact is dangerous, resulting in the necessity for contact-avoiding Teletherapy. Teletherapy is easier to access for patients and analysts than having to drive to an appointment. For some patients, it is a dream come true, waking up with your iPhone analyst at your bedside. Because Teletherapy is so user-friendly, many patients will never want to return to their analyst's office. But the technical glitches of iPhones, computers, and the unexpected interruptions by housemates, pets, etc. make Teletherapy less reliable and private. And most patients and analysts miss the vital need for an embodied therapeutic experience. The author emphasizes the importance of continuing to practice Teletherapy until the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicates it is safe to see patients in person. It appears that Teletherapy has radically transformed the practice of psychoanalysis and will continue to do so into the 21st century.

We recognized at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that students, staff and faculty may require mental health support, particularly with the challenges of isolation and loneliness. In response, our team transitioned from an in-person to a novel online format at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We designed online content for participants to (1) connect with therapy dogs and experience feelings of love, comfort and support as occurred in in-person programming, and (2) learn about pandemic-specific, evidence-informed mental health knowledge. Our unique approach highlighted what dogs can teach humans about health through their own care and daily activities. From April to June 2020, we developed a website, created 28 Facebook livestreams and 60 pre-recorded videos which featured therapy dogs and handlers, and cross-promoted on various social media platforms. Over three months, first a combined process-outcome evaluation helped us determine whether our activities contributed to the program's goals. A subsequent needs assessment allowed us to elicit participant preferences for the program moving forward. This commentary reflects on these findings and our teams' collective experiences to share our key lessons learned related to program personnel needs, therapy dog handler training and support requirements, and online programming prerequisites.

Elected officials must make critical system-level decisions for stymieing the spread of the virus. Businesspersons must make personnel, financial, and operational decisions to minimize transmission while preserving their business's vitality. Members of the public must make personal decisions about personal protective equipment and changing social, recreational, occupational, and spiritual behavior to protect themselves and others. The scientific community can shift how they illustrate the virus's behavior to the public in an appropriate and understandable way so that the public can make informed decisions. This article suggests the use of a single-case design and logarithmic analyses to improve the current methodologies for COVID-19 analysis and illustration. METHOD: The Standard Celeration Chart was used with Theil's incomplete regression and a 7-point change analysis; the authors demonstrate a suitable virus-tracking and mitigation methodology. RESULTS: Analysis and data visualization are standardized, providing an accurate depiction of the virus's growth for public dissemination and decision-making. An analytic strategy is demonstrated for retrospectively detecting meaningful changes in viral growth or prospectively measuring such changes that coincide with known mitigation strategies. DISCUSSION: The authors suggest improvements in bridging science to application by making COVID-19 informatics more meaningful and actionable by lawmakers, businesspersons, and the public. Limitations and future directions for COVID-19 informatics are discussed.

The current study investigated the extent to which early neurocognitive processes involved in the categorization of faces vary when participants' tasks goals were to categorize faces by race or by gender. In contrast to previous findings, task-related differences were found, such that differentiation in the P2 event-related potential (ERP) according to perceived gender was facilitated by having an explicit task goal of categorizing faces by gender; however, the P2 was sensitive to race regardless of task goals. Use of principal components analysis (PCA) revealed two underlying components that comprised the P2 and that were differentially sensitive to the gender and race of the faces, depending on participants' top-down task goals. Results suggest that top-down task demands facilitate discrimination of faces along the attended dimension within less than 200 ms, but that the effect of top-down task demands may not be evident when examining early ERP components that reflect more than one distinct underlying process.","Volpert-Esmond, Hannah I; Bartholow, Bruce D",Journal of experimental social psychology,431,16

This essay examines the basis and limits of duty to treat in a time of crisis and explores how these experiences could leave doctors morally stressed and even compromised. We question whether a physician-patient relationship that treats patients' safety and well-being as separate from their doctors' personal and professional values, needs, and dignity is the best way to deliver care. Such questions predated coronavirus but were brought to the forefront because of the epidemic. As physicians process their experiences, we hope to begin a deeper moral and social conversation that might help us be better prepared for future crises.","Mangione, Salvatore; Post, Stephen G",Am. j. med. sci,431,26

The phosphotransferase system (PTS) couples the import of carbohydrates with their phosphorylation prior to metabolism and has been linked to GAS pathogenesis. In a screen of an insertional mutant library of all 14 annotated PTS permease (EIIC) genes in MGAS5005, the annotated ß-glucoside PTS transporter (bglP) was found crucial for GAS growth and survival in human blood and was validated in another M1T1 GAS strain, 5448. In 5448, bglP was shown to be in an operon with a putative phospho-ß-glucosidase (bglB) downstream and a predicted antiterminator (licT) upstream. Using defined non-polar mutants of the ß-glucoside permease (bglP) and ß-glucosidase enzyme (bglB) in 5448, we showed that bglB, not bglP, was important for growth in blood. Furthermore, transcription of the licT/blgPB operon was found to be repressed by glucose and induced by the ß-glucoside salicin as the sole carbon source. Investigation of the individual bglP and bglB mutants determined that they influence in vitro growth in the ß-glucoside salicin; however, only bglP was necessary for growth in other non-ß-glucoside PTS sugars such as fructose and mannose. Additionally, loss of BglP and BglB suggests they are important for the regulation of virulence-related genes that control biofilm formation, SLS-mediated hemolysis, and localized ulcerative lesion progression during subcutaneous infections in mice. Thus, our results indicate that the ß-glucoside PTS transports salicin and its metabolism can differentially influence GAS pathophysiology during soft tissue infection.","Braza, Rezia Era; Silver, Aliyah B; Sundar, Ganesh S; Davis, Sarah E; Razi, Afrooz; Islam, Emrul; Hart, Meaghan; Zhu, Jinyi; Le Breton, Yoann; McIver, Kevin S",Infect. immun,431,15

The pandemic has likely exacerbated opioid use problems among Indigenous communities, especially for individuals with acute distress or comorbid mental illness, or who are in need of withdrawal management or residential services. In response to the pandemic, we discuss first how greater prescription flexibility has facilitated and even increased access to medications for opioid use disorder. Second, we describe how Indigenous-serving clinics have expanded telemedicine services, albeit not without some challenges. Third, we note challenges with restricted participation in traditional Indigenous healing practices that can be helpful for addiction recovery.

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods study of telemedicine visits across pediatric endocrinology, nephrology, orthopedic surgery, and rheumatology at a large children's hospital. We used deductive analysis to review observational data from 40 video visits. Providers and patients/caregivers were surveyed around areas of satisfaction and communication. RESULTS: We found adaptations of telemedicine including shared-screen use and provider-guided parent procedures among others. All providers felt that it was safest for their patients to conduct visits by video, and 72.7% reported completing some component of a clinical exam. Patients rated the areas of being respected by the clinical staff/provider and showing care and concern highly, and the mean overall satisfaction was 86.7 ± 19.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has been used to deliver care to pediatric patients during the pandemic, and we found that patients were satisfied with the telemedicine visits during this stressful time and that providers were able to innovate during visits. Telemedicine is a tool that can be successfully adapted to patient and provider needs, but further studies are needed to fully explore its integration in pediatric subspecialty care. IMPACT: This study describes telemedicine use at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic from both a provider and patient perspective, in four different pediatric subspecialties. Prior to COVID-19, pediatric telehealth landscape analysis suggested that many pediatric specialty practices had pilot telehealth programs, but there are few published studies evaluating telemedicine performance through the simultaneous patient and provider experience as part of standard care.

We propose a control scheme to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid various adverse effects. To exploit the fact that the disease severity increases considerably with age and comorbidities, we assume that some focused protection measures for those high-risk individuals are implemented and the disease does not spread within the high-risk population. Because the protected population has higher severity ratios than the unprotected population by definition, the protective measure can substantially reduce mortality in the whole population and also avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. Based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered model, social acceptability and feasibility of the proposed strategy are summarized into two easily computable conditions. The proposed framework can be applied to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the proposed scheme if [Formula: see text] and the severity rates of the disease are 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.","Akamatsu, Takashi; Nagae, Takeshi; Osawa, Minoru; Satsukawa, Koki; Sakai, Takara; Mizutani, Daijiro",Sci Rep,431,1

Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested. In case of empyema, rapid IV-to-oral switch seems to be equivalent to prolonged IV treatment.","Tramper-Stranders, Gerdien A.",Paediatr Respir Rev,431,19

CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection. Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 215,461 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified. There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis. The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis. On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic.

This rapid systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence for aerosol production and transmission of respiratory infection associated with procedures that involve airway suctioning or induce coughing/sneezing. The review was informed by PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed for studies published between 1/1/2003 and 6/10/2020. Included studies examined whether nasogastric tube insertion, lung-function tests, nasoendoscopy, dysphagia assessment or suctioning for airway clearance result in aerosol generation or transmission of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, or influenza. Risk of bias assessment assessed robustness of measurement, control for confounding and applicability to clinical practice. Eighteen primary studies and two systematic reviews were included. Three epidemiological studies found no association between nasogastric tube insertion and acquisition of respiratory infections. One simulation study found low/very low production of aerosols associated with pulmonary lung function tests. Seven simulation studies of endoscopic sinus surgery suggested significant increases in aerosols but findings were inconsistent, two clinical studies found airborne particles associated with the use of microdebriders/drills. Some simulation studies did not use robust measures to detect particles and are difficult to equate to clinical conditions. There was an absence of evidence to suggest that the procedures included in the review were associated with an increased risk of transmission of respiratory infection. In order to better target precautions to mitigate risk, more research is required to determine the characteristics of medical procedures and patients that increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Wilson, Jennie; Garson, Gail; Fitzgerald, Shaun; Llewelyn, Martin J.; Jenkins, David; Parker, Simon; Bois, Adam; Thomas, James; Sutcliffe, Katy; Sowden, Amanda; O’Mara-Eves, Alison; Stansfield, Claire; Harriss, Elinor; Reilly, Jacqui",J Hosp Infect,431,2

However, the causations of Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome have been recently explained to involve high replication rate viral infections. In a subset of patients, the extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes that are not quickly cleared by phagocytosis will create a type III hypersensitivity immune reaction. The subsequent release of proteases and other enzymes and the expression or exposure of new immunogenic antigens due to protease attacks on basement membranes of epithelial cells or endothelial cells in blood vessels will induce new autoantibodies and cause Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. There is now increasing evidence that a viral infection of a large surface area of tissue, such as the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract or blood vessels, and a resultant type III hypersensitivity immune reaction is the most plausible explanation for the causations of Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome.

The novel coronavirus disease COVID‐19 has unleashed a pandemic in record time accompanied by an alarming mortality rate mainly due to pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since there are no effective preventive or curative therapies currently, MSC therapy (MSCT) has emerged as a possible candidate despite the lack of preclinical data of MSCs for COVID‐19. Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft‐vs‐host disease reported in 2004. Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious—including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis—as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes. In this article, we review the mechanistic evidence for clinical use of MSCs in pulmonary immune/inflammatory disorders, and survey the ongoing clinical trials—including for COVID‐19—of MSCT for these diseases, with some perspectives and comment on MSCT for COVID‐19.","Yen, B.

We describe the course of a patient with COVID-19 in the setting of an acquired humoral deficiency as a result of chemotherapeutic treatment for rheumatologic conditions. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old Caucasian male presented with non-relieving fever, hypoxemia, and persistent diarrhea after seven days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The patient’s past medical history was significant for mixed connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus treated with methotrexate and rituximab since 2008. He was diagnosed with acquired humoral deficiency in 2017 managed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion every three weeks. The patient’s course of hospitalization was complicated by acute respiratory distress which necessitated intensive unit care and required up to 20 L/min oxygen supplementation via a humidified high flow generator. He was treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and received an IVIG transfusion. The patient was discharged to home after forty-two days of hospitalization with oxygen supplementation only during ambulation and a complete resolution of diarrhea. DISCUSSION: According to current limited data, patients with immunodeficiency have longer length of hospitalization compared to immunocompetent individuals. Our patient demonstrated a form of immunodeficiency as the result of a chemotherapeutic agent, and his clinical course appeared to be more severe. CONCLUSION: More studies are necessary to shed light on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on immunocompromised and immunocompetent and individuals.

OBJECTIVE: Compare invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use between older Asian and White decedents with hospitalization in the last 30 days of life. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A 20% random sample of 2000–2017 Medicare fee-for-service decedents who were 66 years or older and had a hospitalization in the last 30 days of life. EXPOSURE: White and Asian ethnicity as collected by the Social Security Administration. MAIN MEASURES: We identified IMV using validated procedural codes. We compared IMV use between Asian and White fee-for-service decedents using random-effects logistic regression analysis, adjusting for sociodemographics, admitting diagnosis, comorbidities, and secular trends. KEY RESULTS: From 2000 to 2017, we identified 2.1 million White (54.5% female, 82.4±8.1 mean age) and 28,328 Asian (50.8% female, 82.6±8.1 mean age) Medicare fee-for-service decedents hospitalized in the last 30 days. Compared to White decedents, Asian fee-for-service decedents have an increased adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 1.42 (95%CI: 1.38–1.47) for IMV. In sub-analyses, Asians’ AOR for IMV differed by admitting diagnoses (cancer AOR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.15–1.51; congestive heart failure AOR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.47–2.08; dementia AOR=1.93, 95%CI: 1.70–2.20; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AOR=2.25, 95%CI: 1.76–2.89). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to White decedents, Asian Medicare decedents are more likely to receive IMV when hospitalized at the end-of-life, especially among patients with non-cancer admitting diagnoses. Future research to better understand the reasons for these differences and perceived quality of end-of-life care among Asian Americans is urgently needed.","Jia, Zhimeng; Leiter, Richard E.; Sanders, Justin J.; Sullivan, Donald R.; Gozalo, Pedro; Bunker, Jennifer N.; Teno, Joan M.",J Gen Intern Med,431,16

In this field study, we evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott Diagnostics, Jena, Germany) for this purpose. METHODS: A total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9–87) were enrolled. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from household (n = 338) and non-household contacts (n = 296) of COVID-19 cases. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care. The RT-PCR test used was the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). RESULTS: Household contacts were tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1–7) after diagnosis of the index case, whereas non-household contacts (n = 296) were tested at a median of 6 days (range, 1–7) after exposure. In total, 79 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38 (48.1%) yielded positive RAD results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAD test was 48.1% (95% CI 37.4–58.9) and 100% (95% CI 99.3–100), respectively. Sensitivity was higher in household (50.8%; 95% CI 38.9–62.5) than in non-household (35.7%; 95% CI 16.3–61.2%) contacts. Individuals testing positive by RAD test were more likely (p < 0.001) to become symptomatic than their negative counterparts. DISCUSSION: The Panbio test displays low sensitivity in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-household contacts. Nonetheless, establishing the optimal timing for upper respiratory tract collection in this group seems imperative to pinpoint test sensitivity.","Torres, Ignacio; Poujois, Sandrine; Albert, Eliseo; Colomina, Javier; Navarro, David",Clin Microbiol Infect,431,16

In this study, the potential to enhance the N-removal capability of an existing University of Cape Town membrane bioreactor system (UCT-MBR) system is evaluated through process modeling. In addition to external carbon addition, the UCT-MBR system is proposed to be converted into an anoxic-oxic (AO) configuration with two operation plans: one is single-sludge (suspended sludge) and the other is double-sludge (suspended sludge and biofilm). The choice between pushing anammox and enhancing conventional heterotrophic denitrification is assessed. The simulation result indicates it is feasible to strategically adjust the spatial-temporal balance between electron donors and electron acceptors to achieve enhanced N-removal by utilizing the influent organic carbon other than adding external carbon. Although anammox can be promoted in the double-sludge-based AO under low-DO conditions, pushing anammox will weaken the system’s resilience to influent fluctuations and carries no economic advantage over the single-sludge-based AO.

However, the origin and direct ancestral viruses of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. RaTG13, a novel coronavirus found in bats in China’s Yunnan Province, is the closest relative virus of the SARS-CoV-2 identified so far. In this study, a new SARS-CoV-2 related virus, provisionally named PrC31, was discovered in Yunnan province by retrospectively analyse bat next generation sequencing (NGS) data of intestinal samples collected in 2018. PrC31 shared 90.7% and 92.0% nucleotide identities to the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and the bat SARSr-CoV ZC45, respectively. Sequence alignment of PrC31 showed that several genomic regions, especially orf1a and orf8 had the highest homology with those corresponding genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 than any other related viruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PrC31 shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 in evolutionary history. The differences between the PrC31 and SARS-CoV-2 genomes were mainly manifested in the spike genes. The amino acid homology between the receptor binding domains of PrC31 and SARS-CoV-2 was only 64.2%. Importantly, recombination analysis revealed that PrC31 underwent multiple complex recombination events (including three recombination breakpoints) involving the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineages, indicating that PrC31 evolved from yet-to-be-identified intermediate recombination strains. Combined with previous studies, it is revealed that the beta-CoVs may possess a more complex recombination mechanism than we thought.","Li, Li-li; Wang, Jing-lin; Ma, Xiao-hua; Sun, Xiao-man; Li, Jin-song; Yang, Xiao-fei; Shi, Wei-feng; Duan, Zhao-jun",Emerging microbes & infections,431,32

The frequency of communication by e-mail and/or videoconference between members of the teaching team and students must be adapted to the situation. Exchanges by e-mail allow for traceability, while videoconferencing allows direct interaction and a way out of isolation. Autonomy, appreciated by the students, was nevertheless combined with a strong variation in motivation; the anxiety-provoking period in which pedagogical continuity was built up may explain this contradictory observation. CONCLUSION: The results obtained largely confirm the data in the literature. The experience gained through this survey should lead teachers to continue their reflection by test/integrating and evaluating distance education systems, while continuing face-to-face activities.","Zorn, Claudine; Feffer, Marie-Laurence; Bauer, Éric; Dillenseger, Jean-Philippe",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,431,16

So what about this distinction in critical care and resuscitation services where caregivers are at the forefront of events? What to do with emotions? The objective of this work is to pose a medico-psychological and ethical perspective on these questions, starting from the hypothesis that emotions have a specific use during the pandemic. The first step will be to show that anguish and fear, although different from an epistemological point of view, arise from the same historical place, which is the discourse of the medical world with death. The awareness of the inevitable makes share the same need of the caregiver and the citizen of a psychic economy which will lead to differentiating two possible reactions to emotions: one to face up and one to come to terms with. This psychic interlacing, inherent to the pandemic context, calls for critical care on a moral dimension related to the issue of abandonment of the human person and the poorly understood notion of “mass death”. An answer to this difficulty would be found in the concept of “being-caregiver-close” but its application also supposes an ethical reflection on the outlets and the personal virtues.","Fourel, D.; Segondi, A.; Delaunay, M.; Gallego, C.",Ethique Sante,431,26

It is often a mild disease and seldom results in paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission. In 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) coined the word SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in patients with severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars) for an outbreak of AP in Hong Kong due to a novel coronavirus. In 2012, another outbreak of coronavirus AP occurred in the Middle East. Confusing case definitions such as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) were coined. This paper aims to present a case of MP with sars, ARDS, pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and review the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP. METHODS: We presented a case of MP with sars, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and performed a literature review on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care. RESULTS: In early 2013, an 11‐year‐old girl presented with sars, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), right‐sided pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was treated with multiple antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae was not isolated in this girl with ‘typical’ pneumonia by symptomatology and chest radiography, but tracheal aspirate identified MP instead. The respiratory equations are computed with PaO(2)/FiO(2) consistent with severe lung injury. Literature on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care is reviewed. Six, 165 and 293 articles were found when PubMed (a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms ‘mycoplasma’ and ‘ICU’, ‘mycoplasma’ and ‘mortality’, and ‘mycoplasma' and ‘severe’. Mortality and PICU admission associated with MP is general low and rarely reported. Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of lung injuries in MP infection is associated with a cell‐mediated immune reaction, and high responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy has been reported especially for severe disease. Management of severe mycoplasma infection in the PICU includes general cardiopulmonary support and specific antimicrobial treatment. Macrolide resistance genotypes have been detected. CONCLUSION: We urge health organizations to refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions each and every time when outbreaks of AP occur.","Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Agnes S.

Though core competencies of family medicine (FM) have been clearly defined by WONCA, there has been an ongoing debate on what the CVs are for family doctors (FDs). Ukraine is a developing country in the middle of Europe with a population of 43 million inhabitants, gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine is a low-income country, developing a modern European healthcare system, especially regarding FM. To implement WONCA standards, it is mandatory to assess the ongoing understanding of CVs in clinical daily practice among active FDs, working in different countries of Europe including Ukraine. Research questions: How do Ukrainian FDs (Delphi group experts) define the CVs of FM in Ukraine and how important are these CVs to a wider population of Ukrainian FDs in their everyday practice? Methods: A mixed method study was conducted in two steps during August and September 2020 in Ukraine. The first part was a qualitative Delphi round (three rounds) design among 20 Ukrainian FDs who were familiar with teaching and terms like CV. A consensus list of six CVs has emerged from the Delphi round study. The second part was a quantitative survey among Ukrainian FDs, who were not specially used to discussing CVs. The consensus list of those six CVs was then submitted to 2000 FDs (randomly selected) who were not involved in the Delphi team, to rank those values from one to nine, according to the importance from their personal point of view. Demographic characteristics have been assessed for all the participants of the Delphi round and quantitative survey. Results: Twenty FDs were involved as experts in the first Delphi round, whereas only five experts continued their participation in the second and the third rounds of the survey. The following six CVs emerged from the Delphi round: comprehensive approach, care coordination, first recourse, continuity of care, integrated approach, and patient and family centered care. The final sample consisted of 375 FDs (19% response rate). There were 323 (88.7%) female and 34 (9.3%) male FDs in the sample. The mean age of the participants was 44.6±13.5 years. Discussion/Conclusion: Defining CVs for FM by Ukrainian FDs in a given socio-economical and historical-cultural setting is crucial to optimize primary medical care and to guarantee an appropriate and successful implementation of WONCA standards as well as CVs in different countries including those where reformation of the health system is ongoing.","Kolesnyk, Pavlo; Bayen, Sabine; Shushman, Ivanna; Kolesnyk, Andrew; Kuodza, George; Klemenc-Ketiš, Zalika; Frese, Thomas",Front Med (Lausanne),431,16

More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR‐mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody‐dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a “scaffolding” role for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcγR function and the complexity of the relationships between FcγRs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent “next‐gen” therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcγRs or the inhibitory FcγRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcγR interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of FcγR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.","Chenoweth, Alicia M; Wines, Bruce D; Anania, Jessica C; Mark Hogarth, P",Immunol Cell Biol,431,21

In this study we aimed to provide surgical neuro-oncologists with practice guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic based on objective data from a high-volume brain tumor surgeon at the current COVID-19 epicenter. METHODS: All outpatient visits and surgeries performed by the senior author during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared between the initial quarantine (3/23/20–5/4/20), the plateau period following quarantine (5/5/20–6/27/20), and the second peak (6/28/20–7/20/20). In-person and telemedicine visits were evaluated for crossovers. Surgeries were subdivided based on lesion type and evaluated across the same time period. RESULTS: From 3/23/20–7/20/20, 469 clinic visits and 196 surgeries were identified. After quarantine was lifted, face-to-face visits increased (P < 0.01) yet no change in telehealth visits occurred. Of 327 telehealth visits, only 5.8% converted to in-person during the 4-month period with the most cited reason being patient preference (68.4%). Of the 196 surgeries performed during the pandemic, 29.1% occurred during quarantine, 49.0% during the plateau, and 21.9% occurred in the second peak. No COVID negative patients developed symptoms at follow-up. 55.6% were performed on malignant tumors and 31.6% were benign with no difference in case volumes throughout the pandemic.

In this present study, variations in terms of missense mutations among the SARS-CoV2 genomes from 128 Indian patients, as of May 2020, are accounted and thereby some key findings with some hypotheses were made. These mutations across various genes of these genomes show wide genetic variations in sequence and rapid evolution of SARS-CoV2 virus. The presence of unique mutations in the studied SARS-CoV2 genomes has led to their attenuation. Few Genes such as ORF6, ORF10 are free from any mutations in the Indian context of 339 genomes observed as of 14th July 2020. Further, E protein contains only one mutation. This may suggest that designing a therapeutic approach against ORF6, ORF10 and E genes may have a beneficial effect in controlling COVID-19 pandemic especially in India.","Hassan, Sk.

The story is a fundamentally optimistic one. In 2019 global life expectancy was approaching 73 years. In 1800 it was probably about 30. To understand the origins of this transition, we have to look at the historical sequence by which so many causes of premature death have been vanquished over time. In England that story begins much earlier than often supposed, in the years around 1600. The first two ‘victories’ were over famine and plague. However, economic changes with negative influences on mortality meant that, despite this, life expectancies were either falling or stable between the late sixteenth and mid eighteenth centuries. The late eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw major declines in deaths from smallpox, malaria and typhus and the beginnings of the long‐run increases in life expectancy. The period also saw urban areas become capable of demographic growth without a constant stream of migrants from the countryside: a necessary precondition for the global urbanization of the last two centuries and for modern economic growth. Since 1840 the highest national life expectancy globally has increased by three years in every decade.","Shaw‐Taylor, Leigh",Econ Hist Rev,431,3

METHODS: One hundred ICR mice were randomly divided into the virus control, the Tamiflu control and the QZD high-, medium-, and low-dose groups. Mice were infected intranasally with influenza virus (H1N1) at 10 median lethal dose (LD(50)). QZD and Tamiflu were administered intragastrically twice daily from day 0 to day 7 after infection. The virus control group was treated with distilled water alone under the same condition. The number of surviving mice was recorded daily for 14 days after viral infection. The histological damage and viral replication and the expression of inflammatory cytokines were monitored. Additionally, the suppression capacity on the secretion of regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in epithelial and macrophage cell-lines were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the virus control group, the survival rate of the QZD groups signifificantly improved in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05), the viral titers in lung tissue was inhibited (P<0.05), and the production of inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were suppressed (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the secretion of RANTETS and TNF-α by epithelial and macrophage cell-lines was inhibited with the treatment of QZD respectively in vitro (p<0.05) CONCLUSIONS: The preventive effects of QZD on influenza virus infection might be due to its unique cytokine inhibition mechanism.

Such data are vital for understanding the pandemic's progression on the continent, evaluating containment measures, and policy planning. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, nationally representative, age-stratified serosurvey in Sierra Leone in March 2021 by randomly selecting 120 Enumeration Areas throughout the country and 10 randomly selected households in each of these. One to two persons per selected household were interviewed to collect information on socio-demographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. Capillary blood was collected by fingerstick, and blood samples were tested using the Hangzhou Biotest Biotech RightSign COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. Total seroprevalence was was estimated after applying sampling weights. FINDINGS: The overall weighted seroprevalence was 2.6% (95% CI 1.9-3.4). This is 43 times higher than the reported number of cases. Rural seropositivity was 1.8% (95% CI 1.0-2.5), and urban seropositivity was 4.2% (95% CI 2.6-5.7). INTERPRETATION: Although overall seroprevalence was low compared to countries in Europe and the Americas (suggesting relatively successful containment in Sierra Leone), our findings indicate enormous underreporting of active cases. This has ramifications for the country’s third wave (which started in June 2021), where the average number of daily reported cases was 87 by the end of the month—this could potentially be on the order of 3,700 actual infections, calling for stronger containment measures in a country with only 0.2% of people fully vaccinated. It may also reflect significant underreporting of incidence and mortality across the continent.","Barrie, Mohamed Bailor; Lakoh, Sulaiman; Kelly, J.

Bitter taste receptor phenotype appears to be associated with the clinical course and symptom duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between T2R phenotype and patient clinical course after infection with SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study was performed from July 1 through September 30, 2020, at a tertiary outpatient clinical practice and inpatient hospital in the United States among 1935 participants (patients and health care workers) with occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. EXPOSURE: Exposure to SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants underwent T2R38 phenotype taste testing to determine whether they were supertasters (those who experienced greater intensity of bitter tastes), tasters, or nontasters (those who experienced low intensity of bitter tastes or no bitter tastes) and underwent evaluation for lack of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and IgM and IgG testing. A group of participants was randomly selected for genotype analysis to correlate phenotype. Participants were followed up until confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via PCR testing. Phenotype of T2R38 was retested after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The results were compared with clinical course. RESULTS: A total of 1935 individuals (1101 women [56.9%]; mean [SD] age, 45.5 [13.9] years) participated in the study. Results of phenotype taste testing showed that 508 (26.3%) were supertasters, 917 (47.4%) were tasters, and 510 (26.4%) were nontasters. A total of 266 participants (13.7%) had positive PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 55 (20.7%) required hospitalization. Symptom duration among patients with positive results ranged from 0 to 48 days. Nontasters were significantly more likely than tasters and supertasters to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 10.1 [95% CI, 5.8-17.8]; P < .001), to be hospitalized once infected (odds ratio, 3.9 [1.5-10.2]; P = .006), and to be symptomatic for a longer duration (mean [SE] duration, 23.7 [0.5] days vs 13.5 [0.4] days vs 5.0 [0.6] days; P < .001). A total of 47 of 55 patients (85.5%) with COVID-19 who required inpatient admission were nontasters. Conversely, 15 of 266 patients (5.6%) with positive PCR test results were supertasters. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that T2R38 receptor allelic variants were associated with participants’ innate immune response toward SARS-CoV-2. The T2R phenotype was associated with patients’ clinical course after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nontasters were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the other 2 groups, suggesting enhanced innate immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Barham, Henry P.; Taha, Mohamed A.; Broyles, Stephanie T.; Stevenson, Megan M.; Zito, Brittany A.; Hall, Christian A.",JAMA Netw Open,431,26

Based on current reports, it was surprising that the characteristics of many patients with COVID-19, who fulfil the Berlin criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are not always like those of patients with typical ARDS and can change over time. While the mechanisms of COVID-19–related respiratory dysfunction in COVID-19 have not yet been fully elucidated, pulmonary microvascular thrombosis is speculated to be involved. Considering that thrombosis is highly related to other inflammatory lung diseases, immunothrombosis, a two-way process that links coagulation and inflammation, seems to be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including respiratory dysfunction. Thus, the current manuscript will describe the proinflammatory milieu in COVID-19, summarize current evidence of thrombosis in COVID-19, and discuss possible interactions between these two.","Fang, Xiang-Zhi; Wang, Ya-Xin; Xu, Ji-Qain; He, Ya-Jun; Peng, Zhe-Kang; Shang, You",Front Immunol,431,16

However, risk stratification and prediction of SARS-CoV-2 patient clinical outcomes upon ICU admission remain inadequate. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model, based on retrospective & prospective clinical data, to stratify patient risk and predict ICU survival and outcomes. METHODS: A Germany-wide electronic registry was established to pseudonymously collect admission, therapeutic and discharge information of SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients retrospectively and prospectively. Machine learning approaches were evaluated for the accuracy and interpretability of predictions. The Explainable Boosting Machine approach was selected as the most suitable method. Individual, non-linear shape functions for predictive parameters and parameter interactions are reported. RESULTS: 1039 patients were included in the Explainable Boosting Machine model, 596 patients retrospectively collected, and 443 patients prospectively collected. The model for prediction of general ICU outcome was shown to be more reliable to predict “survival”. Age, inflammatory and thrombotic activity, and severity of ARDS at ICU admission were shown to be predictive of ICU survival. Patients’ age, pulmonary dysfunction and transfer from an external institution were predictors for ECMO therapy. The interaction of patient age with D-dimer levels on admission and creatinine levels with SOFA score without GCS were predictors for renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Using Explainable Boosting Machine analysis, we confirmed and weighed previously reported and identified novel predictors for outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Using this strategy, predictive modeling of COVID-19 ICU patient outcomes can be performed overcoming the limitations of linear regression models.

The present study examined willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine, the associated reasons for willingness/unwillingness, and vaccine safety perceptions in a cross-sectional assessment of community adults in Ontario. Methods: 1367 individuals (60.3% female, M age = 38.6) completed an online assessment between January 15, 2021 and February 15, 2021. Perceptions were investigated in general and by age, sex and education. Results: Overall, 82.8% sample reported they were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 17.2% reported they were unwilling. The three most common reasons for unwillingness were long-term side effects (65.5%), immediate side effects (60.5%), and lack of trust in the vaccine (55.2%). Vaccine willingness significantly differed by sex and education level, with female participants and those with less than a bachelors degree being more likely to report unwillingness. Perception of COVID-19 vaccine safety was significantly lower (-10.7%) than vaccines in general and differed by age, sex and education, with females, older adults, and individuals with less than a bachelors degree reporting lower perceived COVID-19 vaccine safety. Conclusion: In this sample of community adults, under one in five individuals was unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, but with higher rates in population subgroups. Targeting public health messaging to females and individuals with less than Bachelors degree, and addressing concerns about long-term and immediate side effects may increase vaccine uptake.","Syan, S.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine, Shulifenxiao formula, as a promising regimen. Methods: A total of 31 RIMN patients resistant to corticosteroid or immunosuppressive agents were retrospectively analyzed. Shulifenxiao treatment lasted a minimum of 12°months in all patients and extended to 24°months in 11 patients. The primary outcomes [the complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)] and secondary outcomes (the serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels) were measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24°months. Results: The data provided an average follow-up of 21 ± 9.16°months from baseline. The remission was attained in 25/31 patients (80.7%: CR 29.0% and PR 51.6%) at 12°months and in 10/11 patients (90.9%: CR 54.6% and PR 36.4%) at 24°months, respectively. Proteinuria reduced from 6.02 g/d at baseline to 0.98 g/d at 12°months (p < 0.001) and to 0.27 g/d at 24°months (p = 0.003); serum albumin increased from 28 g/L to 37.2 g/L at 12°months (p < 0.001) and to 41.3 g/L at 24°months (p = 0.003); eGFR improved from 100.25 ml/min/1.73 m(2) to 118.39 ml/min/1.73 m(2) at 6°months (p < 0.001) and finally to 111.62 ml/min/1.73 m(2)at 24°months (p = 0.008).

COVID-19 patient autopsies have revealed thrombi in the microvasculature, suggesting intravascular coagulation as a prominent feature of organ failure in these patients. Interestingly, in COVID-19, pulmonary compliance is preserved despite severe hypoxemia corroborating the hypothesis that perfusion mismatch may play a significant role in the development of respiratory failure. METHODS: We describe a series of 27 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo-Brazil and treated with heparin in therapeutic doses tailored to clinical severity.

The coagulopathy and cerebral hemorrhage have been recently reported in these patients. Prolonged acetaminophen use increases the international normalized ratio (INR) and the risk of bleeding among patients taking anti-coagulants. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) by acetaminophen and NAC in chronic applications has been reported, however, detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanism and binding sites are not clear. Herein, we built the homology model of human VKOR (hVKOR) using ITASSER server, confirmed, and applied it for docking analysis of its interaction with acetaminophen and its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), and NAC. We also calculated the lipophilicity and predicted the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeation of NAPQI by Swiss ADME. Our analysis showed that NAPQI and NAC, but not acetaminophen, bind strongly to the similar sites in hVKOR via both hydrogen and van der Waals bonding; particularly with Cys135. Thus, it interrupted the vitamin K reducing electron transfer pathway. Further, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study revealed that the interactions of the ligands with hVKOR are stable. In conclusion, our analysis shed a light on the molecular mechanism of acetaminophen-induced coagulopathy previously reported in some clinical cases with chronic acetaminophen use. Furthermore, considering the anti-coagulopathy of NAPQI and NAC but not acetaminophen, the BBB permeation potency of these agents, and the risk of coagulopathy in COVID-19, we suggest a regular prothrombin time (PT) and INR monitoring of these patients taking acetaminophen and/or NAC.

Our patient was admitted 20 days after SARS-CoV-2 detection for evening-rise fever. Laboratory testing showed severe neutropenia while chest x-ray detected moderate pulmonary involvement. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosis was made through morphological and molecular analysis on bone marrow aspirate. Given the stability of the blood count and clinical conditions, antiviral therapy with Remdesivir and Convalescent Plasma was started before antileukemic treatment, obtaining a rapid resolution of the infection. Conclusion: In our experience, the treatment with Remdesivir and Convalescent Plasma led to a rapid resolution of Sars-Cov-2 infection. Our case did not present any adverse event to the therapy. Thus, this treatment could be considered in patients with malignancies, in order to accelerate the resolution of the infection and begin immunosuppressive treatment safely.

Meanwhile, more cost-effective and precise COVID-19 detection methods are being preferred worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Machine vision–based COVID-19 detection methods, especially deep learning as a diagnostic method in the early stages of the pandemic, have been assigned great importance during the pandemic. This study aimed to design a highly efficient computer-aided detection (CAD) system for COVID-19 by using a neural search architecture network (NASNet)–based algorithm. METHODS: NASNet, a state-of-the-art pretrained convolutional neural network for image feature extraction, was adopted to identify patients with COVID-19 in their early stages of the disease. A local data set, comprising 10,153 computed tomography scans of 190 patients with and 59 without COVID-19 was used. RESULTS: After fitting on the training data set, hyperparameter tuning, and topological alterations of the classifier block, the proposed NASNet-based model was evaluated on the test data set and yielded remarkable results. The proposed model's performance achieved a detection sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.999, 0.986, and 0.996, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model achieved acceptable results in the categorization of 2 data classes. Therefore, a CAD system was designed on the basis of this model for COVID-19 detection using multiple lung computed tomography scans. The system differentiated all COVID-19 cases from non–COVID-19 ones without any error in the application phase. Overall, the proposed deep learning–based CAD system can greatly help radiologists detect COVID-19 in its early stages. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of a CAD system as a screening tool would accelerate disease detection and prevent the loss of health care resources.","Ghaderzadeh, Mustafa; Asadi, Farkhondeh; Jafari, Ramezan; Bashash, Davood; Abolghasemi, Hassan; Aria, Mehrad",J Med Internet Res,431,1

However, the link between skin manifestations and the severity of the disease remains debatable. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the temporal relationship between different types of skin lesions and the severity of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for relevant studies published between January and July 2020 using Pubmed/Medline, Embase, and Web of knowledge. The following keywords were used: “SARS-CoV-2” or “COVID-19” or “new coronavirus” or “Wuhan Coronavirus” or “coronavirus disease 2019” and “skin disease” or “skin manifestation” or “cutaneous manifestation.” Results: Out of 381 articles, 47 meet the inclusion criteria and a total of 1,847 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were examined. The overall frequency of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients was 5.95%. The maculopapular rash was the main reported skin involvement (37.3%) commonly occurred in middle-aged females with intermediate severity of the disease. Forty-eight percentage of the patients had a mild, 32% a moderate, and 20% a severe COVID-19 disease. The mild disease was mainly correlated with chilblain-like and urticaria-like lesions and patients with vascular lesions experienced a more severe disease. Seventy-two percentage of patients with chilblain-like lesions improved without any medication. The overall mortality rate was 4.5%. Patients with vascular lesions had the highest mortality rate (18.2%) and patients with urticaria-like lesions had the lowest mortality rate (2.2%). Conclusion: The mere occurrence of skin manifestations in COVID-19 patients is not an indicator for the disease severity, and it highly depends on the type of skin lesions. Chilblain-like and vascular lesions are the ends of a spectrum in which from chilblain-like to vascular lesions, the severity of the disease increases, and the patient's prognosis worsens. Those with vascular lesions should also be considered as high-priority patients for further medical care.","Jamshidi, Parnian; Hajikhani, Bahareh; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Vahidnezhad, Hassan; Dadashi, Masoud; Nasiri, Mohammad Javad",Front Med (Lausanne),431,20

METHODS: Using social media to reach a broad range of physicians, a convenience sample of physician mothers completed an on-line survey posted between April 27 and May 11. Members were encouraged to repost on social media and share with personal contacts resulting in a passive snowball sampling effect. RESULTS: A total of 2709 physician mothers from 48 states, Puerto Rico, and 19 countries representing more than 25 medical specialties completed the survey. Most were between 30 and 39 y of age, 67% self-identified as white, 17% as Asian, 4% as African American. Most had been working for 11-16 y. A total of 91% had a spouse/partner of the opposite sex. Over half were practicing in an area they identified as high COVID-19 density, while 50% had personally cared for a person with COVID-19. Physician mothers were most concerned about exposing their children to COVID-19 and about the morale and safety of their staff. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to explore the personal and professional challenges facing physician mothers during a pandemic. Physician mothers were most concerned about exposing their families to COVID-19. Mothers continued to work and at times increased their work, despite having domestic, childcare, and schooling responsibilities.","Pearson, Claire; Levine, Miriam; Messman, Anne; Chopra, Teena; Awali, Reda; Robb, Lauren; Melikian, Ryan; Janis, Andrea; Levine, Diane L.",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,431,23

This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit–risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient’s individualized situation.

Infected hosts exhibit diverse clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms in their genital organs, respiratory, digestive, and circulatory systems. Considering the high transmissibility (R(0): ≤6.0) compared to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV, the quest for the clinical development of suitable antiviral nanotherapeutics (NTPs) is incessant.

The present study aimed to examine the effects of obsessive–compulsive (OC) symptom dimensions and OCD severity on suicidal ideation by considering the role of stress responses in reaction to COVID‐19 in a clinical sample of patients with OCD. In a cross‐sectional study, 304 patients with OCD completed measures of OC symptom dimensions, OCD severity, general mental health (depression and anxiety), and COVID‐19‐related stress. Results showed that after controlling for depression, anxiety, comorbidity, and lifetime suicide attempts, the OC symptom dimensions of responsibility for harm and unacceptable obsessional thoughts as well as general severity had indirect effects on suicidal ideation through the specific stress responses to COVID‐19, including traumatic stress and compulsive checking. The study shows that OCD patients with specific OC symptom dimensions and severe OCD are more likely to have suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Further, the specific stress responses to COVID‐19 may be an underlying mechanism. Clinicians should carefully assess suicidal ideation in patients with OCD who experience responsibility for harm and unacceptable thoughts, particularly during the pandemic.","Khosravani, Vahid; Samimi Ardestani, Seyed Mehdi; Sharifi Bastan, Farangis; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J.

We previously reported that leukemia patients were more susceptible to COVID-19 than the overall population. However, for COVID-19 recovered patients with leukemia, the impacts of intensive chemotherapy on the immune memory of COVID-19 are unknown. This study characterized the changes in immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in acute leukemia patients, who underwent chemotherapy after recovering from COVID-19. The study enrolled three groups of individuals. One group was a total of three acute leukemia patients, who recovered well from COVID-19 before the last cycle of chemotherapy. The other two groups were six COVID-19 recovered healthy people, and six normal uninfected healthy people, respectively. Levels of B cells, T cells, and NK cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were monitored. The results showed that B cells were severely decreased after chemotherapy, especially memory B cells. Most of the T cells and NK cells showed only minor changes after chemotherapy, except for γδ T cells. The serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not significantly affected after chemotherapy in two leukemia patients. However, interestingly, one leukemia patient's SARS-CoV-2 IgM showed dramatically increase, suggesting possible loss of serological memory after chemotherapy. These findings raised the concern for the stability of immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 during chemotherapy and the choice of anti-leukemia treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Wei; Li, Ziping; He, Wenjuan; Yu, Dan; Wang, Ping; Cai, Li; Yang, Peng; Chen, Xuexing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhou, Hao",J Cancer,431,1

Italy is one of the most affected countries by COVID-19, particularly in the northern regions. Several studies consider COVID-19 a zoonotic disease and, since Italy is the repository of a high biodiversity, SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals can be considered as a reservoir of the virus or favor the spreading between animals and humans. In this work, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of ACE2 protein of the most common domestic and wild animals present in Italy. Among the latter, we focused on ACE2 of the Chiroptera species present in Italy, to identify the primary reservoir in this region. First, we reproduced in silico the Chiroptera ACE2/viral Spike (S) protein interactions on the human ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 S complex model and identified the critical residues for the binding. In silico molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to Chiroptera vs. SARS-CoV-2 S protein pointed to Rhinolophus ferrumequinum as a bat living in Italy, that may be a potential primary reservoir of the virus. On the other hand, a sequence similarity search on ACE2 of domestic and wild animals living in Italy pointed to domestic (horses, cats, cattle and sheep) and wild (European rabbits and grizzly bears) animal species as potential SARS-CoV-2 secondary reservoirs. Molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to these species vs. S protein of Bat coronavirus (Bt-CoV/Rp3/2004) suggests that the primary reservoir Rhinolophus ferrumequinum may infect the secondary reservoirs, domestic and worldwide animals living in Italy, determining a specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Buonocore, Michela; Marino, Carmen; Grimaldi, Manuela; Santoro, Angelo; Firoznezhad, Mohammad; Paciello, Orlando; Prisco, Francesco; D’Ursi, Anna Maria",Heliyon,431,16

This study examined changes in and predictors of adolescent mental health from before to during the COVID‐19 pandemic in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. METHODS: Participants include 238 adolescents (132 males; ages 15–17; 118 with ADHD). Parents and adolescents provided ratings of mental health symptoms shortly before the COVID‐19 pandemic and in spring and summer 2020. RESULTS: Adolescents on average experienced an increase in depression, anxiety, sluggish cognitive tempo, inattentive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre‐COVID‐19 to spring 2020; however, with the exception of inattention, these symptoms decreased from spring to summer 2020. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to experience an increase in inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms. Adolescents with poorer pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities were at‐risk for experiencing increases in all mental health symptoms relative to adolescents with better pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities. Interactive risk based on ADHD status and pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities was found for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, such that adolescents with ADHD and poor pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation displayed the highest symptomatology across timepoints. Lower family income related to increases in inattention but higher family income related to increases in oppositional/defiant symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The early observed increases in adolescent mental health symptoms during the COVID‐19 pandemic do not on average appear to be sustained following the lift of stay‐at‐home orders, though studies evaluating mental health across longer periods of time are needed. Emotion dysregulation and ADHD increase risk for sustained negative mental health functioning and highlight the need for interventions for these populations during chronic stressors.

PCR-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on expensive centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests, that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus, are rapid and inexpensive but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, we have created an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute Do-It-Yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/l) and specificity (>97% True Negative Rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Our workflow, ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test), incorporates the following features: 1) Increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from reaction, 2) Improved specificity by using sequence-specific QUASR reporters, 3) Increased sensitivity through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal, 4) Quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target, and 5) Co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as Influenza B, by duplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets. The flexible nature of the ALERT workflow allows easy, at-home and point-of-care testing for individuals and higher-throughput processing for centralized labs and hospitals. With minimal effort, SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets can be swapped out for other targets to repurpose ALERT to detect other viruses, microorganisms or nucleic acid-based markers.","Bektas, A.; Covington, M.

We describe the use of lung ultrasound imaging and findings in two cases of severe respiratory failure from avian influenza A (H7N9) infection. METHODS: Serial lung ultrasound images and video from two cases of H7N9 respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a tertiary care intensive care unit were analyzed for characteristic lung ultrasound findings described previously for respiratory failure and infection. These findings were followed serially, correlated with clinical course and chest X-ray. RESULTS: In both patients, characteristic lung ultrasound findings have been observed as previously described in viral pulmonary infections: subpleural consolidations associated or not with local pleural effusion. In addition, numerous, confluent, or coalescing B-lines leading to ‘white lung’ with corresponding pleural line thickening are associated with ARDS. Extension or reduction of lesions observed with ultrasound was also correlated respectively with clinical worsening or improvement. Coexisting consolidated pneumonia with sonographic air bronchograms was noted in one patient who did not survive.

Dynamic linear models were trained to forecast the weekly hospitalisations based on teleradiological activity predictors. RESULTS: A total of 100,018 CT-scans were included over 36 weeks, and 19,133 (19%) performed within the COVID-19 workflow. Concomitantly, 227,677 hospitalisations were reported. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were almost perfectly superimposed (cross-correlation coefficients at lag 0: 0.90–0.92). Maximal number of COVID-19 CT-scans was reached the week of 2020-03-23 (1 086 CT-scans), 1 week before the highest hospitalisations (23,542 patients). The best valid forecasting model combined the number of COVID-19 CT-scans and the number of hospitalisations during the prior two weeks and provided the lowest mean absolute percentage (5.09%, testing period: 2020-11-02 to 2020-11-29). CONCLUSION: Monitoring COVID-19 CT-scan activity in emergencies accurately and instantly predicts hospitalisations and helps adjust medical resources, paving the way for complementary public health indicators.

Cellular X-domain associated macrodomain protein/ADP-ribose-1″-monophosphatase (Appr-1″-pase) activities are also reported in coronaviruses (CoV), including identification of its homologs in alpha and rubella viruses. The present study investigated the role(s) of X-domain residues in HEV replication cycle. In silico analysis showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation of X-domain (a.a. 785–942) a.a. positions wherein the N-terminus residues ‘Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, and Gly817’ formed a potential catalytic-site homolog of CoVAppr-1″-pase. To experimentally test this prediction, X-domain ‘active-site’ residues were subjected to mutational analysis using the HEV-SAR55 replicon (pSK-GFP). FACS analysis of mutant RNA transfected S10-3 cells showed that Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala constructs completely abrogated HEV replication, similar to their Gly816Val and Gly817Val counterparts. However, ‘Gly815Ala’ mutant replicated very poorly in contrast to ‘Gly815Val’ that completely abolished GFP synthesis. Furthermore, while ‘Asn806Ala’ mutant retained RNA replication, the ‘Asn809Ala’ and His812Leu mutants showed non-viability. Notably, in a sequential-nucleotide mutation analysis, the dispensability of X-domain in HEV replication at transcriptional level has already been demonstrated (Parvez, 2013b). Taken together, the present data strongly argue for an essential role of X-domain residues (Asn809, His812, Gly816 and Gly817) at post-translational level, indicating its involvement in viral replication. In conclusion, the speculated regulatory role of ORF1 X-domain in HEV replication cycle critically depends on the ‘Asn, Asn, His, Gly, Gly, Gly’ segment/secondary structure. Nevertheless, further biochemical or biophysical characterizations of HEV X-domain associated Appr-1″-pase activity would only confirm its biological significance in virus or host-pathogenesis.","Parvez, Mohammad Khalid",Gene,431,26

Currently listed diseases include Chikungunya, cholera, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Hendra virus infection, influenza, Lassa fever, Marburg virus disease, Neisseria meningitis, MERS-CoV, monkeypox, Nipah virus infection, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), plague, Rift Valley fever, SARS, smallpox, tularemia, yellow fever, and Zika virus disease. The associated pathogens are increasingly important on the global stage. The majority of these diseases have neurological manifestations. Those with less frequent neurological manifestations may also have important consequences. This is highlighted now in particular through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reinforces that pathogens with the potential to spread rapidly and widely, in spite of concerted global efforts, may affect the nervous system. We searched the scientific literature, dating from 1934 to August 2020, to compile data on the cause, epidemiology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging features, and treatment of each of the diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential as viewed through a neurologist's lens. We included articles with an abstract or full text in English in this topical and scoping review. Diseases with epidemic and pandemic potential can be spread directly from human to human, animal to human, via mosquitoes or other insects, or via environmental contamination. Manifestations include central neurologic conditions (meningitis, encephalitis, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, seizures), peripheral and cranial nerve syndromes (sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, ophthalmoplegia), post-infectious syndromes (acute inflammatory polyneuropathy), and congenital syndromes (fetal microcephaly), among others. Some diseases have not been well-characterized from a neurological standpoint, but all have at least scattered case reports of neurological features. Some of the diseases have curative treatments available while in other cases, supportive care remains the only management option. Regardless of the pathogen, prompt, and aggressive measures to control the spread of these agents are the most important factors in lowering the overall morbidity and mortality they can cause.","McEntire, Caleb R.

Detailed information about the lifetime and kinematics of airborne droplets of different size is relevant in order to evaluate hygiene measures like wearing masks but also social distancing and ventilation concepts for indoor environments. However, the evaporation process of expiratory droplets and aerosols is not fully understood. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to present evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets. An acoustic levitator is utilized in conjunction with microscopic imaging for recording the temporal evolution of the evaporation of saliva droplets under well-defined ambient conditions. Following the evaporation of the water content, a saliva droplet reaches a final size, which remains stable in the timescale of hours. By investigating numerous droplets of different size, it was found that the final droplet diameter correlates well to 20 % of the initial diameter. This correlation is independent of the ambient conditions for a temperature range from 20 °C to 29 °C and a relative humidity from 6 % to up to 65 %. The experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics are implemented into a numerical model, which is based on one-dimensional droplet kinematics and a rapid mixing evaporation model. By taking into account the evaporation-falling curve as presented by Wells, the significance of the experimental results for predicting the lifetime of saliva droplets and aerosols is demonstrated. The numerical predictions may be used to determine the impact of the droplet size and the ambient conditions on the transmission risks of infectious diseases like COVID-19.","Lieber, Christian; Melekidis, Stefanos; Koch, Rainer; Bauer, Hans-Jörg",J Aerosol Sci,431,18

In severe COVID-19 infection, many immune cells and their products are involved, making management difficult. The abundant release of cytokines and chemokines in severe COVID-19 patients leads to profound hyper inflammation and the mobilization of immune cells, triggering the cytokine storm. The complications associated with the cytokine storm include severe respiratory distress, intravascular coagulation, multi-organ failure, and death. The enormous formation of interleukin (IL)-6 and hemopoietic factors such as granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are implicated in the severity of the infection. Moreover, these inflammatory cytokines and factors signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway causing the activation of cytokine-related genes. The neutralization of these proteins could be of therapeutic help in COVID-19 patients and could mitigate the risk of mortality. IL-6 antagonist, IL-6 receptor antagonists, GM-CSF receptor inhibitors, and JAK-STAT inhibitors are being investigated to prevent intense lung injury in COVID-19 patients and increase the chances of survival. The review focuses the role of IL-6, GM-CSF, and JAK-STAT inhibitors in regulating the immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients.","Banji, David; Alqahtani, Saad S.; Banji, Otilia J.F.; Machanchery, Shamna; Shoaib, Ambreen",Saudi Pharm J,431,24

Among the six currently known major CRISPR-Cas types, the type VI CRISPR-Cas13 is the only one known to exclusively bind and cleave foreign RNA. Within the last couple of years, this system has been adapted to serve numerous, and sometimes not obvious, applications, including some that might be developed as effective molecular therapies. Indeed, Cas13 has been adapted to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In a cell-free environment, Cas13 has been used in the development of highly specific, sensitive, multiplexing-capable, and field-adaptable detection tools. Importantly, Cas13 can be reprogrammed and applied to eukaryotes to either combat pathogenic RNA viruses or in the regulation of gene expression, facilitating the knockdown of mRNA, circular RNA, and noncoding RNA. Furthermore, Cas13 has been harnessed for in vivo RNA modifications including programmable regulation of alternative splicing, A-to-I and C to U editing, and m6A modifications. Finally, approaches allowing for the detection and characterization of RNA-interacting proteins have also been demonstrated. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the applications utilizing CRISPR-Cas13 that illustrate its versatility. We also discuss the most important limitations of the CRISPR-Cas13-based technologies, and controversies regarding them.

Working in the state of a pandemic is a huge mental load for the medical environment. Aim. Evaluation of emotional control among nurses against work conditions and the support received during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Material and methods. The research was performed among nurses (n = 577) working during the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in infectious (n = 201) and non-infectious (n = 376) wards in 11 Polish hospitals. To evaluate work conditions, the questionnaire prepared by the authors and the Emotional Control Scale (Courtauld Emotional Control Scale—CECS), which rates the control of anger, depression, and fear were used. Results. In the entire research group, fear had the highest rate of suppression among the negative emotions—18.25 points, 17.91 points in infectious wards and 18.44 points among nurses working in non-infectious wards; p > 0.05. The nurses fear was significantly repressed when there was no possibility of the nurses having to perform a COVID-19 test in the workplace; p < 0.05. A larger emotional supressed occurred in nurses who simultaneously declared the perception of increased stress level; p < 0.05. Conclusions. A high level of emotion suppression, especially regarding fear, combined with higher stress levels, occurring irrespective of the ward, points at the need for mental support for the researched nurses.","Malinowska-Lipień, Iwona; Wadas, Tadeusz; Sułkowska, Joanna; Suder, Magdalena; Gabryś, Teresa; Kózka, Maria; Gniadek, Agnieszka; Brzostek, Tomasz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,431,12

Comorbidities render them vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Although preventative and mitigation strategies are recommended, the effect of these are unknown. A period of “potential-high-infectivity” results if a health-care-worker (HCWs) or a patient becomes infected. Aim: We describe and analyze early, universal SARS-CoV-2 real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, biomarker monitoring and SARS-CoV-2 preventative strategies, in a single dialysis center, after a positive patient was identified. Methodology: The setting was a single outpatient dialysis center in Johannesburg, South Africa which had already implemented preventative strategies. We describe the management of 57 patients and 11 HCWs, after one of the patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All individuals were subjected to RT-PCR tests and biomarkers (Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio, C-reactive protein, and D-Dimer) within 72 h (initial-tests). Individuals with initial negative RT-PCR and abnormal biomarkers (one or more) were subjected to repeat RT-PCR and biomarkers (retest subgroup) during the second week. Additional stringent measures (awareness of viral transmission, dialysis distancing and screening) were implemented during the period of “potential high infectivity.” The patient retest subgroup also underwent clustered dialysis until retest results became available. Results: A second positive-patient was identified as a result of early universal RT-PCR tests. In the two positive-patients, biomarker improvement coincided with RT-PCR negative tests. We identified 13 individuals for retesting. None of these retested individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and there was no deterioration in median biomarker values between initial and retests. Collectively, none of the negative individuals developed COVID-19 symptoms during the period “potential high infectivity.” Conclusion: A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may necessitate additional proactive steps to counteract spread of infection. This includes early universal RT-PCR testing and creating further awareness of the risk of transmission and modifying preventative strategies. Abnormal biomarkers may be poorly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ESRF patients due to underlying illnesses. Observing dynamic changes in biomarkers in RT-PCR positive and negative-patients may provide insights into general state of health.","Pillai, Jayandiran; Motloba, Pagollang; Motaung, Keolebogile Shirley Caroline; Wallis, Carole; Ozougwu, Lovelyn Uzoma; Basu, Debashis",Front Pharmacol,431,16

During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether greenness was related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the US. METHODS: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April–May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with higher population density. DISCUSSION: Exposures to NDVI were associated with reduced county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US as well as reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates in densely populated counties.","Klompmaker, Jochem O.; Hart, Jaime E.; Holland, Isabel; Sabath, M.Benjamin; Wu, Xiao; Laden, Francine; Dominici, Francesca; James, Peter",Environ Res,431,20

However, oral and maxillofacial surgery commonly involves in patients with difficult airways that require fiberoptic intubation (FOI), which is not well suited for current hood designs. In this manuscript, we describe a negative-pressure intubation hood (NPIH) designed for fiberoptic intubation, which contains aerosols of the patient and better protects healthcare workers who are present at the time of intubation and extubation on oral and maxillofacial surgery cases.","Emery, Andrew Robert; Saniukovich, Olga; Lang, Angela Lu; Tannyhill, R.

Immune responses and protection efficacy of the vaccination vector were assessed in both mice and pig models. An indirect ELISA assay suggested that when mice were vaccinated with rSPV-SA, the level of IgG against TGEV was enhanced dramatically. The cytokine assays were employed and the results indicated that both the Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine levels raised after vaccination with rSPV-SA in mice models. Results from the passive immunity protection test of new born piglets demonstrated that the recombinant live-vector vaccine, rSPV-SA, could 100% protect piglets from the SPV infection, and there was no significant clinical symptom in the rSPV-SA treatment group during this experiment. The data suggest that the novel recombinant swinepox virus is a potential vaccine against TGEV infection.","Yuan, Xiaomin; Lin, Huixing; Fan, Hongjie",Vaccine,431,32

We aimed to describe the clinical profile and risk factors for severe disease in children hospitalized with COVID-19 from India. METHODS: In this multicentric retrospective study, we retrieved data related to demographic details, clinical features, including the severity of disease, laboratory investigations and outcome. RESULTS: We included 402 children with a median (IQR) age of 7 (2–11) years. Fever was the most common symptom, present in 38.2% of children. About 44% had underlying comorbidity. The majority were asymptomatic (144, 35.8%) or mildly symptomatic (219, 54.5%). There were 39 (9.7%) moderate-severe cases and 13 (3.2%) deaths. The laboratory abnormalities included lymphopenia 25.4%, thrombocytopenia 22.1%, transaminitis 26.4%, low total serum protein 34.7%, low serum albumin 37.9% and low alkaline phosphatase 40%. Out of those who were tested, raised inflammatory markers were ferritin 58.9% (56/95), c-reactive protein 33.3% (41/123), procalcitonin 53.5% (46/86) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) 76%. The presence of fever, rash, vomiting, underlying comorbidity, increased total leucocyte count, thrombocytopenia, high urea, low total serum protein and raised c-reactive protein was factors associated with moderate to severe disease. CONCLUSION: Fever was the commonest symptom. We identified additional laboratory abnormalities, namely lymphopenia, low total serum protein and albumin and low alkaline phosphatase. The majority of the children were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. We found high urea and low total serum protein as risk factors for moderate to severe disease for the first time.","Jat, Kana Ram; Sankar, Jhuma; Das, Rashmi Ranjan; Ratageri, Vinod H; Choudhary, Bharat; Bhat, Javeed Iqbal; Mishra, Baijayantimala; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Behera, Bijayini; Charoo, Bashir Ahmad; Goyal, Jagdish P; Gupta, Aditya Kumar; Gulla, Krishna Mohan; Gera, Rani; Illalu, Shivanand; Kabra, S K; Khera, Daisy; Kumar, Balbir; Lodha, Rakesh; Mohan, Anant; Mohanty, Pankaj Kumar; Satapathy, Amit Kumar; Singh, Kuldeep; Singh, Amitabh; Sharma, Sumant Vinayak; Tiwari, Pawan; Trikha, Anjan; Wari, Prakash K",J Trop Pediatr,431,33

Therefore, physical assessment knowledge has become a fundamental and essential education program for nursing students. However, most of the current nursing courses are taught via a didactic teaching approach, making it difficult for students to think deeply about relevant issues due to the lack of interaction and context. This may, in turn, have an impact on learning effectiveness and clinical judgment. OBJECTIVE A virtual patient (VP)-based social learning approach is proposed to enhance nursing students' performance and clinical judgment in education programs. DESIGN A quasi-experiment method was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. PARTICIPANTS A total of 40 senior nursing students participated in the study (VP-based social learning approach group = 20, control group = 20). METHODS The study involved a pre- and post-test to examine students' learning achievements, self-efficacy, and communication skills. The experimental group adopted the VP-based learning approach, while the control group adopted the conventional didactic learning approach. ANCOVA was employed to compare the performances of the two groups. RESULTS The experimental results indicate that using a VP for learning can enhance students' learning achievements, self-efficacy, and communication skills. In addition, based on the analysis of the results, students generally believed that learning with a VP makes learning more enjoyable. CONCLUSION The VP-based social learning approach would be an effective strategy to train nursing students who have limited opportunities to experience real clinical situations, in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hwang, Gwo-Jen; Chang, Ching-Yi; Ogata, Hiroaki",Nurse education today,431,24

To further investigate the possible roles of S2 in SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis and pathogenesis of SARS, we characterized the host expression profiles induced upon S2 over-expression in Vero E6 cells by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Possible activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in S2 expressing cells was suggested, as evidenced by the up-regulation of cytochrome c and down-regulation of the Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic members. Inhibition of Bcl-2-related anti-apoptotic pathway was further supported by the diminution of S2-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells over-expressing Bcl-xL.

The under-representation of transmembrane proteins in the Protein Data Bank highlights the need to apply new and advanced bioinformatics methods to shed light on their structure and function. This study focuses on a family of transmembrane proteins containing the Pfam domain PF09335 ('SNARE_ASSOC'/ ‘VTT ‘/’Tvp38’). One prominent member, Tmem41b, has been shown to be involved in early stages of autophagosome formation and is vital in mouse embryonic development as well as being identified as a viral host factor of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We used evolutionary covariance-derived information to construct and validate ab initio models, make domain boundary predictions and infer local structural features. Results: The results from the structural bioinformatics analysis of Tmem41b and its homologues showed that they contain a tandem repeat that is clearly visible in evolutionary covariance data but much less so by sequence analysis. Furthermore, cross-referencing of other prediction data with covariance analysis showed that the internal repeat features two-fold rotational symmetry. Ab initio modelling of Tmem41b and homologues reinforces these structural predictions. Local structural features predicted to be present in Tmem41b were also present in Cl (-)/H (+ )antiporters. Conclusions: The results of this study strongly point to Tmem41b and its homologues being transporters for an as-yet uncharacterised substrate and possibly using H (+) antiporter activity as its mechanism for transport.","Mesdaghi, Shahram; Murphy, David L.; Sánchez Rodríguez, Filomeno; Burgos-Mármol, J.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are essential weapons that a patient with COVID-19 has to combat the disease. When now repurposing a drug, namely an aptamer that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteins for COVID-19 treatment (BC 007), which is, however, a neutralizer of pathogenic autoantibodies in its original indication, the possibility of also binding and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies must be considered. Here, the highly specific virus-neutralizing antibodies have to be distinguished from the ones that also show cross-reactivity to tissues. The last-mentioned could be the origin of the widely reported SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmunity, which should also become a target of therapy. We, therefore, used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology to assess the binding of well-characterized publicly accessible anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (CV07-209 and CV07-270) with BC 007. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetric titration, and circular dichroism spectroscopy were additionally used to test the binding of BC 007 to DNA-binding sequence segments of these antibodies. BC 007 did not bind to the highly specific neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody but did bind to the less specific one. This, however, was a lot less compared to an autoantibody of its original indication (14.2%, range 11.0–21.5%). It was also interesting to see that the less-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody also showed a high background signal in the ELISA (binding on NeutrAvidin-coated or activated but noncoated plastic plate). These initial experiments suggest that the risk of binding and neutralizing highly specific anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies by BC 007 should be low.","Haberland, Annekathrin; Krylova, Oxana; Nikolenko, Heike; Göttel, Peter; Dallmann, Andre; Müller, Johannes; Weisshoff, Hardy",Viruses,431,16

The advantages of using TCM for treatment of liver diseases include: protecting hepatocytes, inhibiting hepatic inflammation and antifibrosis in the liver. In this article, we introduce TCM herbal preparations from the Chinese materia medica (such as Fuzheng Huayu) that are typically used for the treatment of liver diseases. Literature surrounding the mechanisms of TCM therapy for treatment of liver diseases is presented and discussed. We propose that side effects of herbal compounds are often under-appreciated, and that more care should be taken in the prescription of potentially hepatotoxic medicines. Further, to deepen the understanding of TCM mechanisms, new techniques and methodologies must be developed. Future studies will lead to the enhancement of clinical outcomes of TCM. As complementary and alternative therapies, TCMs will play an expanding role in the future of liver disease treatment.","Zhao, Chang-qing; Zhou, Yang; Ping, Jian; Xu, Lie-ming",Journal of Integrative Medicine,431,10

Accurate, rapid and simple detection of CDV is critical to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks. In this study, a visible and incubation instrument-free reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with lateral flow strip (LFS RT-RPA) was developed to detect CDV using primers and lateral flow (LF) probe specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. The CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min, and the products were visible to the naked eyes on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CDV, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the in vitro transcribed CDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 9.4 × 10(1) copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 32 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and CDV RNA positive rate was 62.0% (20/32) by LFS RT-RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time RT-PCR assay. The performance of the LFS RT-RPA was comparable to real-time RT-PCR, while the LFS RT-RPA assay was much faster and easier to perform. The novel CDV LFS RT-RPA assay provides an attractive and promising tool for rapid and reliable detection of CDV in the underequipped laboratory and point-of-need facility, which is of great significance in CD control in low resource settings.","Wang, Jianchang; Wang, Jinfeng; Li, Ruiwen; Shi, Ruihan; Liu, Libing; Yuan, Wanzhe",J Virol Methods,431,24

Instead, we used a bladder syringe to wash the femoral canal. The aim of this study was to assess whether this change in practice had a detrimental effect on the quality of the bone cement mantles in patients undergoing cemented hip hemiarthroplasty. Methodology We performed a retrospective review of all patients treated at a tertiary teaching hospital in the United Kingdom (Addenbrookes, Cambridge University Hospitals) presenting with a neck of femur fracture requiring a hemiarthroplasty between October 2019 and June 2020. We retrospectively assessed 100 post-operative radiographs for patients who had received hip hemiarthroplasty following neck of femur fragility fracture (50 before the service change and 50 after). The Barrack classification was used to assess the quality of the bone cement mantle. Results Pre-SARS-CoV-2, 30% of hemiarthroplasties were deemed as being “at risk” of aseptic loosening. During SARS-CoV-2, 64% of hips were deemed as being “at risk.” This represents a statistically significant absolute increase of 34% (P < 0.05, the P value is 0.000645). Both clinicians agreed on the classification of hips “at risk” or “not at risk” (i.e., grades C/D and A/B, respectively) in 85% of the cases. Cohen’s kappa coefficient was calculated as 0.68, indicating substantial agreement. Conclusions Following our experience of this forced service change, we would discourage abandoning the use of pulsed lavage in future pandemics. We have demonstrated an association between abandoning pulsed lavage and detrimental effects on the procedural quality for hip hemiarthroplasty. Patients treated over this time period will be closely monitored for operative complications. As this was the only equipment change made for this procedure, we have demonstrated its detrimental effect on the procedural quality. Should pulsed lavage be discontinued, patients may need to be counseled for higher risk of early failure and revision surgery and may require long-term radiographic follow-up. In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, Surgeons should carefully consider the risks and benefits of using pulsed lavage in accordance with the personal protective equipment they have available and the consequential impact on the bone cement mantle quality.","Sharma, Dhiraj; Spacey, Kate; Sharma, Vivek; Vince, Alastair",Cureus,431,16

We present an assessment of the validity and cost-effectiveness of virtual and augmented reality simulation, animal, cadaver and synthetic organ models. Face, content, construct, concurrent and predictive validity criteria were applied to each simulation model. There are six major commercial simulation machines available for robot-assisted surgery. The validity of virtual reality (VR) simulation curricula for psychomotor assessment and skill acquisition for the early phase of robotic surgery training has been demonstrated. The widespread adoption of VR simulation has been limited by the high cost of these machines. Live animal and cadavers have been the accepted standard for robotic surgical simulation since it began in the early 2000s. Our review found that there is a lack of evidence in the literature to support the use of animal and cadaver for robotic surgery training. The effectiveness of these models as a training tool is limited by logistical, ethical, financial and infection control issues. The latest evolution in synthetic organ model training for robotic surgery has been driven by new 3D-printing technology. Validated and cost-effective high-fidelity procedural models exist for robotic surgery training in urology. The development of synthetic models for the other specialties is not as mature. Expansion into multiple surgical disciplines and the widespread adoption of synthetic organ models for robotic simulation training will require the ability to engineer scalability for mass production. This would enable a transition in robotic surgical education where digital and synthetic organ models could be used in place of live animals and cadaver training to achieve robotic surgery competency.","Costello, Daniel M.; Huntington, Isabel; Burke, Grace; Farrugia, Brooke; O’Connor, Andrea J.; Costello, Anthony J.; Thomas, Benjamin C.; Dundee, Philip; Ghazi, Ahmed; Corcoran, Niall",J Robot Surg,431,16

High age, several comorbidities as well as poor physical fitness can negatively influence the outcome within COVID-19 infection. We investigated whether the ratio of fat to muscle area, measured in initial LDCT, can predict severe progression of COVID-19 in the follow-up period. METHOD: We analyzed 58 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection that underwent an initial LDCT in one of two included centers due to COVID-19 infection. Using the ratio of waist circumference per paravertebral muscle circumference (FMR), the body composition was estimated. Patient outcomes were rated on an ordinal scale with higher numbers representing more severe progression or disease associated complications (hospitalization/ intensive care unit (ICU)/ tracheal intubation/ death) within a follow-up period of 22 days after initial LDCT. RESULTS: In the initial LDCT a significantly higher FMR was found in patients requiring intensive care treatment within the follow-up period. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, FMR (p < .001) in addition to age (p < .01), was found to be a significant predictor of the necessity for ICU treatment of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: FMR as potential surrogate of body composition and obesity can be easily determined in initial LDCT of COVID-19 patients. Within the multivariate analysis, in addition to patient age, low muscle area in proportion to high fat area represents an additional prognostic information for the patient outcome and the need of an ICU treatment during the follow-up period within the next 22 days. This multicentric pilot study presents a method using an initial LDCT to screen opportunistically for obese patients who have an increased risk for the need of ICU treatment. While clinical capacities, such as ICU beds and ventilators, are more crucial than ever to help manage the current global corona pandemic, this work introduces an approach that can be used for a cost-effective way to help determine the amount of these rare clinical resources required in the near future.","Kottlors, Jonathan; Zopfs, David; Fervers, Philipp; Bremm, Johannes; Abdullayev, Nuran; Maintz, David; Tritt, Stephanie; Persigehl, Thorsten",Eur J Radiol,431,16

Ensuring equitable care and distribution of health resources for patients with and without COVID-19 is a recurring ethical challenge for clinicians. Palliative care aims to mitigate suffering caused by a life-limiting illness, and this crisis has led to the awareness and urgency to ensure it reaches all who needs it. We share here the palliative care perspectives and ethical challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia.","Chong, Lee Ai; Khoo, Erwin J.; Kamar, Azanna Ahmad; Tan, Hui Siu",Asian Bioeth Rev,431,2

Despite this fact, clinical trials using MMP-9 inhibitors have been disappointing. This review focuses on the roles of MMP-9 in MI wound healing. Infiltrating leukocytes, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells secrete MMP-9 during all phases of cardiac repair. MMP-9 both exacerbates the inflammatory response and aids in inflammation resolution by stimulating the pro-inflammatory to reparative cell transition. In addition, MMP-9 has a dual effect on neovascularization and prevents an overly stiff scar. Here, we review the complex role of MMP-9 in cardiac wound healing, and highlight the importance of targeting MMP-9 only for its detrimental actions. Therefore, delineating signaling pathways downstream of MMP-9 is critical.","Becirovic-Agic, Mediha; Chalise, Upendra; Daseke, Michael J.; Konfrst, Shelby; Salomon, Jeffrey D.; Mishra, Paras K.; Lindsey, Merry L.",Biomolecules,431,16

Little is known about such ancient epidemics and a deep evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats is lacking. The study of past epidemics has typically been limited in temporal scope to recorded history, and in physical scope to pathogens that left sufficient DNA behind, such as Yersinia pestis during the Great Plague. Host genomes, however, offer an indirect way to detect ancient epidemics beyond the current temporal and physical limits. Arms races with pathogens have shaped the genomes of the hosts by driving a large number of adaptations at many genes, and these signals can be used to detect and further characterize ancient epidemics. Here, we detect the genomic footprints left by ancient viral epidemics that took place in the past approximately 50 000 years in the 26 human populations represented in the 1000 Genomes Project. By using the enrichment in signals of adaptation at approximately 4500 host loci that interact with specific types of viruses, we provide evidence that RNA viruses have driven a particularly large number of adaptive events across diverse human populations. These results suggest that different types of viruses may have exerted different selective pressures during human evolution. Knowledge of these past selective pressures will provide a deeper evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats.

Coupled with the emerging biological and pathological significance of carbohydrates, lectins have become extensively used as research tools in glycobiology. However, lectin-based drug development has been impeded by high manufacturing costs, low chemical stability, and the potential risk of initiating an unfavorable immune response. As alternatives to lectins, non-protein small molecules having carbohydrate-binding properties (lectin mimics) are currently attracting a great deal of attention because of their ease of preparation and chemical modification. Lectin mimics of synthetic origin are divided roughly into two groups, boronic acid-dependent and boronic acid-independent lectin mimics. This article outlines their representative architectures and carbohydrate-binding properties, and discusses their therapeutic potential by reviewing recent attempts to develop antiviral and antimicrobial agents using their architectures. We also focus on the naturally occurring lectin mimics, pradimicins and benanomicins. They are the only class of non-protein natural products having a C-type lectin-like ability to recognize d-mannopyranosides in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Their molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition and therapeutic potential are also discussed.","Nakagawa, Yu; Yukishige, Ito",Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry,431,1

RECENT FINDINGS: Although the currently available anti-HTN agents have broad applicability in treating HTN, additional agents, such as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists, have recently gained clinical significance. In addition, there have been some anecdotal concerns regarding the adverse effects, indications, and risks of COVID-19 infection/mortality when using certain anti-HTN agents. SUMMARY: Current guidelines currently address the treatment of primary HTN. However, isolated HTN is uncommon and often involves comorbid diseases that require specific regimentation.

A largely unexplored strategy to reduce mRNA hydrolysis is to redesign RNAs to form double-stranded regions, which are protected from in-line cleavage and enzymatic degradation, while coding for the same proteins. The amount of stabilization that this strategy can deliver and the most effective algorithmic approach to achieve stabilization remain poorly understood. Motivated by the need for stabilized COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, we present simple calculations for estimating RNA stability against hydrolysis, and a model that links the average unpaired probability of an mRNA, or AUP, to its overall rate of hydrolysis. To characterize the stabilization achievable through structure design, we compare optimization of AUP by conventional mRNA design methods to results from the LinearDesign algorithm, a new Monte Carlo tree search algorithm called RiboTree, and crowdsourcing through the OpenVaccine challenge on the Eterna platform. Tests were carried out on mRNAs encoding nanoluciferase, green fluorescent protein, and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates encoding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, spike receptor binding domain, and full-length spike protein. We find that Eterna and RiboTree significantly lower AUP while maintaining a large diversity of sequence and structure features that correlate with translation, biophysical size, and immunogenicity. Our results suggest that increases in in vitro mRNA half-life by at least two-fold are immediately achievable and that further stability improvements may be enabled with thorough experimental characterization of RNA hydrolysis.","Wayment-Steele, Hannah K.; Kim, Do Soon; Choe, Christian A.; Nicol, John J.; Wellington-Oguri, Roger; Sperberg, R.

These structures are highly dependent on cholesterol. Hence, this study investigates the impact of HEV on cholesterol-metabolism, the effect of intracellular cholesterol content on HEV-release and the potential of cholesterol-modulators to serve as antivirals. METHODS: Intracellular cholesterol-content of cells was modulated and impacts on HEV were monitored using qPCR, Western blot, microscopy, virus-titration and density-gradient centrifugation. Blood-lipids and HEV-RNA were routinely quantified in chronically infected patients during follow-up visits. RESULTS: In HEV-infected cells, decreased levels of cholesterol are found. In patients, HEV infection decreases serum-lipid concentrations. Importantly, statin treatment herein increases viral titers. Similarly, reduction of intracellular cholesterol via simvastatin treatment increases viral release in vitro. On the contrary, elevating intracellular cholesterol via LDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol strongly reduces viral release due to enhanced lysosomal degradation of HEV. Drug-induced elevation of intracellular cholesterol via fenofibrate or PSC833 impairs HEV release via the same mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This study analyses the crosstalk between HEV and intracellular cholesterol. The results highlight the importance of an intact cholesterol homeostasis for HEV-release and thereby identify a potential target for antiviral strategies. Especially fenofibrate is considered a promising novel antiviral against HEV. Beyond this, the study may help clinicians evaluating co-treatments of HEV-infected patients with statins, as this may be counter indicated.","Glitscher, Mirco; Martín, David Heiler; Woytinek, Kathrin; Schmidt, Benjamin; Tabari, Denna; Scholl, Catharina; Stingl, Julia C.; Seelow, Evelyn; Choi, Mira; Hildt, Eberhard",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,431,8

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of DDIs and PIMs in COVID-19 patients at hospital discharge. METHOD: Patients with a proven diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were hospitalized between 21 February and 30 April 2020, treated with at least two drugs, and with available information regarding pharmacological treatments upon admission and at discharge were considered. The appropriateness of drug prescriptions was assessed using INTERcheck(®). RESULTS: A significant increase in the prescription of proton pump inhibitors and heparins was found when comparing admission with hospital discharge (from 24 to 33% [p < 0.05] and from 1 to 17% [p < 0.01], respectively). The increased prescription of heparins at discharge resulted in a highly significant increase in the potentially severe DDIs mediated by this class of drugs. 51% of COVID-19 patients aged > 65 years had at least one PIM upon admission, with an insignificant increment at discharge (58%). CONCLUSION: An increased number of prescribed drugs was observed in COVID-19 patients discharged from our hospital. The addition of heparins is appropriate according to the current literature, while the use of proton pump inhibitors is more controversial.

Method A total of 110 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive patients (subjects) in which noncontrast chest DECT was done in our COVID-19 care center (CCC) were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of various abnormalities of lung parenchyma due to SARS-COV-2 and their distribution with extent was recorded. Various types of lung parenchyma abnormalities due to COVID-19 were evaluated in all patients. Data were analyzed and various prevalent abnormalities were calculated as a percentage for each type. All the cases were also sorted into four major groups on the basis of the Radiological Society of North America CT classification of COVID patients. Result Among the total 110 patients that were enrolled in this study, 80 (72.7%) were males and 30 (27.3%) were females with a mean age of 40.5 ± 7 years (range 24-84). Out of this, we observed that 59 (53.6%) cases had abnormalities of lung parenchyma and were designated as DECT positive, whereas 51 (46.3%) cases had completely normal DECT. Only 14 (12.7%) of the patients (cases) presented with dyspnoea, 10 (9%) had hyperpnoea, whereas 12 (10.8%) had other associated comorbidities. Among the patients having abnormal DECT findings, multilobar (86%), bilateral lung field involvement (72.8%) with the ascendancy of peripheral and posterior distribution was most commonly noted. With respect to the different types of opacities noted in various patients, we found that ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the common abnormality found in almost all cases for the greatest part. Pure GGO was reported in 16 (28%), GGO admixed with a crazy-paving pattern were elicited in 17 (28.8%) and GGO mixed with consolidation was noted in 25 (42.3%) cases. Thirty-eight (64.4%) cases were having peri-lesional or intra-lesional segments or involving a small segment enlargement of the pulmonary vessel. Among the cases showing DECT positivity, the typical pattern on the basis of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) classification was noted in 71.2% of cases, whereas the atypical pattern was found in 1.2% percent of cases and the intermediate type was depicted in 25.4% percent of cases. Forty-six point three percent (46.3%) of the total cases that were enrolled in the study were grouped as the no pneumonia category. Conclusion The result of this study proved that the maximum number of RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients had mild symptoms and few comorbidities with normal chest DECT and fell under the no pneumonia category of the RSNA CT classification of COVID patients. However, out of the remaining patients, the majority of patients had GGO on DECT as a typical finding mixed with other patterns in a bilateral distribution and peripheral predominance.

In the months following the introduction of vaccines, their availability and the human resources needed to run the vaccination programmes have been scarce in many countries. Vaccine hesitancy is also being encountered from some sections of the general public.

Contrary to personality traits, implicit motives are often deemed to be rather stable personality characteristics. Normally, implicit motives are obtained by Operant Motives, unconscious intrinsic desires measured by the Operant Motive Test (OMT). The OMT test requires participants to write freely descriptions associated with a set of provided images and questions. In this work, we explore different recent machine learning techniques and various text representation techniques for facing the problem of the OMT classification task. We focused on advanced language representations (e.g, BERT, XLM, and DistilBERT) and deep Supervised Autoencoders for solving the OMT task. We performed an exhaustive analysis and compared their performance against fully connected neural networks and traditional support vector classifiers. Our comparative study highlights the importance of BERT which outperforms the traditional machine learning techniques by a relative improvement of 7.9%. In addition, we performed an analysis of how the BERT attention mechanism is being modified. Our findings indicate that the writing style features acquire higher importance at the moment of accurately identifying the different OMT categories. This is the first time that a study to determine the performance of different transformer-based architectures in the OMT task is performed. Similarly, our work propose, for the first time, using deep supervised autoencoders in the OMT classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer-based methods exhibit the best empirical results, obtaining a relative improvement of 7.9% over the competitive baseline suggested as part of the GermEval 2020 challenge. Additionally, we show that features associated with the writing style are more important than content-based words.

This study presents a facile method of fabricating masks through electrospinning nontoxic polyvinyl butyral (PVB) polymeric matrix with the antibacterial component Thymol, a natural phenol monoterpene. Based on the results of Japanese Industrial Standards and American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists methods, the maximum antibacterial value of the mask against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was 5.6 and 6.4, respectively. Moreover, vertical electrospinning was performed to prepare Thymol/PVB nanofiber masks, and the effects of parameters on the submicron particulate filtration efficiency (PFE), differential pressure, and bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) were determined. Thorough optimization of the small-diameter nanofiber–based antibacterial mask led to denser accumulation and improved PFE and pressure difference; the mask was thus noted to meet the present pandemic requirements. The as-developed nanofibrous masks have the antibacterial activity suggested by the National Standard of the Republic of China (CNS 14774) for general medical masks.

Eight high-temperature indices, including three single measurements (average, maximum and minimum temperature) and five composite indices (heat index, humidex, temperature humidity index, apparent temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature), and their standardized Z scores, were used in distributed lag non-linear models. Cumulative 8-day (lag zero to seven days) relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated, 1 and 2 standardized deviations above the medium (i.e., at 84.1th and 97.7th percentile, respectively), by comparing with Z scores for the lowest risks of mortality and outpatient visits as references. Analyses were performed for Taipei in north, Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan. Results showed that standardized Z-values of high-temperature indices associated with the lowest health risk were approximately 0 in Taipei and Central Taiwan, and − 1 in Southern Taiwan. As the apparent temperature was at Z = 2, the cumulative 8-day mortality risk increased significantly, by 23% in Taipei and 28% in Southern Taiwan, but not in Central Taiwan. The maximum temperature displayed consistently a high correlation with all-cause outpatient visits at Z = 1; with the cumulative 8-day RRs for outpatient visits increased by 7%, 3%, and 4% in the three corresponding areas. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated methods to compare multiple high-temperature indices associated with all-cause mortality and outpatient visits for population residing in a subtropical island. Apparent temperature is an optimal indicator for predicting all-cause mortality risk, and maximum temperature is recommended to associate with outpatient visits. The impact of heat varied with study areas, evaluated health outcomes, and high-temperature indices. The increased extreme heat is associated with stronger risk for all-cause mortality than for outpatient visits.","Lin, Yu-Kai; Chang, Chin-Kuo; Li, Ming-Hsu; Wu, Yu-Chung; Wang, Yu-Chun",Sci Total Environ,431,3

We conducted this study to compare the outcomes of influenza patients treated with veno‐venous‐ECMO (VV‐ECMO) to COVID‐19 patients treated with VV‐ECMO, during the first wave of COVID‐19. METHODS: Patients in our institution with ARDS due to COVID‐19 or influenza who were placed on ECMO between August 1, 2010 and September 15, 2020 were included in this comparative, retrospective study. To improve homogeneity, only VV‐ECMO patients were analyzed. The clinical characteristics and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 28 COVID‐19 patients and 17 influenza patients were identified and included. ECMO survival rates were 68% (19/28) in COVID‐19 patients and 94% (16/17) in influenza patients (p = .04). Thirty days survival rates after ECMO decannulation were 54% (15/28) in COVID‐19 patients and 76% (13/17) in influenza patients (p = .13).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of social distancing measures in unique regions. DESIGN: An agent-based simulation model. SETTING: Agent-based model applied to Dane County, Wisconsin; the Milwaukee metropolitan (metro) area; and New York City (NYC). PATIENTS: Synthetic population at different ages. INTERVENTION: Different times for implementing and easing social distancing measures at different levels of adherence. MEASUREMENTS: The model represented the social network and interactions among persons in a region, considering population demographic characteristics, limited testing availability, “imported” infections, asymptomatic disease transmission, and age-specific adherence to social distancing measures. The primary outcome was the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: The timing of and adherence to social distancing had a major effect on COVID-19 occurrence. In NYC, implementing social distancing measures 1 week earlier would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from 203 261 to 41 366 as of 31 May 2020, whereas a 1-week delay could have increased the number of confirmed cases to 1 407 600. A delay in implementation had a differential effect on the number of cases in the Milwaukee metro area versus Dane County, indicating that the effect of social distancing measures varies even within the same state. LIMITATION: The effect of weather conditions on transmission dynamics was not considered. CONCLUSION: The timing of implementing and easing social distancing measures has major effects on the number of COVID-19 cases.

Additionally, correlation analysis was performed between students’ self- and examiners’ assessment of the treatment results. Methods: Within 4 hours, 22 examinees each had to place a multi-surface adhesive anterior and posterior restoration, performed an endodontic treatment on a maxillary premolar and a periodontal debridement of one quadrant. All treatments were performed on a model fixed in a phantom head. Compliance with the prescribed hygiene and social distancing guidelines and self-assessment of the practical performance was part of the practical examination as well. One examiner per examination part evaluated anonymously the final results. The historical control was based on the exam results of a cohort from 2019. Mean values (standard deviation), non-parametric correlations (Spearman's Rho) and group comparisons (Mann-Whitney) were calculated for statistical analysis. Results: Examination results under simulated treatment conditions were significantly worse (p<0.05) than in the cohort that took their state exam in patients, with exception of the endodontic partial exam. The overall scores in restorative dentistry and periodontology of both groups, which include a structured theoretical examination, did not differ. The majority of the candidates rated their performance worse than the examiners, and there was no correlation between self- and third-party assessment. Conclusion: In the comparison of two years, a simulated practical examination without patients in restorative dentistry, endodontics and periodontology resulted in matchable results compared with an examination on patients. Equal conditions for the candidates resulting in better comparability and avoidance of ethical dilemmas of patient treatment under examination conditions could also be arguments towards a state examination under phantom conditions in the future.","Wicht, Michael J.; Höfer, Karolin; Derman, Sonja H.

To fight this pandemic, almost all governments and health authorities have focused on prevention. In March or April, most countries’ officials imposed home quarantine and lockdown measures nationwide. PURPOSE: This study sought to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety levels among people in Portugal under mandatory home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were compared to the general Portuguese population’s HRQoL before the COVID-19 outbreak. This research also aimed to understand the factors that can influence the respondents’ HRQoL. METHODS: A sample of Portugal’s population quarantined at home (n = 904) filled in an online survey comprising the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item and the EQ-5D-5L and other questions about sociodemographic characteristics, feelings, duties and activities during the quarantine. The sample was weighted to mirror the general population’s gender, age and education. Descriptive analyses and correlation coefficients were used to evaluation the respondents’ anxiety and HRQoL. Generalised linear models were estimated to identify determinants of HRQoL during the COVID-19 quarantine. RESULTS: The results show that individuals quarantined at home reported higher anxiety and lower HRQoL levels and that people with more anxiety tended to have a lower HRQoL. Females and elderly individuals experienced the highest levels of anxiety and poorest HRQoL. In addition, HRQoL during the quarantine can be explained by various occupational and attitudinal variables, as well as sociodemographic variables. CONCLUSION: Individuals’ mental health should be taken into consideration during pandemics or other emergency situations. Anxiety and other factors can decrease people’s HRQoL, in conjunction with the pandemic’s social and economic consequences.","Ferreira, Lara N.; Pereira, Luís N.; da Fé Brás, Maria; Ilchuk, Kateryna",Qual Life Res,431,1

This novel coronavirus disease phenotype ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant cytokine storm with respiratory failure, polyorgan dysfunction, and death. Severe disease is characterized by exuberant inflammation resulting from high circulating cytokines such as interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These inflammatory mediators are responsible for the detrimental effects on the immune, hematologic, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal and other body systems. In addition to inhibition of viral replication, blunting this inflammatory response before overt cytokine storm is important to improve outcomes. Although there are upcoming promising agents such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, inexpensive, safe, and widely available adjunct treatments to ameliorate disease burden would be welcome. Two potential antiinflammatory agents include indomethacin, which has been shown in experimental models to decrease canine coronavirus (CCoV) levels in dogs and exhibit antiviral activity against several other viruses, and the polyphenol, resveratrol, a potent antioxidant that has shown antiviral activity against several viruses.","Marinella, Mark A.",Int J Clin Pract,431,24

Hospitals are making changes to their regular operations to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while ensuring the treatment of emergency patients. These substantial changes affect the typical work setting of clinicians and require the implementation of organizational arrangements. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to increase our understanding of how digital transformation drives virtual collaboration among clinicians in hospitals in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We present the lessons learned from an exploratory case study in which we observed the introduction of an information technology (IT) system for enhancing collaboration among clinicians in a German hospital. The results are based on 16 semistructured interviews with physicians from various departments and disciplines; the interviews were generalized to better understand and interpret the meaning of the statements. RESULTS: Three key lessons and recommendations explain how digital transformation ensures goal-driven collaboration among clinicians. First, we found that implementing a disruptive change requires alignment of the mindsets of the stakeholders. Second, IT-enabled collaboration presupposes behavioral rules that must be followed. Third, transforming antiquated processes demands a suitable technological infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: Digital transformation is being driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rapid introduction of IT-enabled collaboration reveals grievances concerning the digital dissemination of medical information along the patient treatment path. To avoid being caught unprepared by future crises, digital transformation must be further driven to ensure collaboration, and the diagnostic and therapeutic process must be opened to disruptive strategies.","Frick, Nicholas R J; Möllmann, Henriette L; Mirbabaie, Milad; Stieglitz, Stefan",JMIR Med Inform,431,28

The numerous uncertainties, unpredictable direction of the pandemic, and psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, humanitarian, and development consequences of the pandemic have led to the most dangerous threat to health, social welfare, global economy, and well-being in recent history. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has called pandemic “the most challenging crisis since World War II” that can negatively affect all efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) over the years. The pandemic has already returned the economy of a number of industrialized nations back to 20 years ago. In the context of COVID-19 outbreak and the lack of vaccines and definitive treatment, different countries have been adopting various spectrum of policies to control the disease and mitigate the risks. Consequently, countries have been facing various challenges including economic recession; insufficient supply of necessary products such as disinfectants, personal protective equipment, and other medical products; and increasing unemployment, which can lead to mental health problems such as stress and anxiety, many of which are beyond global health and well-being. Nevertheless, the precise impact of this ongoing global catastrophe can only be accurately assessed when the epidemic ends or even some years after the vaccine becomes equally accessible. In this context, it is crucial to turn the outbreak to a learning curve, aiming to prevent greater losses during similar future pandemics. In this chapter we aim to discuss challenges and opportunities caused by the novel coronavirus for global health, its intended and unintended consequences to achieve SDGs as well as the policy lessons learned from this outbreak.","Takian, Amirhossein; Haghighi, Hajar; Raoofi, Azam",Environmental and Health Management of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 ),431,6

In early 2020 the Save the Children Emergency Health Unit deployed to Cox’s Bazar Bangladesh to support the establishment of a severe acute respiratory infection isolation and treatment centre as part of the COVID-19 response. We developed a charter of patient rights and had it translated into Bangla and Burmese; however, the charter remained inaccessible to Rohingya and members of the host community with low literacy. METHODS: To both visualise and contextualise the patient charter we undertook a graphic elicitation method involving both the Rohingya and host communities. We carried out two focus group discussions during which we discussed the charter and agreed how best to illustrate the individual rights contained therein. RESULTS: Logistical constraints and infection prevention and control procedures limited our ability to follow up with the original focus group participants and to engage in back-translation as we had planned; however, we were able to elicit rich descriptions of each right. Reflecting on our method we were able to identify several key learnings relating to: 1) our technique for eliciting feedback on the charter verbatim versus a broader discussion of concepts referenced within each right, 2) our decision to include both men and women in the same focus group, 3) our decision to ask focus group participants to describe specific features of each illustration and how this benefited the inclusivity of our illustrations, and 4) the potential of the focus groups to act as a means to introduce the charter to communities. CONCLUSIONS: Though executing our method was operationally challenging we were able to create culturally appropriate illustrations to accompany our patient charter. In contexts of limited literacy it is possible to enable access to critical clinical governance and accountability tools.","McGowan, Catherine R.; Hellman, Nora; Baxter, Louisa; Chakma, Sonali; Nahar, Samchun; Daula, Ahasan Ud; Rowe, Kelly; Gilday, Josie; Kingori, Patricia; Pounds, Rachel; Cummings, Rachael",Confl Health,431,18

Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020. RESULTS: Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2130 samples (3.9 %) and constituted 8.1 % of all virus detections. OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4 % of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0 %), HKU1 (17.6 %), and 229E (15.3 %). The overall fraction of positive samples was similar between seasons, but at species level there were distinct biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. OC43 and 229E incidence was relatively constant across age strata, while that of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction. Symptomatic reinfections in adults and the elderly appear relatively common. Both findings may be of relevance for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Dyrdak, Robert; Hodcroft, Emma B.; Wahlund, Martina; Neher, Richard A.; Albert, Jan",J Clin Virol,431,4

In response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the state mandated “Stay At Home” order included closure of schools and public places and physical distancing measures. As a result, social interactions among children were significantly impaired and pediatric outpatient offices and vaccination rates declined. We sought to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health as well as access to health care in our pediatric population in Wayne County, Michigan. Design/Methods. We conducted a survey through the Wayne County Public School Districts to elicit information regarding subjects’ access to pediatric health care as well as experiences pertinent to their child(ren)’s mental health. Results. Approximately 8500 surveys were sent to families and 278 responses were received. Responses revealed that 46% of children spent more time alone during the pandemic, 36.9% had changes in sleep, 25.6% had little pleasure in doing things, and 32.5% were unhappy or sad. 66.2% were able to make new visits during the pandemic, however, 20.1% missed their child’s doctors’ visits for reasons including clinic cancellations and fear of entering a healthcare setting. Conclusions. The results of this survey demonstrate significant mental health concerns among our pediatric population as approximately 1/3 of families reported changes in behavior or mental health. As school closures persist in response to the ongoing pandemic and social interactions remain limited, it is imperative that pediatricians screen for depression, behavioral problems and other mental health concerns and offer families help to identify appropriate community mental health resources.","Raheja, Raksha; Pitman-Hunt, Chaya; Haidar, Sara; Gjorgjevska, Slavica; Leja, Jacqueline",Glob Pediatr Health,431,15

We here report a series of heart transplanted patients with COVID-19 from two centers of Italy. METHODS All heart transplanted patients of Transplant Centers of Bergamo and Torino with a microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Data collection included clinical presentation, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment and outcome. Follow-up was performed by visit or phone. RESULTS From February to March 2020 twenty-six heart transplanted patients (age 62±12 years; 77% males; time from transplant 10±10 years; 69% with comorbidities) had a microbiologically confirmed COVID-19. The most frequent symptom was fever, followed by cough. Seventeen patients had a pneumonia, 8 of them severe pneumonia. Seven patients died (27%) and 17 (65%) were hospitalized. Discontinuation of immunosuppression was associated with death (71 vs 21%, p=0.02). Conversely, all patients receiving steroids survived (p<0.001). Patients who received heart transplantation during COVID-19 outbreak survived and no acute graft rejection occurred. Patients who died were older than survivors, had a longer time from transplant and a worse clinical presentation at diagnosis. The current regimen enabled the prolonged survival and function of orthotopic cardiac xenografts in altogether 6 of 8 baboons, of which 4 were now added. These results exceed the threshold set by the Advisory Board of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has a significant impact on long term heart transplanted patients. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a limited influence on more recent transplants.

Methods: All data were collated by the Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Ireland (CFRI). Comparisons were made between PWCF's access to regular hospital facilities utilised for the treatment and management of their condition prior to the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019, and preliminary data during the pandemic in 2020. A descriptive analysis of the differences between key outcome measure data was conducted. The outcome measures analysed were (i) the number and type of encounters, (ii) the number of virtual clinics, (iii) the number of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) carried out, (iv) the number of hospital admissions, and (v) the number of individuals receiving home intravenous antibiotic treatment. Results: In 2019, encounter data were recorded for 1,254 individuals, compared to 1,143 in 2020. Overall, fewer encounters took place in 2020 (5,346) than in 2019 (7,947). Decreases were observed across all in-person hospital encounter types in 2020, when compared with 2019 (annual review: 273 vs 747;day-unit review: 1,792 vs 2,864;drop-in: 115 vs 277;OPD appointment: 1,064 vs 3,289). However, since the outbreak of the pandemic, 1,696 virtual encounters occurred. Significantly, the number of PFTs carried out decreased by 58% in 2020 (2,283), when compared with 2019 (5,458). Of the 1,696 virtual encounters, only 183 (10.8%) saw PFTs carried out. Conclusion: Our analysis has shown a clear reduction in the utilisation of usually regular hospital resources by PWCF in 2020 when compared with 2019. In-person hospital encounters have decreased by 55% in total, highlighting the significant impact that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had on PWCF.","Rees, H.; Babu, S.; Fletcher, G.; Kirwan, L.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,431,6

Major announcements by the World Health Organization (WHO) were taken into consideration with peaks in online searches. Correlations were made using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results Overall, the online searches for COVID-19 were not correlated with the actual incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The mean Spearman correlation for incidence was 0.20 (range -0.66 to 0.76) and for mortality was 0.35 (range -0.75 to 0.85). Online searches in Europe were all strongly synchronized with each other; a mean Spearman correlation of 0.93 (range 0.62 to 0.99). Conclusions Online searches for COVID-19 in Europe are not correlated with epidemiology but strongly correlated with international WHO announcements. Our study challenges previous Google Trends studies and emphasizes the role of the WHO in raising awareness of a new disease.","Szmuda, Tomasz; Ali, Shan; Hetzger, Tarjei Vevang; Rosvall, Philip; Słoniewski, Paweł",Int J Infect Dis,431,16

This article considers the case where the transmission rate of the disease as well as the eciency of treatments is subject to uncertainty. We consider two dierent regimes, or submodels, of the stochastic SIR model, where the population consists of three groups: susceptible, infected and recovered and dead. In the first regime the proportion of infected is very low, and the proportion of susceptible is very close to 100 with few deaths and where recovered individuals do not acquire immunity. In a second regime, the proportion of infected is moderate, but not negligible. We show that the first regime corresponds almost exactly to a well-known problem in finance, the problem of portfolio and consumption decisions under mean-reverting returns (Wachter, JFQA 2002), for which the optimal control has an analytical solution. We develop a perturbative solution for the second problem. To our knowledge, this paper represents one of the first attempts to develop analytical/perturbative solutions, as opposed to numerical solutions to stochastic SIR models.","Gatto, Nicole M.; Schellhorn, Henry",Math Biosci,431,1

METHODS: Semi-structured telephone or video interviews with 20 adults aged over 70. Purposive sampling methods were used to increase diversity within the group. Transcripts were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants described potential threats to their wellbeing during the pandemic, including fears for mortality, grieving normal life, and concerns for the future. Participants also described activities and behaviours that helped to protect their mental health, including adopting a slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising, and using past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs. DISCUSSION: This study provides UK-based evidence that while some older adults experienced challenges during the first wave of COVID-19, many were resilient throughout social distancing restrictions despite early reported concerns of mental health consequences among the older adult population. Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining access to essentials to promote feelings of normality and use of social support to help reduce uncertainty in times of pandemics.

In this study, the therapeutic potential of a new iridoid glycoside isolated from the leaves of Clerodendrum volubile against COVID-19 was investigated. Harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (HG) was isolated, characterised and investigated for its druglikeness, optimized geometry, and pharmacokinetics properties. Its immunomodulatory was determined by chemiluminescence assay using polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in addition to T-cell proliferation assay. In silico analysis was used in determining its molecular interaction with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2). HG displayed potent druglikeness properties, with no inhibitory effect on cytochrome P(450) (1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4) and a predicted LD(50) of 2000 mg/kg. Its (1)H-NMR chemical shifts showed a little deviation of 0.01 and 0.11 ppm for H-4 and H-9, respectively. HG significantly suppressed oxidative bursts in PMNs, while concomitantly inhibiting T-cell proliferation. It also displayed a very strong binding affinity with the translation initiation and termination sequence sites of spike (S) protein mRNA of SARS-COV-2, its gene product, and host ACE2 receptor. These results suggest the immunomodulatory properties and anti-SARS-COV-2 potentials of HG which can be explored in the treatment and management of COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Various parameters including clinical manifestations and molecular evaluation can affect the accuracy of diagnosis. This review aims to discuss the various clinical symptoms and molecular evaluation results in COVID-19 patients, to point out the importance of onset symptoms, type, and timing of the sampling, besides the methods that are used for detection of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A systematic literature review of current articles in the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE was conducted according to the PRISMA guideline. RESULTS: Of the 12946 patients evaluated in this investigation, 7643 were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive by molecular techniques, particularly the RT-PCR/qPCR combined technique (qRT-PCR). In most of the studies, all of the enrolled cases had 100% positive results for molecular evaluation. Among the COVID-19 patients who were identified as such by positive PCR results, most of them showed fever or cough as the primary clinical signs. Less common symptoms observed in clinically confirmed cases were hemoptysis, bloody sputum, mental disorders, and nasal congestion. The most common clinical samples for PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were obtained from throat, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal swabs, while tears and conjunctival secretions seem to be the least common clinical samples for COVID-19 diagnosis among studies. Also, different conserved SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences could be targeted for qRT-PCR detection. The suggested molecular assay being used by most laboratories for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is qRT-PCR. CONCLUSION: There is a worldwide concern on the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of well-managed global control. Hence, it is crucial to update the molecular diagnostics protocols for handling the situation. This is possible by understanding the available advances in assays for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Good sampling procedure and using samples with enough viral loads, also considering the onset symptoms, may reduce the qRT-PCR false-negative results in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Selection of the most efficient primer-probe for target genes and samples containing enough viral loads to search for the existence of SARS-CoV-2 helps detecting the virus on time using qRT-PCR.","Zandi, Milad; Farahani, Abbas; Zakeri, Armin; Akhavan Rezayat, Sara; Mohammadi, Ramin; Das, Umashankar; Dimmock, Jonathan R.; Afzali, Shervin; Nakhaei, Mohammadvala Ashtar; Doroudi, Alireza; Erfani, Yousef; Soltani, Saber",Int J Microbiol,431,23

This has driven many psychotherapists and other mental health professionals towards telepsychotherapy, relying on online consultations to provide continuity of care. However, the adoption of telepsychotherapy required major adaptations from both mental health professionals and patients. This study set out to explore the predictors of the use of online consultations and the perceived level of comfort using telepsychotherapy in a sample of 73 Lebanese mental health professionals. Data was collected via online dissemination of a survey. Results show that 82% of participants made use of online consultations in the past few days, reflecting the adaptation of Lebanese mental health professionals to the atypical newly imposed situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequent lockdown. Having previous experience in the use of online consultations and perceived level of telepresence were significant predictors of the level of comfort of mental health professionals in the execution online consultations. We suggest that more awareness and trainings are required around the practice of telepsychotherapy outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tohme, Pia; De Witte, Nele A.

METHODS: A total of 30 231 workers were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information was collected on COVID-19-related symptoms, risk factors, preventive equipment, and risk perception. The crude prevalence was calculated for infection, use of protective devices, perceived risk and main concerns. Additionally, adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated for these variables using logistic regression models with age, gender, occupation, epidemiological week and laboratory as confounding factors. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of infection was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0% to 3.4%), being higher among policemen (4.4%) and bus drivers (4.2%), but lower among emergency healthcare personnel, firefighters, food market workers and burial services (<2%). Lower excess risk was observed in workers reporting occupational contact with COVID-19 cases only (PR=1.42; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.71) compared with household exposure only (PR=2.75; 95% CI 2.32 to 3.25). Infection was more frequent in symptomatic workers (PR=1.28; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.48), although 42% of detected infections were asymptomatic. Use of facial masks (78.7%) and disinfectants (86.3%) was common and associated with lower infection prevalence (PR(masks)=0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79; PR(disinfectants)=0.75; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91). Over 50% of workers felt being at high risk of infection and worried about infecting others, yet only 2% considered quitting their work.

The episodic control-binding hypothesis posits that the formation of temporary stimulus-control bindings, which are held in event-files supported by episodic memory, can guide the contextually appropriate application of cognitive control. Across two experiments, we sought to examine the role of task-focused attention in the encoding and implementation of stimulus-control bindings in episodic event-files. In Experiment 1, we obtained self-reports of mind wandering during encoding and implementation of stimulus-control bindings. Results indicated that, whereas mind wandering during the implementation of stimulus-control bindings does not decrease their efficacy, mind wandering during the encoding of these control-state associations interferes with their successful deployment at a later point. In Experiment 2, we complemented these results by using trial-by-trial pupillometry to measure attention, again demonstrating that attention levels at encoding predict the subsequent implementation of stimulus-control bindings better than attention levels at implementation. These results suggest that, although encoding stimulus-control bindings in episodic memory requires active attention and engagement, once encoded, these bindings are automatically deployed to guide behavior when the stimulus recurs. These findings expand our understanding of how cognitive control processes are integrated into episodic event files.

Methods During the infection surge, we added new infection control measures and strengthened existing ones. Additional personal protective equipment was used, and the number of ophthalmologists rotating in the three high-capacity NICUs we service was limited. Results More infants required ROP examinations during the study period in 2020 than in the same period in 2019, but fewer examinations were performed. There were no cases of missed progression to severe ROP during this time and no known transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between ROP patients and ophthalmology staff. Conclusions Overall, effective ROP care was safely provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, and contact with this vulnerable population was minimized.","Mantagos, Iason S.; Wu, Carolyn; Griffith, Joseph F.; Jastrzembski, Benjamin G.; Gonzalez, Efren; Goldstein, Samantha; Pearlo, Lori; Vanderveen, Deborah K.",J AAPOS,431,3

We undertook a single-centre cross-sectional study in order to understand the variations in vaccine-induced immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain (B.1) and three major VOCs (B.1.1.7, B.1351 and P.1). We studied a cohort of outpatients with immunodeficiencies (IDPs) and health care workers (HCWs) based at the same critical care tertiary NHS Trust, following a single dose of either BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccines. Our serological data revealed either undetectable antibodies or low neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in IDPs, with only 5% and 3% showing detectable neutralisation of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively. Healthy HCWs without a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated a wide range of nAb titres post-vaccination. However, their responses are significantly lower than HCWs with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralisation of VOCs with the E484K mutation (B.1.351 and P.1) were consistently lower in HCWs in the absence of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001). Notably, in HCWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a significant increase of neutralising titres post-vaccination to all four strains, compared to their pre-vaccination neutralisation titres. This underscores the importance of vaccination even in populations that have been previously exposed, and also provides support for the hypothesis that a second-dose of vaccination will similarly boost immunity to greater protective levels in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, this serological nAb analysis after a single-dose of BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccination demonstrates a wide variety of responses, particularly against the VOCs, and suggests limited neutralisation-based protection in individuals with immunodeficiencies.","Nadesalingam, A.; Cantoni, D.; Wells, D.

The discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV shows that HCoVs pose a significant threat to human health. Our work aims to develop a sensitive method (mCoV-MS) which can not only identify known HCoVs accurately, but also have the ability to provide clues for the emerging HCoVs. The method was performed using a MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. We developed a 17-plex analysis to detect six HCoVs in Panel A and another 17-plex analysis to detect Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus in Panel B. All tested primers and probes for the mCoV-MS method were effective, with no cross-reactivity observed with other common respiratory viruses. To confirm the usefulness of the mCoV-MS method we screened 384 pharyngeal and/or anal swab samples collected from bats/rodents, and 131 nasal and throat swabs from human patients. The results showed good concordance with the results of metagenomic analysis or PCR-sequencing. The validation test showed mCoV-MS method can detect potentially pathogenic CoVs in Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and provide convincingly phylogenetic evidences about unknown CoVs. The mCoV-MS method is a sensitive assay that is relatively simple to carry out.

Departing from a dataset containing the Euclidean positions of all players during 60 matches of the Spanish national league (30 from LaLiga Santander and 30 from LaLiga Smartbank, respectively, the first and second divisions), we analysed 1,670 participations of elite soccer players. Our results show a high heterogeneity of both the player-player interaction time (from 0 to 14 min) and the aggregated time with all opponents (from <1 to 44 min). Furthermore, when the player position is taken into account, we observe that goalkeepers are the players with the lowest exposure (lower than 1 min), while forwards are the players with the highest values of the accumulated time (~21 min). In this regard, defender-forward interactions are the most frequent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset describing the proximity between soccer players. Therefore, we believe these results may be crucial to the development of epidemiological models aiming the predict the risk of contagion between players and, furthermore, to understand better the statistics of all actions that involve proximity between players.","Garrido, David; Antequera, Daniel R.; Campo, Roberto López Del; Resta, Ricardo; Buldú, Javier M.",Front Psychol,431,18

Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using >34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 962 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the 4 primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by 3 expert cardiologists. Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1 intensity, sensitivity increased to 90.0%. Application of the algorithm at the appropriate anatomic auscultation location detected moderate‐to‐severe or greater aortic stenosis, with sensitivity of 93.2% and specificity of 86.0%, and moderate‐to‐severe or greater mitral regurgitation, with sensitivity of 66.2% and specificity of 94.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning algorithm’s ability to detect murmurs and clinically significant aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation is comparable to expert cardiologists based on the annotated subset of our database. The findings suggest that such algorithms would have utility as front‐line clinical support tools to aid clinicians in screening for cardiac murmurs caused by valvular heart disease.

This cycle has been studied in Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a pathogen of African sleeping sickness, and is involved in (i) ATP and (ii) acetate production and proceeds independent of oxygen and an electrochemical gradient. Interestingly, knockout of ASCT in procyclic form (PCF) of T. brucei cause oligomycin A-hypersensitivity phenotype indicating that ASCT/SCS cycle complements the deficiency of ATP synthase activity. In bloodstream form (BSF) of T. brucei, ATP synthase works in reverse to maintain the electrochemical gradient by hydrolyzing ATP. However, no information has been available on the source of ATP, although ASCT/SCS cycle could be a potential candidate. Regarding mitochondrial acetate production, which is essential for fatty acid biosynthesis and growth of T. brucei, ASCT or acetyl-CoA hydrolase (ACH) are known to be its source. Despite the importance of this cycle, direct evidence of its function is lacking, and there are no comprehensive biochemical or structural biology studies reported so far. Here, we show that in vitro–reconstituted ASCT/SCS cycle is highly specific towards acetyl-CoA and has a higher k cat than that of yeast and bacterial ATP synthases. Our results provide the first biochemical basis for (i) rescue of ATP synthase-deficient phenotype by ASCT/SCS cycle in PCF and (ii) a potential source of ATP for the reverse reaction of ATP synthase in BSF.","Mochizuki, Kota; Inaoka, Daniel Ken; Mazet, Muriel; Shiba, Tomoo; Fukuda, Keisuke; Kurasawa, Hana; Millerioux, Yoann; Boshart, Michael; Balogun, Emmanuel O.; Harada, Shigeharu; Hirayama, Kenji; Bringaud, Frédéric; Kita, Kiyoshi",Biochim Biophys Acta Bioenerg,431,1

The aim of this study was to determine the virucidal efficacy of blue LED (405 nm) and far-UVC (222 nm) light in comparison to standard UVC (254 nm) irradiation for the inactivation of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) on different matrices as a model for SARS-CoV-2. Wet or dried FIPV on stainless steel, plastic, or paper discs, in the presence or absence of artificial saliva, were exposed to various wavelengths of light for different time periods (1–90 min). Dual activity of blue LED and far-UVC lights were virucidal for most wet and dried FIPV within 4 to 16 min on all matrices. Individual action of blue LED and far-UVC lights were virucidal for wet FIPV but required longer irradiation times (8–90 min) to reach a 4-log reduction. In comparison, LED (265 nm) and germicidal UVC (254 nm) were virucidal on almost all matrices for both wet and dried FIPV within 1 min exposure. UVC was more effective for the disinfection of surfaces as compared to blue LED and far-UVC individually or together. However, dual action of blue LED and far-UVC was virucidal. This combination of lights could be used as a safer alternative to traditional UVC.","Gardner, Amanda; Ghosh, Sayani; Dunowska, Magdalena; Brightwell, Gale",Viruses,431,20

In this article we address the issue by a combined approach involving molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. The study contributes to improve the understanding, at molecular level, of the acylation and deacylation stages of avibactam involved in the inhibition of KPC-2. The results show that both mechanisms, acylation and deacylation, the reaction occur via the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The formation of this intermediate corresponds to the rate limiting stage. The activation barriers are 19.5 kcal/mol and 23.0 kcal/mol for the acylation and deacylation stages, respectively. The associated rate constants calculated, using the Eyring equation, are 1.2 × 10(−1) and 3.9 × 10(−4) (s(−1)).

This finding is known as the illusory truth effect, and it is typically thought to occur because repetition increases processing fluency. Because fluency and truth are frequently correlated in the real world, people learn to use processing fluency as a marker for truthfulness. Although the illusory truth effect is a robust phenomenon, almost all studies examining it have used three or fewer repetitions. To address this limitation, we conducted two experiments using a larger number of repetitions. In Experiment 1, we showed participants trivia statements up to 9 times and in Experiment 2 statements were shown up to 27 times. Later, participants rated the truthfulness of the previously seen statements and of new statements. In both experiments, we found that perceived truthfulness increased as the number of repetitions increased. However, these truth rating increases were logarithmic in shape. The largest increase in perceived truth came from encountering a statement for the second time, and beyond this were incrementally smaller increases in perceived truth for each additional repetition. These findings add to our theoretical understanding of the illusory truth effect and have applications for advertising, politics, and the propagation of “fake news.”","Hassan, Aumyo; Barber, Sarah J.",Cogn Res Princ Implic,431,27

We have previously demonstrated that acute inflammation modulates cytochromes P450 (CYPs) activity in an isoform-specific manner. We therefore hypothesized that COVID-19 might also impact CYP activity, and thus aimed to evaluate the impact of acute inflammation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the six main human CYPs activity. This prospective observational study was conducted in 28 patients hospitalized at the Geneva University Hospitals (Switzerland) with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COVID-19. They received the Geneva phenotyping cocktail orally during the first 72 hours of hospitalization and after 3 months. Capillary blood samples were collected 2 hours after cocktail administration to assess the metabolic ratios (MRs) of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were also measured in blood. CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A MRs decreased by 52.6% (P = 0.0001), 74.7% (P = 0.0006), and 22.8% (P = 0.045), respectively, in patients with COVID-19. CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 MRs increased by 101.1% (P = 0.009) and 55.8% (P = 0.0006), respectively. CYP2D6 MR variation did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.072). As expected, COVID-19 was a good acute inflammation model as mean serum levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly (P < 0.001) higher during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In recent researches, many useful methods for fake news detection employ sequential neural networks to encode news content and social context-level information where the text sequence was analyzed in a unidirectional way. Therefore, a bidirectional training approach is a priority for modelling the relevant information of fake news that is capable of improving the classification performance with the ability to capture semantic and long-distance dependencies in sentences. In this paper, we propose a BERT-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) deep learning approach (FakeBERT) by combining different parallel blocks of the single-layer deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) having different kernel sizes and filters with the BERT.

We have witnessed within some of our classrooms a more empowered hostility and intolerance to conversations pertaining to social justice. We agree that this phenomenon is pedagogical because this language usage not only teaches, but also legitimizes hate speech. We have witnessed the illogical extension of this hate speech with an increase in hate crimes across the country since the 2016 election, Without peaceful protest and grassroots feminist activism, we fear that this speech, this pedagogy, will spread even more violent forms of hate. This research was conducted in and around the first Women's March of 2017. We wanted to know: What were marchers' prior histories of political activism prior to the election? If this was their first time participating in such a manner, how did the election and its early political fallout inspire marchers to attend? 2) What plans did marchers have for political activism after the march? 3) What can be learned from these participants about the current state of political activism in our current era? A total of 788 individuals had taken part in the online survey. Among the participants, 45% marched on Washington, and 55% participated in the march in their local cities. We found that issues of gender equality were of great concern to many of the marchers. In particular, issues related to economic and social equity, including salary.

Such models are usually defined as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments based on qualitative characteristics, with different assumptions about the nature and rate of transfer across compartments. Though most commonly formulated as ordinary differential equation models, in which the compartments depend only on time, recent works have also focused on partial differential equation (PDE) models, incorporating the variation of an epidemic in space. Such research on PDE models within a Susceptible, Infected, Exposed, Recovered, and Deceased framework has led to promising results in reproducing COVID-19 contagion dynamics. In this paper, we assess the robustness of this modeling framework by considering different geometries over more extended periods than in other similar studies. We first validate our code by reproducing previously shown results for Lombardy, Italy. We then focus on the U.S. state of Georgia and on the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, one of the most impacted areas in the world. Our results show good agreement with real-world epidemiological data in both time and space for all regions across major areas and across three different continents, suggesting that the modeling approach is both valid and robust.","Grave, Malú; Viguerie, Alex; Barros, Gabriel F.; Reali, Alessandro; Coutinho, Alvaro L.

The rapid and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Earlier during the pandemic, there were limited genetic viral variations. As millions of people became infected, multiple single amino acid substitutions emerged. Many of these substitutions have no consequences. However, some of the new variants show a greater infection rate, more severe disease, and reduced sensitivity to current prophylaxes and treatments. Of particular importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission are mutations that occur in the Spike (S) protein, the protein on the viral outer envelope that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (hACE2).

According to alchemical free energy calculations, the P1' hydroxymethyl group also contributes to the binding free energy. Covalent inhibition of the enzyme is triggered by the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the Sγ atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1' hydroxyl group.

Easily available modalities like X-ray can be used to detect specific symptoms associated with COVID-19. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks are widely used for computer-aided detection of diseases from smaller datasets. This paper investigates the effectiveness of multi-CNN, a combination of several pre-trained CNNs, for the automated detection of COVID-19 from X-ray images. The method uses a combination of features extracted from multi-CNN with correlation based feature selection (CFS) technique and Bayesnet classifier for the prediction of COVID-19. The method was tested using two public datasets and achieved promising results on both the datasets. In the first dataset consisting of 453 COVID-19 images and 497 non-COVID images, the method achieved an AUC of 0.963 and an accuracy of 91.16%.

Variants of previously described viruses are also called “remerging viruses.” They are mutants of known viruses but cause new epidemics with considerable virulence. The influenza virus that caused the 2009 swine flu pandemic was a variant of an existing virus.","Ryu, Wang-Shick",Molecular Virology of Human Pathogenic Viruses,431,20

We describe characteristics and outcomes of confirmed ARDS in COVID-19 patients managed with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study in consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (as defined by the Berlin criteria) affected with with COVID-19 (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens), admitted to a network of 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs) between March 12 and June 1, 2020. We examined the clinical features, ventilatory management, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 ARDS patients, and compared some results with other relevant studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: A total of 742 patients were analysed with complete 28-day outcome data: 128 (17.1%) with mild, 331 (44.6%) with moderate, and 283 (38.1%) with severe ARDS. At baseline, defined as the first day on invasive MV, median (IQR) values were: tidal volume 6.9 (6.3–7.8) ml/kg predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure 12 (11–14) cmH(2)O. Values of respiratory system compliance 35 (27–45) ml/cmH(2)O, plateau pressure 25 (22–29) cmH(2)O, and driving pressure 12 (10–16) cmH(2)O were similar cto values from non-COVID-19 ARDS observed in other studies. Recruitment maneuvers, prone position and neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 79%, 76% and 72% of patients, respectively. The risk of 28-day mortality was lower in mild ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.33–0.93), p = 0.026] and moderate ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% CI 0.47–0.97), p = 0.035] when compared to severe ARDS. The 28-day mortality was similar to other observational studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large series, COVID-19 ARDS patients have features similar to other causes of ARDS, compliance with lung-protective ventilation was high, and the risk of 28-day mortality increased with the degree of ARDS severity.

The model is calibrated for a group of eight African economies which offer student loans, and the effect on human capital accumulation of decreasing the remittance price to the level recommended by the United Nations (3%) is numerically derived. It is found that reduction in remittance prices alters the decisions of households, leading in the aggregate to a decrease in interest rates, a curbing of the desire to migrate, and an increase human capital. Hence, the study offers the policy prescription that governments, both in nations where remittances originate and in those to which funds are sent, must continue to lower remittance prices, by, for example, improving access to mobile banking, especially since such policies are relatively immune to economic shocks.","Khraiche, Maroula; Boudreau, James",J Policy Model,431,12

The objective is to evaluate vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in COVID-19 patients, and compare the findings with healthy controls. The secondary objective is to evaluate if there are differences in OCTA parameters between COVID-19 patients with and without associated TE. METHODS: Cross-sectional case–control study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with and without TE related to the infection and age-matched healthy controls. Ophthalmological examination and OCTA were performed 12 weeks after diagnosis. Demographic data and medical history were collected. Macular OCTA parameters in the superficial retinal plexus were analyzed according to ETDRS sectors. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included, 19 (20%) COVID-19 patients with associated TE, 47 (49.5%) COVID-19 patients without TE, and 29 (30.5%) healthy controls. Fifty-three (55.7%) were male, mean age 54.4 (SD 10.2) years. COVID-19 patients presented significantly lower VD than healthy controls: central (p = 0.003), inner ring (p = 0.026), outer ring (p = 0.001). PD was also significantly decreased: outer ring (p = 0.003), full area (p = 0.001). No differences in OCTA parameters were found between COVID-19 patients with and without TE. CONCLUSIONS: OCTA represents a promising tool for the in vivo assessment of microvascular changes in COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection show lower VD and PD compared to healthy controls. However, no differences were found between COVID-19 when considering TE. Prospective studies are required to further evaluate the retinal microvascular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the vasculature of other organs.

We assessed changes in hospital resource utilization and estimated the future backlog of cases in the colorectal surgery division of a large safety-net hospital. METHODS: Patients undergoing colorectal procedures from 3/16/20 to 4/23/20 (COVID) were compared with those from January through June 2018 (historical). Resource utilization rates were calculated by weekly case volumes and hospital stay in each group. A future catch up timeframe and new wait times from scheduling to surgery dates were calculated. RESULTS: The COVID and historical groups included 13 and 239 patients, respectively. The COVID group showed a 74% relative decrease in weekly surgical case rates (9.2 to 2.4 patients per week). Both groups had similar lengths of stay. The COVID group had a longer average ICU stay (1.4 ± 2.5 days vs. 0.4 ± 1.2 days, P = 0.016) and a 132% increase in ICU resource utilization. Overall, the COVID group had a 48% relative decrease in hospital resource utilization, owing to reduced volume but higher acuity. If the surgery numbers returns to pre-COVID volumes, the calculated “catch up” times range from 4.6 weeks to 9.2 weeks. Wait times for new cases may increase by 70% compared with pre-COVID levels. CONCLUSION: Cancelling elective colorectal surgeries results in a decrease in overall but increase in ICU-specific resource utilization. Though necessary, cancellations result in an increasing backlog of cases that poses significant future logistical and clinical challenges in an already overburdened safety-net hospital. Effective triage systems will be critical to prioritize this backlog.","Yoon, Dong Hum; Koller, Sarah; Duldulao, Philip Marjun N.; Ault, Glenn T.; Lee, Sang W.; Cologne, Kyle G.",J Gastrointest Surg,431,16

Ever since that time, COVID-19 has killed millions of people Worldwide. Even people not stricken by this disease are not spared from its negative economic, social, and health-related drawbacks. This commentary provides insight into potential mechanism involved in the development of depression and emotional negativity escalating during the current pandemic. In particular, preventive measures of COVID-19, such as staying at home, are sedentarism measures that decrease physical activity. Physical inactivity alters gut microbiome structure in a fashion that promotes gut dysbiosis and flaring of systemic inflammation, leading to the buildup of body fat. Obesity, which contributes to a trail of health-depleting disorders, furthers gut microbial disintegration while fat tissue stimulates the release of cytokines, promotes metabolic resistance, and alters signaling involved in the production of antioxidants. As a result, the body gets flooded by toxic molecules such pro-inflammatory mediators, free radicals, advanced glycation end products. These toxic molecules alter cellular function in all body tissues, including those of the brain. Neuroinflammation is associated with progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions along with dysregulation in emotions. Counteracting the sedentarism enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic through suitable indoors activities and intake of healthy food is likely to protect against or revert physiological impairments that may affect people retreating to their homes during the current crisis, eventually restoring physical and mental health.","Ali, Amira Mohammed; Kunugi, Hiroshi",Sports medicine and health science,431,24

To what extent burnout may relate to an actual alteration of this key professional ability has been little investigated. In an experimentally controlled setting, we investigated whether subjective experiences of global burnout or burnout depersonalization (the interpersonal component of burnout) relate to objectively measured alterations in emotion recognition and to what extent such alterations are emotion specific. Healthcare workers (n = 90) completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory and a dynamic emotion recognition task in which faces with neutral emotional expressions gradually changed to display a specific basic emotion (happiness, anger, fear, or sadness). Participants were asked to identify and then classify each displayed emotion. Before the task, a subsample of 46 participants underwent two salivary cortisol assessments. Individuals with global burnout were less accurate at recognizing others’ emotional expressions of anger and fear, tending to misclassify these as happiness, compared to individuals without global burnout. Individuals with high burnout depersonalization were more accurate in recognizing happiness and less accurate in recognizing all negative emotions, with a tendency to misclassify the latter as positive ones, compared to healthcare workers with moderate/low depersonalization. Moreover, individuals with high depersonalization—but not participants with global burnout—were characterized by higher cortisol levels. These results suggest that the subjective burnout experience relates to an actual, but selective, reduction in the recognition of facial emotional expressions, characterized by a tendency to misclassify negative emotional expressions as positive ones, perhaps due to an enhanced seeking of positive social cues. This study adds to the understanding of emotional processing in burnout and paves the way for more nuanced studies on the role of altered processing of threat signals in the development and/or persistence of burnout.","Colonnello, Valentina; Carnevali, Luca; Russo, Paolo Maria; Ottaviani, Cristina; Cremonini, Valeria; Venturi, Emanuele; Mattarozzi, Katia",PeerJ,431,26

The aim of this study to investigate the prognostic value of right ventricular (RV) strain in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients admitted to the emergency room for COVID-19 between 1 and 30 April were included in this study. ECG was performed on hospital admission and was evaluated as blind. RV strain was defined as in the presence of one or more of the following ECG findings: complete or incomplete right ventricular branch block (RBBB), negative T wave in V1-V4 and presence of S1Q3T3. The main outcome measure was death during hospitalization. The relationship of variables to the main outcome was evaluated by multivariable Cox regression analysis.

Healthcare workers in particular have experienced increased levels of psychological distress, depression and anxiety. Any perceived stress to an individual can provoke psychological defence mechanisms. Using psychoanalytic theory, a defence mechanism is described as an unconscious psychological strategy, with or without resulting behaviour, which aims to reduce or eliminate anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli. This paper aims to describe a range of psychological defence mechanisms encountered within colleagues in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the methodology of a case series, specific defence mechanisms are explored with reference to further literature in the field. RESULTS: The author has encountered varying psychological defence mechanisms, both within himself and in other members of the multidisciplinary team. These have been illustrated in the attached clinical vignettes, relating to the specific psychological coping mechanisms of; denial, hypochondriasis, altruism, sublimation and humour. CONCLUSION: We encourage acknowledgement of psychological defence mechanisms and their implications on day to day practice. Whilst defence mechanisms can have a number of negative consequences as described in this article, they also have an important role, particularly in the case of mature defence mechanisms, as protective factors against psychological distress and symptom formation. Deeper understanding of the gold-standard hierarchical organization of defence mechanisms could help increase utilisation of specific therapeutic interventions for enhancing changes from immature to mature defensive responses to stressful experiences as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.","Walker, Graham; McCabe, Thomas",Eur J Psychiatry,431,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the experiences of COVID-19 with renal healthcare practitioners during the first global lockdown between June 2020 and September 2020. METHODS: A multi-methods approach was carried out including a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews. This was a multinational study of renal healthcare practitioners from 29 countries. Quantitative: A self-designed survey on COVID-19 experiences and standardised questionnaires (General Health Questionnaire-12; Maslach Burnout Inventory). Descriptive statistics were generated for numerical data. Qualitative: Online semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data was subjected to thematic analysis. Renal healthcare practitioners (n = 251) completed an online survey. Thirteen renal healthcare practitioners took part in semi-structured interviews (12 nurses and 1 dietician). RESULTS: The majority of participants surveyed were female (86.9 %; n = 218), nurses (86.9 %; n = 218) with an average 21.5 (SD = 11.1) years’ experience since professional qualification, and 16.3 years (SD = 9.3) working in renal healthcare. Survey responses indicated a level of preparedness, training and satisfactory personal protective equipment during the pandemic however approximately 40.3 % experienced fear about attending work, and 49.8 % experienced mental health distress. The highest prevalence of burnout was emotional exhaustion (35.9 %). Three themes emerged from the qualitative analysis highlighting the holistic complexities in managing renal healthcare, a neglected specialist workforce, and the need for appropriate support at work during a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Results have highlighted the psychological impact, in terms of emotional exhaustion and mental health distress in our sample of renal healthcare practitioners. As the pandemic has continued, it is important to consider the long-term impact on an already stretched workforce including the risk of developing mental health disorders.

A growing body of data supports the role of microbiota in health and in disease. Grasping the principles of host-microbiota interactions (HMIs) at the molecular level is important since it may provide insights into the mechanisms of infections. The crosstalk between the host and the microbiota may help resolve puzzling questions such as how a microorganism can contribute to both health and disease. Integrated superorganism networks that consider host and microbiota as a whole–may uncover their code, clarifying perhaps the most fundamental question: how they modulate immune surveillance. Within this framework, structural HMI networks can uniquely identify potential microbial effectors that target distinct host nodes or interfere with endogenous host interactions, as well as how mutations on either host or microbial proteins affect the interaction. Furthermore, structural HMIs can help identify master host cell regulator nodes and modules whose tweaking by the microbes promote aberrant activity. Collectively, these data can delineate pathogenic mechanisms and thereby help maximize beneficial therapeutics. To date, challenges in experimental techniques limit large-scale characterization of HMIs. Here we highlight an area in its infancy which we believe will increasingly engage the computational community: predicting interactions across kingdoms, and mapping these on the host cellular networks to figure out how commensal and pathogenic microbiota modulate the host signaling and broadly cross-species consequences.","Guven-Maiorov, Emine; Tsai, Chung-Jung; Nussinov, Ruth",PLoS Comput Biol,431,20

This brief commentary examines the deficits of current models and proposes several improved alternates. The existing single transgene mouse models poorly mimic the clinical features of COVID-19; those strains get a milder disease than human COVID-19 disease. Many of the current transgenic models utilize random integration of several copies of single ACE2 transgenes, resulting in unnatural gene expression and exhibit rapid lethality. We suggest preparing precision knock-in of selected human mini genes at the mouse initiation codon and knock-out of the mouse homolog as a better option. Three genes critical for infection are suggested targets, ACE2 (the viral cellular receptor), its co-infection protease TMRPSS2, and the primary antibody clearance receptor FcγRT. To offer the best platform for COVID 19 research, preparation of single, double, and triple humanized combinations offers the researcher the opportunity to better understand the contributions of these receptors, coreceptors to therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we propose to create the humanized strains in the C57BL/6J and BALB/c backgrounds. These two backgrounds are Th1 responders and Th2 responders, respectively, and allow modeling of the variability seen in human pathology including lung pathology and late sequelae of COVID-19 disease (BALB/c). We suggest the need to do a thorough characterization of both the short-term and long-term effects of SAR-CoV-2 infection at the clinical, virologic, histopathologic, hematologic, and immunologic levels.

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and is the last to unbind from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking the hydrophobic surface of RBD via neutralizing antibodies could prove to be an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.","Taka, Elhan; Yilmaz, Sema Z.; Golcuk, Mert; Kilinc, Ceren; Aktas, Umut; Yildiz, Ahmet; Gur, Mert",J Phys Chem B,431,22

Furthermore, mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 - a symptom-based approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced, age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 - July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and 0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a specific day with 4 previous days of history. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while heart rate variability is decreased. Measuring these metrics can help in early diagnosis, and in monitoring the progress of the disease.","Natarajan, A.; Su, H.-W.; Heneghan, C.",,431,16

We create a daily index of social distancing—at the state level—to capture social distancing beliefs by analyzing the number of tweets containing keywords such as “stay home”, “stay safe”, “wear mask”, “wash hands” and “social distancing”. We find that an increase in the Twitter index of social distancing on day t-1 is associated with a decrease in mobility on day t. We also find that state orders, an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, precipitation and temperature contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states are also less likely to enforce social distancing. Beliefs shared on social networks could both reveal the behavior of individuals and influence the behavior of others. Our findings suggest that policy makers can use geotagged Twitter data—in conjunction with mobility data—to better understand individual voluntary social distancing actions.","Porcher, Simon; Renault, Thomas",PLoS One,431,24

Eosinopenia has been identified as a potential biomarker of sepsis in the past decade. However, its clinical application progress is slow and its recognition is low. Recent studies have again focused on the potential association between Eosinopenia and severe infections. This study analyzed the efficacy of Eosinopenia as a biomarker for diagnosis of sepsis and its correlation with pathophysiology of sepsis. METHOD: The protocol for this meta-analysis is available in PROSPERO (CRD42020197664). We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL databases to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Two authors performed data extraction independently. The pooled outcomes were calculated by TP (true positive), FP (false positive), FN (false negative), TN (true negative) by using bivariate meta-analysis model in STATA 14.0 software. Meanwhile, possible mechanisms of sepsis induced Eosinopenia was also analyzed. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the present study with a total number of 3842 subjects. The incidence of Eosinopenia based on the enrolled studies varied from 23.2 to 92.7%. For diagnosis of sepsis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio of Eosinopenia were 0.66 (95%CI [0.53–0.77]), 0.68 (95%CI [0.56–0.79]), 2.09 (95%CI [1.44–3.02]), 0.49 (95%CI [0.34–0.71]) and 4.23 (95%CI [2.15–8.31]), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve (SROC) was 0.73 (95%CI [0.68–0.76]). Meta-regression analysis revealed that no single parameter accounted for the heterogeneity of pooled outcomes. For each subgroup of different eosinopenia cutoff values (50, 40, ≤25, 100), the sensitivity was 0.61, 0.79, 0.57, 0.54, and the specificity was 0.61, 0.75, 0.83, 0.51, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that Eosinopenia has a high incidence in sepsis but has no superiority in comparison with conventional biomarkers for diagnosis of sepsis. However, eosinopenia can still be used in clinical diagnosis for sepsis as a simple, convenient, fast and inexpensive biomarker. Therefore, further large clinical trials are still needed to re-evaluate eosinopenia as a biomarker of sepsis.

To this aim, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein represents a crucial target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. Since virus binding to ACE-2 alone could not be sufficient to justify such severe infection, in order to facilitate medical countermeasure development and to search for new targets, two further regions of S protein have been taken into consideration here. One is represented by the recently identified ganglioside binding site, exactly localized in our study in the galectin-like domain, and the other one by the putative integrin binding sites contained in the RBD. We propose that a cooperating therapy using inhibitors against multiple targets altogether i.e., ACE2, integrins and sugars could be definitely more effective.","Pirone, Luciano; Del Gatto, Annarita; Di Gaetano, Sonia; Saviano, Michele; Capasso, Domenica; Zaccaro, Laura; Pedone, Emilia",Front Mol Biosci,431,1

Recent studies have examined the performance of fabrics under various conditions; however, the performance against violent respiratory events such as human sneezes is yet to be explored. Accordingly, we present a comprehensive experimental study using sneezes by a healthy adult and a tailored image-based flow measurement diagnostic system evaluating all dimensions of protection of commonly available fabrics and their layered combinations: the respiratory droplet blocking efficiency, water resistance, and breathing resistance. Our results reveal that a well-designed cloth mask can outperform a three-layered surgical mask for such violent respiratory events. Specifically, increasing the number of layers significantly increases the droplet blocking efficiency, on average by ∼20 times per additional fabric layer. A minimum of three layers is necessary to resemble the droplet blocking performance of surgical masks, and a combination of cotton/linen (hydrophilic inner layer)–blends (middle layer)–polyester/nylon (hydrophobic outer layer) exhibited the best performance among overall indicators tested. In an optimum three-layered design, the average thread count should be greater than 200, and the porosity should be less than 2%. Furthermore, machine washing at 60 °C did not significantly impact the performance of cloth masks. These findings inform the design of high-performing homemade cloth masks.","Bhattacharjee, Shovon; Bahl, Prateek; de Silva, Charitha; Doolan, Con; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Heslop, David; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina",ACS Biomater Sci Eng,431,1

Coronavirus and rotavirus frequently are associated with the neonatal calf diarrhea syndrome, but the etiologic role of the newly identified viruses is undefined. All diarrheal viruses replicate within small intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in variable degrees of villous atrophy. Immunity against these viral infections, therefore, must be directed toward protection of the susceptible intestinal epithelial cells. Because most of these viral infections occur in calves<3 wk of age, passive lactogenic immunity within the gut lumen plays an important role in protection. This report reviews methods of boosting rotavirus antibody responses in bovine mammary secretions and analyses of passive and active immunity in calves supplemented with colostrum and challenged by rotavirus. Results indicate rotavirus immunoglobulin G1 antibodies in colostrum and milk were elevated after intramuscular and intramammary vaccination of pregnant cows with an Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center rotavirus vaccine but not after intramuscular immunization with a commercial rota-coronavirus vaccine. Feeding colostrum from intramuscular plus intramammary immunized cows to newborn calves challenged by rotavirus prevented diarrhea and shedding of rotavirus.","Saif, Linda J.; Smith, K.

This study's main outcome is a poor composite outcome, comprising of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 9 studies with 3,663 patients. The prevalence of dyslipidemia in this pooled analysis was 18% (4%-32%). Dyslipidemia was associated with increased composite poor outcome (RR 1.39 [1.02, 1.88], p=0.010; I(2): 56.7%, p=0.018). Subgroup analysis showed that dyslipidemia was associated with severe COVID-19 (RR 1.39 [1.03, 1.87], p=0.008; I(2): 57.4%, p=0.029). Meta-regression showed that the association between dyslipidemia and poor outcome varies by age (coefficient: -0.04, p=0.033), male gender (coefficient: -0.03, p=0.042), and hypertension (coefficient: -0.02, p=0.033), but not diabetes (coefficient: -0.24, p=0.135) and cardiovascular diseases (coefficient: -0.01, p=0.506).

There have been calls from academics and NGOs to develop more detailed understandings of older adults’ risk experiences to inform disaster risk reduction (DRR) and communication approaches. We conducted in-depth interviews with twelve members of the retired population, of which the majority happened to be members of a local church, in a flood risk area of north Wales, UK, in 2018 to ascertain risk perceptions, coping capacities, and risk communication preferences to inform more age-centred approaches. Results present retired population are a diverse group with varying perceptions and capacities. While personal risk perceptions were low overall, coping capacities varied and were primarily social in nature, which can be sustained despite mobility or other limitations typical of older age. Participants expressed preference for traditional/interpersonal risk communication methods, such as telephone calls or home visits. A key recommendation from this study is that risk communication and DRR practices should adopt people-centric approaches that are co-produced and respect the differentiated vulnerabilities, capacities and needs of at-risk populations. This study and its findings are important is providing a more nuanced picture of the vulnerabilities and capacities of the particularly at-risk population of older adults.

We aimed at an in-silico analysis of regulatory microRNA and their transcription factors (TF) for these inflammatory genes that may help to devise potential therapeutic strategies in the future. Methods: The cytokine regulating immune-expressed genes (CRIEG) were sorted from literature and GEO microarray dataset and their co-differentially expressed miRNA and transcription factors were predicted from publicly available databases. Enrichment analysis was done through mienturnet, MiEAA, and Gene Ontology, and pathways predicted by KEGG and Reactome pathways. The functional and regulatory features were analyzed and visualized through Cytoscape. Results: Sixteen CRIEG were observed to have a significant protein-protein interaction network. The ontological analysis revealed significantly enriched pathways for biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. The search performed in the miRNA database yielded 10 miRNAs that are significantly involved in the regulation of these genes and their transcription factors. Conclusion: An In-Silico representation of a network involving miRNAs, CRIEGs, and TF which take part in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 has been elucidated. These regulatory factors may have potentially critical roles in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 and may be explored further for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies and mechanistic validation.","Khokhar, M.; Tomo, S.; Purohit, P.",,431,16

We describe a rapidly implemented COVID‐adapted diagnostic pathway to mitigate risk and maximize cancer diagnosis in patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC. METHOD: The ‘COVID‐adapted pathway’ integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFIT) to enrich for significant colorectal disease with judicious use of CT with oral contrast to detect gross pathology. Patients reporting ‘high‐risk’ symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the remainder underwent an initial qFIT to inform subsequent investigation. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Outcomes comprised cancer detection frequency. RESULTS: Overall, 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 women) were triaged using this pathway. Most (84.6%) were referred as ‘urgent suspicious of cancer’. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47.9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT, 211 (50.0%) to qFIT only, eight (1.9%) to outpatient clinic and one to colonoscopy. Fifteen (3.6%) declined investigation and seven (1.7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13 cancers (3.1%), similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017–2019 (3.3%). Compared with the period 1 April–31 May in 2017–2019, we observed a 43% reduction in all primary care referrals (1071 referrals expected reducing to 609). CONCLUSION: This COVID‐adapted pathway mitigated the adverse effects on diagnostic capacity and detected cancer at the expected rate within those referred. However, the overall reduction in the number of referrals was substantial. The described risk‐mitigating measures could be a useful adjunct whilst standard diagnostic services remain constrained due to the ongoing pandemic.","Miller, Janice; Maeda, Yasuko; Au, Stephanie; Gunn, Frances; Porteous, Lorna; Pattenden, Rebecca; MacLean, Peter; Noble, Colin L.; Glancy, Stephen; Dunlop, Malcolm G.; Din, Farhat V.

At a detailed level, there are many differences in the replication processes of different viruses that are imposed by the biology of the host cell and the nature of the virus genome. The other stages that have been discussed are: attachment, penetration, uncoating, genome replication, gene expression, assembly, maturation, and release.

Researchers residing in SSA, despite often drawing on Cochrane methods, training or resources, conduct and publish systematic reviews outside of Cochrane. Our objective was to investigate the extent to which Cochrane authors from SSA publish Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews. METHODS: We conducted a bibliometric study of systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews from SSA, first by identifying SSA Cochrane authors, then retrieving their first and last author systematic reviews and overviews from PubMed (2008 to April 2019) and using descriptive analyses to investigate the country of origin, types of reviews and trends in publishing Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews over time. To be eligible, a review had to have predetermined objectives, eligibility criteria, at least two databases searched, data extraction, quality assessment and a first or last author with a SSA affiliation. RESULTS: We identified 657 Cochrane authors and 757 eligible systematic reviews. Most authors were from South Africa (n=332; 51%), followed by Nigeria (n=126; 19%). Three-quarters of the reviews (71%) were systematic reviews of interventions. The intervention reviews were more likely to be Cochrane reviews (60.3% vs 39.7%). Conversely, the overviews (23.8% vs 76.2%), qualitative reviews (14.8% vs 85.2%), diagnostic test accuracy reviews (16.1% vs 83.9%) and the ‘other’ reviews (11.1% vs 88.9%) were more likely to be non-Cochrane reviews. During the study period, the number of non-Cochrane reviews increased more than the number of Cochrane reviews. About a quarter of the reviews covered infectious disease topics. CONCLUSION: Cochrane authors from SSA are increasingly publishing a diverse variety of systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews, often opting for non-Cochrane journals.","Mbuagbaw, Lawrence; Schoonees, Anel; Oliver, Joy; Arikpo, Dachi; Durão, Solange; Effa, Emmanuel; Hohlfeld, Ameer; Kredo, Tamara; Wiysonge, Charles Shey; Young, Taryn",BMJ Open,431,26

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs) are part of the PRR family; they form a large multiple-protein complex called the inflammasome in the cytosol. In mammals, the inflammasome consists of an NLR, used as a sensor molecule, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) as an adaptor protein, and pro-caspase1 (Casp1). Inflammasome activation induces Casp1 activation, promoting the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, and the induction of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis via gasdermin D cleavage in mammals. Inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in mammals play important roles in protecting the host from pathogen infection. Recently, numerous inflammasome-related genes in teleosts have been identified, and their conservation and/or differentiation between their expression in mammals and teleosts have also been elucidated. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular structure and machinery of the inflammasomes and the ASC-spec to induce pyroptosis; moreover, we explore the protective role of the inflammasome against pathogenic infection in teleosts.","Morimoto, Natsuki; Kono, Tomoya; Sakai, Masahiro; Hikima, Jun-ichi",Int J Mol Sci,431,21

However, cPORT is associated with acute toxicity, especially in the head and neck (H&N) region, and requires daily treatments over several weeks. We previously reported high rates of durable local control with minimal toxicity using 8 Gy single-fraction radiation therapy (SFRT) in the metastatic setting. We report early results on a cohort of patients with localized H&N MCC, who received post operative SFRT if a cPORT regimen was not feasible. METHODS: Twelve patients with localized MCC of the H&N (clinical/pathologic stages: I-II) and no prior RT to the region were identified from an IRB-approved prospective registry who underwent surgical resection followed by post operative SFRT. Time-to-event was calculated starting from the date of resection prior to SFRT. The cumulative incidence of in-field locoregional recurrences and out-of-field recurrences was estimated with death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Twelve H&N MCC patients were identified with clinical/pathologic stages I-II H&N MCC. Median age at diagnosis was 81 years (58-96); 25% had immunosuppression. At a median follow-up of 19 months (range: 8-34), there were no in-field locoregional recurrences. A single out-of-field regional recurrence was observed, which was successfully salvaged. There were no MCC specific-deaths. No radiation-associated toxicities greater than grade 1 (CTCAE v5) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that SFRT could offer a potential alternative to cPORT to treat the primary site for localized H&N MCC, particularly in elderly or frail patients, with promising in-field local control and minimal toxicity. Further data with validation in larger cohorts is needed to confirm the sustained safety and efficacy of post operative SFRT.","Cook, Maclean M.; Schaub, Stephanie K.; Goff, Peter H.; Fu, Alex; Park, Song Y.; Hippe, Daniel S.; Liao, Jay J.; Apisarnthanarax, Smith; Bhatia, Shailender; Tseng, Yolanda D.; Nghiem, Paul T.; Parvathaneni, Upendra",Adv Radiat Oncol,431,27

This paper uses an innovative model of social class within a sample of Australian women to describe changes in affective states and alcohol consumption patterns across two time points during COVID-19. Methods: Survey data were collected from Australian mid-life women (45–64 years) at two time points during COVID-19—May 2020 (N = 1,218) and July 2020 (N = 799). We used a multi-dimensional model for measuring social class across three domains—economic capital (income, property and assets), social capital (social contacts and occupational prestige of those known socially), and cultural capital (level of participation in various cultural activities). Latent class analysis allowed comparisons across social classes to changes in affective states and alcohol consumption patterns reported at the two time points using alcohol consumption patterns as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption (AUDIT-C) and its component items. Results: Seven social classes were constructed, characterized by variations in access to capital. Affective states during COVID-19 differed according to social class. Comparing between the survey time points, feeling fearful/anxious was higher in those with high economic and cultural capital and moderate social capital (“emerging affluent”). Increased depression was most prominent in the class characterized by the highest volumes of all forms of capital (“established affluent”). The social class characterized by the least capital (“working class”) reported increased prevalence of uncertainty, but less so for feeling fearful or anxious, or depressed. Women's alcohol consumption patterns changed across time during the pandemic. The “new middle” class—a group characterized by high social capital (but contacts with low prestige) and minimal economic capital—had increased AUDIT-C scores. Conclusion: Our data shows the pandemic impacted women's negative affective states, but not in uniform ways according to class. It may explain increases in alcohol consumption among women in the emerging affluent group who experienced increased feelings or fear and anxiety during the pandemic. This nuanced understanding of the vulnerabilities of sub-groups of women, in respect to negative affect and alcohol consumption can inform future pandemic policy responses designed to improve mental health and reduce the problematic use of alcohol. Designing pandemic responses segmented for specific audiences is also aided by our multi-dimensional analysis of social class, which uncovers intricate differences in affective states amongst sub-groups of mid-life women.","Lunnay, Belinda; Toson, Barbara; Wilson, Carlene; Miller, Emma R.; Meyer, Samantha Beth; Olver, Ian N.; Foley, Kristen; Thomas, Jessica A.; Ward, Paul Russell",Front Public Health,431,20

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective feasibility study . SETTING: In-person testing with a novel ACM. METHODS: The mask was designed in Solidworks and 3D printed. Measurements were made on 10 healthy volunteers who wore the ACM while reading the Rainbow Passage repeatedly and performing a forced cough or sneeze at 5-second intervals over 1 minute with an endoscope in place. RESULTS: There was a large variation in the number of aerosol particles generated among the volunteers. Only the sneeze task showed a significant increase compared with normal breathing in the 0.3-µm particle size when compared with a 1-tailed t test (P = .013). Both the 0.5-µm and 2.5-µm particle sizes showed significant increases for all tasks, while the 2 largest particle sizes, 5 and 10 µm, showed no significant increase (both P < .01). With the suction off, 3 of 30 events (2 sneeze events and 1 cough event) had increases in particle counts, both inside and outside the mask. With the suction on, 2 of 30 events had an increase in particle counts outside the mask without a corresponding increase in particle counts inside the mask. Therefore, these fluctuations in particle counts were determined to be due to random fluctuation in room particle levels. CONCLUSION: ACM will accommodate rigid and flexible endoscopes plus instruments and may prevent the leakage of patient-generated aerosols, thus avoiding contamination of the room and protecting health care workers from airborne contagions.

The prediction model is presented based on the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which has been widely used to describe the epidemic time evolution of infectious diseases. The original version of the Kermack and McKendrick model is used in this study. This included the daily rates of infection spread by infected individuals when these individuals interact with a susceptible population, which is denoted by the parameter β, while the recovery rates to determine the number of recovered individuals is expressed by the parameter γ. The parameters estimation of the three-compartment SIR model is determined through using a mathematical sequential reduction process from the logistic growth model equation. As the parameters are the basic characteristics of epidemic time evolution, the model is always tested and applied to the latest actual data of confirmed COVID-19 cases. It seems that this simple model is still reliable enough to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively with a high degree of correlation between actual data and prediction results. Therefore, it is possible to apply this model to predict cases of COVID-19 in several countries. In addition, the parameter characteristics of the classic SIR model can provide information on how these parameters reflect the efforts by each country to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is clearly seen from the changes of the parameters shown by the classic SIR model.","Kartono, Agus; Karimah, Savira Vita; Wahyudi, Setyanto Tri; Setiawan, Ardian Arif; Sofian, Irmansyah",Infect Dis Rep,431,20

A PEDV strain (CN/Liaoning25/2018) isolated from a clinical outbreak of piglet diarrhea contained a 49-bp deletion in the ORF3 gene. This deletion is considered a genetic characteristic of low pathogenic attenuated vaccine strains. However, CN/Liaoning25/2018 was highly pathogenic. Complete genome sequencing, identity analysis, phylogenetic tree construction, and recombination analysis showed that this virus was a recombinant strain containing the Spike (S) gene from the highly pathogenic CN/GDZQ/2014 strain and the remaining genomic regions from the low pathogenic vaccine isolate SQ2014. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry results confirmed that this strain was highly pathogenic and indicated that intestinal epithelial cell vacuolation was positively correlated with the intensity and density of PEDV antigens. A new natural recombination model for PEDV was identified. Our results suggest that new highly pathogenic recombinant strains in the field may be generated by recombination between low pathogenic attenuated live PEDV vaccines and pathogenic circulating PEDV strains. Our findings also highlight that the 49-bp deletion of the ORF3 gene in low pathogenic attenuated vaccine strains will no longer be a reliable standard to differentiate the classical vaccine attenuated from the field strains.","Wang, Huinan; Zhang, Libo; Shang, Yuanbin; Tan, Rongrong; Ji, Mingxiang; Yue, Xinliang; Wang, Nannan; Liu, Jun; Wang, Chunhua; Li, Yonggang; Zhou, Tiezhong",Virus Evol,431,1

The study objective was to identify barriers to decision aid use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) within a behavior change model to inform an implementation strategy. METHODS: Perspectives from Canadian health care providers (HCPs) and patients living with RA were obtained on an early RA decision aid and on perceived facilitators and barriers to decision aid implementation. Data were collected through semistructured interviews, transcribed, and then analyzed by inductive thematic analysis. The lessons learned were then mapped to the behavior change wheel COM‐B system (C = capability, O = opportunity, and M = motivation interact to influence B = behavior) to inform key elements of a national implementation strategy. RESULTS: Fifteen HCPs and fifteen patients participated. The analysis resulted in five lessons learned: 1) paternalistic decision‐making is a dominant practice in early RA, 2) patients need emotional support and access to educational tools to facilitate participation in shared decision‐making (SDM), 3) there are many logistical barriers to decision aid implementation in current care models, 4) flexibility is necessary for successful implementation, and 5) HCPs have limited interest in further training opportunities about decision aids. Implementation recommendations included the following: 1) making the decision aids directly available to patients (O) and providing SDM education (C/M), 2) creating an SDM rheumatology curriculum (C/O/M), 3) using “decision coaches” or patient partners as peer support (C/O/M), 4) linking decision aids to “living” rheumatology guidelines (M), and 5) designing trials of patient decision aid/SDM interventions to evaluate patient‐important outcomes (O/M). CONCLUSION: A multifaceted strategy is suggested to improve uptake of decision aids.","Barber, Claire E.

To investigate mechanisms of this tolerance of infection, we used single-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an experimental model of inflammation and compared the responses of two rodents: Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed deermouse and reservoir for the agents of Lyme disease and other zoonoses, and the house mouse Mus musculus. Four hours after injection with LPS or saline, blood, spleen, and liver samples were collected and subjected to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), metabolomics, and specific reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Differential expression analysis was at the gene, pathway, and network levels. LPS-treated deermice showed signs of sickness similar to those of exposed mice and had similar increases in corticosterone levels and expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor, IL-1β, and C-reactive protein. By network analysis, the M. musculus response to LPS was characterized as cytokine associated, while the P. leucopus response was dominated by neutrophil activity terms. In addition, dichotomies in the expression levels of arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase 2 and of IL-10 and IL-12 were consistent with type M1 macrophage responses in mice and type M2 responses in deermice. Analysis of metabolites in plasma and RNA in organs revealed species differences in tryptophan metabolism. Two genes in particular signified the different phenotypes of deermice and mice: the Slpi and Ibsp genes. Key RNA-seq findings for P. leucopus were replicated in older animals, in a systemic bacterial infection, and with cultivated fibroblasts. The findings indicate that P. leucopus possesses several adaptive traits to moderate inflammation in its balancing of infection resistance and tolerance.","Balderrama-Gutierrez, Gabriela; Milovic, Ana; Cook, Vanessa J.; Islam, M.

Eighty-one outbreaks had a median outbreak duration of 32.5 days (range 5-204 days) and 1,161 VREfm isolates were sequenced. The same cgMLST cluster types reappeared after outbreaks were terminated. When comparing the first 5 months of the COVID-19 pandemic with the corresponding period in 2019, we found a 10-fold decrease in VREfm outbreak patients and median outbreak duration decreased from 56 to 7 days (88%). Several COVID-19 ICBSs were implemented from March 13 through summer 2020. VREfm outbreaks lasted up to 204 days, but our findings suggest that outbreaks might last longer since the same cgMLST persisted in the same wards for years implying an endemic situation with recurrent outbreaks caused by hospital reservoirs or readmittance of unknown VREfm carriers.

Closing this gap could facilitate messaging to promote COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. METHODS: In July 2020, a five-question text message survey was sent to 1,087 youth aged 14–24 years. Questions assessed youths' perceptions regarding the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, the potential impact of contracting COVID-19 on their lives, the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to others, and their use of face coverings around others with whom they do not live. Coding was conducted to assign responses to discrete categories and to identify common themes. RESULTS: Of 1,087 eligible participants, 797 (73.3%) were included in analyses. Of these participants, 27.3% believed they would likely contract COVID-19 in the next few months, 90.3% believed contracting COVID-19 would have a moderate or significant impact on their lives, 86.0% were moderately or very concerned about spreading COVID-19, and 89.2% reported wearing face coverings all or most of the time. Factors affecting face covering use included the desire to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, peer influence, and policy mandates. CONCLUSIONS: Youths' perceptions regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 varied, but most believed their lives would be adversely impacted if this occurred. Most youth were concerned about spreading COVID-19 and wore face coverings, but many made exceptions to face covering use when around close contacts. Public health campaigns may be most effective if they leverage positive peer influence and appeal to youths' desire not to spread COVID-19 to others.","DeJonckheere, Melissa; Waselewski, Marika; Amaro, Xochitl; Frank, Abby; Chua, Kao-Ping",J Adolesc Health,431,16

Indeed, the effects of a pandemic transcends its epidemiological characteristics to political economy and societal resilience. If resilience is the capacity of a system to adapt successfully to significant challenges that threaten the function or development of the human society, then ontological insecurity is about the lack of such capacity. Drawing on Keith Hartian’s understanding of ‘informality’ of spaces, this policy brief attempts to identify and frame a research agenda for the future. The agenda would assist future researchers and policymakers provide responses that appropriately recognize groups and actors that define the urban informal space.","Onditi, Francis; Nyadera, Israel Nyaburi; Obimbo, Moses Madadi; Muchina, Samson Kinyanjui",Hist Philos Life Sci,431,24

Ensuring adequate staffing with highly competent nurses remains a top priority to sustain safe patient care. However, there are barriers to individual professional advancement in hospitals, including costs and lack of support or time, which can lead to decreased nurse satisfaction. After the mandated cancellation of elective surgery in March 2020 resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, leaders at a medical center decided to turn this difficult situation into an opportunity to re‐engage their perioperative personnel in professional development. More than 70 staff members participated in activities related to certification, continuing education, clinical advancement, and cross‐training. Elective surgery has since resumed, and as a result of the pursuit of professional development opportunities, staff member turnover did not increase throughout the transition at the medical center. Interest in professional growth has been reignited and staff members are excited about future development opportunities.","Robertson, Lori; Finlayson, Susan; Peñaloza, M.

They lack explicit dynamics and have multiple sources of cost, both of which are beyond the current scope of traditional control theory. We construct the global economy risk network by combining the consensus of experts from the World Economic Forum with risk activation data to define its topology and interactions. Many of these risks, including extreme weather and drastic inflation, pose significant economic costs when active. We introduce a method for converting network interaction data into continuous dynamics to which we apply optimal control. We contribute the first method for constructing and controlling risk network dynamics based on empirically collected data. We simulate applying this method to control the spread of COVID-19 and show that the choice of risks through which the network is controlled has significant influence on both the cost of control and the total cost of keeping network stable. We additionally describe a heuristic for choosing the risks trough which the network is controlled, given a general risk network.","Brissette, Christopher; Niu, Xiang; Jiang, Chunheng; Gao, Jianxi; Korniss, Gyorgy; Szymanski, Boleslaw K.",Sci Rep,431,20
