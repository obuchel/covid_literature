463,"The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative: Objectives, design and recruitment results of a prospective cohort study investigating infant viral respiratory illness and the development of asthma and allergic diseases",2010-04-08,"Background and objective: The ‘attack rate’ of asthma following viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) is about 3–4 fold higher than that of the general population; however, the majority of children who develop viral LRTI during infancy do not develop asthma, and asthma incidence has been observed to continuously decrease with age. Thus, we do not understand how viral LRTI either predispose or serve as a marker of children to develop asthma. The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative has been established as a longitudinal prospective investigation of infants and their biological mothers. The primary goals are to investigate both the acute and the long‐term health consequences of varying severity and aetiology of clinically significant viral respiratory tract infections on early childhood outcomes. Methods: Over four respiratory viral seasons, 2004–2008, term, non‐low birth weight previously healthy infants and their biological mothers were enrolled during an infant's acute viral respiratory illness. Longitudinal follow up to age 6 years is ongoing. Results: This report describes the study objectives, design and recruitment results of the over 650 families enrolled in this longitudinal investigation. The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative is additionally unique because it is designed in parallel with a large retrospective birth cohort of over 95 000 mother–infant dyads with similar objectives to investigate the role of respiratory viral infection severity and aetiology in the development of asthma. Conclusions: Future reports from this cohort will help to clarify the complex relationship between infant respiratory viral infection severity, aetiology, atopic predisposition and the subsequent development of early childhood asthma and atopic diseases.","HARTERT, Tina V.; CARROLL, Kecia; GEBRETSADIK, Tebeb; WOODWARD, Kimberly; MINTON, Patricia",Respirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992986/,191
585,Seasonal distribution of active systemic lupus erythematosus and its correlation with meteorological factors,2011-06-11,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of seasonal distribution of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the influences of meteorological factors including temperature and humidity on active systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: The characteristics of seasonal distribution of active SLE and its correlation with meteorological factors were retrospectively analyzed in 640 patients living in the city of Zhanjiang, China and had active SLE between January 1997 and December 2006. RESULTS: In winter, when there are weaker ultraviolet (UV) rays, the ratio of patients with active SLE to total inpatients was 3.89 ‰, which is significantly higher than in other seasons with stronger UV rays, including 2.17 ‰ in spring, 1.87 ‰ in summer and 2.12 ‰ in autumn. The number of patients with active SLE had significant negative correlation with mean temperature and was not significantly related to mean humidity. CONCLUSION: Active SLE has the characteristics of seasonal distribution and is associated with temperature. The mechanism remains to be further studied.","Zhang, Hua-Li; Xu, Shi-Chao; Tang, De-Shen; Liang, Dong; Liu, Hua-Feng*",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3129944/,191
772,Reliability and External Validity of AMSTAR in Assessing Quality of TCM Systematic Reviews,2012-02-16,"Objective. The aim of this study is to measure the reliability and external validity of AMSTAR by applying it to a sample of TCM systematic reviews. Study Design and Methods. We tested the agreement, reliability, construct validity, and feasibility of AMSTAR through comparisons with OQAQ. Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 13.0. Results. A random of sample with 41 TCM systematic reviews was selected from a database. The interrater agreement of the individual items of AMSTAR was moderate with a mean kappa of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.73). The ICC for AMSTAR against OQAQ (total score of 9 items, excluding item 10) was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.93). Conclusions. Although there is room for improvement on few items, the new tool is reliable, valid, and easy to use for methodological quality assessment of systematic reviews on TCM.","Kang, Deying; Wu, Yuxia; Hu, Dan; Hong, Qi; Wang, Jialiang; Zhang, Xin",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292204/,191
1107,Multicomponent Therapeutics of Berberine Alkaloids,2013-03-24,"Although berberine alkaloids (BAs) are reported to be with broad-spectrum antibacterial and antiviral activities, the interactions among BAs have not been elucidated. In the present study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was chosen as a model organism, and modified broth microdilution was applied for the determination of the fluorescence absorption values to calculate the anti-MRSA activity of BAs. We have initiated four steps to seek the optimal combination of BAs that are (1) determining the anti-MRSA activity of single BA, (2) investigating the two-component combination to clarify the interactions among BAs by checkerboard assay, (3) investigating the multicomponent combination to determine the optimal ratio by quadratic rotation-orthogonal combination design, and (4) in vivo and in vitro validation of the optimal combination. The results showed that the interactions among BAs are related to their concentrations. The synergetic combinations included “berberine and epiberberine,” “jatrorrhizine and palmatine” and “jatrorrhizine and coptisine”; the antagonistic combinations included “coptisine and epiberberine”. The optimal combination was berberine : coptisine : jatrorrhizine : palmatine : epiberberine = 0.702 : 0.863 : 1 : 0.491 : 0.526, and the potency of the optimal combination on cyclophosphamide-immunocompromised mouse model was better than the natural combinations of herbs containing BAs.","Luo, Jiaoyang; Yan, Dan; Yang, Meihua; Dong, Xiaoping; Xiao, Xiaohe",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3619540/,191
1702,"AS03(B)-Adjuvanted H5N1 Influenza Vaccine in Children 6 Months Through 17 Years of Age: A Phase 2/3 Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Observer-Blinded Trial",2015-03-01,"Background. This phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study assessed the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of an inactivated, split-virion H5N1 influenza vaccine (A/Indonesia/5/2005) in children aged 6 months through 17 years. Methods. Children received 2 influenza vaccine doses 21 days apart, each containing 1.9 µg of hemagglutinin and AS03(B) adjuvant (5.93 mg of α-tocopherol). The randomization ratio was 8:3 for vaccine to placebo, with equal allocation between 3 age strata (6–35 months, 3–8 years, and 9–17 years). Immunogenicity against the vaccine strain was assessed 21 days after the first and second vaccine doses for all vaccinees, at day 182 for half, and at day 385 for the remaining half. Reactogenicity after each dose and safety up to 1 year after vaccination were evaluated. Results. Within each age stratum, the lower limit of the 98.3% confidence interval for the day 42 seroprotection rate was ≥70%, thus fulfilling the US and European licensure criteria. The immune responses elicited by vaccine persisted well above baseline levels for 1 year. The vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo, but no major safety concerns were identified. Conclusions. AS03(B)-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine was immunogenic and showed an acceptable safety profile in all age groups studied. Clinical Trials Registration.

2508,Immunogenicity and Safety of an AS03-Adjuvanted H7N9 Pandemic Influenza Vaccine in a Randomized Trial in Healthy Adults,2016-12-01,"Background. Almost 700 cases of human infection with avian influenza A/H7N9 have been reported since 2013. Pandemic preparedness strategies include H7N9 vaccine development. Methods. We evaluated an inactivated H7N9 vaccine in an observer-blind study in healthy adults aged 18–64 years. Participants (420) were randomized to receive 1 of 4 AS03-adjuvanted vaccines (low or medium dose of hemagglutinin with AS03(A) or AS03(B)), one nonadjuvanted vaccine, or placebo. The coprimary immunogenicity objective determined whether adjuvanted vaccines elicited an immune response against the vaccine-homologous virus, 21 days after the second vaccine dose per US and European licensure criteria in the per-protocol cohort (n = 389). Results. All adjuvanted vaccines met regulatory acceptance criteria. In groups receiving adjuvanted formulations, seroconversion rates were ≥85.7%, seroprotection rates ≥91.1%, and geometric mean titers ≥92.9% versus 23.2%, 28.6%, and 17.2 for the nonadjuvanted vaccine. The AS03 adjuvant enhanced immune response at antigen-sparing doses. Injection site pain occurred more frequently with adjuvanted vaccines (in ≤98.3% of vaccinees) than with the nonadjuvanted vaccine (40.7%) or placebo (20.0%). None of the 20 serious adverse events reported were related to vaccination. Conclusions. Two doses of AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccine were well tolerated and induced a robust antibody response at antigen-sparing doses in healthy adults. Clinical Trials Registration.

2945,Potential for broad-scale transmission of Ebola virus disease during the West Africa crisis: lessons for the Global Health security agenda,2017-12-01,"BACKGROUND: The 2014–2016 Ebola crisis in West Africa had approximately eight times as many reported deaths as the sum of all previous Ebola outbreaks. The outbreak magnitude and occurrence of multiple Ebola cases in at least seven countries beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, hinted at the possibility of broad-scale transmission of Ebola. MAIN TEXT: Using a modeling tool developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Ebola outbreak, we estimated the number of Ebola cases that might have occurred had the disease spread beyond the three countries in West Africa to cities in other countries at high risk for disease transmission (based on late 2014 air travel patterns). We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola. CONCLUSIONS: The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci. Health security requires robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak.

3344,Prevalence of Respiratory Polyomaviruses Among Pediatric Patients With Respiratory Symptoms in Singapore,2018-08-17,"Background: Although WU polyomavirus (WU) and KI polyomavirus (KI) have been demonstrated to infect the human respiratory tract, it remains unclear if WU or KI cause human disease. We sought to further investigate the relationship between WU and KI infection and respiratory disease in a pediatric population with respiratory symptoms in Singapore. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms in a Singaporean pediatrics hospital. Upon consent, residual respiratory samples from pediatric inpatients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were collected and further screened for WU and KI using qPCR. The amplicons of positive samples were sequenced for confirmation. The severity of a patient's illness was assessed by chart review post-discharge looking for clinical markers of respiratory status such as presenting symptoms, diagnoses, and interventions. Results: From December 2016 to April 2017, 201 patients with residual respiratory samples were enrolled in the study. The average age of all participants recruited was 45 months. WU and KI were detected in 13% (26/201) and 3% (6/201) of patients, respectively. Conducting bivariate and multivariate modeling, patients with WU or KI positivity were not at increased risk of SARI, need for additional oxygen, intravenous fluids, and did not receive additional oral antibiotics or bronchodilators during admission. In contrast, patients with RSV detections were at increased risk of requiring supplemental oxygen during hospital admission. Conclusion: While limited in sample size, our pilot study data do not support the hypothesis that molecular evidence of WU or KI was associated with increased morbidity among a sample of general, pediatric patients with respiratory illness in Singapore.","Hansen-Estruch, Christophe; Coleman, Kristen K.; Thoon, Koh C.; Low, Jenny G.; Anderson, Benjamin D.; Gray, Gregory C.",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107759/,191
3797,Inflammatory responses relate to distinct bronchoalveolar lavage lipidome in community-acquired pneumonia patients: a pilot study,2019-05-02,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antibiotics are losing their effectiveness due to the emerging infectious diseases, the scarcity of novel antibiotics, and the contributions of antibiotic misuse and overuse to resistance. Characterization of the lipidomic response to pneumonia and exploring the “lipidomic phenotype” can provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis and potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic treatments. METHODS: Lipid profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were generated through untargeted lipidomic profiling analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify possible sources of variations among samples. Partitioning clustering analysis (k-means) was employed to evaluate the existence of distinct lipidomic clusters. RESULTS: PCA showed that BALF lipidomes differed significantly between CAP (n = 52) and controls (n = 68, including 35 healthy volunteers and 33 patients with non-infectious lung diseases); while no clear separation was found between severe CAP and non-severe CAP cases. Lactosylceramides were the most prominently elevated lipid constituent in CAP. Clustering analysis revealed three separate lipid profiles; subjects in each cluster exhibited significant differences in disease severity, incidence of hypoxemia, percentages of phagocytes in BALF, and serum concentrations of albumin and total cholesterol (all p < 0.05). In addition, SM (d34:1) was negatively related to macrophage (adjusted r = − 0.462, p < 0.0001) and PE (18:1p/20:4) was positively correlated with polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) percentages of BALF (adjusted r = 0.541, p < 0.0001). The 30-day mortality did not differ amongst three clusters (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that specific lower airway lipid composition is related to different intensities of host inflammatory responses, and may contribute to functionally relevant shifts in disease pathogenesis in CAP individuals. These findings argue for the need to tailor therapy based on specific lipid profiles and related inflammatory status. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03093220).

4602,Molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains from the endotracheal tubes of patients with nosocomial pneumonia,2020-02-28,"OBJECTIVES: This review fills the paucity of information on K. pneumoniae as a nosocomial pathogen by providing pooled data on epidemiological risk factors, resistant trends and profiles and resistant and virulent genes of this organism in Asia. METHODS: Exhaustive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar for most studies addressing the prevalence, risk factors, drug resistant-mediated genes and/or virulent factors of K. pneumoniae in Asia. Data extracted for meta-analysis were analyzed using comprehensive meta-analysis version 3. Trends data for the isolation rate and resistance rates were entered into Excel spread sheet and the results were presented in graphs. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of drug resistance in K. pneumoniae were; amikacin (40.8%) [95% CI 31.9–50.4], aztreonam (73.3%) [95% CI 59.9–83.4], ceftazidime (75.7%) [95% CI 65.4–83.6], ciprofloxacin (59.8%) [95% CI 48.6–70.1], colistin (2.9%) [95% CI 1.8–4.4], cefotaxime (79.2%) [95% CI 68.0–87.2], cefepime (72.6) [95% CI 57.7–83.8] and imipenem (65.6%) [95% CI 30.8–89.0]. TEM (39.5%) [95% CI 15.4–70.1], SHV-11 (41.8%) [95% CI 16.2–72.6] and KPC-2 (14.6%) [95% CI 6.0–31.4] were some of the resistance mediated genes observed in this study. The most virulent factors utilized by K. pneumoniae are; hypermucoviscous phenotype and mucoviscosity-related genes, genes for biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide, iron uptake and transport genes and finally, adhesive genes. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that, antimicrobial resistant in K. pneumoniae is a clear and present danger in Asia which needs strong surveillance to curb this menace. It is very important for public healthcare departments to monitor and report changes in antimicrobial-resistant isolates.","Effah, Clement Yaw; Sun, Tongwen; Liu, Shaohua; Wu, Yongjun",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7050612/,191
5237,"Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: community transmission, pathogenesis, and drug resistance",2010-03-25,"Microorganisms spread across national boundaries and the professional activities of clinical (medical) microbiologists are critical in minimising their impact. Clinical microbiologists participate in many activities, e.g. diagnosis, antibiotic therapy, and there is a need for a set of professional standards for Europe with a common curriculum, to build upon the current strengths of the specialty and to facilitate the free movement of specialists within the European Union. Such standards will also better highlight the important contribution of clinical microbiologists to healthcare. There is a move to larger centralised microbiology laboratories often located off-site from an acute hospital, driven by the concentration of resources, amalgamation of services, outsourcing of diagnostics, automation, an explosion in the range of staff competencies and accreditation. Large off-site centralised microbiology laboratories are often distant to the patient and may not facilitate the early detection of microbial spread. Ultimately, the needs of patients and the public are paramount in deciding on the future direction of clinical microbiology. Potential conflicts between integration on an acute hospital site and centralisation can be resolved by a common set of professional standards and a team-based approach that puts patients first.","Humphreys, H.; Nagy, E.; Kahlmeter, G.; Ruijs, G.

5571,Allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation following salvage chemotherapy for adults with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia,1998-05-14,"AIM: To study the relationship between primary structures of oligodeoxynucleo-tides (ODN) containing unmethylated deoxycytidyl-deoxyguanosine (CpG) dinucleotide motifs and their immunostimulatory activities in mouse spleen cells. METHODS: A series of CpG ODN with different primary structures were synthesized. Their capabilities to stimulate mouse spleen cell proliferation were determined by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-12, and IFN-α) secretion spectra induced by CpG ODN were assessed by ELISA. The ability of CpG ODN to activate natural killer cells was evaluated by standard 4 h (51)Cr-release assay. Flow cytometry was utilized to examine the expressions of various lymphocyte surface molecules on diverse immunocytes. An effective CpG ODN for murine, ODN1826, was set as the template of modification and the positive control. RESULTS: The immunostimulatory activities of CpG ODN with different sequences and compositions varied markedly, both in character and in extent. It was useless for improving the immunostimulatory activity of ODN1826 by simply increasing the functional hexameric CpG motif number, modifying the site of CpG motifs, or changing the distance between multi-CpG motifs. However, an addition of a self-complementary palindrome structure at the 3′-end, but not the 5′-end of CpG ODN, aroused marked improvement in its activity. Several designed ODN had superior comprehensive immunostimulatory properties compared to ODN1826. CONCLUSION: The immunostimulatory activity of a CpG ODN was relevant to its primary structure. It was useless for promoting immunostimulatory activity to simply change CpG motif number, space, or distance. The 3′-end palindrome structure of CpG ODN is associated with enhanced immunostimulatory activity.","Du, Hai-yan; Xia, Shao-you; Song, Hai-feng; Li, Na; Shang, Ming-mei; Zou, Jia; Wang, Qing-qing; Ou, Lun; Sun, Xiao; Ji, Ai-guo; Tang, Zhong-ming",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091584/,191
5612,Low molecular weight heparin for the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a prospective phase II study,2003-06-10,"Seventy-three patients with hematological cancers undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were evaluated for event-free survival (EFS) and toxicity. All received 36 g/m(2) cytosine arabinoside (HDA) and 1200 cGy fractionated total body irradiation (TBI). We assessed the association of EFS and toxicities with the following risk factors: age, gender, diagnosis, initial relapse risk and patient–donor histocompatibility. The EFS probability is 33% at 800 days post-BMT. Twenty-six patients (36%) died of toxicity within 100 days and 14 (19%) have relapsed. EFS was inversely associated with age (P < 0.0001) and initial relapse risk (P = 0.007). The risk of pulmonary (P = 0.023) and hepatic toxicity (P = 0.011) increased with age. Diagnosis other than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was a risk factor (P = 0.015) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); and fewer ALL patients died from toxicity (P = 0.014). The probability of sepsis within 100 days post-BMT correlated (P = 0.007) with initial relapse risk. We conclude: (1) the lower EFS and greater pulmonary and hepatic toxicity associated with increasing age indicate a need for less toxic regimens that maintain high antileukemic efficacy for older patients; (2) the high GVHD and sepsis rates seen in certain categories of patients indicate a need for careful definition of eligibility criteria for this still highly toxic treatment.","Kumar, M; Saleh, A; Rao, PV; Ochoa, S; Meyers, L; Miller, A; Graham-Pole, J",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091784/,191

6448,Left ventricular hypertrophy and renin-angiotensin system blockade,2009-05-15,"Influenza A virus and secondary bacterial infection may have remote effects in the form of cardiovascular complications or fibrosis in different organs. However, the mechanisms governing the development of complications remain poorly studied. The present work reports the comparative assessment of the functional changes which take place in human ECV-304 endothelial cell sublines obtained previously by the long-term culturing of cells after exposure to varying infectious doses (IDs) of influenza A virus, and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It has been demonstrated that, in the course of long-term culturing (six passages) after exposure to pathogenic agents (influenza virus and/or LPS), endothelial cells maintain changes in their migratory activity, permeability, and expression of mRNA for cytokines TNFα and TGFβ (along with the changes in their proliferation activity, which has been demonstrated earlier). The pattern of changes depended on the type of the agent (agents) to which the cells were exposed. The differences in migratory activity (which was at its maximum 4 h after wounding) between the cell sublines at the sixth passage correlated with the differences in their proliferation activity at the first passage (proliferation data were obtained previously). In particular, an increase in migration and proliferation was observed in the sublines exposed to low virus doses (ECV-1ID), as well as exposed to LPS (ECV-LPS), while the suppression of migration and proliferation was observed in the subline exposed to high virus doses (ECV-1000ID). In the ECV-1ID, ECV-LPS, and most notably in ECV-1ID + LPS sublines, we detected an increase in the expression of mRNA for cytokines TNFα and TGFβ, which, however, didn’t lead to the induction of apoptosis. We have also demonstrated an increase in cell permeability in the analyzed sublines, which was indicated by a decrease in the expression of the mRNAs for the genes encoding occludin and ZO-1, the tight junctions proteins . This paper also reports an evaluation of the effects of the antiviral preparations rimantadine and alpisarin on the functional state of cell sublines. As a result, it has been demonstrated that these drugs may be able to prevent the development of the pathological changes caused by influenza A virus and/or LPS in endothelial cells. The results obtained in the present work may be of use when studying the mechanisms of development of the influenza A virus and secondary bacterial infection complications.","Smirnova, S.

6477,Seasonal Human Influenza: Treatment Options,2014-06-25,"Free radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly formed in the human body. Free-radical mechanisms have been implicated in the pathology of several human diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, malaria, and rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the superoxide radical (O(2)(·−)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) are known to be generated in the brain and nervous system in vivo, and several areas of the human brain are rich in iron, which appears to be easily mobilizable in a form that can stimulate free-radical reactions. Antioxidant defenses to remove O(2)(·−) and H(2)O(2) exist. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) remove O(2)(·−) by greatly accelerating its conversion to H(2)O(2). Catalases in peroxisomes convert H(2)O(2) into water and O(2) and help to dispose of H(2)O(2) generated by the action of the oxidase enzymes that are located in these organelles. Other important H(2)O(2)-removing enzymes in human cells are the glutathione peroxidases. When produced in excess, ROS can cause tissue injury. However, tissue injury can itself cause ROS generation (e.g., by causing activation of phagocytes or releasing transition metal ions from damaged cells), which may (or may not, depending on the situation) contribute to a worsening of the injury. Assessment of oxidative damage to biomolecules by means of emerging technologies based on products of oxidative damage to DNA (e.g., 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine), lipids (e.g., isoprostanes), and proteins (altered amino acids) would not only advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms but also facilitate supplementation and intervention studies designed and conducted to test antioxidant efficacy in human health and disease.","Aruoma, Okezie I.",J Am Oil Chem Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101596/,191
6535,Role of interleukin-8 in community-acquired pneumonia: Relation to microbial load and pulmonary function,1997,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a secondary complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, resulting from uncontrolled high blood sugar. 30–40 % of diabetic patients develop DN associated with a poor life expectancy and end-stage renal disease, causing serious socioeconomic problems. Although an exact pathogenesis of DN is still unknown, several factors such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and proteinuria may contribute to the progression of renal damage in diabetic nephropathy. DN is confirmed by measuring blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and proteinuria. Clinical studies show that intensive control of hyperglycemia and blood pressure could successfully reduce proteinuria, which is the main sign of glomerular lesions in DN, and improve the renal prognosis in patients with DN. Diabetic rodent models have traditionally been used for doing research on pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic strategies, but have limitations for translational research. Diabetes in animal models such as rodents are induced either spontaneously or by using chemical, surgical, genetic, or other techniques and depicts many clinical features or related phenotypes of the disease.

Twenty-seven patients with FHF due to viral hepatitis, two with type A (HA), nine with type B (HB), and 16 with type non-A, non-B (NANB) underwent therapy with this new ALSS over the last five years. Three patients, with an exacerbation of chronic HB and 15/16 with type NANB hepatitis were treated with interferon (IFN) also. Of these, 25 patients (92.6%), regained consciousness and 15 (55.6%) [1/2 (50%) with type A, 6/9 (66.7%) with type B and 8/16 (50%) with type NANB hepatitis] survived Including four patients who survived with intensive, care and plasma exchange alone, 19/31 (61.3%) patients survived. Because of its biocompatibility, both survivors and nonsurvivors could be sustained with the ALSS without complications for long periods (19.3 days for the survivors and 32.4 days for nonsurvivors). With this ALSS the ability to sustain life for such prolonged periods allows hepatic regeneration to occur and result in patient survival. It is anticipated that this new ALSS will not only be of value in cases of fulminant hepatic failure but that it may also play a role in sustaining life for those, awaiting liver transplantation.","Yoshiba, Makoto; Sekiyama, Kazuhiko; Iwamura, Yukari; Sugata, Famio",Dig Dis Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101817/,191
6631,Lymphocyte reconstitution after allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies,1998-02-13,"Amiodarone is a widely used and very potent antiarrhythmic substance. Among its adverse effects, pulmonary toxicity is the most dangerous without a causal treatment option. Due to a very long half-life, accumulation can only be prevented by strict adherence to certain dosage patterns. In this review, we outline different safe and proven dosing schemes of amiodarone and compare the incidence and description of pulmonary toxicity. Reason for this is a case of fatal pulmonary toxicity due to a subacute iatrogenic overdosing of amiodarone in a 74-year-old male patient with known severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and ectopic atrial tachycardia with reduced function of kidneys and liver but without preexisting lung disease. Within 30 days, the patient received 32.2 g of amiodarone instead of 15.6 g as planned. Despite early corticosteroid treatment after fast exclusion of all other differential diagnoses, the patient died another month later in our intensive care unit from respiratory failure due to bipulmonal pneumonitis.","Range, Felix T.; Hilker, Ekkehard; Breithardt, Günter; Buerke, Boris; Lebiedz, Pia",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101864/,191
6681,Proteomic peptide profiling for preemptive diagnosis of acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation,2013-07-11,"Excessive or inappropriate inflammation and immunosuppression are components of the response to surgery, trauma, injury, and infection in some individuals and these can lead, progressively, to sepsis and septic shock. The hyperinflammation is characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory mediators, while the immunosuppression is characterized by impairment of antigen presentation and of T helper cell type-1 responses. Long-chain n−3 FA from fish oil decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids. They act both directly (by replacing arachidonic acid as an eicosanoid substrate and by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism) and indirectly (by altering the expression of inflammatory genes through effects on transcription factor activation). Thus, long-chain n−3 FA are potentially useful anti-inflammatory agents and may be of benefit in patients at risk of developing sepsis. As such, an emerging application of n−3 FA is in surgical or critically ill patients where they may be added to parenteral or enteral formulas. Parenteral or enteral nutrition including n−3 FA appears to preserve immune function better than standard formulas and appears to partly prevent some aspects of the inflammatory response. Studies to date are suggestive of clinical benefits from these approaches, especially in postsurgical patients.","Calder, Philip C.",Lipids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101959/,191

We examined the brains of 262 such patients operated for coronary bypass, valve replacement, or heart transplantation. Circulatory disturbances (macro- and microhemorrhages, infarcts, subarachnoid hemorrhages, and hypoxemic brain damage) were present in 128 cases (49%), as the cause of death in 33 cases (12.6%). The infarcts were caused by local arteriosclerosis of brain arteries, arterial emboli originating from the operative sites or myocardial infarctions, or by fat emboli, foreign body emboli or megakaryocytic capillary emboli in rare cases. Inflammatory disturbances were present in 17 cases and consisted of fungal or bacterial septicopyemic changes (12) or of glial nodules (5) as the substrate of a viral or autoimmunencephalitis (Bickerstaff). An incidental finding was Alzheimer’s disease in 37 cases (14% of the material) of elderly patients, often associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not as cause of death or cause of macroscopic brain hemorrhage. Since we have conducted an autopsy study, there is a limitation to transfer the documented changes to the total group of post-cardiac surgery patients with neurologic and cognitive deficits. Contrary to some previous reports, histologically overt microembolic phenomena do not seem to play a major role in our material. On the other hand, careful scrutiny revealed non-fatal white matter microhemorrhages of varying frequency in the different groups, especially after valve operations. These as well as the occasional glial nodules, after resorption and microscarring, could well be the cause of slight neurologic and cognitive impairments.","Emmrich, P.; Hahn, J.; Ogunlade, V.; Geiger, K.; Schober, R.; Mohr, F.

6712,Clinical characteristics of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients: a single center experience,2010-04-28,"INTRODUCTION: In this retrospective, uncontrolled, observational study, the effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated granulocyte transfusions (GTX) in neutropenic paediatric patients with sepsis was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Granulocytes were collected from unrelated, ABO group-matched and cytomegalic-antibody compatible donors. For neutrophil mobilization, donors received a single subcutaneous dose of glycosylated G-CSF (Lenograstim, Chugai Pharma, Japan) plus oral dexamethasone (8 mg). In total, 168 (range 1–19 per patient) GTX were transfused in 32 children with a median age of 7.4 (0.25 to 16) years. RESULTS: The underlying diseases comprised predominantly haematooncological malignancies (31 children). In 15 of 32 patients, neutropenia was related to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All children suffered from sepsis based on international criteria (fever, tachycardia, respiratory rate >2 SD above normal in the context of a suspected or proven infection). In ten children bacteria were isolated, in six children a fungal infection was diagnosed and four sepsis episodes were caused by viral infections. GTX contained a median neutrophil number of 6.3 (range 1.9–13.9)×10(10) per transfusion and obtained a sustained haematological response after GTX. Nineteen out of 32 children survived the neutropenic sepsis, particularly nine out of 11 patients with bacterial sepsis. DISCUSSION: In contrast to the non-survivors, we observed a significant decrease in the C-reactive protein levels shortly after initiation of the GTX treatment in the surviving patients. A clear-cut benefit of GTX for children with neutropenic sepsis cannot be concluded from these data, but in children with (severe) bacterial sepsis refractory to antibiotic treatment, GTX were feasible, safe and could reduce mortality rates in this subgroup of patients.","Grigull, Lorenz; Pulver, Nicole; Goudeva, Lilia; Sykora, Karl-Walter; Linderkamp, Christin; Beilken, Andreas; Seidemann, Kathrin; Schmid, Hansjörg; Welte, Karl; Heuft, Hans-Gert",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102011/,191

7223,Human Bocavirus in Children Hospitalized for Acute Gastroenteritis: A Case-Control Study,2008-07-15,"BACKGROUND: The use of oral ribavirin (RBV) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections is not well studied. With the drastic increase in the cost of aerosolized RBV, we aimed to compare outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients treated with oral or aerosolized RBV for RSV infections. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 124 HCT recipients with RSV infections treated with oral or aerosolized RBV from September 2014 through April 2017. An immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) was used to classify patients as low, moderate, or high risk for progression to lower respiratory infection (LRI) or death. RESULTS: Seventy patients (56%) received aerosolized RBV and 54 (44%) oral RBV. Both groups had a 27% rate of progression to LRI (P = 1.00). Mortality rates did not significantly differ between groups (30-day: aerosolized 10%, oral 9%, P = 1.00; 90-day: aerosolized 23%, oral 11%, P = .10). Classification and regression tree analysis identified ISI ≥7 as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality. For patients with ISI ≥7, 30-day mortality was significantly increased overall, yet remained similar between the aerosolized and oral therapy groups (33% for both). After propensity score adjustment, Cox proportional hazards models showed similar mortality rates between oral and aerosolized therapy groups (30-day: hazard ratio [HR], 1.12 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .345–3.65, P = .845). CONCLUSIONS: HCT recipients with RSV infections had similar outcomes when treated with aerosolized or oral RBV. Oral ribavirin may be an effective alternative to aerosolized RBV, with potential significant cost savings.","Foolad, Farnaz; Aitken, Samuel L; Shigle, Terri Lynn; Prayag, Amrita; Ghantoji, Shashank; Ariza-Heredia, Ella; Chemaly, Roy F",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108094/,191

In the present study, we investigated both the role of α4 integrin and the therapeutic effect of HCA3551, a newly synthesized orally active small-molecule α4 integrin antagonist, in the development of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). The mRNA levels of α4 integrins were significantly up-regulated in the CNS of mice with TMEV-IDD as compared with naïve mice (*p<0.05). HCA3551 treatment in the effector phase significantly suppressed both the clinical and histological development of TMEV-IDD. The number of infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells in the CNS was significantly decreased in the mice treated with HCA3551 (**p<0.01). The labeling indices for CD68 antigen and the absolute cell numbers of TNF-α-producing CD4(+) T cells and IFN-γ-producing CD8(+) T cells were significantly decreased in the CNS of mice treated with HCA3551 (*p<0.05). HCA3551 treatment in the effector phase might inhibit the binding of α4 integrin to VCAM-1, thereby decreasing the number of MNCs in the CNS.","Hirano, Yuta; Kobayashi, Kunitoshi; Tomiki, Hiroki; Inaba, Yuhji; Ichikawa, Motoki; Kim, Byung S.; Koh, Chang-Sung",Int Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108629/,191

Here, we first review the state-of-the-art, computational methods used for prediction of novel virus–host interactions for infectious diseases followed by a case study on EBOV–human interactions. The assessment result shows that the predicted human host proteins are highly similar with known human interaction partners of EBOV in the context of structure and semantics and are responsible for similar biochemical activities, pathways and host–pathogen relationships.","Halder, Anup Kumar; Dutta, Pritha; Kundu, Mahantapas; Basu, Subhadip; Nasipuri, Mita",Brief Funct Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109800/,191

10208,New insights into pediatric community‐acquired pneumonia gained from untargeted metabolomics: A preliminary study,2019-12-10,"Tight junctions are intercellular junctions adjacent to the apical ends of paracellular spaces. They have two classical functions, the barrier function and the fence function. The former regulates the passage of ions, water and various molecules through paracellular spaces, and is thus related to edema, jaundice, diarrhea and blood‐borne metastasis. The latter function maintains cell polarity by forming a fence to prevent intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane with those in the lateral membrane. This function is deeply involved in cancer cell properties in terms of loss of cell polarity. Recently, two novel aspects of tight junctions have been reported. One is their involvement in signal transduction. The other is that fact that tight junctions are considered to be a crucial component of innate immunity. In addition, since some proteins comprising tight junctions work as receptors for viruses and extracellular stimuli, pathogenic bacteria and viruses target and affect the tight junction functions, leading to diseases. In this review, the relationship between tight junctions and human diseases will be described.","Sawada, Norimasa",Pathol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168075/,191

To this end, the synthetic gene encoding the V antigen was subcloned into the downstream of the intein (INT) and chitin-binding domain (CBD) from the pTXB1 vector using specific primers. In the following, the produced new plasmid, pTX-V, was transformed into E. coli ER(2566) strain, and the expression accuracy was confirmed using electrophoresis and Western blotting. In addition, the effects of medium, inducer, and temperature on the enhancement of protein production were studied using the Taguchi method. Finally, the V antigen was purified by a chitin affinity column using INT and CBD tag. The expression was induced by 0.05 mM IPTG at 25 °C under optimal conditions including TB medium. It was observed that the expression of the V-INT–CBD fusion protein was successfully increased to more than 40% of the total protein. The purity of V antigen was as high as 90%. This result indicates that V antigen can be produced at low cost and subjected to one-step purification using a self-cleaving INT tag.","Hosseini, Elahe Seyed; Zeinoddini, Mehdi; Saeedinia, Ali Reza; Babaeipour, Valiollah",Mol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222043/,191

Social relationships may moderate the impact of discrimination and represent modifiable behaviors that can be targeted by public health interventions. We described citywide associations between self-reported racial discrimination and health-related quality of life among the overall New York City (NYC) adult residential population and by four main race/ethnicity groups and explored whether social relationships moderated health effects of discrimination. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 2335 adults weighted to be representative of the NYC population. We measured exposures to lifetime interpersonal racial discrimination in nine domains using a modified version of the Experiences of Discrimination scale. We performed unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses on four self-rated health-related quality of life outcomes including general health, physical health, mental health, and limitations from physical or mental health. RESULTS: Overall, 47% [95% CI 44.5, 50.3] of respondents reported having experienced racial discrimination in at least one domain. In the overall population, significant associations with racial discrimination were noted in adjusted models for poor physical health, poor mental health, and limitations by poor physical and mental health. Among those exposed to racial discrimination, the risk of experiencing poor mental health was lower among those who had contact with family or friends outside their household at least once a week, compared with those who had less frequent social contact. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that social relationships may moderate the impact of racial discrimination on mental health and should be integrated into health promotion efforts.","Bergeron, Genevieve; Lundy De La Cruz, Nneka; Gould, L.

12531,Current Concepts in Community and Ventilator Associated Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in ICU Patients,2020-07-05,"Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits(1), but it remains challenging to distinguish variants that affect regulatory function(2). Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin(3–6). However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence(6). Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor–DNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions(1,7) is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation.","Vierstra, Jeff; Lazar, John; Sandstrom, Richard; Halow, Jessica; Lee, Kristen; Bates, Daniel; Diegel, Morgan; Dunn, Douglas; Neri, Fidencio; Haugen, Eric; Rynes, Eric; Reynolds, Alex; Nelson, Jemma; Johnson, Audra; Frerker, Mark; Buckley, Michael; Kaul, Rajinder; Meuleman, Wouter; Stamatoyannopoulos, John A.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7410829/,191

However, its comprehensive bioactive compound(s) and mechanism(s) against type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have not been exposed. Hence, we implemented network pharmacology to identify its key compounds and mechanism(s) against T2DM. METHODS: Compounds in SB were explored through GC-MS and screened by Lipinski’s rule. Genes associated with the selected compounds or T2DM were extracted from public databases, and the overlapping genes between SB-compound related genes and T2DM target genes were identified using Venn diagram. Then, the networking between selected compounds and overlapping genes was constructed, visualized, and analyzed by RStudio. Finally, affinity between compounds and genes was evaluated via molecular docking. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis of SB detected a total of 20 compounds which were accepted by the Lipinski’s rule. A total number of 16 compounds-related genes and T2DM-related genes (4,763) were identified, and 81 overlapping genes between them were selected. Gene set enrichment analysis exhibited that the mechanisms of SB against T2DM were associated with 12 signaling pathways, and the key mechanism might be to control blood glucose level by activating PPAR signaling pathway. Furthermore, the highest affinities were noted between four main compounds and six genes (FABP3-Propyleneglyco monoleate, FABP4-25-Oxo-27-norcholesterol, NR1H3-Campesterol, PPARA-β-sitosterol, PPARD-β-sitosterol, and PPARG-β-sitosterol). CONCLUSION: Our study overall suggests that the four key compounds detected in SB might ameliorate T2DM severity by activating the PPAR signaling pathway.","Oh, Ki Kwang; Adnan, Md.; Cho, Dong Ha",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7774932/,191

Our review aimed to summarize the current economic evidence and understand the costs and cost-effectiveness of systematic screening approaches among high-risk groups and settings. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on economic evaluations of screening for TB disease targeting persons with clinical and/or structural risk factors, such as persons living with HIV (PLHIV) or persons experiencing homelessness. We searched three databases for studies published between January 1, 2010 and February 1, 2020. Studies were included if they reported cost and a key outcome measure. Owing to considerable heterogeneity in settings and type of screening strategy, we synthesized data descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 27 articles were included in our review; 19/27 (70%) took place in high TB burden countries. Seventeen studies took place among persons with clinical risk factors, including 14 among PLHIV, while 13 studies were among persons with structural risk factors. Nine studies reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from US$51 to $1980 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Screening was most cost-effective among PLHIV. Among persons with clinical and structural risk factors there was limited evidence, but screening was generally not shown to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Studies showed that screening is most likely to be cost-effective in a high TB prevalence population. Our review highlights that to reach the “missing millions” TB programmes should focus on simple, cheaper initial screening tools (i.e., symptom screen and CXR) followed by molecular diagnostic tools (i.e., Xpert®) among the highest risk groups in the local setting (i.e., PLHIV, urban slums). Programmatic costs greatly impact cost-effectiveness thus future research should provide both fixed and variable costs of screening interventions to improve comparability.

This study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of new instruments in the Arabic language that measure patient satisfaction with all types of removable dentures. METHODS: A three-step methodology was used to translate and test the instruments. In step one, the instruments were translated from tested German instruments to develop the pilot questionnaires. In step two, the face validity of the pilot questionnaires was tested through three rounds of interviews. There were 15, 13, and 15 participants per round, respectively. At the end of every round, the results of the interviews were discussed with an expert panel. The expert panel confirmed the form and the type of questionnaires’ adjustments before a new round of interviews began. At the end of step two, the final form of the questionnaires was reached. In step three, 235 questionnaires were distributed to 133 participants to estimate the construct validity of the upper jaw and the lower jaw questionnaires. After one week, the participants were asked to complete the questionnaires again. A total of 102 questionnaires were returned and used to assess the instruments’ reliability. Factor analysis was used to assess the construct validity. The intraclass correlation coefficient and Cronbach’s alpha were used to estimate the reliability and suitability of the items in the indexes. RESULTS: The result of step one was two pilot questionnaires. The pilot questionnaires were adjusted in step two. At the end of step two, the questionnaires proved to have good face validity. Factor analyses in step three revealed that only one factor could be retained. The one-factor model explained 60.95% and 63.06 of the total variance of the upper jaw and lower jaw questionnaires, respectively. The items in every questionnaire shared the same cluster and could be summed to form an upper jaw index and lower jaw index that reflected patient satisfaction with removable dentures. Cronbach’s alpha values indicated excellent internal consistency and reliability for the upper jaw questionnaire (α = 0.91) and the lower jaw questionnaire (α = 0.92). Intraclass correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.72 to 0.95, which can be considered “moderate” to “excellent”. CONCLUSIONS: The Arabic version of questionnaires and indexes assessing patient satisfaction with upper and lower removable dentures are reliable and valid self-administered instruments.

21566,Clinical Outcome of Guillain-Barré Syndrome in 108 Children,2021-01-28,"An increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) controls virtually all endothelial cell functions and is, therefore, crucial to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. An aberrant elevation in endothelial can indeed lead to severe cardiovascular disorders. Likewise, moderate amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce intracellular Ca(2+) signals to regulate vascular functions, while excessive ROS production may exploit dysregulated Ca(2+) dynamics to induce endothelial injury. Herein, we survey how ROS induce endothelial Ca(2+) signals to regulate vascular functions and, vice versa, how aberrant ROS generation may exploit the Ca(2+) handling machinery to promote endothelial dysfunction. ROS elicit endothelial Ca(2+) signals by regulating inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2B, two-pore channels, store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), and multiple isoforms of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. ROS-induced endothelial Ca(2+) signals regulate endothelial permeability, angiogenesis, and generation of vasorelaxing mediators and can be exploited to induce therapeutic angiogenesis, rescue neurovascular coupling, and induce cancer regression. However, an increase in endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) induced by aberrant ROS formation may result in endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, and pulmonary artery hypertension. This information could pave the way to design alternative treatments to interfere with the life-threatening interconnection between endothelial ROS and Ca(2+) signaling under multiple pathological conditions.","Negri, Sharon; Faris, Pawan; Moccia, Francesco",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465413/,191

The recent attempts at creating digital currencies, famously known as cryptocurrencies, and their corresponding platform blockchain were some of these. How and why did they emerge? What do their inventions imply for our future? And why are they important? Sharing economy and memberships (as opposed to ownerships) are other examples of profound changes. Increasing use of shared goods, services like Uber and Airbnb, and the unstoppable trend of membership services like e-newspapers, e-libraries, and music streaming points to one conclusion: the end of the idea of ownership. On the governmental side, we have been observing an increasing inclination toward authoritarian states. Liberalism seems to have failed. People have been losing their trust in economic regimes.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of mannan‐binding lectin (MBL), an initiator of the lectin pathway of complement, in asthma and allergic rhinitis. MBL levels and MBL‐induced complement activity were determined in 19 patients of bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis and 20 unrelated, age‐matched controls of Indian origin. MBL levels and activity were correlated with percent eosinophilia and percent predicted FEV1 values of the patients. Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1 and intron 1 of the MBL with the disease, clinical markers, MBL levels and MBL‐induced complement activity was analysed using standard statistical tools. Significantly higher MBL levels and activity were observed in patients of bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis as compared to the controls. We identified five SNPs, of which two, A816G in exon 1 and G1011A in intron 1 of the MBL, were novel. SNP G1011A was significantly associated with the disease (P = 0.0024, OR = 5.8696, 95% CI: 1.7316 < OR < 19.8963). Individuals with ‘A’ allele at position 1011 showed increased MBL levels, activity and disease severity. Our results suggest that ‘A’ allele at position 1011 leading to high MBL levels and complement activity may be contributing to the severity of bronchial asthma and allergic airway inflammation.","Sukhija, S.; Gupta, V.

39826,ASTCT Notes,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment (CM) is a major public health problem, affecting many lives, in the short and long term, and costing individuals, families, and society dearly. There is a need for broad implementation of evidence-based preventive interventions, such as the Safe Environment for Every Kid (SEEK) model, developed for pediatric primary care. Primary care offers an excellent opportunity to help address prevalent psychosocial problems (e.g., parental depression) that are risk factors for CM. By addressing such problems, SEEK can strengthen families and support parents; promote children’s health, development, and safety; help prevent CM; and benefit the health of the US population. This study will examine intervention strategies for optimizing SEEK’s adoption, implementation, and sustainment, and its effectiveness in preventing CM. Despite strong evidence from two federally funded randomized controlled trials, SEEK has not been widely adopted. The goal of this study is to examine technology-driven implementation strategies to scale-up SEEK—in pediatric and family medicine primary care settings. The aims are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of training strategies on SEEK’s implementation in primary care practices, (2) evaluate barriers and facilitators to successful implementation and sustainment of SEEK, and (3) examine the model’s effectiveness in preventing CM and the economic costs of implementing SEEK. METHODS: This randomized type III hybrid mixed methods design will examine how advances in medical training can bolster SEEK’s adoption and implementation in pediatric and family medicine practices in different regions of the USA. These are independent online training and in-depth structured training via a quality improvement project, approved by the American Boards of Pediatrics and of Family Medicine. We will also evaluate SEEKonline, software that assists primary care practitioners implement the model, and a “Traditional” paper and pencil strategy for their impact on implementation. The study uses the EPIS framework and the Universal Stages of Implementation Completion, quantitative measures, qualitative interviews, and data abstracted from electronic health records. DISCUSSION: The knowledge gained should improve pediatric primary care to better address prevalent social determinants of health, benefiting many children and families. The outcomes should enhance the field of implementation science and guide future interventions in primary care.

40653,Quality and Specific Concerns of Clinical Guidelines for Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine: A Critical Appraisal,2020-09-26,"BACKGROUND: Parents use the Internet commonly for themselves and to search for information about their children's health. However, health-related information from the web has the potential to trigger anxiety and stress. The understanding of contributing factors for distress during health-related information search processes and which factors could be targeted for prevention is still limited. METHODS: Parents living in Austria with a child between 0 and 6 years were randomly assigned to search the web for current somatic health issues related to self- or child-symptoms. The task was performed on a desktop computer with a timeframe of 15 minutes. The stress level was assessed immediately before and after the search task with the State-Trait Anxiety-Inventory (STAI). Recruitment was terminated early due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic outbreak (sample size prior to COVID-19, N = 53). RESULTS: Multiple linear regression was used to predict parents' stress change during the search task based on health anxiety, attitude towards online health information, eHealth literacy, couple satisfaction and parental burden. Health anxiety, attitude towards online health information and eHealth literacy did not significantly contribute to predict parents' stress change (STAI state anxiety change), however couple satisfaction (β = -.393, t = -2.46, p = .018) and parental burden (β = -.388, t = -2.30, p = .026) did. Higher parents' baseline level of stress immediately before the search task was only associated with higher levels of parental burden (β = .882, t = 4.00, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate the importance of the relational level, rather than the individual level, in understanding stress during online health information seeking among parents. Future research should incorporate relational variables like parental burden and couple satisfaction into theoretical models and test their influence on online health distress in larger samples. KEY MESSAGES: Family and relational variables should be considered in future research investigating distress during online health information seeking for oneself or by proxy. Fostering parents' couple satisfaction and reducing parental burden may can contribute to lower stress levels after symptom-related online searches.","Kubb, C; Foran, H",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543442/,191

Given the limited research on the topic, this paper aims to identify determinants of consumers’ attitudes and re-purchase intentions toward DTC brands. The initial qualitative phase of in-depth interviews with frequent DTC shoppers, resulted in the identification of eight determinants. The subsequent quantitative analysis with 210 US DTC shoppers confirmed that co-creation, cost-effectiveness, website attractiveness, brand uniqueness, social media engagement, and innovativeness of DTC brands significantly influence consumers’ attitudes while cost-effectiveness (indirectly), brand uniqueness, social media engagement, and brand innovativeness affect consumers re-purchase intentions.

51056,Building the Timeline,2020-10-25,"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary and multisectoral approaches such as One Health and related concepts (e.g., Planetary Health, EcoHealth) offer opportunities for synergistic expertise to address complex health threats. The connections between humans, animals, and the environment necessitate collaboration among sectors to comprehensively understand and reduce risks and consequences on health and wellbeing. One Health approaches are increasingly emphasized for national and international plans and strategies related to zoonotic diseases, food safety, antimicrobial resistance, and climate change, but to date, the possible applications in clinical practice and benefits impacting human health are largely missing. METHODS: In 2018 the “Application of the One Health Approach to Global Health Centers” conference held at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine convened experts involved in One Health policy and practice. The conference examined issues relevant to One Health approaches, sharing examples of challenges and successes to guide application to medical school curricula and clinical practice for human health. This paper presents a synthesis of conference proceedings, framed around objectives identified from presentations and audience feedback. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The following objectives provide opportunities for One Health involvement and benefits for medical schools and global health centers by: 1) Improving One Health resource sharing in global health and medical education; 2) Creating pathways for information flow in clinical medicine and global health practice; 3) Developing innovative partnerships for improved health sector outcomes; and 4) Informing and empowering health through public outreach. These objectives can leverage existing resources to deliver value to additional settings and stakeholders through resource efficiency, more holistic and effective service delivery, and greater ability to manage determinants of poor health status. We encourage medical and global health educators, practitioners, and students to explore entry points where One Health can add value to their work from local to global scale.","Machalaba, Catherine; Raufman, Jill; Anyamba, Assaf; Berrian, Amanda M.; Berthe, Franck C.

58019,The Efficiency of AuNPs in Cancer Cell Targeting Compared to Other Nanomedicine Technologies Using Fuzzy PROMETHEE,2021-09-15,"Coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19) has stimulated urgent innovative responses to tackle the current crisis and unveil new trajectories enabling recovery as early as possible. In the quest for solutions to the pandemic, organizations have been forced to join efforts with an unprecedented number of different stakeholders, including competitors, rising new appropriation‐related challenges. To ease these issues and facilitate collaborative efforts, some initiatives have come into being to encourage the release of Intellectual Property (IP) rights to unlock new possibilities from their use and possibly foster the collective innovation process. The Open COVID Pledge (OCP) stands out as the most visible project that has gained momentum at the international level, as it has increasingly involved well‐known top‐patenting companies, willing to publicly commit to making their IP relevant to COVID‐19 freely available. Drawing from all the available information (the World Wide Web, the participating companies' press releases and official websites, and the documents of pledged patents), we propose a research design, applying a semantic method to allow an augmented understanding of the main characteristics of this pledge. Our findings point out that the OCP has got a great media resonance on the overall web, also thanks to the commitment of large top‐patenting pledgors; results also show that while the official communications of the participant companies resemble very much the general OCP Manifesto of providing free access to their patent portfolio, the semantic analysis of the pledged patents unveils details on available technologies that mostly refer to the real‐time search and analysis of information and devices for the detection of the diffusion of the virus. Overall, this analysis contributes to providing contextual information on the available IP, towards the desired direction of putting the pledge to work and have an impact on follow‐on innovation, which represents the underlying rationale of the initiative in the fight against COVID‐19.","Antonelli, Ginevra Assia; Leone, Maria Isabella; Ricci, Riccardo",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8447075/,191

METHODS HALO CM was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with CM. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with fremanezumab quarterly (675 mg at baseline, placebo at weeks 4 and 8), fremanezumab monthly (225 mg at baseline, weeks 4 and 8), or placebo. This manuscript assessed the effect of treatment with fremanezumab on health-related quality of life and productivity using the following prespecified assessments: the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQoL) questionnaire at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire at weeks 4, 8, 12; EuroQoL 5-dimension, 5-response level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) questionnaire at baseline and week 12. RESULTS The full analysis set included 1121 patients: 375 patients with quarterly dosing, 375 with monthly dosing, and 371 with placebo. Fremanezumab quarterly and monthly was associated with significant improvements over placebo in change from baseline mean scores in MSQoL domains (all, p < 0.05) to week 12. At week 12, fremanezumab also showed significant improvements in EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale (p < 0.05) and PGIC scores (p < 0.0001); as well as significant reductions from baseline in WPAI:GH scores (p < 0.01) and presenteeism (impairment while working; p < 0.05) vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS Fremanezumab quarterly or monthly was associated with improvement over placebo in migraine-specific quality of life, overall health status, patients' global impression of change with treatment, and productivity in patients with CM.","Lipton, Richard B; Cohen, Joshua M; Gandhi, Sanjay K; Yang, Ronghua; Yeung, Paul P; Buse, Dawn C",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747522/,191

The negative outcomes can be further amplified if the incident occurred during a pandemic surge, such as what occurred in Beirut, Lebanon with the August 4, 2020 Beirut Port explosion. To decrease the mortality and morbidity and avoid inefficiency, management depends on having an established coordinated multidisciplinary approach from transport and triage to emergency department care and in-hospital management.

60072,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and the kidney.,2016,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically changed the routine way of life and challenged the ways in which health and dental services are provided. During the 1st lockdown, practiced in most of the countries, routine dental procedures were suspended. Even after the lockdown was eased, visiting crowded dental clinics was still considered health-threatening, especially among populations at high risk of developing a severe reaction to COVID-19. Regretfully, in most cases, temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and bruxism were not included under the definition of emergency, leaving many patients without the possibility of consulting their dentists. A literature search, performed about 10 months after the declaration of the pandemic, found only a few studies dealing with TMD and bruxism during COVID-19. Most of the studies indicate adverse effects on subjects' psycho-emotional status (stress, anxiety, depression), which in turn lead to the intensification of subjects' TMD and bruxism symptoms, and increased orofacial pain. Unlike other oral pathologies, which require manual interventions, chronic orofacial pain can be addressed, at least at its initial stage, through teledentistry and/or consultation. Remote first aid for patients suffering from orofacial pain includes various kinds of treatment, such as the self-massage of tense and painful areas, stretching, thermotherapy, drug therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which can be administered through the phone and/or the Internet. Relevant legal and ethical issues should be considered while using remote modes for the triage, diagnosis and treatment of chronic orofacial pain patients.","Alona, Alona Emodi-Perlman; Eli, Ilana",Dental and medical problems,https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/132896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974750/,191

Due to the lack of broad-spectrum antibiotics, it is urgent to develop nonantibiotic strategies to fight bacteria. Herein, inspired by the localized ""capture and killing"" action of bacteriophages, a virus-like peroxidase-mimic (V-POD-M) is synthesized for efficient bacterial capture (mesoporous spiky structures) and synergistic catalytic sterilization (metal-organic-framework-derived catalytic core). Experimental and theoretical calculations show that the active compound, MoO3 , can serve as a peroxo-complex-intermediate to reduce the free energy for catalyzing H2 O2 , which mainly benefits the generation of •OH radicals. The unique virus-like spikes endow the V-POD-M with fast bacterial capture and killing abilities (nearly 100% at 16 µg mL-1 ). Furthermore, the in vivo experiments show that V-POD-M possesses similar disinfection treatment and wound skin recovery efficiencies to vancomycin. It is suggested that this inexpensive, durable, and highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalytic active V-POD-M provides a promising broad-spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.","Yang, Ye; Wu, Xizheng; Ma, Lang; He, Chao; Cao, Sujiao; Long, Yanping; Huang, Jianbo; Rodriguez, Raul D; Cheng, Chong; Zhao, Changsheng; Qiu, Li",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202005477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33475193/,191

Generally, antibodies are utilized as the biorecognition molecules in the LFA. However, antibodies selected using an in vivo process not only may risk killing the animal hosts and causing errors between different batches but also their range is restricted by the refrigerated conditions used to store them. To avoid these limitations, aptamers screened by an in vitro process have been studied as biorecognition molecules in LFAs. Based on the sandwich or competitive format, the aptamer-based LFA can accomplish on-site detection of target analytes. Since aptamers have a distinctive ability to undergo conformational changes, the adsorption-desorption format has also been exploited to detect target analytes in aptamer-based LFAs. This paper reviews developments in aptamer-based LFAs in the last three years for the detection of target analytes. Three formats of aptamer-based LFAs, i.e., sandwich, competitive, and adsorption-desorption, are described in detail. Based on these formats, signal amplification strategies and multiplexed detection are discussed in order to provide an overview of aptamer-based LFAs for on-site detection of target analytes. In addition, the potential commercialization and future perspectives of aptamer-based LFAs for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 are given to support the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huang, Lei; Tian, Shulin; Zhao, Wenhao; Liu, Ke; Ma, Xing; Guo, Jinhong",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979718/,191
60601,Viral infections in solid organ transplant recipients: novel updates and a review of the classics.,2017,"Flow-diverting stents have provided a new endovascular capacity to reconstruct an intracranial aneurysm with its diseased parent artery. The results of first-generation flow diversion stents have been encouraging, with even large or giant treated aneurysms achieving complete angiographic occlusion at 12-month follow-up. Numerous clinical reports have described a slow progressive thrombosis pattern and gradual increase in rate of complete aneurysm obliteration over time. Despite promising early results, some complications specific to flow-diverting stents have been encountered. Chief among them is delayed aneurysm rupture. This complication did not emerge with stent-assisted coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms, and the underlying cause has not been established. However, new evidence suggests that persistent, or even increased, aneurysm pressure after stent placement may play a role in some delayed ruptures. We sought to evaluate this phenomenon by measuring intrasaccular pressure before and after stent placement using two different 0.014 inch coronary pressure measurement wires. Two patients with giant internal carotid artery aneurysms treated with flow-diverting stents were evaluated. Before and after stent deployment, intrasaccular aneurysm and systemic arterial pressures were recorded for 60 s and compared. In both cases, intrasaccular pressure measurement with the use of 0.014 inch pressure wire system was feasible; the pressure wires could be pushed out of the microcatheter placed in the aneurysms without friction or unexpected microcatheter motion. Despite successful flow-diverting stent deployment and angiographic flow diversion effects with excellent wall opposition across the aneurysm necks, there was no significant difference between intrasaccular and systemic pressures.","Tateshima, Satoshi; Jones, Jesse G; Mayor Basto, Fernando; Vinuela, Fernando; Duckwiler, Gary R",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871764/,191

This was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited exposure to patients for clinical teaching. METHODS We conducted a proof-of-concept study at a London teaching hospital using mixed reality (MR) technology (HoloLens2™) to deliver a remote access teaching ward round. RESULTS Students unanimously agreed that use of this technology was enjoyable and provided teaching that was otherwise inaccessible. The majority of participants gave positive feedback on the MR (holographic) content used (n = 8 out of 11) and agreed they could interact with and have their questions answered by the clinician leading the ward round (n = 9). Quantitative and free text feedback from students, patients and faculty members demonstrated that this is a feasible, acceptable and effective method for delivery of clinical education. DISCUSSION We have used this technology in a novel way to transform the delivery of medical education and enable consistent access to high-quality teaching. This can now be integrated across the curriculum and will include remote access to specialist clinics and surgery. A library of bespoke MR educational resources will be created for future generations of medical students and doctors to use on an international scale.","Bala, Laksha; Kinross, James; Martin, Guy; Koizia, Louis J; Kooner, Angad S; Shimshon, Gideon J; Hurkxkens, Thomas J; Pratt, Philip J; Sam, Amir H",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786988/,191

68636,New concepts in pediatric rhinitis.,2021-01-21,"Despite the availability of several antiemetics, clinical findings show that control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) continues to be a serious concern for hematological patients, mainly for those receiving multiple-day (MD) and high-dose (HD) chemotherapy (CT). For CINV prophylaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3-RAs) and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RAs) are usually administered together with dexamethasone, which may increase the risk of serious infections in patients undergoing myeloablative treatment. The rationale of this multicenter, open-label and phase IIa study was to explore the efficacy of multiple doses of NEPA (netupitant/palonosetron) given as an every-other-day regimen without dexamethasone in preventing CINV in patients with relapsed-refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R-NHL), eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and treated with MD-HD-CT. Seventy patients participated to the study. According to the adopted Fleming one-stage design, the primary endpoint of this study was achieved. The CR values were 87.1% (primary endpoint, overall phase: days 1-8), 88.6% (acute phase: days 1-6), and 98.6% (delayed phase: days 7-8), while complete control (CR with no more than mild nausea) was 85.7% (overall phase), 88.6% (acute phase), and 95.7% (delayed phase). Moderate and severe episodes of nausea were reported by less than 10% of patients in the overall phase and less than 5% in both the acute and delayed phases. Regarding safety, NEPA was well tolerated with only one adverse event (constipation) evaluated as possibly related to NEPA administration. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that multiple alternate dosing of NEPA without the addition of dexamethasone is highly effective for preventing nausea and vomiting in this difficult setting, with a good tolerability profile.","Di Renzo, Nicola; Musso, Maurizio; Scimè, Rosanna; Cupri, Alessandra; Perrone, Tommasina; De Risi, Clara; Pastore, Domenico; Guarini, Attilio; Mengarelli, Andrea; Benedetti, Fabio; Mazza, Patrizio; Capria, Vera; Chiusolo, Patrizia; Cupelli, Luca; Federico, Vincenzo; Bozzoli, Valentina; Messa, Anna Rita; Codega, Paolo; Bonizzoni, Erminio; Specchia, Giorgina",Bone marrow transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-020-0909-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346078/,191

We analysed cardiological parameters including ECG and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) level and their association with mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the demographics, comorbidities, laboratory findings and electrocardiographic parameters of 453 consecutive patients, whose outcome was clear, died or discharged. Findings were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Also, the same comparison was made between cardiac injury and no-cardiac injury subgroups. RESULTS The cardiac injury group had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than the no-cardiac injury group. Also, frequencies of atrial fibrillation, axis change, ST-segment/T-wave change, fragmented QRS, premature atrial/ventricular contraction was found to be higher in the cardiac injury group. Moreover, non-survivors had longer QRS intervals, more frequent ST-segment/T-wave changes and isolated S1Q3T3 pattern than surviving patients. Laboratory results showed median values of hs-TnT at the admission of 4.95 ng/L (IQR, 3-12.35) with concentrations markedly higher in the non-surviving patients vs survivors. Hs-TnT value along with age and respiratory rate was found to be an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities were more frequently reported in non-surviving and cardiac injury groups than those surviving and without cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS In COVID-19 patients, both elevated hs-TnT and ECG abnormalities, suggesting cardiac involvement, on admission portends an ominous prognosis and indicates at higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Prioritised treatment and more aggressive therapeutic strategies could be planned to avoid the occurrence of death in these patients.","Omar, Timor; Karakayalı, Muammer; Perincek, Gökhan",Acta cardiologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015385.2021.1903704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823754/,191

Any potential drug formulation has to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and specific to metastatic brain tumors without causing unacceptable adverse effects. Here, we developed transferrin-functionalized chimeric polymersomes carrying siRNA against polo-like kinase 1 (Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1) for treating brain metastatic MDA-MB 231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts in mice. To facilitate the loading of siPLK1, chimaeric polymersomes (CPs) were designed with spermine in the watery core and transferrin-binding peptide (TBP) at the surface, enabling attachment of transferrin after the siRNA loading step and thereby circumventing interference of transferrin with siRNA loading. Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1 encapsulating 3.8 wt% siRNA had a mean size of about 50 nm and a neutral zeta potential in phosphate buffer (PB). By virtue of the presence of transferrin, Tf@TBP-CPs demonstrated greatly (ca. 5-fold) enhanced internalization in MDA-MB 231 cells and transcytosis in the endothelial (bEnd.3) monolayer model in vitro as well as markedly improved accumulation in the orthotopically xenografted MDA-MB 231 tumor in the brain in vivo compared with control CPs lacking transferrin, supporting that transferrin mediates efficient BBB penetration and high specificity towards MDA-MB 231 cells. As a result, Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1 effectively inhibited tumor progression and prolonged the lifespan of the mice significantly. Selective transferrin coating appears to be a particularly facile strategy to fabricate BBB-permeable and targeted vesicles for potent RNAi therapy of brain metastatic breast cancer.","Wei, Yaohua; Sun, Yinping; Wei, Jingjing; Qiu, Xinyun; Meng, Fenghua; Storm, Gert; Zhong, Zhiyuan",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.07.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352315/,191

Stent tips can be visualized because they have radiopaque markers. Concerns regarding stent tip misplacement include risks of artery perforation and occlusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of ICA branches with embedded stent tips. MATERIALS AND METHODS ICA branches with embedded stent tips were identified among 35 patients with unruptured ICA aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling between November 2003 and November 2014. Patient clinical and angiographic outcomes associated with the embedded stent tip were analyzed. RESULTS Most of the 35 studied aneurysms were paraclinoid ICA aneurysms (n = 30). The most commonly involved ICA branch was the posterior communicating artery (26 patients, 74.3%), followed by the anterior choroidal artery (8 patients, 22.9%) and ophthalmic artery (1 patient, 2.9%). During the follow-up period (38.6 ± 17.9 months), no new neurologic deficits developed. Neither hemorrhagic nor thromboembolic events occurred. Angiography was performed during the final follow-up evaluation at a mean of 32.7 ± 18.0 months, and all ICA branches with embedded stent tips showed patent blood flow without severe luminal narrowing. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, placement of a stent tip into ICA branches during stent-assisted coiling was not associated with any major adverse events.","Ban, S P; Kwon, O-K; Lee, S U; Bang, J S; Oh, C W; Jeong, H J; Cho, M J; Jeong, E-A; Kim, T",AJNR.

The best approach to assess patient prognosis relies on prediction models that simultaneously consider a number of prognostic factors and provide an estimate of patients' absolute risk of an event. Such prediction models should be characterized by adequately discriminating between patients who will have an event and those who will not and by adequate calibration ensuring accurate prediction of absolute risk. This Users' Guide will help clinicians understand the available metrics for assessing discrimination, calibration, and the relative performance of different prediction models. This article complements existing Users' Guides that address the development and validation of prediction models.

According to the theory of TCM, they are categorized as a blood-cooling and hematostatic herb. In clinical practice, they were usually prescribed with heat-clearing herbs to reinforce the efficacy of hemostasis. The review provides the up-to-date information from 1980 to present that is available on the botany, processing research, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of the leaves. The information is collected from scientific journals, books, theses and reports via library and electronic search (Google Scholar, Pubmed and CNKI). Through literature reports, we can find that the leaves show a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, disinsection, anticancer, diuretic, hair growth-promoting, neuroprotective and antifibrotic activities. Diterpene and flavonoids would be active constituents in P. orientalis leaves. Many studies have provided evidence for various traditional uses. However, there is a great need for additional studies to elucidate the mechanism of blood-cooling and hematostatic activity of the leaves. Therefore, the present review on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry and toxicity has provided preliminary information for further studies of this herb.","Shan, Ming-Qiu; Shang, Jing; Ding, An-Wei",The American journal of Chinese medicine,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0192415x14500347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871649/,191
74767,"Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards Zika virus among healthcare workers in St. Kitts.",2021-03-05,"During the perioperative period, nociception control is certainly one of the anesthesiologist's main objectives when assuming care of a patient. There exists some literature demonstrating that the nociceptive stimuli experienced during surgery are responsible for peripheral and central sensitization phenomena, which can in turn lead to persistent postsurgical pain. An individualized approach to the evaluation and treatment of perioperative nociception is beneficial in order to avoid the sensitization phenomena that leads to prolonged postoperative pain and to minimize the consumption of opiates and their adverse effects. In terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values when compared to heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), recent literature has shown that the NOL variation (ΔNOL) is the best index to distinguish noxious from non-noxious stimuli. Chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists may constitute a limitation to the use of the NOL index. β1-adrenergic antagonists induce a depressive action on the heart rate, which results in a limitation of its variability after a noxious stimulus. Since heart rate and heart rate variability are two parameters integrated into the NOL index, the validity of the NOL index in a population of patients receiving β1-adrenergic antagonists has not yet been determined. Our study sought to explore the NOL index, the BIS, and the heart rate variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia. We then compared those results to a control group of patients from our previous study (CJA group) that received no β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic treatment. The patients in this study were subjected to a standardized anesthetic protocol from induction up to 3 min after a standardized tetanic stimulus to the ulnar nerve at a frequency of 100 Hz and an amperage of 70 mA, for a duration of 30 s. Data were electronically recorded to obtain NOL, BIS, and heart rate values every 5 s for the duration of the protocol. The NOL maximal mean value reached after noxious stimulation was not different between our two cohorts (CJA: 30(14) versus BETANOL: 36(14) (p = 0.12)). There was no statistically significant difference between our cohorts in regards of the NOL AUC representing the variation of the NOL over a 180 s period (CJA: 595(356) versus BETANOL: 634(301) (p = 0.30)). However, a repeated measurement ANCOVA identified slight statistically significant differences between our cohorts in the peak of variation of the NOL index between 20 and 65 s after noxious stimulation, the NOL index of the cohort of beta-blocked patients being higher than the CJA patients. Moreover, the time to reach the maximum value was not different (CJA: 73(37) versus BETANOL: 63(41) (p = 0.35)). NOL sensitivity and specificity to detect a noxious stimulus under general anesthesia were similar in patients taking beta-blockers or not, and were better than those of heart rate and Bispectral index (AUC NOL 0.97, CI(0.92-1), versus AUC BIS 0.78, CI(0.64-0.89) and AUC HR 0.66, CI(0.5-0.8)). In conclusion, the NOL index is a reliable monitor to assess nociception in a population of patients under chronic beta-blocker therapy. Patients under such therapy achieve similar maximal NOL values over a 180 s period after a standardized noxious stimulus and the NOL variation over time, represented by the AUC is not significantly different from a cohort of non-beta-blocked patients. Whether the patient takes beta-blockers or not, sensitivity of the NOL index is greater than that seen for BIS index or heart rate to detect an experimental noxious stimulus under general anesthesia.","Bergeron, Catherine; Brulotte, Véronique; Pelen, Felix; Clairoux, Ariane; Bélanger, Marie-Eve; Issa, Rami; Urbanowicz, Robert; Tanoubi, Issam; Drolet, Pierre; Fortier, Louis-Philippe; Verdonck, Olivier; Fortier, Annik; Espitalier, Fabien; Richebé, Philippe",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-020-00626-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398545/,191

METHODS Eight beagles were divided into an experimental group (five males) and a control group (three females). The experimental group underwent thoracotomy on both the left and right sides of the chest. Both sides received the membrane, and the membrane on one side was glued to the pleura using tissue adhesive. The control group underwent thoracotomy only on the left side. Two weeks postoperatively, all dogs were sacrificed and adhesions were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically.

Effective improvement work can facilitate the necessary changes, but little is known about professionals' experiences of participation in improvement interventions. The aim was to evaluate how preschool staff experience quality improvement work, using the Breakthrough Series Collaborative improvement programme, to enhance outdoor environments. METHODS An improvement intervention using a breakthrough collaborative was performed at 9 preschools in Sweden and examined with a longitudinal mixed method design. Staff completed questionnaires on 4 occasions (n=45 participants) and interviews took place after the intervention (n=16 participants). RESULTS The intervention was successful in the sense that the staff were content with the learning seminars, and they had triggered physical changes in the outdoor environment. They integrated the quality improvement work with their ordinary work and increasingly involved the children. The staff tested improvement tools but did not find them entirely appropriate for their work, because they preferred existing methods for reflection. CONCLUSIONS The challenges in quality improvement work seem to be similar across contexts.

Its use is associated with a significant hemostatic challenge, especially in COVID- 19 patients who have been demonstrated to otherwise present a COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. The systematic use of unfractionated heparin therapy to prevent circuit thrombosis is warranted during ECMO support. The clinical presentation and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a rare but life-threatening complication of heparin therapy, has not been described in those patients yet. We report herein two cases of laboratory-confirmed HIT in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS admitted to our intensive care unit for VV-ECMO support and the successful use of argatroban as an alternative therapy. We also provide a brief literature review of best evidence for managing such patients. The diagnosis and management of HIT is particularly challenging in COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support. An increased awareness is warranted in those patients who already present a procoagulant state leading to higher rates of thrombotic events which can confuse the issues. Argatroban seems to be an appropriate and safe therapeutic option in COVID-19 patients with HIT while on VV-ECMO.","Bidar, Frank; Hékimian, Guillaume; Martin-Toutain, Isabelle; Lebreton, Guillaume; Combes, Alain; Frère, Corinne",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10047-020-01203-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789604/,191

In current study, we sought to estimate the incidence, clinical outcomes, and characteristics of barotrauma among COVID-19 patients receiving invasive and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. METHODOLOGY We conducted this retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and requiring oxygen support or positive airway pressure for ARDS who presented to our tertiary care center from March through November, 2020. RESULTS A total of 353 patients met our inclusion criteria, of which 232patients who required heated high-flow nasal cannula, continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure were assigned to non-invasive group. The remaining 121 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and were assigned to invasive group. Of the 353 patients, 32 patients (65.6% males) with a mean age of 63 ± 11 years developed barotrauma in the form of either subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. The incidence of barotrauma was 4.74% (11/232) and 17.35% (21/121) in non-invasive group and invasive group, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 22 (15.7 -33.0) days with an overall mortality of 62.5% (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 ARDS have a high incidence rate of barotrauma. Pulmonary barotrauma should be considered in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who exhibit worsening of their respiratory disease as it is likely associated with a high mortality risk. Utilizing lung-protective ventilation strategies may reduce the risk of barotrauma.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Spanel, Alan J; McMillan, Sean; Lahan, Shubham; Boer, Brian; Birge, Justin; Thi, Meilinh",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211019719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013825/,191

Our preference is for the anterior intrahepatic approach (AIA) with mass stapling, in order to minimise the risk of inadvertent injury of the left-sided inflow and to preserve as much parenchyma as possible. In this paper, we present our experience over the last 10 years and compare it with results from the EHD technique. METHODS Data for a 10-year period from 2000 to 2010 were extracted retrospectively from a prospectively collected database. Results in each group were measured by a combination of technical and oncological outcomes. Groups were compared by way of descriptive statistics and differences tested for significance by appropriate statistical means. RESULTS 411 right hepatectomies were performed for colorectal metastases. Of these, 242 were by AIA and 169 by EHD. Both groups were well matched in demographic terms and according to disease burden, although more extended resections were performed in the EHD group. Operative duration (433 vs. 350 min), blood loss (420 vs. 348 ml) and incidence of bile leaks (4 vs. 2) were all lower in the AIA group. All other technical and oncological outcomes were equivalent. CONCLUSION The AIA approach provides equivalent morbidity, mortality and oncological outcome to the EHD dissection technique and may confer the benefits of being safer and providing greater scope to preserve hepatic parenchyma.","Habib, Mohammad; Cresswell, A Ben; Chandrakumaran, Kandiah; Welsh, Fenella K S; John, Timothy G; Rees, Myrddin",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000335716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22441615/,191

We conducted an updated meta-analysis of clinical trials and observational studies published till June 2020. Patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) infection were included. The drugs used in the intervention group are Chloroquine (CQ)/Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without Azithromycin. The primary outcome is time to achieve virological cure. Of 1040 citations, 11 studies provided data of 1215 patients. Compared to control, CQ/HCQ has no significant effect on the time to negative COVID-19 RT-PCR results, neither in clinical trials (mean difference [MD] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.7 to 3.79; P = 0.18; n = 180), nor in observational studies (MD 1.14; 95%CI - 11.98 to 14.26; P = 0.86, n = 407). CQ/HCQ did not affect the virological cure after day 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28; except after day 5, as shown by a single small non-randomised trial (odds ratio [OR] 9.33; 95% CI 1.51 to 57.65; P = 0.02, n = 30).

Yet, detailed insights into the experiences of young people and their caregivers of using technology to manage type 1 diabetes mellitus are lacking. OBJECTIVE The objective of our study was to describe the breadth of experiences and perspectives on diabetes technology use among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their caregivers. METHODS This systematic literature review used integrated thematic analysis to guide a narrative synthesis of the included studies. We analyzed the perspectives and experiences of young people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their caregivers reported in qualitative studies, quantitative descriptive studies, and studies with a mixed methods design. RESULTS Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria, and they included studies on insulin pump, glucose sensors, and remote monitoring systems. The following eight themes were derived from the analysis: (1) expectations of the technology prior to use, (2) perceived impact on sleep and overnight experiences, (3) experiences with alarms, (4) impact on independence and relationships, (5) perceived usage impact on blood glucose control, (6) device design and features, (7) financial cost, and (8) user satisfaction. While many advantages of using diabetes technology were reported, several challenges for its use were also reported, such as cost, the size and visibility of devices, and the intrusiveness of alarms, which drew attention to the fact that the user had type 1 diabetes mellitus. Continued use of diabetes technology was underpinned by its benefits outweighing its challenges, especially among younger people. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes technologies have improved the quality of life of many young people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their caregivers.

84673,Psychosocial impact of ocular surface allergic inflammatory disorders.,2021-08-09,"INTRODUCTION The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is attracting much attention as a target for disease-modifying therapies in neurodegenerative diseases. It is a highly conserved protein, present in plasma and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and enriched in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). It modulates ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer and activation of the ER stress pathways. Mitochondrial and MAM dysfunctions contribute to neurodegenerative processes in pathologies including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, the S1R can be activated by small druggable molecules and accumulating preclinical data suggest that S1R agonists are effective protectants in these neurodegenerative diseases. AREA COVERED In this review, the author presents the data showing the high therapeutic potential of S1R drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on pridopidine as a potent and selective S1R agonist under clinical development. Of particular interest is the bi-phasic (bell-shaped) dose-response effect described in numerous preclinical models in vitro, in vivo and in clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION S1R agonists modulate essential inter-organelles communication altered in all neurodegenerative diseases and activate numerous intracellular survival pathways. Research in the field will continue growing in the near future. The particular cellular nature of this unique chaperone protein must be better understood to facilitate the development of promising molecules at the clinical stage.","Maurice, Tangui",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2021.1838483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070647/,191

Mounting evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via the air; however, this has not yet been demonstrated. Here we quantitatively analyze virion accumulation by accounting for aerosolized virion emission and destabilization. Reported superspreading events analyzed within this framework point towards aerosol mediated transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Virion exposure calculated for these events is found to trace out a single value, suggesting a universal minimum infective dose (MID) via aerosol that is comparable to the MIDs measured for other respiratory viruses; thus, the consistent infectious exposure levels and their commensurability to known aerosol-MIDs establishes the plausibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Using filtration at a rate exceeding the destabilization rate of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 can reduce exposure below this infective dose.","Kolinski, John M; Schneider, Tobias M",Physical review.

Nevertheless, ischemic strokes also occur in patients who are being treated with NOAC. In those particular patients, knowledge about the underlying stroke etiology, clinical presentation, acute management, and complication rates is scarce. OBJECTIVE Systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive clinical overview in terms of presentation, laboratory, imaging parameters and outcomes of patients suffering from acute cerebral ischemic events (i.e. TIA and acute ischemic stroke) while on treatment with a NOAC. Only if available, comparison to VKA is presented which was not the primary focus of this analysis. DATA SOURCES PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and EMBASE from January 1, 2006, to November 20, 2018. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 52 studies providing detailed information on a total of 12247 patients were included. We excluded case reports and case series with less than five patients. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHOD We systematically assessed study quality using a bias tool and pooled consistent data. RESULTS Existing data indicates milder stroke severity and smaller infarct size of acute ischemic stroke on treatment with NOAC compared to stroke occurrence on Vitamin K antagonists (VKA). Established risk factors for ischemic events also play a role in stroke while on NOACs, albeit the underlying etiology remains poorly understood. Intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy seem to be safe and effective, but patient selection for recanalization therapies is challenging. LIMITATIONS Limited quality of published data, duplicate cases, statistical issues of data pooling, possible incomplete retrieval of identified research and reporting bias might have limited our findings.

By involving end users of eHealth in cocreation processes when designing eHealth solutions, an acceptable and relevant product can be secured. Stakeholders' perspectives could aid in closing the gap between research-developed products and the implementation of eHealth services in real-life scenarios. OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore the views of patients with CRC, their informal caregivers, and health care professionals (HCPs) on information technology and the design of eHealth support in CRC care. METHODS A qualitative, explorative design was used to conduct 31 semistructured individual interviews with 41% (13/31) patients with CRC, 29% (9/31) informal caregivers, and 29% (9/31) HCPs recruited from the gastrosurgical ward of a university hospital in southwestern Norway. A semistructured interview guide was used for data collection, and the data were analyzed by systematic text condensation. RESULTS Participants described the diverse experiences of patients with CRC seeking web-based information. Age and digital competence were highlighted as influencers of the use of information technology. Patients rarely received advice from HCPs about relevant and secure websites containing information on CRC diagnosis and treatment. Features of desired eHealth interventions in following up patients with CRC were patient education, health monitoring, and communication with HCPs. CONCLUSIONS Several elements affect the activities of patients with CRC seeking health information. Age, inexperience with computer technology, and lack of access to web-based health information may reduce the ability of patients with CRC to engage in decision-making processes regarding illness and treatment. An eHealth service for patients with CRC should comprise features for information, education, and support for self-management and should aim to be individually adapted to the patient's age and digital competence. Involving end users of eHealth services is necessary to ensure high-quality tailored services that are perceived as user friendly and relevant to the end users.","Husebø, Anne Marie Lunde",JMIR cancer,https://doi.org/10.2196/28279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34491210/,191

Exploratory classification tree analyses identified hierarchical predictors of daily PA and sport participation separately. Disability status was not a primary predictor of daily PA. Instead, it emerged in the fifth level after age, sex, body mass index, and income, highlighting the dynamic intersection of disability with sociodemographic factors influencing PA levels. In comparison, disability status was a second-level predictor for sport participation, suggesting that unique factors influencing PA level are likely experienced by disabled children and adolescents. The authors employ an intersectionality lens to critically discuss implications for research in adapted PA.","Ross, Samantha M; Smit, Ellen; Yun, Joonkoo; Bogart, Kathleen R; Hatfield, Bridget E; Logan, Samuel W",Adapted physical activity quarterly : APAQ,https://doi.org/10.1123/apaq.2020-0027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440335/,191

Five mothers were recruited as participants and interviewed online, as the data obtained were examined through the use of thematic analysis. Also, three main themes were shown, (1) Mothers' experience in implementing home education, as regards adaptability and burden of caregiving, (2) The constraints in home education implementation, as regards maladaptive behaviours of ASD and emerging negative emotions, (3) The efforts to alleviate barriers, as regards problem-focused and religious copings. Also, the implementation of home education during the pandemic was less than optimal, due to the increase in maladaptive behaviours of the autistic children, low adaptability, the burden of caregiving, and emerging negative emotions. Appropriate coping strategies were also observed to help mothers in alleviating the constraints to implementing home education and parenting stress.","Daulay, Nurussakinah",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882385/,191

The Spanish Flu, which our grandparents still remember, was a disease that in the course of history killed millions of people: it is thought that at least 25-30 million people died from it, in Italy estimates show about 600,000 deaths for Spanish flu. The city of Milan, in particular the Policlinico Ca' Granda, was overwhelmed by this disease. From September 1918 to April 1919, a total of 5,684 people suffering from Influenza were admitted to the hospital, of whom 4,198 recovered and 1,486 died. Between 1918 and 1919, administrative and organizational measures were imple- mented to deal with the situation. Initiatives were taken on the hygiene of the hospital environment and on the disinfection of the patients' linen; numerous instruments were purchased; new spaces were opened for the Spanish patients and rules and procedures were introduced regarding visits to the sick by the public. We should not forget the central role that nurses played during 1918 and 1919. As today, several colleagues were affected and died for this cause, but they were awarded prizes, gratifications and praise for the hard and dangerous work they did on a daily basis.","Castiglioni di Caronno, Erica; La Torre, Anna",Professioni infermieristiche,https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2020.732075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33010122/,191

One possible option is the vaccination of autologous inactivated tumor cells. The primary indispensable principles of a cell-based melanoma vaccine include: i) Entire inactivation of melanoma cells; ii) retaining the immunogenicity of melanoma cells; and iii) adherence to laws and ethical guidelines. However, traditional methods for the production of the vaccine, such as ultrasonic, chemotherapeutics and freeze-thawing, have some juridical or therapeutic constraints. Therefore, the present study used high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) to inactivate malignant cells, and treated B16-F10 tumor cells with different pressures (≥50 MPa) and different durations (≥1 min). It was identified that tumor cells in vitro lost their proliferative ability, but retained their immunogenicity following treatment. Furthermore, the vaccination of the melanoma cells significantly suppressed their oncogenesis. Collectively, the present results suggest that HHP treatment may be an economically viable and effective measure to develop a melanoma vaccine, when pressure was ≥200 MPa and the treatment duration was ≥30 min.","Liu, Kai; Yan, Shuai; Ma, Zhanchuan; Liu, Bin",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724353/,191

Concurrent viral and bacterial infections enable intricate mechanisms of cooperation between pathogens, which complicate the symptoms and outcome of the disease. Such bilateral interactions are based on the modulation of bacterial growth on epithelium pathologically altered during viral illness and the modulation of immune responses, as well as the enhancement of virus replication by bacterial virulence factors. This study showed that proteases produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative bacterium implicated in the development of periodontitis, named gingipains, facilitated HMPV replication in LLC-MK2 cells and may contribute to HMPV pathogenicity in patients with periodontitis. Gingipains at low nanomolar concentrations enabled HMPV replication and allowed virus propagation in vitro. In contrast to previously published data for influenza virus, however, Staphylococcus aureus proteases and human neutrophil elastase did not affect virus replication.","Pyrc, Krzysztof; Strzyz, Paulina; Milewska, Aleksandra; Golda, Anna; Schildgen, Oliver; Potempa, Jan",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.032094-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21715599/,191

A sulfonic acid was used as the cation-exchange group in MEC-C18/SCX, and a quaternary amine as the anion-exchange group in MEC-C18/SAX. The extraction parameters optimized were sample pH, elution solvent, sample/elution volume and extraction/elution time. The optimized CPME method followed by LC-MS/MS was used to determine the ionizable compounds in environmental water samples, including river water and effluent wastewater, with excellent selectivity and matrix effect values below -30% (except -33% for mephedrone) and apparent recovery results ranging from 40% to 69%, except for ibuprofen (< 35%) and atenolol (< 25%). The analytical method was validated for environmental water samples, and used in the analysis of several samples in which some of the target compounds were found at ng L-1 concentration levels.","Nadal, Joan Carles; Borrull, Francesc; Furton, Kenneth G; Kabir, Abuzar; Fontanals, Núria; Marcé, Rosa Maria",Journal of chromatography.

In the face of the sudden pandemic, workforce mobilization has been of critical concern to medical institutions. During the pandemic, the public's behaviors of seeking medical assistance have also changed. Using the real-world data of a large medical center in Taiwan, this study aimed to analyze the fluctuations of outpatient visits among various departments and divisions in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide suggestions for staff allocation in similar future events. METHODS Data of outpatient visits at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were obtained for analysis. The weekly fluctuations of outpatient visits among 36 departments or divisions were computed for the 8 weeks from February 3 to March 29, 2020, the early phase of the pandemic. The monthly data of outpatient visits by department and division in March 2020 were also extracted for comparison with those in March 2019. A simple regression equation was used to calculate the weekly trends. RESULTS Average outpatient visits decreased by 26% in the 2 months following the outbreak. Among the 36 departments or divisions, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and cardiology underwent marked declines after the outbreak; the slopes of the simple regression equation were -110.8, -100.7, and -99.2, respectively. By contrast, transfusion medicine, toxicology, transplantation surgery, pediatric surgery, chest surgery, technical aid, and oncology were divisions less influenced. In the year-over-year comparison, infection was the only department or division with positive growth (20.5%), whereas all others exhibited negative growth. CONCLUSION In the future, we can fulfil the additional personnel needs during a pandemic by redeploying physicians from departments experiencing a reduced workload. Hospitals should also establish preparatory employee training programs to ensure that the reassigned personnel are adequately equipped to serve in their new positions.","Chang, Ya-Ting; Chiang, Shu-Chiung; Lee, Wui-Chiang; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145199/,191

No current treatment option can provide complete repair. The possibility of growth factor delivery into the joint for cartilage regeneration after injury would be an attractive treatment option. A full thickness osteochondral defect of 4 mm in diameter and 2 mm deep was created by mechanical drilling in the medial femoral condyle in 20 female adult New Zealand White rabbits. In an attempt to improve regeneration a hyaluronic hydrogel system, with or without bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) was delivered intraarticularly. The contralateral joint defect was treated with saline as control. Throughout the study, rabbits were clinically examined and after 12 (n = 6) or 24 (n = 9) weeks, the rabbits were euthanized and the joints evaluated by histology. The defects healed with fibrocartilage like tissue, and the filling of the defects ranged from less than 25% to complete. The healing of the defects varied both inter- and intra-group wise. Treatment with hyaluronan gel with or without BMP-2 had no effect on cartilage regeneration compared with controls. Instead, severe ectopic bone formation was found in seven joints treated with BMP-2. In conclusion, the present study shows that neither treatment with hyaluronic gel alone, nor in combination with BMP-2, improves the healing of an induced cartilage defect in rabbits. It further shows that BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone formation, which severely affects the functionality of the joint.","Aulin, C; Jensen-Waern, M; Ekman, S; Hägglund, M; Engstrand, T; Hilborn, J; Hedenqvist, P",Laboratory animals,https://doi.org/10.1177/0023677212473716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23467490/,191

The degradation of hemoglobin results in the impairment of oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, and the accumulation of free iron enhances the production of reactive oxygen species. Both events can lead to the development of oxidative stress. In this case, oxidative damage to the lungs leads then to the injuries of all other tissues and organs. The use of uridine, which preserves the structure of pulmonary alveoli and the air-blood barrier of the lungs in the course of experimental severe hypoxia, and dihydroquercetin, an effective free radical scavenger, is promising for the treatment of COVID-19.

PURPOSE Our aim was to compare treatment-related outcomes between these 2 techniques. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 data bases was performed for studies published from 1990 to 2017. STUDY SELECTION We selected series of reconstructive and deconstructive treatments with >10 patients. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to analyze occlusion rates, complications, and neurologic outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS Thirty-nine studies evaluating 894 very large/giant aneurysms were included. Long-term occlusion of unruptured aneurysms was 71% and 93% after reconstructive and deconstructive treatments, respectively (P = .003). Among unruptured aneurysms, complications were lower after parent artery occlusion (16% versus 30%, P = .05), whereas among ruptured lesions, complications were lower after reconstructive techniques (34% versus 38%). Parent artery occlusion in the posterior circulation had higher complications compared with in the anterior circulation (36% versus 15%, P = .001). Overall, coiling yielded lower complication and occlusion rates compared with flow diverters and stent-assisted coiling. Complication rates of flow diversion were lower in the anterior circulation (17% versus 41%, P < .01). Among unruptured lesions, early aneurysm rupture (within 30 days) was slightly higher after reconstructive treatment (5% versus 0%, P = .08) and after flow diversion alone compared with flow diversion plus coiling (7% versus 0%). LIMITATIONS Limitations were selection and publication biases. CONCLUSIONS Parent artery occlusion allowed high rates of occlusion with an acceptable rate of complications for unruptured, anterior circulation aneurysms. Coiling should be preferred for posterior circulation and ruptured lesions, whereas flow diversion is relatively safe and effective for unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms.","Cagnazzo, F; Mantilla, D; Rouchaud, A; Brinjikji, W; Lefevre, P-H; Dargazanli, C; Gascou, G; Riquelme, C; Perrini, P; di Carlo, D; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between overdose deaths and carfentanil availability in the United States. DESIGN Secondary analysis of drug overdose deaths from the Center for Disease Control and carfentanil exhibit data from drug seizures submitted to drug crime labs and published by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Trends in overdose deaths were compared in states with high carfentanil exhibits with states with low or no carfentanil exhibits. SETTING United States. CASES A total of 1,035,923 drug overdose death records in the United States from 1979 through 2019 were studied. MEASUREMENTS The outcomes studied were number of overdose deaths and mortality rates by state. FINDINGS Drug overdose deaths have been closely tracking along an exponential curve. The years 2016 and 2017 witnessed a hyper-exponential surge with increases in overdose deaths of 11,228 (+21.4%), and 6,605 (+10.4%), respectively. Subsequently in 2018, drug overdose deaths declined by -2,870 (-4.1%). This rise and then fall coincided with a surge and then decline in carfentanil drug seizure exhibits during these same years: 0 (2015), 1292 (2016), 5,857 (2017) and 804 (2018). The majority of carfentanil exhibits were localized to a few states. The 2018 decline in overdose deaths in the top five states with the greatest spike in carfentanil exhibits in 2017 (Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Michigan) was 2,848, which accounted for nearly all of the total US decline. CONCLUSIONS The 2016-2017 acceleration and then 2018 decline in drug overdose deaths in the United States was associated with the sudden rise and then fall of carfentanil availability. Given the regional variation, carfentanil's decreased availability may have contributed to the reduction in overdose deaths in 2018.","Jalal, Hawre; Burke, Donald S",Addiction,https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935381/,191

98788,Patient Perspectives on the Effect of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Patients With Systemic Sclerosis: An International Patient Survey.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Reduction of the coronary sinus was shown to improve angina in patients unsuitable for revascularisation. We assessed whether a percutaneous device that reduces the diameter of the coronary sinus improved outcomes across multiple endpoints in a phase II trial. METHODS We conducted a novel analysis performed as a post hoc efficacy analysis of the COSIRA (Coronary Sinus Reducer for Treatment of Refractory Angina) trial, which enrolled patients with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class 3-4 refractory angina. We used four domains: symptoms (CCS Angina Scale), functionality (total exercise duration), ischaemia (imaging) and health-related quality of life. For all domains, we specified a meaningful threshold for change. The primary endpoint was defined as a probability of ≥80% that the reducer exceeded the meaningful threshold on two or more domains (group-level analysis) or that the average efficacy score in the reducer group exceeded the sham control group by at least two points (patient-level analysis). RESULTS We randomised 104 participants to either a device that narrows to coronary sinus (n=52) or a sham implantation (n=52). The reducer group met the prespecified criteria for concordance at the group level and demonstrated improvement in symptoms (0.59 CCS grade, 95% credible interval (CrI)=0.22 to 0.95), total exercise duration (+27.9%, 95% CrI=2.8% to 59.8%) and quality of life (stability +11.2 points, 95% CrI=3.3 to 19.1; perception +11.0, 95% CrI=3.3 to 18.7). CONCLUSIONS The reducer concordantly improved symptoms, functionality and quality of life compared with a sham intervention in patients with angina unsuitable for coronary revascularisation. Concordant analysis such as this one can help interpret early phase trials and guide the decision to pursue a clinical programme into a larger confirmatory trial.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate individuals' health anxiety and emotion regulation during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to some variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between emotion regulation and health anxiety. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study was conducted on 874 individuals reached online through the google e-forms. The participants were administered the ""Health Anxiety Scale and Emotion Regulation Scale"" to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, Mann- Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Spearman Correlation Coefficient were used. RESULTS In the current study, healthy anxiety scores of the participants were analyzed depending on some variables. Health anxiety was found to be higher in women, 18-30 age group, singles, students, and groups with physical and mental health problems. The research also found that there is a low and negative relationship between health anxiety and cognitive reappraisal. It is understood that men's suppression scores are higher than women. There is no significant difference between suppressing emotions and health anxiety. It was found that educators received the highest scores in terms of cognitive reappraisal. The cognitive reappraisal level of the group without mental disorder was found to be higher than the other group. CONCLUSION According to the results of the research, more supportive services should be provided for the groups with the higher health anxiety. Considering that especially students and young people are affected more, it can be said that mental health preventive services should be included more in these groups. At the same time, the fact that men have higher emotion suppression scores than women shows that this situation should also be taken into consideration in mental health services.","Canlı, Derya; Karaşar, Burcu",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370761/,191
100359,Lung transplantation: candidate selection and timing of transplant.,2021-06-01,"Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","Endo, Akira; Abbott, Sam; Kucharski, Adam J; Funk, Sebastian",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15842.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32685698/,191
101927,Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for children with β-thalassemia major: multicenter experience in China.,2018,"OBJECTIVES Optimizing blood pressure using near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring has been suggested to ensure organ perfusion during cardiac surgery. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a reliable surrogate for cerebral blood flow in clinical cerebral autoregulation monitoring and might provide an earlier warning of malperfusion than indicators of cerebral ischemia. We hypothesized that blood pressure below the limits of cerebral autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass would be associated with major morbidity and operative mortality after cardiac surgery. METHODS Autoregulation was monitored during cardiopulmonary bypass in 450 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery. A continuous, moving Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between the arterial pressure and low-frequency near-infrared spectroscopy signals and displayed continuously during surgery using a laptop computer. The area under the curve of the product of the duration and magnitude of blood pressure below the limits of autoregulation was compared between patients with and without major morbidity (eg, stroke, renal failure, mechanical lung ventilation >48 hours, inotrope use >24 hours, or intra-aortic balloon pump insertion) or operative mortality. RESULTS Of the 450 patients, 83 experienced major morbidity or operative mortality. The area under the curve of the product of the duration and magnitude of blood pressure below the limits of autoregulation was independently associated with major morbidity or operative mortality after cardiac surgery (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.71; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS Blood pressure management during cardiopulmonary bypass using physiologic endpoints such as cerebral autoregulation monitoring might provide a method of optimizing organ perfusion and improving patient outcomes from cardiac surgery.","Ono, Masahiro; Brady, Kenneth; Easley, R Blaine; Brown, Charles; Kraut, Michael; Gottesman, Rebecca F; Hogue, Charles W",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.07.069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24075467/,191

This high sweat salt loss increases the risk for electrolyte disturbances, associated with subacute or chronic complications. Sodium status therefore needs to be adequately monitored and salt intake adjusted to individual needs. The lack of current evidence to formulate specific recommendations and assess sodium status is reflected in a variability of recommendations in international guidelines. This narrative review presents an overview of the current evidence. Infants with CF in particular are at risk for severe sodium deficiency, potentially leading to metabolic alkalosis due to low intake and high sweat losses. More research on the assessment of sodium status and efficacy of sodium chloride supplements in the population of patients with CF, especially given the changing era of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulatory treatment, is warranted.","Declercq, Dimitri; Van Braeckel, Eva; Marchand, Sophie; Van Daele, Sabine; Van Biervliet, Stephanie",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680818/,191
103923,Restructuring of a pediatric hospital in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-23,"Objectives This study aimed to describe the ultrasonographic, endoscopic and histological characteristics of the caecum and ileocaecocolic junction in cats suffering from chronic clinical signs compatible with caecocolic disease. Methods Cats presenting with clinical signs suggestive of a caecocolic disease were prospectively recruited. All cats underwent an ultrasonographic examination of the caecum, ileum, colon, ileocolic lymph nodes and local mesenteric fat, in addition to comprehensive abdominal ultrasonography. This was followed by a colonoscopy with a macroscopic assessment of the caecocolic mucosa; caecocolic tissue samples were systematically collected for histologic analysis. Results Eighteen cats were included. Eleven of 18 cats had ultrasonographic abnormalities adjacent to the ileocaecocolic junction (lymphadenopathy, local steatitis) and 13/18 cats had abnormalities directly related to the junction (wall thickening, loss of wall layering). Seventeen of 18 cats had at least one ultrasonographic abnormality. Endoscopically, hyperaemia, oedema, discoloration and/or erosions were found in all cats. Each cat was classified as having mild or moderate-to-severe lesions according to endoscopic results; no classification could be established statistically for ultrasonographic results. The accentuation of the dimpled pattern tended to be inversely related to the severity of endoscopic lesion scoring. Histologically, a large proportion of cats showed typhlitis (13/16), one had lymphoma and two were normal. All cats with typhlitis also had colitis. There was only slight agreement between endoscopic and histological caecal results regarding the severity of lesions. Loss of caecal wall layering on ultrasound was found in 7/18 cats and, surprisingly, did not appear as a reliable predictor of the severity of inflammation or of malignancy; neither did local steatitis nor lymph node size. Conclusions and relevance Ultrasonography and endoscopy should not be used as the sole methods to investigate the ileocaecocolic region in cats with clinical signs suggestive of caecocolic disease. The presence of chronic clinical signs should routinely prompt histological biopsy.","Hahn, Harriet; Pey, Pascaline; Baril, Aurélie; Charpentier, Julie; Desquilbet, Loic; Le Poder, Sophie; Château-Joubert, Sophie; Laloy, Eve; Freiche, Valerie",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x16663594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613492/,191
103982,When should we use corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia?,2020-12-29,"Approximately 3.8 million patients annually receive extended-release (ER) or long-acting opioid prescriptions in the outpatient setting, around half of which are written by primary care physicians. Compared with short-acting, immediate-release (IR) formulations, ER and oral long-acting opioid analgesics are associated with clinical advantages, such as extended periods of time during which drug plasma levels are within the therapeutic range, decreased peak-to-trough fluctuations, and prolonged analgesia over the dosing period. Additionally, ER opioids offer a more convenient, less frequent dosing regimen to chronic pain patients who are often taking several concomitant medications. The increased utilization of ER opioids has been accompanied by a rise in the misuse and abuse of these formulations. Certain pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., longer time to maximum drug plasma concentration, lower maximum drug plasma concentration) may decrease the abuse potential of intact ER opioids by limiting the positive subjective and reinforcing effects relative to IR formulations. Putative abuse-deterrent formulations have also recently been introduced to impede physical manipulation of these formulations, or reduce the harm resulting from such behavior. Such formulations may represent an incremental advance to reduce non-oral forms of abuse. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic profiles and abuse-deterrent features of newer ER opioid analgesics for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.","Gudin, Jeffrey A",Journal of pain & palliative care pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/15360288.2012.757575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23527669/,191

To continue with the characterization of this viral protein, we have investigated its intracellular distribution in avian cells. Most sigmaA accumulates into cytoplasmic viral factories of infected cells, and yet a significant fraction was detected in the nucleolus. The protein also localizes in the nucleolus of transfected cells, suggesting that nucleolar targeting is not facilitated by the viral infection or by viral factors. Assays performed in both intact cells and digitonin-permeabilized cells demonstrate that sigmaA is able to enter the nucleus via a nucleoporin-dependent nondiffusional mechanism that does not require added cytosolic factors or energy input. These results indicate that sigmaA by itself is able to penetrate into the nucleus using a process that is mechanistically different from the classical nuclear localization signal/importin pathway. On the other hand, two sigmaA arginines that are necessary for dsRNA binding are also required for nucleolar localization, suggesting that dsRNA-binding and nucleolar targeting are intimately linked properties of the viral protein.","Vázquez-Iglesias, Lorena; Lostalé-Seijo, Irene; Martínez-Costas, José; Benavente, Javier",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01080-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640987/,191

105919,STAT 1 mutation associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and pancytopenia.,2021-01-09,"PURPOSE To assess the association of patient, lesion, and procedure variables, including calcification, with late lumen loss (LLL) after use of drug-eluting balloon (DEB) therapy in patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease. METHODS In this retrospective study, 91 patients (mean age 72.0±8.62 years; 50 men) were analyzed at 6 months after DEB treatment. Lesions were located in the superficial femoral artery (SFA, n=68) and popliteal artery (n=23). Lesion calcification was graded by a core laboratory using 2 published scoring indices: the peripheral artery calcification scoring system and a grading system based on circumference (arc) and length of calcium. RESULTS The median LLL after 6 months was 0.2 mm (interquartile range -0.5, 1.14) overall and varied significantly across lesions with differing severity of calcification (p=0.042). However, LLL did not differ based on calcium location (intimal, medial, or mixed) or calcium length (p=0.351 and p=0.258, respectively). Additional predictors of LLL after DEB treatment included diabetes (p=0.034), coronary artery disease (p=0.024), and prior intervention (p=0.013). Interestingly, the severity of residual stenosis after the intervention did not have any impact on the LLL during follow-up (Spearman r = -0.238). CONCLUSION Severity of lesion calcification is associated with LLL after treatment with DEB. One possible approach to overcome this limitation might be plaque modification or removal prior to DEB usage. Nevertheless, clinical data that support this hypothesis are currently lacking.","Tepe, Gunnar; Beschorner, Ulrich; Ruether, Charlotte; Fischer, Imma; Pfaffinger, Peter; Noory, Elias; Zeller, Thomas",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815600156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26250747/,191
106658,The need for protecting and enhancing TB health policies and services for forcibly displaced and migrant populations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND Hospitals are expected to operate at a high performance level even under exceptional conditions of peak demand and resource disruptions. This understanding is not mature yet and there are wide areas of possible improvement. In particular, the fast mobilization and reconfiguration of resources frequently result into the severe disruption of elective activities, worsening the quality of care. This becomes particularly evident during the on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. More resilient resource allocation strategies, that is, which adapt to the dynamics of the prevailing circumstance, are needed to maximize the effectiveness of health-care delivery. In this study, a simulation approach was adopted to assess and compare different hospital's adaptive resource allocation strategies in responding to a sudden onset disaster mass casualty incident (MCI). METHODS A specific set of performance metrics was developed to take into consideration multiple objectives and priorities and holistically assess the effectiveness of health-care delivery when coping with an MCI event. Discrete event simulation (DES) and system dynamics (SD) were used to model the key hospital processes and the MCI plan. RESULTS In the daytime scenario, during the recovery phase of the disaster, a gradual disengagement of resources from the emergency department (ED) to restart ordinary activities in operating rooms and wards returned the best performance. In the night scenario, the absorption capacity of the ED was evaluated by identifying the current bottleneck and assessment of the benefit of different resource mobilization strategies. CONCLUSIONS The present study offers a robust approach, effective strategies and new insights to design more resilient plans to cope with MCIs. It becomes particularly relevant when considering the risk of indirect damage of emergencies, where all the available resources are shifted from the care of the ordinary to the ""disaster"" patients, like during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Future research is needed to widen the scope of the analysis and take into consideration additional resilience capacities such as operational coordination mechanisms among multiple hospitals in the same geographic area.","Faccincani, Roberto; Trucco, Paolo; Nocetti, Claudio; Carlucci, Michele; Weinstein, Eric S",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114535/,191

Malnutrition-screening tools will also be discussed to screen and diagnose the patients at higher risk of COVID-19 severity and related worse outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 can occur in a wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic to severe forms. Among the major risk factors for worse severity, overnutrition, undernutrition and body composition play a role in the ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat accumulation (i.e. obesity) or lean mass loss and functionality (i.e. sarcopenia) or a combination of both (i.e. sarcopenic obesity) can affect whole-body functioning. These body composition alterations in the short-term can influence susceptibility and immunological responses to the virus, inflammatory reaction, metabolic and respiratory distress, while in the long-term can modulate disease outcomes, namely length of stay, time required for recovery, risk of ICU-acquired weakness and long-term disabilities and potentially increase the risk of death.

We assessed the performance of primary angioplasty in a tertiary care hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, by comparing the door-to-device (DTD) time and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow after angioplasty between two periods of admission: during the outbreak of COVID-19 (March 1 to May 31, 2020) and before the outbreak (March 1, to May 31, 2019). Overall, there was a relative reduction of 44% for STEMI admission during the outbreak ( n = 116) compared with before the outbreak ( N = 208). Compared with before the outbreak period ( n = 141), STEMI patients who admitted during the outbreak and received primary angioplasty ( n = 70) had similar median symptom onset-to-angioplasty center admission (360 minutes for each group), similar to radial access uptake (90 vs. 89.4%, p = 0.88) and left anterior descending infarct-related artery (54.3 vs. 58.9%, p = 0.52). The median DTD time and total ischemia time were longer (104 vs. 81 minutes, p < 0.001, and 475.5 vs. 449 minutes, p = 0.43, respectively). However, the final achievement of TIMI 3 flow was similar (87.1 vs. 87.2%), and so was the in-hospital mortality (5.7 vs. 7.8%). During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found a longer DTD time for primary angioplasty, but the achievement of final TIMI 3 flow and in-hospital mortality were similar as compared with before the outbreak. Thus, primary angioplasty should remain the standard of care for STEMI during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Dharma, Surya; Dakota, Iwan; Firdaus, Isman; Danny, Siska Suridanda; Zamroni, Dian; Yudha, Ardi; Susanto, Agus; Siswanto, Bambang Budi","The International journal of angiology : official publication of the International College of Angiology, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1727133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054273/,191

Heparin-like sulfated or sulfonated compounds have been known for decades for their ability to prevent the infection of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) dependent viruses, even though only in a reversible way. We have previously shown that gold nanoparticles and β-cyclodextrins coated with mercapto-undecane sulfonic acid (MUS) inhibit HSPG-dependent viruses irreversibly, while retaining the low-toxicity profile of most heparin-like compounds. In this work we show that, in stark contrast with heparin, these compounds also inhibit different strains of influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which do not bind HSPG. The antiviral action is virucidal and irreversible for influenza A virus (H1N1), while for VSV there is a reversible inhibition of viral attachment to the cell.

109877,Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2: A Double-Edged Sword.,2020-03-26,"Objective In early 2020, the spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare this disease a pandemic. Initial epidemiological data showed that patients with cancer were at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. National scientific societies published recommendations modifying the patients' breast cancer (BC) management to preserve, in theory, quality oncologic care, avoiding the increased risk of contamination. The Senology International Society (SIS) decided to take an inventory of the actions taken worldwide. This study investigates COVID-19-related changes concerning BC management and analyzes the will to maintain them after the pandemic, evaluating their oncological safety consequences. Materials and Methods SIS network members participated in an online survey using a questionnaire (Microsoft® Forms) from June 15th to July 31st, 2020. Results Forty-five responses from 24 countries showed that screening programs had been suspended (68%); magnetic resonance imagines were postponed (73%); telemedicine was preferred when possible (71%). Surgeries were postponed: reconstructive (77%), for benign diseases (84%), and in patients with significant comorbidities (66%). Chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols had been adapted in 28% of patients in both. Exception for telemedicine (34%), these changes in practice should not be continued. Conclusion The SIS survey showed significant changes in BC's diagnosis and treatment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, but most of these changes should not be maintained. Indeed, women have fewer severe forms of COVID-19 and are less likely to die than men. The risk of dying from COVID-19 is more related to the presence of comorbidities and age than to BC. Stopping screening and delaying treatment leads to more advanced stages of BC. Only women aged over 65 with BC under treatment and comorbidities require adaptation of their cancer management.","Mathelin, Carole; Ame, Shanti; Anyanwu, Stanley; Avisar, Eli; Boubnider, Wahib Mohcen; Breitling, Katrin; Anie, Hannah Ayettey; Conceição, José Carlos; Dupont, Veronique; Elder, Elisabeth; Elfgen, Constanze; Elonge, Tony; Iglesias, Edelmiro; Imoto, Shigeru; Ioannidou-Mouzaka, Lydia; Kappos, Elisabeth A; Kaufmann, Martin; Knauer, Michael; Luzuy, Franck; Margaritoni, Marko; Mbodj, Mamadou; Mundinger, Alexander; Orda, Ruben; Ostapenko, Valerijus; Özbaş, Serdar; Özmen, Vahit; Pagani, Olivia; Pieńkowski, Tadeusz; Schneebaum, Schlomo; Shmalts, Ekaterina; Selim, Ashraf; Pavel, Zotov; Lodi, Massimo; Maghales-Costa, Maurício",European journal of breast health,https://doi.org/10.4274/ejbh.galenos.2021.2021-1-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870120/,191

RESULTS After analysis, 70 subjects receiving the loxoprofen treatment and 69 subjects receiving celecoxib treatment were determined to be eligible for the analysis. The minimum p value in GWAS was detected in the analysis of 16 cases with an increase of five or more mucosal breaks and 123 controls with zero to four mucosal breaks. In the GWAS, five SNPs in the bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing family B member 4 (BPIFB4) gene showed the lowest p value (p = 2.69 × 10-7 with an odds ratio of 40.9). Of the five SNPs, four were nonsynonymous SNPs (rs2070325: V268I, rs2889732: T320N, rs11699009: F527L, rs11696307: T533I, and rs11696310: intronic). Furthermore, 23 SNPs in BPIFB4 detected by genotype imputation based on the GWAS data also showed suggestive associations (p < 1 × 10-6). CONCLUSION The results indicate that SNPs in BPIFB4 were associated with NSAID-induced small intestinal mucosal injury (UMIN: 000007936).","Fujimori, Shunji; Fukunaga, Koya; Takahashi, Atsushi; Mushiroda, Taisei; Kubo, Michiaki; Hanada, Ryuzo; Hayashida, Mari; Sakurai, Toshiyuki; Iwakiri, Katsuhiko; Sakamoto, Choitsu",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5349-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30377885/,191
111902,Correction.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We aimed to compare the performance of the ZeroGravity (ZG) system (radiation protection system composed by a suspended lead suit) against the use of standard protection (lead apron (LA), thyroid shield, lead eyeglasses, table skirts, and ceiling suspended shield) in neuroangiography procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Radiation exposure data were prospectively collected in consecutive neuroendovascular procedures between December 2014 and February 2015. Operator No 1 was assigned to the use of an LA (plus lead glasses, thyroid shield, and a 1 mm hanging shield at the groin) while operator No 2 utilized the ZG system. Dosimeters were used to measure peak skin dose for the head, thyroid, and left foot. RESULTS The two operators performed a total of 122 procedures during the study period. The ZG operator was more commonly the primary operator compared with the LA operator (85% vs 71%; p=0.04). The mean anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and cumulative dose area product (DAP) radiation exposure as well as the mean fluoroscopy time were not statistically different between the operators' cases. The peak skin dose to the head of the operator with LA was 2.1 times higher (3380 vs 1600 μSv), while the thyroid was 13.9 (4460 vs 320 μSv), the mediastinum infinitely (520 vs 0 μSv), and the foot 3.3 times higher (4870 vs 1470 μSv) compared with the ZG operator, leading to an overall accumulated dose 4 times higher. The ratio of cumulative operator received dose/total cumulative DAP was 2.5 higher on the LA operator. CONCLUSIONS The ZG radiation protection system leads to substantially lower radiation exposure to the operator in neurointerventional procedures. However, substantial exposure may still occur at the level of the lens and thyroid to justify additional protection.","Haussen, Diogo C; Van Der Bom, Imramsjah Martijn John; Nogueira, Raul G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491039/,191
112222,Clinical characteristic and epidemiological features of SARS CoV -2 disease patients from a COVID 19 designated Hospital in New Delhi.,2021-01-06,"Fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) results in abnormal cardiac function that is apparent antenatally due to advances in fetoplacental Doppler ultrasound and fetal echocardiography. Increasingly, these imaging modalities are being employed clinically to examine cardiac function and assess wellbeing in utero, thereby guiding timing of birth decisions. Here, we used a rabbit model of IUGR that allows analysis of cardiac function in a clinically relevant way. Using isoflurane induced anesthesia, IUGR is surgically created at gestational age day 25 by performing a laparotomy, exposing the bicornuate uterus and then ligating 40-50% of uteroplacental vessels supplying each gestational sac in a single uterine horn. The other horn in the rabbit bicornuate uterus serves as internal control fetuses. Then, after recovery at gestational age day 30 (full term), the same rabbit undergoes examination of fetal cardiac function. Anesthesia is induced with ketamine and xylazine intramuscularly, then maintained by a continuous intravenous infusion of ketamine and xylazine to minimize iatrogenic effects on fetal cardiac function. A repeat laparotomy is performed to expose each gestational sac and a microultrasound examination (VisualSonics VEVO 2100) of fetal cardiac function is performed. Placental insufficiency is evident by a raised pulsatility index or an absent or reversed end diastolic flow of the umbilical artery Doppler waveform. The ductus venosus and middle cerebral artery Doppler is then examined. Fetal echocardiography is performed by recording B mode, M mode and flow velocity waveforms in lateral and apical views. Offline calculations determine standard M-mode cardiac variables, tricuspid and mitral annular plane systolic excursion, speckle tracking and strain analysis, modified myocardial performance index and vascular flow velocity waveforms of interest. This small animal model of IUGR therefore affords examination of in utero cardiac function that is consistent with current clinical practice and is therefore useful in a translational research setting.","Hodges, Ryan; Endo, Masayuki; La Gerche, Andre; Eixarch, Elisenda; DeKoninck, Philip; Ferferieva, Vessilina; D'hooge, Jan; Wallace, Euan M; Deprest, Jan",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/50392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23852345/,191

METHOD A sample of 6,882 individuals (Mage = 42.30; 78.8% female) from 59 countries completed an online survey asking about several pandemic-related changes in life and psychological status. RESULTS Of these participants, 25.4% and 19.5% reported moderate-to-severe depression (DASS-21) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), respectively. Demographic characteristics (e.g. higher-income country), COVID-19 exposure (e.g., having had unconfirmed COVID-19 symptoms), government-imposed quarantine level, and COVID-19-based life changes (e.g., having a hard time transitioning to working from home; increase in verbal arguments or conflict with other adult in home) explained 17.9% of the variance in depression and 21.5% in anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS In addition to posing a high risk to physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has robustly affected global mental health, so it is essential to ensure that mental health services reach individuals showing pandemic-related depression and anxiety symptoms.","Alzueta, Elisabet; Perrin, Paul; Baker, Fiona C; Caffarra, Sendy; Ramos-Usuga, Daniela; Yuksel, Dilara; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos",Journal of clinical psychology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128795/,191

113574,Comments on Leung.,2021-02-01,"Background: Outcome heterogeneity, selective reporting, and choosing outcomes that do not reflect needs and priorities of stakeholders, limit the examination of health intervention effects, particularly in late phase trials. Core outcome sets (COS) are a proposed solution to these issues. A COS is an agreed-upon, standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported as a minimum in all trials in a specific area of health or healthcare. COS are intended to increase standardisation of outcome measurement and reporting to better enable comparisons between, and synthesis of findings of trials in a particular health area. Methods: This study will examine late phase trials, published between October 2019 and March 2020 (inclusive), in the following five medical journals: New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, BMJ, and Annals of Internal Medicine. Trials will be examined to determine if they refer to a COS, and whether they use a COS. Trialists for each identified trial will subsequently be contacted to complete an online survey examining trialists' awareness of, and decisions to search for and use a COS. Discussion: This study will provide important information on uptake of COS by later phase trialists in major medical journals, and the views of these trialists on COS use in trials. These findings will inform approaches to increasing awareness and uptake of COS in future health trials.","Matvienko-Sikar, Karen; Avery, Kerry; Blazeby, Jane; Hughes, Karen; Jacobsen, Pamela; Kirkham, Jamie; Kottner, Jan; Mellor, Katie; Saldanha, Ian; Smith, Valerie; Terwee, Caroline B; Williamson, Paula R",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13109.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33693308/,191

114749,Reply to Beken et al.,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND CT perfusion (CTP) and diffusion or perfusion MRI might assist patient selection for endovascular thrombectomy. We aimed to establish whether imaging assessments of irreversibly injured ischaemic core and potentially salvageable penumbra volumes were associated with functional outcome and whether they interacted with the treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy on functional outcome. METHODS In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the HERMES collaboration pooled patient-level data from all randomised controlled trials that compared endovascular thrombectomy (predominantly using stent retrievers) with standard medical therapy in patients with anterior circulation ischaemic stroke, published in PubMed from Jan 1, 2010, to May 31, 2017. The primary endpoint was functional outcome, assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days after stroke. Ischaemic core was estimated, before treatment with either endovascular thrombectomy or standard medical therapy, by CTP as relative cerebral blood flow less than 30% of normal brain blood flow or by MRI as an apparent diffusion coefficient less than 620 μm2/s. Critically hypoperfused tissue was estimated as the volume of tissue with a CTP time to maximum longer than 6 s. Mismatch volume (ie, the estimated penumbral volume) was calculated as critically hypoperfused tissue volume minus ischaemic core volume. The association of ischaemic core and penumbral volumes with 90-day mRS score was analysed with multivariable logistic regression (functional independence, defined as mRS score 0-2) and ordinal logistic regression (functional improvement by at least one mRS category) in all patients and in a subset of those with more than 50% endovascular reperfusion, adjusted for baseline prognostic variables. The meta-analysis was prospectively designed by the HERMES executive committee, but not registered. FINDINGS We identified seven studies with 1764 patients, all of which were included in the meta-analysis. CTP was available and assessable for 591 (34%) patients and diffusion MRI for 309 (18%) patients. Functional independence was worse in patients who had CTP versus those who had diffusion MRI, after adjustment for ischaemic core volume (odds ratio [OR] 0·47 [95% CI 0·30-0·72], p=0·0007), so the imaging modalities were not pooled. Increasing ischaemic core volume was associated with reduced likelihood of functional independence (CTP OR 0·77 [0·69-0·86] per 10 mL, pinteraction=0·29; diffusion MRI OR 0·87 [0·81-0·94] per 10 mL, pinteraction=0·94). Mismatch volume, examined only in the CTP group because of the small numbers of patients who had perfusion MRI, was not associated with either functional independence or functional improvement. In patients with CTP with more than 50% endovascular reperfusion (n=186), age, ischaemic core volume, and imaging-to-reperfusion time were independently associated with functional improvement. Risk of bias between studies was generally low. INTERPRETATION Estimated ischaemic core volume was independently associated with functional independence and functional improvement but did not modify the treatment benefit of endovascular thrombectomy over standard medical therapy for improved functional outcome. Combining ischaemic core volume with age and expected imaging-to-reperfusion time will improve assessment of prognosis and might inform endovascular thrombectomy treatment decisions.

Participants were encouraged to organize their contributions around the dimensions of administrative psychiatry, the structure of clinical care, the content of clinical care, the patients' reported personal experiences, and the psychiatrists' reported personal experiences. Themes identified and discussed are paradoxical separateness, seeking an optimal interpersonal distance, finding new idioms, reality and symbolism, and loss, mourning, and isolation.

115634,Changes in helper lymphocyte chemokine receptor expression and elevation of IP-10 during acute respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants.,2011,"BACKGROUND The Composite Variability Index (CVI), derived from the electroencephalogram, was developed to assess the antinociception-nociception balance, whereas the Bispectral Index (BIS) was developed to assess the hypnotic state during anesthesia. We studied the relationships between these indices, level of hypnosis (BIS level), and antinociception (predicted remifentanil effect-site concentrations, CeREMI) before and after stimulation. Also, we measured their association with movement in response to a noxious stimulus. METHODS We randomized 120 patients to one of 12 groups targeting different hypnotic levels (BIS 70, 50, and 30) and various CeREMI (0, 2, 4, or 6 ng/mL). At pseudo-steady state, baseline values were observed, and a series of stimuli were applied. Changes in BIS, CVI, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) between baseline and response period were analyzed in relation to level of hypnosis, antinociception, and somatic response to the stimuli. RESULTS CVI and BIS more accurately correlate with somatic response to an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation-noxious stimulation than HR, MAP, CeREMI, and propofol effect-site concentration (Tukey post hoc tests P < 0.01). Change in CVI is more adequate to monitor response to stimulation than changes in BIS, HR, or MAP (as described by the Mathews Correlation Coefficient with significance level set at P < 0.001). In contrast, none of the candidate analgesic state indices was uniquely related to a specific opioid concentration and is extensively influenced by the hypnotic state as measured by BIS. CONCLUSIONS CVI appears to correlate with somatic responses to noxious stimuli. However, unstimulated CVI depends more on hypnotic drug effect than on opioid concentration.","Sahinovic, Marco M; Eleveld, Douglas J; Kalmar, Alain F; Heeremans, Eleonora H; De Smet, Tom; Seshagiri, Chandran V; Absalom, Anthony R; Vereecke, Hugo E M; Struys, Michel M R F",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892803/,191

118367,A Eulogy for Dr. Francisco Miguel Marty Forero.,2021-05-22,"OBJECTIVES Child sex trafficking is a global health problem, with a prevalence of 4% to 11% among high-risk adolescents. The objective of this study was to confidentially administer a validated screening tool in a pediatric emergency department by using an electronic tablet to identify minors at risk for sex trafficking. Our hypothesis was that this modality of administration would adequately identify high-risk patients. METHODS English- and Spanish-speaking patients from the ages of 12 to 17 years presenting to a large urban pediatric emergency department with high-risk chief complaints were enrolled in a prospective cohort over 13 months. Subjects completed a previously validated 6-item screening tool on an electronic tablet. The screening tool's sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify additional risk factors. RESULTS A total of 212 subjects were enrolled (72.6% female; median age: 15 years; interquartile range 13-16), of which 26 patients were subjected to child sex trafficking (prevalence: 12.3%). The sensitivity and specificity of the electronic screening tool were 84.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 70.8%-98.5%) and 53.2% (95% CI 46.1%-60.4%), respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 20.2% (95% CI 12.7%-27.7%) and 96.1% (95% CI 92.4%-99.9%), respectively. A previous suicide attempt and history of child abuse increased the odds of trafficking independent of those who screened positive but did not improve sensitivity of the tool. CONCLUSIONS A confidentially administered, previously validated, electronic screening tool was used to accurately identify sex trafficking among minors, suggesting that this modality of screening may be useful in busy clinical environments.","Hurst, Irene A; Abdoo, Denise C; Harpin, Scott; Leonard, Jan; Adelgais, Kathleen",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-013235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593847/,191

SBIRT screening included the completion of the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression risk, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale, a question on average amount of screen time daily, and the S2BI for substance use. Analyses included t-tests and chi-squares to examine demographic differences across variables, bivariate correlations among independent variables to assess for use within regression analyses, and stepwise linear regressions to examine relations between depression risk, anxiety risk, screen time and substance use. Analyses were examined using the full sample as well as those who scored positive for mild mental health symptoms. Median screen time was 3 to 4 h daily, 29% met criteria for mental health problems or risky substance use with high comorbidity of depression and anxiety risk. Findings demonstrated a significant risk of increased substance use associated with depression risk, severe anxiety risk, and screen time. Anxiety risk alone was not related to substance use risk when accounting for depression risk. Routine screening for depression, other mental health concerns, screen time and substance use is critical in supporting adolescent health and development, especially given comorbidity and their relative contributions. Interventions aimed at decreasing screen time, and identifying mental health problems may aid in decreasing substance use risk in adolescents.","Cioffredi, Leigh-Anne; Kamon, Jody; Turner, Win",Preventive medicine reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898206/,191

Nowadays, it has been clearly demonstrated that Apo D expression is induced and its subcellular location undergoes modifications in stressful and pathological conditions that characterize aging processes and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present work was to study in detail the effect of H2O2 on the subcellular location of Apo D, in the hippocampal cell line HT22, by structural, ultrastructural, immunocytochemical, and molecular techniques in order to characterize the Apo D distribution pattern in neurons during oxidative stress. Our results indicate that Apo D is located in the cytoplasm under physiological conditions but treatment with H2O2 induces apoptosis and causes a displacement of Apo D location to the nucleus, coinciding with DNA fragmentation. In addition, we demonstrated that Apo D tends to accumulate around the nuclear envelope in neurons and glial cells of different brain areas in some neurodegenerative diseases and during human aging, but never inside the nucleus. These data suggest that the presence of Apo D in the nucleus, which some authors related with a specific transport, is a consequence of structural and functional alterations during oxidative stress and not the result of a specific role in the regulation of nuclear processes.","Martínez-Pinilla, Eva; Navarro, Ana; Ordóñez, Cristina; del Valle, Eva; Tolivia, Jorge",Acta histochemica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acthis.2015.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25953740/,191

Methods A retrospective study and analysis of patients undergoing hernia repair using an open CS (OCS) and endoscopically assisted CS (ECS) technique, respectively, from 2011 to 2016 at the Rostock University Medical Center. Patients underwent a mesh-based sublay reinforcement following a distinct CS with closure of the linea alba. Patient characteristics, technical details, and short-term postoperative outcomes were determined by a physician chart review. A health-related QoL survey (EQ-5D) including a pain assessment was evaluated at a median of 19.5 months postoperatively. Results Thirty-five patients had a CS: 25 OCS and 10 ECS. Perioperative variables were comparable except for the median defect size (169 cm2 OCS vs. 86 cm2 ECS; p < 0.05) and maximum width of hernia (25 vs. 13 cm). Hospitalization lasted 16.6 days in the OCS group and 7.9 days in the endoscopic group (p = 0.04). Wound complications occurred in 24% of OCS and 10% of ECS patients. Conclusions Patients in the ECS group had a shorter hospital stay and less minor and major wound complications. These advantages led to a faster recovery directly affecting the QoL in the ECS group. This effect diminishes in the long-term follow-up with a positive trend towards the OCS technique.","Philipp, Mark; Leuchter, Matthias; Klar, Ernst",Visceral medicine,https://doi.org/10.1159/000505247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33005659/,191
122917,Robot-assisted segmental resection for intralobar pulmonary sequestration.,2016,"Medical devices are generally made of polyvinyl chloride plasticized by six authorized plasticizers as alternatives to di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) classified as reprotoxic class 1b. These are acetyl tri-n-butyl citrate (ATBC), di-(2-ethylhexy) adipate (DEHA), di-(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT), di-isononyl cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH), di-isononyl phthalate (DINP), and tri-octyl trimellitate (TOTM). The main objective of this study was to propose a new method using 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine and quantify these seven plasticizers in PVC sheets, standard infusion tubings, and commercially available medical devices. Two techniques were compared: dissolution in deuterated tetrahydrofuran and extraction by deuterated chloroform. Plasticizer 1H NMR spectra were very similar in both deuterated solvents; dissolution and extraction provided similar results. The sensitivity of this method enabled us to detect and quantify the presence of minor plasticizers in PVC. In nine commercially available samples, the major plasticizer was identified and quantified by 1H NMR. In six samples, one, two, or three minor plasticizers were identified and also quantified. DEHP was detected in only one tubing. NMR is therefore very convenient for studying plasticizers contained in medical devices. Only small quantities of solvents and sample are required. It is not necessary to dilute samples to enter a quantification range, and it is sufficiently sensitive to detect contaminants.","Genay, Stéphanie; Feutry, Frédéric; Masse, Morgane; Barthélémy, Christine; Sautou, Valérie; Odou, Pascal; Décaudin, Bertrand; Azaroual, Nathalie",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-016-0053-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27822646/,191

Studies have documented the benefits of chemotherapy administered after resection, but a number of questions remain regarding how overall outcomes can be further improved. To provide the oncology community with direction on these issues, a consensus conference of leading experts in the NSCLC field was held at the Fifth Annual Atlanta Lung Cancer Symposium on October 25-27, 2007. The available scientific literature is presented and when such literature is lacking, clinical experience is provided to support the following conclusions. Preoperative staging should be done in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, but endoscopic fine needle aspiration of enlarged mediastinal nodes can be used, and if histology is positive for malignancy, mediastinoscopy can be avoided. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy is not generally recommended but can be considered to downstage an unresectable patient. There is currently no role for preoperative radiation or chemoradiation. Adjuvant systemic therapy is not recommended for stage IA and IB patients; however, adverse prognostic factors are acceptable reasons to consider adjuvant systemic therapy in the latter. Adjuvant systemic therapy is recommended for stage IIA, IIB, and IIIA patients, consistent with recent American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines. A cisplatin-based regimen should be started within 60 days after surgery, but if relatively contraindicated, carboplatin is an acceptable alternative. Adjuvant radiation therapy is not recommended for N0 and N1 patients, but is used in N2 patients to decrease local recurrence.","Bordoni, Rodolfo",The oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2008-0062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18779538/,191
123622,Clinical and microbial spectrum of community-acquired pneumonia in children of north India.,2020-11-25,"The nutrition situation in Sudan is one of the worst in northeast Africa and it is characterized by persistently high levels of acute and chronic malnutrition that have increased over the last two decades. The underlying causes of malnutrition are multi-sectoral and are mainly due to inequalities, inadequate food practices, and limited access to healthcare services. Based on the report The Economic and Social Impacts of Child Undernutrition in Sudan, this study assesses the impact that malnutrition has on health, education, and productivity in Sudan. The country is estimated to have lost an equivalent of about 11.6 billion Sudanese pound in 2014, which represented 2.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Productivity-related losses contributed the largest costs at 1.5% of GDP followed by health and education sectors at 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively. In 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic further exposed the fragility of Sudan's health, social, and economic system. It is mandatory that all stakeholders address child nutrition as a main concern and stunting is incorporated in the center of the development agenda. In particular, the national development frameworks should be updated to ensure the reduction of the stunting prevalence and to put in place a comprehensive multi-sectoral nutrition policy, strategy, and plan of action.","Abu-Fatima, Osman; Abbas, Akram Abdel Gayoum; Racalbuto, Vincenzo; Smith, Lee; Pizzol, Damiano",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350372/,191

A better understanding of cause-specific mortality in this population is needed to inform comprehensive responses. Objective To estimate all-cause and cause-specific crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) among people using extramedical opioids, including age- and sex-specific estimates when possible. Data Sources For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for studies published from January 1, 2009, to October 3, 2019, and an earlier systematic review on this topic published in 2011. Study Selection Cohort studies of people using extramedical opioids and reporting mortality outcomes were screened for inclusion independently by 2 team members. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted by a team member and checked by another team member. Study quality was assessed using a custom set of items that examined risk of bias and quality of reporting. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis models. Heterogeneity was assessed using stratified meta-analyses and meta-regression. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcome measures were all-cause and cause-specific CMRs and SMRs among people using extramedical opioids compared with the general population of the same age and sex. Results Of 8683 identified studies, 124 were included in this analysis (100 primary studies and 24 studies providing additional data for primary studies). The pooled all-cause CMR, based on 99 cohorts of 1 262 592 people, was 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.4-1.8 per 100 person-years), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 99.7%). Heterogeneity was associated with the proportion of the study sample that injected opioids or was living with HIV infection or hepatitis C. The pooled all-cause SMR, based on 43 cohorts, was 10.0 (95% CI, 7.6-13.2). Excess mortality was observed across a range of causes, including overdose, injuries, and infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that people using extramedical opioids experience significant excess mortality, much of which is preventable. The range of causes for which excess mortality was observed highlights the multiplicity of risk exposures experienced by this population and the need for comprehensive responses to address these. Better data on cause-specific mortality in this population in several world regions appear to be needed.","Larney, Sarah; Tran, Lucy Thi; Leung, Janni; Santo, Thomas; Santomauro, Damian; Hickman, Matt; Peacock, Amy; Stockings, Emily; Degenhardt, Louisa",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.4170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31876906/,191
124777,Refined ultrasonographic criteria for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,2021-03-24,"Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Particularly in adult patients, the vast majority of gliomas belongs to the heterogeneous group of diffuse gliomas, i.e. glial tumors characterized by diffuse infiltrative growth in the preexistent brain tissue. Unfortunately, glioblastoma, the most aggressive (WHO grade IV) diffuse glioma is also by far the most frequent one. After standard treatment, the 2-year overall survival of glioblastoma patients is approximately only 25%. Advanced knowledge in the molecular pathology underlying malignant transformation has offered new handles and better treatments for several cancer types. Unfortunately, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients have not yet profited as although numerous experimental drugs have been tested in clinical trials, all failed miserably. This grim prognosis for GBM is at least partly due to the lack of successful drug delivery across the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). The human brain comprises over 100 billion capillaries with a total length of 400 miles, a total surface area of 20 m(2) and a median inter-capillary distance of about 50 μm, making it the best perfused organ in the body. The BBTB encompasses existing and newly formed blood vessels that contribute to the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor and facilitate glioma cell migration to other parts of the brain. The high metabolic demands of high-grade glioma create hypoxic areas that trigger increased expression of VEGF and angiogenesis, leading to the formation of abnormal vessels and a dysfunctional BBTB. Even though the BBTB is considered 'leaky' in the core part of glioblastomas, in large parts of glioblastomas and, even more so, in lower grade diffuse gliomas the BBTB more closely resembles the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and prevents efficient passage of cancer therapeutics, including small molecules and antibodies. Thus, many drugs can still be blocked from reaching the many infiltrative glioblastoma cells that demonstrate 'within-organ-metastasis' away from the core part to brain areas displaying a more organized and less leaky BBTB. Hence, drug delivery in glioblastoma deserves explicit attention as otherwise new experimental therapies will continue to fail. In the current review we highlight different aspects of the BBTB in glioma patients and preclinical models and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of drug delivery approaches for the treatment of glioma patients. We provide an overview on methods to overcome the BBTB, including osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), bradykinin receptor-mediated BBTB opening, inhibition of multidrug efflux transporters, receptor-mediated transport systems and physiological circumvention of the BBTB. While our knowledge about the molecular biology of glioma cells is rapidly expanding and is, to some extent, already assisting us in the design of tumor-tailored therapeutics, we are still struggling to develop modalities to expose the entire tumor to such therapeutics at pharmacologically meaningful quantities. Therefore, we must expand our knowledge about the fundamentals of the BBTB as a step toward the design of practical and safe devices and approaches for enhanced drug delivery into the diseased brain area.","van Tellingen, O; Yetkin-Arik, B; de Gooijer, M C; Wesseling, P; Wurdinger, T; de Vries, H E",Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drup.2015.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25791797/,191

The Comaneci device confers the same benefits as balloon remodeling but without the risks of parent artery occlusion. This alleviates time pressure on the clinician, and could reduce the risk of parent artery thrombosis. Three patients were treated with the Comaneci device. Two patients had acute ruptured posterior communicating aneurysms and one patient was treated electively for a carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm. Excellent occlusion of all three aneurysms was obtained. One patient developed a distal middle cerebral artery clot, that was treated with intravenous aspirin, with minor neurological consequences. These early results show that the Comaneci device can be used to achieve good cerebral aneurysm occlusion. Vessel patency is maintained throughout the procedure with potential advantages over conventional balloon assisted coiling.","Lawson, Aimee Louise Deborah; Chandran, Arun; Puthuran, Mani; Goddard, Tony; Nahser, Hans; Patankar, Tufail",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011726.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26138730/,191

Norovirus (NoV) and sapovirus (SaV) have been sporadically reported to cause chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. METHODS We undertook a retrospective study (2008-2009) to examine the clinical and epidemiologic significance of NoV and SaV infections in adult renal transplant recipients hospitalized for acute or chronic diarrhea. RESULTS Ninety-six renal transplant recipients were hospitalized for diarrhea at our institution during a 16-month period, 87 of whom were included in the study, including 46 patients with chronic diarrhea. Among 41 patients with unexplained diarrhea, 20 patients were screened for NoV/SaV, 16 of whom were positive. Fifteen of them (94%) had chronic diarrhea. When compared with bacterial and parasitic infections, NoV/SaV infections were associated with a greater weight loss at the time of admission, a 8.7-fold longer duration of symptoms and a more frequent need for mycophenolic acid dosage reduction. Eighty-one percent of patients hospitalized for NoV/SaV-associated diarrhea experienced acute renal failure. Five and one patients subsequently had biopsy-diagnosed active graft rejection and oxalate nephropathy, respectively. Ten of the 14 patients who underwent a longitudinal study of NoV/SaV stool's clearance exhibited a prolonged viral shedding period with a median time of 289 days (107-581 days). CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that NoV/SaV infection causes posttransplant chronic diarrhea potentially complicated by severe kidney graft impairment.","Roos-Weil, Damien; Ambert-Balay, Katia; Lanternier, Fanny; Mamzer-Bruneel, Marie-France; Nochy, Dominique; Pothier, Pierre; Avettand-Fenoel, Véronique; Anglicheau, Dany; Snanoudj, Renaud; Bererhi, Lynda; Thervet, Eric; Lecuit, Marc; Legendre, Christophe; Lortholary, Olivier; Zuber, Julien",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0b013e31821c9392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21555974/,191

MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2003-2011, 89 patients with HCC received a combination therapy-transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus RF ablation in 38 patients and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus MW ablation in 51 patients. Local tumor response, tumor progression-free survival (PFS), overall PFS, overall survival (OS), and complications were compared. Overall PFS and OS were compared between the two treatment groups in multivariate analysis controlling for Child-Pugh class, Barcelona Clinic Liver Classification stage, and index tumor size. RESULTS Complete local tumor response was achieved in 37 (80.4%) of the tumors treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus RF ablation and 49 (76.6%) of the tumors treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus MW ablation (P = .67). The median tumor PFS and overall PFS were 20.8 months and 9.3 months (P = .72) for transarterial chemoembolization plus RF ablation and 21.8 months and 9.2 months for transarterial chemoembolization plus MW ablation (P = .32). The median OS of the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus RF ablation group was 23.3 months, and the median OS of the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus MW ablation group was 42.6 months, with no significant difference in the survival experience between the two groups (log-rank test, P = .10). In the multivariate analysis, Barcelona Clinic Liver Classification stage was the only factor associated with overall PFS and OS. One patient in the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus RF ablation cohort (3%) and two patients in the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus MW ablation cohort (4%) required prolonged hospitalization (< 48 h) for pain management after the procedure (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS Based on similar safety and efficacy outcomes, both combination therapies, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus RF ablation and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization plus MW ablation, are effective treatments for HCC.","Ginsburg, Michael; Zivin, Sean P; Wroblewski, Kristen; Doshi, Taral; Vasnani, Raj J; Van Ha, Thuong G",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2014.10.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25534635/,191

Ultrasonically activated dissectors (UADs) and radiofrequency-based devices have been considered excellent surgical devices because of their reliability and flexibility. Meanwhile, microwave-based devices have demonstrated potential with their unique heating mechanism. This study aims to compare the sealing function of a newly invented forceps-like microwave sealer (MS) with that of currently available UADs. Materials and Methods. MS and 2 examples of UADs (Harmonic Focus+ [HF+] and Sonicision [SNC]) were employed to perform mesenterectomies (in vivo) and sealing sizable vessels (ex vivo). Vessel diameter, seal time, burst pressure (BP), sealing completion, and instrument sticking were recorded. The samples underwent histological investigation for thermal damage evaluation. Results. During mesenterectomies, MS required 3 seconds and 30 W to secure a complete seal. The BP achieved by the MS seal was higher than that of HF+ and SNC on arteries (851 ± 203.7 vs 682.4 ± 287.3, P < .05; vs 833.1 ± 251.2 mmHg, P = .4523, respectively) but was not statistically different on veins (324.9 ± 203.5 vs 460.1 ± 320.3 vs 508.3 ± 350.7 mmHg, P = .215). In all trials, MS caused less sticking but exhibited similar heat-induced alterations to UADs. MS's thermal spread was not statistically more extended than that of UADs on either arteries or veins. Conclusions. MS was capable of not only sealing tiny vessels but also achieving high-pressure endurance on sizable vessels. Its forceful grasping and synchronous heating process helped create solid stumps with an acceptable thermal spread.","Dang, Khiem Tran; Naka, Shigeyuki; Yamada, Atsushi; Mukaisho, Ken-Ichi; Tani, Tohru",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350620937860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614282/,191

However, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been examined among minorities in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, explores stress among the Arab minority in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its association with the population's perceived COVID-19 threat, trust in the healthcare system, adherence to preventative guidelines, and perceived discrimination.The study analyzed a cross-sectional online survey of 626 Israeli Arabs. Most participants (65%) reported moderate levels of stress, and 10% reported severe levels. The Bedouin population reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other minority groups. The participants also reported a high degree of perceived threat, a moderate-to-high level of discrimination, a moderate level of trust in the healthcare system, and very high adherence to guidelines.Hierarchical regression analysis showed that age, religion, trust in the healthcare system, perceived threat, and adherence to guidelines were all significant predictors of stress [F(11,600), p < .001]. The model explained 24% of the variance in stress. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the participants' perceived threat and trust mediated the association between their perceived discrimination and stress [indirect effect = 0.13, SE = 0.03 CI = (0.08, 0.18)], whereby discrimination was negatively associated with trust (β = -0.52), which, in turn, was negatively associated with stress (β = -0.10). Furthermore, discrimination was positively associated with perceived threat (β = 0.21), which, in turn, was positively associated with stress (β = 0.35). Discrimination is an important social determinant of health - especially during health emergencies when trust in healthcare systems and perceived threats are crucial. As such, our findings could assist policymakers in developing fair policies that are tailored to various population groups and that may reduce stress levels among minorities, thereby improving both their mental and physical health.","Satran, Carmit; Ali-Saleh, Ola; Mashiach-Eizenberg, Michal; Bord, Shiran",Ethnicity & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2021.1899139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734913/,191

132043,"Proton pump inhibitors decrease eotaxin-3/CCL26 expression in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: Possible role of the nongastric H,K-ATPase.",2017,"BACKGROUND Population prevalence estimates by the World Health Organisation suggest that 1 in 160 children worldwide has an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Accessing respite care services for children with an ASD can often be a daunting and exhaustive process, with parents sometimes forced to access acute hospital services as an initial point of contact for respite care or in a crisis situation. To gain an in-depth understanding of accessing respite care for children with an ASD, from the perspectives of parents, a systematic review of the evidence on parent's experiences and views of respite care for children with an ASD at the acute and primary interface was undertaken. METHODS Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO were systematically searched. Studies identified as relevant based on predetermined eligibility criteria were selected for inclusion. The search strategy also targeted unpublished studies and grey literature. Qualitative data and qualitative components of mixed method studies that represented the experiences of parents accessing respite care for children with an ASD were eligible for inclusion. A meta-aggregative approach was used during data synthesis. RESULTS Database searching elicited 430 records of which 291 studies remained after removal of duplicates. These 291 studies were screened for title and abstract by two reviewers resulting in 31 studies to be screened at full text and assessed for eligibility. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and a further additional study also met the inclusion criteria during a manual search. As a result, 7 studies were selected for the review as set out in Fig. 1. CONCLUSION In the absence of appropriate services and defined pathways to support services such as respite care, overwhelmed parents and community providers of mental health resources may not be in a position to meet the specific needs of children with an ASD and their families which may be contributing to a direct increase in hospitalizations.

134908,Managing pulmonary complications in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,2018,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to determine if contrast enhancement is necessary for MRI surveillance of clinical T1a (cT1a) solid renal masses. MATERIALS AND METHODS. With institutional review board approval, 36 patients who underwent two or more contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI examinations (median, four examinations; range, two to 10 examinations) for surveillance of 39 cT1a solid renal masses between 2009 and 2019 (median time between scans, 2 years; range, 1-7 years) were evaluated. Two radiologists independently measured renal mass size and assessed tumor stage in two sessions for baseline and follow-up examinations using T1-weighted nephrographic phase CE-MRI and unenhanced single-shot T2-weighted MRI in mixed order with a 4-week washout period. Comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon sign-rank test and Pearson correlation. Bland-Altman and intraclass correlation determined interobserver agreement. RESULTS. Mean size ± SD of renal masses on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were 18 ± 5 mm (range, 9-37 mm) and 18 ± 5 mm (range, 9-37 mm) for radiologist 1 and 19 ± 7 mm (range, 10-39 mm) and 19 ± 6 mm (range, 10-39 mm) for radiologist 2 with near perfect correlation (for radiologist 1, β = 0.9897; for radiologist 2, β = 0.9317; p < .001). Interob-server agreement for measurements comparing radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 on CEMRI and T2-weighted MRI and intraobserver agreement for measurements on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were excellent. Mean growth rate of renal masses measured on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were 2 ± 2 mm (range, -5 to 8 mm) and 2 ± 3 mm (range, -3 to 8 mm) for radiologist 1 and 3 ± 5 mm (range, -1 to 18 mm) and 3 ± 6 mm (range, -1 to 24 mm) for radiologist 2 with high correlation (for radiologist 1, β = 0.8313 [p < .001]; for radiologist 2, β = 0.848 [p = .002]). At baseline, all tumors were subjectively cT1a on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI (p > .99, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 1). During follow-up, one mass progressed to T3 on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI for radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 (p > .99, ICC = 1). CONCLUSION. In this study, size measurements on unenhanced T2-weighted MRI had near perfect correlation to measurements using CE-MRI in cT1a solid renal masses undergoing surveillance, with high agreement between and within observers. Clinical staging did not differ comparing T2-weighted MRI and CE-MRI, with near perfect agreement. Contrast enhancement is not necessary for follow-up size measurements in cT1a solid renal masses with MRI.","Mawi, Hatem; Narine, Rishi; Schieda, Nicola",AJR.

Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic, by analyzing the results of 70 paired self-administered vs standard telephone-administered ALSFRS-R, we calculated overall score, single item scores, ALSFRS-R domain scores, King's and MiToS stage inter-rater agreement and reliability using different validated methods. We created the Italian version of self-administered ALSFRS-R following ENCALS recommendation. Results: Correlation between the two scales was 0.94 and no systematic directional bias was found. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was very high (>0.90) for the vast majority of the considered classification criteria, especially King's total score (0.96) and MiToS score (0.94). A higher ICC was found when the patients answered the questionnaire with the caregiver's help (0.95). Conclusions: Online self-administered ALSFRS-R scale is a valid tool to stratify ALS patients into clinical stages and to implement telemedicine monitoring.","Manera, Umberto; Cabras, Sara; Daviddi, Margherita; Vasta, Rosario; Torrieri, Maria Claudia; Palumbo, Francesca; Bombaci, Alessandro; Grassano, Maurizio; Solero, Luca; Peotta, Laura; Iazzolino, Barbara; Canosa, Antonio; Calvo, Andrea; Chiò, Adriano; Moglia, Cristina",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,https://doi.org/10.1080/21678421.2020.1813307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856494/,191

Early reversal of the defunctioning ileostomy has been proposed as a method of mitigating these problems. We aimed to evaluate the safety of early ileostomy closure within 6 weeks. METHOD Randomized controlled trials investigating the safety of early ileostomy closure were identified through a systematic search and review of the current literature. Meta-analysis of the extracted outcome data was performed, and the methodological quality of the individual studies was assessed. RESULTS The search identified six eligible studies yielding a total of 528 patients, with 269 in the early closure (EC) group and 259 in the standard closure (SC) group. Major complications in the EC group was 5.2% compared with 3.6% in the SC group (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.33-3.79). Anastomotic leakage in the EC group was 3.3% compared with 3.5% in the SC group (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.29-2.75). The meta-analysis resulted in no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the primary or secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION This review was not able to discern a statistically significant difference in postoperative complications when comparing early and standard ileostomy closure. The current literature indicates that early ileostomy closure is not associated with higher complication rates in patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course and radiologically verified intact distal anastomosis after index surgery.","Clausen, Frederik Bjerg; Dohrn, Niclas; Hölmich, Emma Rosenkrantz; Klein, Mads; Gögenur, Ismail",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-020-03761-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970178/,191

Clinically, advanced age and cardiovascular comorbidities are the most important risk factors. Objective To determine whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), an age-associated condition with excess cardiovascular risk defined as the presence of an expanded, mutated somatic blood cell clone in persons without other hematological abnormalities, may be associated with an inflammatory gene expression sensitizing monocytes to aggravated immune responses. Design, Setting, and Participants This hypothesis-generating diagnostic study examined a cohort of patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure, as well as age-matched healthy control participants. Single-cell RNA sequencing and analyses of circulating peripheral monocytes was done between 2017 and 2019 to assess the transcriptome of circulating monocytes. Exposures Severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure. Main Outcomes and Measures CHIP-driver sequence variations in monocytes with a proinflammatory signature of genes involved in cytokine release syndrome. Results The study included 8 patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis, 6 with chronic postinfarction heart failure, and 3 healthy control participants. Their mean age was 75.7 (range, 54-89) years, and 6 were women. Mean CHIP-driver gene variant allele frequency was 4.2% (range, 2.5%-6.9%) for DNMT3A and 14.3% (range, 2.6%-37.4%) for TET2. Participants with DNMT3A or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations displayed increased expression of interleukin 1β (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 1.6217 normalized Unique Molecular Identifiers [nUMI]; DNMT3A, 5.3956 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 10.8216 nUMI; P < .001), the interleukin 6 receptor (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5386 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9162 nUMI; P < .001;TET2, 0.5738 nUMI; P < .001), as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome complex (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.4797 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9961 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 1.2189 nUMI; P < .001), plus upregulation of CD163 (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5239 nUMI; DNMT3A, 1.4722 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 1.0684 nUMI; P < .001), a cellular receptor capable of mediating infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and other genes involved in cytokine response syndrome. Gene ontology term analyses of regulated genes revealed that the most significantly upregulated genes encode for leukocyte-activation and interleukin-signaling pathways in monocytes of individuals with DNMT3A (myeloid leukocyte activation: log[Q value], -50.1986; log P value, -54.5177; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -21.0264; log P value, -24.1993; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -18.0710: log P value, -21.1597) or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations (immune response: log[Q value], -36.3673; log P value, -40.6864; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -13.1733; log P value, -16.3463; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -12.6547: log P value, -15.7977). Conclusions and Relevance Monocytes of individuals who carry CHIP-driver sequence variations and have cardiovascular disease appear to be primed for excessive inflammatory responses.

138252,Transparency of TEE3D surface rendering helps to assess the scale of hidden disaster.,2021-03-28,"BACKGROUND Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Most drug therapies, to date, have focused on targeting the amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathway, but clinical outcomes of anti-Aβ antibodies have been unsuccessful and unable to meet their primary endpoints. Similar trends have also been observed in treatments that target the tau pathway. SUMMARY This paper reviews recent anti-Aβ passive monotherapies, since Bapineuzumab, that have progressed to phase 3 clinical trials. Specifically, we discuss the 4 clinical trial programs of Solanezumab (targets Aβ monomers), Aducanumab (targets Aβ oligomers and plaques), Crenezumab (targets Aβ oligomers), and Gantenerumab (targets Aβ fibrils) which are all exogenous monoclonal antibodies. We conclude with potential reasons for why they have not met their primary endpoints and discuss lessons learnt from these trials. Key Message: Future disease-modifying trials (DMTs) for AD should be conducted in asymptomatic, Aβ-positive individuals. Moreover, potential additive and/or synergistic benefits focusing on anti-Aβ and anti-tau drug combinations merit further investigation.","Tian Hui Kwan, Angela; Arfaie, Saman; Therriault, Joseph; Rosa-Neto, Pedro; Gauthier, Serge",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321511/,191

140367,Prevalence and seasonal distribution of viral etiology of respiratory tract infections in inpatients and outpatients of the pediatric population: 10 year follow-up.,2018,"A key controversy in the COVID-19 pandemic has been over staff safety in health and social care settings. Anaesthetists and intensivists were anticipated to be at the highest risk of work-related infection due to involvement in airway management and management of critical illness and therefore wear the highest levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the hospital. However, the data clearly show that those working in anaesthesia and critical care settings are at lower risk of infection, harm and death from COVID-19 than colleagues working on the wards. The observed safety of anaesthetists and intensivists and increased risk to those in other patient-facing roles has implications for transmission-based infection control precautions. The precautionary principle supports extending training in and use of airborne precaution PPE to all staff working in patient-facing roles who have close contact with coughing patients. This will both reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19, maintain services and reduce nosocomial transmission to vulnerable patients. The emergence of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with significantly higher transmissibility creates urgency to addressing this matter.","Cook, Tim M; El-Boghdadly, Kariem; Brown, Jules; Pickering, Anthony E",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509933/,191

142113,Nasal cromolyn in the treatment of rhinitis.,2020-09-01,"OBJECTIVE A dominant sigmoid sinus with focal dehiscence or thinning (DSSD/T) of the overlying bony wall is a commonly encountered, but frequently overlooked, cause of vascular pulsatile tinnitus (VPT). Also, the pathophysiological mechanism of sound perception in patients with VPT remains poorly understood. In the present study, a novel surgical method, termed transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery, was introduced to ameliorate VPT in patients with DSSD/T. The authors reviewed a case series, analyzed the surgical outcomes, and suggested the pathophysiological mechanism of sound perception. The theoretical background underlying VPT improvement after transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery was also explored. METHODS Eight patients with VPT that was considered attributable to DSSD/T underwent transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery between February 2010 and February 2015. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 9.5 months (range 4-13 months). Transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery featured simple mastoidectomy, partial compression of the SS using harvested cortical bone chips, and reinforcement of the bony SS wall with bone cement. Perioperative medical records, imaging results, and audiological findings were comprehensively reviewed. RESULTS In 7 of the 8 patients (87.5%), the VPT abated immediately after surgery. Statistically significant improvements in tinnitus loudness and distress were evident on numeric rating scales. Three patients with preoperative ipsilesional low-frequency hearing loss exhibited postoperative improvements in their low-frequency hearing thresholds. No major postoperative complications were encountered except in the first subject, who experienced increased intracranial pressure postoperatively. This subsided after a revision operation for partial decompression of the SS. CONCLUSIONS Transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery may be a good surgical option in patients with DSSD/T, a previously unrecognized cause of VPT. Redistribution of severely asymmetrical blood flow, reinforcement of the bony SS wall with bone cement to reconstruct a soundproof barrier, and disconnection of a problematic sound conduction route via simple mastoidectomy silence VPT.","Kim, Chong Sun; Kim, So Young; Choi, Hyunseok; Koo, Ja-Won; Yoo, Shin-Young; An, Gwang Seok; Lee, Kyogu; Choi, Inyong; Song, Jae-Jin",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.6.jns15961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26745481/,191

The extent and types of randomized controlled trials (RCT)-our most reliable source of clinical evidence-conducted in these high-risk patients over recent years are largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a systematic review, identifying all RCTs published in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from 1995 to 2014 that focused on the acute treatment of nontraumatic cardiac arrest in adults. We then extracted data on the setting of study populations, types and timing of interventions studied, risk of bias, outcomes reported, and how these factors have changed over time. Over this 20-year period, 92 RCTs were published containing 64 309 patients (median, 225.5 per trial). Of these, 81 RCTs (88.0%) involved out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whereas 4 (4.3%) involved in-hospital cardiac arrest and 7 (7.6%) included both. Eighteen RCTs (19.6%) were performed in the United States, 68 (73.9%) were performed outside the United States, and 6 (6.5%) were performed in both settings. Thirty-eight RCTs (41.3%) evaluated drug therapy, 39 (42.4%) evaluated device therapy, and 15 (16.3%) evaluated protocol improvements. Seventy-four RCTs (80.4%) examined interventions during the cardiac arrest, 15 (16.3%) examined post cardiac arrest treatment, and 3 (3.3%) studied both. Overall, reporting of the risk of bias was limited. The most common outcome reported was return of spontaneous circulation: 86 (93.5%) with only 22 (23.9%) reporting survival beyond 6 months. Fifty-three RCTs (57.6%) reported global ordinal outcomes, whereas 15 (16.3%) reported quality-of-life. RCTs in the past 5 years were more likely to be focused on protocol improvements and postcardiac arrest care. CONCLUSIONS Important gaps in RCTs of cardiac arrest treatments exist, especially those examining in-hospital cardiac arrest, protocol improvement, postcardiac arrest care, and long-term or quality-of-life outcomes.","Sinha, Shashank S; Sukul, Devraj; Lazarus, John J; Polavarapu, Vivek; Chan, Paul S; Neumar, Robert W; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K",Circulation.

143493,Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis associated with shock.,2020-10-30,"Alum, the only adjuvant approved for clinical applications, can induce strong humoral (Th2) but weak cellular (Th1) immune responses. It is necessary to develop safe and effective adjuvants capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. We previously showed that activation-associated protein-1 (ASP-1) derived from Onchocerca volvulus has potent adjuvant activity. In this study, we have further evaluated the adjuvanticity of recombinant ASP-1 using a panel of recombinant proteins or synthetic peptide-based antigens, including ovalbumin (OVA), synthetic HIV peptide (HIV-p), recombinant HIV gp41 (rgp41) and HBV HBsAg, as well as three commercially available inactivated vaccines against haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Influenza and Rabies. Our results indicate that ASP-1 induced significantly higher IgG1 (Th2-associated) and IgG2a (Th1-associated) responses than alum adjuvant against OVA antigen, HIV-p, and rgp41. Consistently, it induced similar level of IgG1 responses as alum but higher level of IgG2a and IFN-gamma-producing T cell responses than alum adjuvant against HBsAg. Further, ASP-1 improved both IgG1 and IgG2a responses to three commercial inactivated vaccines when used separately or in combination. In conclusion, the recombinant ASP-1, unlike alum adjuvant, is able to induce both Th1 and Th2-associated humoral responses and Th1 cellular responses, suggesting that it can be further developed as a promising adjuvant for subunit-based and inactivated vaccines.","Xiao, Wenjun; Du, Lanying; Liang, Chao; Guan, Jie; Jiang, Shibo; Lustigman, Sara; He, Yuxian; Zhou, Yusen",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.07.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18675867/,191

As residency time in the living body and methods of waste elimination are crucial to defining a good nanoparticle candidate and moving forward with steps for validation, this study was aimed at evaluating the biodistribution of these multimodal Gado-6Si-NP in rodents. Gado-6Si-NP were imaged following intravenous injection in control Wistar rats and mice using MRI (7 T), optical fluorescent imaging, and SPECT. A clear correlation was observed among MRI, optical imaging, and SPECT regarding the renal elimination. Quantitative biodistribution using gamma-counting of each sampled organ confirmed that these nanoparticles circulated freely in the blood pool and were rapidly cleared by renal excretion without accumulation in liver and RES uptake. These results demonstrate that Gado-6Si-NP display optimal biodistribution properties, enabling them to be developed as multimodal agents for in vivo imaging and theragnostics, especially in oncological applications.","Kryza, David; Taleb, Jacqueline; Janier, Marc; Marmuse, Laurence; Miladi, Imen; Bonazza, Pauline; Louis, Cédric; Perriat, Pascal; Roux, Stéphane; Tillement, Olivier; Billotey, Claire",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bc1005976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21545181/,191

We are in a period of unprecedented discovery with new large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) and accelerating discovery of risk genes. However, much of the observed heritability of ALS is undiscovered and we are not yet approaching elucidation of the total genetic architecture, which will be necessary for comprehensive disease subclassification. RECENT FINDINGS We summarize recent developments and discuss the future. New machine learning models will help to address nonlinear genetic interactions. Statistical power for genetic discovery may be boosted by reducing the search-space using cell-specific epigenetic profiles and expanding our scope to include genetically correlated phenotypes. Structural variation, somatic heterogeneity and consideration of environmental modifiers represent significant challenges which will require integration of multiple technologies and a multidisciplinary approach, including clinicians, geneticists and pathologists. SUMMARY The move away from fully penetrant Mendelian risk genes necessitates new experimental designs and new standards for validation.

The exposure group was divided into 3 groups according to their distance from the monitoring points. Physical examination, routine blood tests, and liver and renal function data were collected, and the DMF concentration in the air was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The prevalence of abnormal heart rhythm, electrocardiogram and B-mode ultrasound results in the exposure group was significantly greater than in the control group. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in the exposure group also were higher than those in the control group (P < .01). There was an effect of distance from leather factories on liver and kidney dysfunction in the 3 exposure groups. Compared with the exposure group at >3 km distance from the source, the prevalence of increased AST, ALT, and BUN in the exposure group at <1 km was significantly greater (P < .001). It was concluded that DMF exposure was related to an increased risk of a cardiac injury and liver and kidney dysfunction.","Hu, Zhi-Yong; Chang, Jie; Guo, Fei-Fei; Deng, Han-Yi; Pan, Guo-Tao; Li, Bing-Yan; Zhang, Zeng-Li",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629651/,191
147619,Corrigendum.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND The advent of COVID-19 increased attention to hand hygiene in prevention of disease transmission. To meet the increased demand for hand sanitizer during the pandemic, the US FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization allowing new manufacturers and importers to enter the market. Some of the newly introduced hand sanitizer products contained methanol in lieu of ethanol or isopropanol. We describe five patients with fatal methanol poisoning resulting from hand sanitizers improperly containing methanol. CASE SUMMARY Comparing a 5-month period from 2019 to the same time frame in 2020, the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center has seen an increase of 124% in exposures to hand sanitizer. Of these cases, 28% involved methanol-contaminated hand sanitizer. Five of these patients died from methanol poisoning. All five cases had similar clinical features with severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis and, in four patients, elevated osmolal gap. Methanol concentrations were consistently very elevated, but these results were not available before the patients succumbed. Four of the patients received fomepizole and adjunctive care. Two patients received emergency extracorporeal therapy. All five died despite maximal treatment efforts. CONCLUSION During the pandemic in 2020, there was a proliferation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers which contained methanol. Exposure to these products, which failed to meet regulatory standards, led to increased harm and death. Challenges to treatment of methanol poisoning, especially in rural areas, include lack of access to timely laboratory measurement of methanol concentrations and lack of available emergency hemodialysis without transfer of the patient.","Holzman, Sarah Denise; Larsen, Jaiva; Kaur, Ramandeep; Smelski, Geoffrey; Dudley, Steven; Shirazi, Farshad Mazda",Clinical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2021.1895202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33755514/,191

The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel. It is a major component of brain nicotinic receptors displays that are blocked by and sensitive to alpha-bungarotoxin. Studies reports involvement of CHRNA7 protein in different neurological diseases. Non-availability of 3-dimensional (3D) structure leads the study toward structure 3D prediction along with its interaction analysis. The current paper is focused on the structure prediction through homology modeling of CHRNA7 along with binding site prediction using Schrödinger software suite. In continuation of the study, protein-protein interaction analysis is carried out by using string database. Tertiary structure along with binding sites was obtained, and visualized CHRAN7 protein have interaction with CHRNA protein family along with JAK2, AKT1, PICK1 protein that are involved in neurological disease. Structure formation analysis is an important aspect of proteomics studies. Hence, this predicted structure can be used for further advance studies and drug designing. Protein interaction analysis shows that CHRNA7 protein also interact with AKT1 protein which regulate neuronal differentiation and development, that signifies the role of CHRNA7 protein in neurological diseases.","Yadav, Ruchi; Deepshikha, Deepshikha; Srivastava, Prachi",Annals of neurosciences,https://doi.org/10.1159/000477155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867899/,191

Here we report quantum walks of biphoton frequency combs where the duration of the walk, or circuit depth, is tunable over a continuous range without any change to the physical footprint of the system-a feature absent from previous photonic implementations. In our platform, entangled photon pairs hop between discrete frequency modes with the coupling between these modes mediated by electro-optic modulation of the waveguide refractive index. Through control of the phase across different modes, we demonstrate a rich variety of behavior: from walks exhibiting enhanced ballistic transport or strong energy confinement, to subspaces featuring scattering centers or local traps. We also explore the role of entanglement dimensionality in the creation of energy bound states, which illustrates the potential for these walks to quantify high-dimensional entanglement.","Imany, Poolad; Lingaraju, Navin B; Alshaykh, Mohammed S; Leaird, Daniel E; Weiner, Andrew M",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba8066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832628/,191
150783,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: from a vasoactive peptide to the gatekeeper of a global pandemic.,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND Novel rationales for randomizing clusters rather than individuals appear to be emerging from the push for more pragmatic trials, for example, to facilitate trial recruitment, reduce the costs of research, and improve external validity. Such rationales may be driven by a mistaken perception that choosing cluster randomization lessens the need for informed consent. We reviewed a random sample of published cluster randomized trials involving only individual-level health care interventions to determine (a) the prevalence of reporting a rationale for the choice of cluster randomization; (b) the types of explicit, or if absent, apparent rationales for the use of cluster randomization; (c) the prevalence of reporting patient informed consent for study interventions; and (d) the types of justifications provided for waivers of consent. We considered cluster randomized trials for evaluating exclusively the individual-level health care interventions to focus on clinical trials where individual randomization is only theoretically possible and where there is a general expectation of informed consent. METHODS A random sample of 40 cluster randomized trials were identified by implementing a validated electronic search filter in two electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE and Embase), with two reviewers independently extracting information from each trial. Inclusion criteria were the following: primary report of a cluster randomized trial, evaluating exclusively an individual-level health care intervention, published between 2007 and 2016, and conducted in Canada, the United States, European Union, Australia, or low- and middle-income country settings. RESULTS Twenty-five trials (62.5%, 95% confidence interval = 47.5%-77.5%) reported an explicit rationale for the use of cluster randomization. The most commonly reported rationales were those with logistical or administrative convenience (15 trials, 60%) and those that need to avoid contamination (13 trials, 52%); five trials (20%) were cited rationales related to the push for more pragmatic trials. Twenty-one trials (52.5%, 95% confidence interval = 37%-68%) reported written informed consent for the intervention, two (5%) reported verbal consent, and eight (20%) reported waivers of consent, while in nine trials (22.5%) consent was unclear or not mentioned. Reported justifications for waivers of consent included that study interventions were already used in clinical practice, patients were not randomized individually, and the need to facilitate the pragmatic nature of the trial. Only one trial reported an explicit and appropriate justification for waiver of consent based on minimum criteria in international research ethics guidelines, namely, infeasibility and minimal risk. CONCLUSION Rationales for adopting cluster over individual randomization and for adopting consent waivers are emerging, related to the need to facilitate pragmatic trials. Greater attention to clear reporting of study design rationales, informed consent procedures, as well as justification for waivers is needed to ensure that such trials meet appropriate ethical standards.","Taljaard, Monica; Goldstein, Cory E; Giraudeau, Bruno; Nicholls, Stuart G; Carroll, Kelly; Hey, Spencer Phillips; Brehaut, Jamie C; Jairath, Vipul; London, Alex John; Eldridge, Sandra M; Grimshaw, Jeremy M; Fergusson, Dean A; Weijer, Charles",Clinical trials,https://doi.org/10.1177/1740774519896799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367741/,191

Macrophages swallow oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to promote foam cell formation. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) has been reported to take part in atherosclerotic development. However, the effects of PAR2 in macrophages were rarely investigated. In this study, human monocyte, THP-1 was induced to macrophages by using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Subsequently, an in vitro model was arranged by using ox-LDL to treat the macrophages. The data showed that inhibition of PAR2 reduced ox-LDL-induced foam cell formation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Additionally, ox-LDL increased PAR2 and inhibited Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) expression, which is a Wnt signaling inhibitor. PAR2 knocked-down decreased DKK1 and enhanced expression of Wnt3a, β-catenin. Meanwhile, DKK1 overexpression reversed the effects of PAR2 on foam cell formation, inflammation, and apoptosis. In summary, PAR2 is essential for the formation of foam cells, inflammation, and apoptosis in macrophages which plays a critical role during atherosclerosis. PAR2 plays roles in macrophages treated with ox-LDL via DKK1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling.","Liu, Yongsheng; Wei, Mei; Liu, Gang; Song, Chunmei; Yang, Man; Cao, Zelong; Zheng, Mingq",General physiology and biophysics,https://doi.org/10.4149/gpb_2020014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084597/,191

Due to constant evolution of respiratory bacteria and viruses, development of drug resistance and emerging pathogens, it constitutes a considerable health care threat. To enable development of novel strategies to control pneumonia, a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of interaction between host cells and infecting pathogens is vital. Here, we review the roles of host cell and bacterial-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in these interactions. We discuss clinical and experimental as well as pathogen-overarching and pathogen-specific evidence for common viral and bacterial elicitors of community-acquired as well as hospital-acquired pneumonia. Finally, we highlight the potential of EVs for improved management of pneumonia patients and discuss the translational steps to be taken before they can be safely exploited as novel vaccines, biomarkers, or therapeutics in clinical practice.","Lena Jung, Anna; Schmeck, Bernd; Wiegand, Marie; Bedenbender, Katrin; Benedikter, Birke J",Advanced drug delivery reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2021.05.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022269/,191

Methods In this prospective case series, nasopharyngeal and tear sampling of 43 patients with severe COVID-19 were performed. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2. Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history. Results The mean age of patients was 56 ± 13 years. The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1-7 days. Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling. Only one patient had conjunctivitis. Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis. All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results. Conclusions Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.

153225,The Utility of Robotic Assisted Pancreas Transplants.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is one of the most complex abdominal operations to perform, and it is usually conducted for tumours of the periampullary region and chronic pancreatitis. Minimally invasive surgery has been progressively being developed for pancreatic surgery, first with the advent of hybrid-laparoscopy and recently with total laparoscopic surgery. Issues including the safety and efficacy of total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (TLPD) and open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) are currently being debated. Studies comparing these two surgical techniques are emerging, and large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking but are clearly required. METHODS AND ANALYSIS TJDBPS01 is a multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial in 14 centres with pancreatic surgery experts who have performed ≥104 TLPDs and OPDs. A total of 656 patients who will undergo PD are randomly allocated to the TLPD group or OPD group in a 1:1 ratio. The trial hypothesis is that TLPD has superior or equivalent safety and advantages in postoperative recovery compared with OPD. The primary outcome is the postoperative length of stay.

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING University Hospital in Sweden. PATIENTS One hundred twenty-two women with uterine size ≤ 16 gestational weeks scheduled to undergo minimally invasive hysterectomy because of benign disease. INTERVENTIONS Robot-assisted hysterectomy or traditional vaginal or laparoscopic minimally invasive hysterectomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All women underwent surgery as randomized. There were no demographic differences between the 2 groups. Vaginal hysterectomy was possible in 41% in the traditional minimally invasive group, at a mean hospital cost of $4579 compared with $7059 for traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy. This was reflected in a mean hospital cost of $993 more per robotic-assisted hysterectomy than for traditional minimally invasive hysterectomy when the robot was a preexisting investment. This hospital cost increased by $1607 when including investments and cost of maintenance. A per-protocol subanalysis comparing laparoscopy and robotics demonstrated similar hospital cost when the robot was a preexisting investment ($7059 vs $7016). Robotic-assisted hysterectomy was associated with less blood loss and fewer postoperative complications. CONCLUSION A similar hospital cost can be attained for laparoscopy and robotics when the robot is a preexisting investment. From the perspective of hospital costs, robotic-assisted hysterectomy is not advantageous for treating benign conditions when a vaginal approach is feasible in a high proportion of patients.","Lönnerfors, Celine; Reynisson, Petur; Persson, Jan",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2014.07.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25045857/,191

In 2012, we made a transition to perform VH on all robotic sacrocolpopexies. Our objective was to report our short-term outcomes and adverse events. METHODS In this case series, we evaluated women who underwent VH with concomitant RSC for stages II to IV pelvic organ prolapse between 2012 and 2017. In these cases, the vesicovaginal and rectovaginal spaces were developed transvaginally. Descriptive analysis including demographics, short-term outcomes, and adverse events are reported. RESULTS In this group of 209 women, median (interquartile interval) duration of follow-up was 49 (26-60) weeks. The majority of the women were white (84.7%) and postmenopausal (80.9%), with a mean (SD) age of 59 (9) years. At a median follow-up time of 49 weeks, pelvic organ prolapse quantification revealed 20 patients (12.4%) with Ba or Bp greater or equal to 0 and 1.4% of patients required repeat prolapse surgery. Among 9 women (4.3%) with postoperative fever, 4 (1.9%) were treated for pelvic collection/abscess. Of 5 women (2.4%) who had venous thromboembolism, 3 (1.4%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. There were 18 patients (8.6%) treated for urinary tract infection within 6 postoperative weeks. Mesh exposure was noted in 16 (7.7%) of the patients, and 11 (6.2%) required reoperation.

However, its long-term effects on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes are unknown. METHODS In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 5734 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes in a 1:1 ratio to receive finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, and diabetic retinopathy, or they had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of 25 to less than 75 ml per minute per 1.73 m2. All the patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer's label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary composite outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was kidney failure, a sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes. The key secondary composite outcome, also assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, a primary outcome event occurred in 504 of 2833 patients (17.8%) in the finerenone group and 600 of 2841 patients (21.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.93; P = 0.001). A key secondary outcome event occurred in 367 patients (13.0%) and 420 patients (14.8%) in the respective groups (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03). Overall, the frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia-related discontinuation of the trial regimen was higher with finerenone than with placebo (2.3% and 0.9%, respectively).

Finally, 83 SG, 152 RYGB, and 123 OAGB patients were included in the analysis. OAGB obtained significantly greater weight loss and remission of dyslipidemia than the other techniques. There was a trend towards greater T2D and hypertension remission rate after OAGB, while fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower after OAGB. There were no significant differences in hemoglobin or protein levels between groups. SG obtained lower iron deficiencies than the other techniques, while there were no significant differences in other nutritional deficiencies between groups.

156232,Single-incision laparoscopic antrectomy for type I gastric neuroendocrine tumor: a case report.,2021-01-12,"Although adaptation to light occurs in the eye and mainly preserves the full dynamic range of neuronal responses during changing background illumination, it affects the entire visual system and helps to optimize visual information processing. We have shown recently that in rat superior colliculus (SC) neurons adaptation to light acts as a local low-pass filter because, in contrast to the primate SC, in rat collicular neurons adaptation to small stimuli is largely limited to the vicinity of the adaptor stimulus. However, it was unclear whether large visual stimuli would induce the same spatially limited adaptation. We addressed this question by evaluating the effects of 1.8°, 6.2° and 20.8° wide adaptor stimuli on test stimuli of variable size. Single unit recordings in the adult rat SC were employed to estimate the response amplitude. Small, 1.8° and 6.2° adaptors habituated visual responses only to stimuli smaller than the adaptive stimuli. However, the 20.8° adaptor dramatically reduced responses even to test stimuli >3 times wider than the adaptor (up to 70° wide). The latter result may be explained by a nearly complete occlusion by a large adaptor of the neuron's receptive field (RF). All these results are consistent with the idea of a limited spatial spread of adaptation in rat SC neurons that is the consequence of high convergence of retinal inputs, in which small RFs limit the spatial spread of adaptation. It is concluded that, in this limited spatial spread of adaptation, rodent SC resembles higher visual system areas in primates and indicates potential differences in visual information processing between rodents and primates.","Baranauskas, Gytis",Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.10.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141032/,191

157476,Guillain-Barré Syndrome Following Influenza Vaccines Affords Opportunity to Improve Vaccine Confidence.,2020-11-02,"Worldwide, norovirus is one of the most associated causes of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to nearly 50 000 child deaths every year in developing countries. Therefore, there is great demand to develop a rapid, low-cost, and accurate detection assay for the foodborne norovirus infection to reduce mortality caused by norovirus. Considering the importance of norovirus, we have demonstrated a highly sensitive and specific colorimetric detection method for analysis of human norovirus genogroups I and II (HuNoV GI and GII) in oyster samples. This is the first report to employ colorimetric HRPzyme-integrated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for direct norovirus detection from the real shellfish samples. We found that the HRPzyme-integrated PCR method is more sensitive than the gel electrophoresis approach and could detect the HuNoV GI and GII genome up to 1 copy/mL. The specificity of the proposed method was successfully demonstrated for HuNoV GI and GII. Further, we performed testing HuNoVs in the spiked oyster samples, and the HRPzyme-integrated PCR method proved to be an ultrasensitive and selective method for detecting HuNoVs in the real samples. By integration of the proposed method with the portable PCR machine, it would be more reliable to improve food safety by detecting HuNoVs in the different types of shellfish, such as oyster and mussel, at the production field.","Batule, Bhagwan S; Kim, Seong U; Mun, Hyoyoung; Choi, Changsun; Shim, Won-Bo; Kim, Min-Gon",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b05289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29381353/,191

Few studies summarize the benefit of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) among lumbar spine surgery patients. This study collects randomized control trial data to investigate the influence of CBT on patient reported outcomes among lumbar spine surgery patients. METHODS Our study used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and a medical library expert assisted in searching PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) to evaluate the effect size of CBT versus control groups with a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS Our meta-analysis included seven studies with a total of 531 patients. The majority of included studies evaluated lumbar fusion, with preoperative CBT performed by physiotherapists. The largest effects were observed for overall quality of life (SMD = 0.55 [95% CI 0.05, 1.05], p < 0.001, I2 = 86.7%) and psychological outcomes (SMD = 0.61 [95% CI 0.28, 0.94], p < 0.001, I2 = 89.7%) though disability and pain outcomes also favored CBT intervention. Included studies demonstrated low overall bias but large heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated negligible study design differences and revealed moderators including CBT session frequency and final follow-up duration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Compared to usual care or alternative therapy control arms, CBT delivered the most improvement with overall quality of life and psychological outcomes. Among appropriately selected patients, CBT could improve perioperative disability, pain, quality of life, and psychological health following lumbar spine surgery.","Parrish, James M; Jenkins, Nathaniel W; Parrish, Manasi S; Cha, Elliot D K; Lynch, Conor P; Massel, Dustin H; Hrynewycz, Nadia M; Mohan, Shruthi; Geoghegan, Cara E; Jadczak, Caroline N; Westrick, Jennifer; Van Horn, Rebecca; Singh, Kern","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-021-06747-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566172/,191

DEx may be reinforced through its effects on the threat reduction and reward systems. The current protocol is designed to evaluate acute psychobiological response to exercise among female participants (age 16-22) with and without EDs. METHOD Twenty medically-stable participants with restrictive-spectrum EDs and 20 healthy control (HC) participants will complete study screening and three task visits which will include two 30-minute bouts of aerobic exercise. RESULTS We aim to validate and demonstrate feasibility of two tasks capturing exercise response in this sample. Further, we will estimate the degree to which a bout of exercise impacts state body image, affect, and circulating concentrations of biological markers among participants, and we will examine whether the impact of exercise on psychological outcomes may differ across ED and HC groups.

Using the iKnife to sample the aerosol of cauterized specimens, we demonstrate a new mode of real-time diagnosis, coupling metabolic phenotype to mutant PIK3CA genotype. Oncogenic PIK3CA results in an increase in arachidonic acid and a concomitant overproduction of eicosanoids, acting to promote cell proliferation beyond a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, mutant PIK3CA drives a multimodal signaling network involving mTORC2-PKCζ-mediated activation of the calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Notably, inhibiting cPLA2 synergizes with fatty acid-free diet to restore immunogenicity and selectively reduce mutant PIK3CA-induced tumorigenicity. Besides highlighting the potential for metabolic phenotyping in stratified medicine, this study reveals an important role for activated PI3K signaling in regulating arachidonic acid metabolism, uncovering a targetable metabolic vulnerability that largely depends on dietary fat restriction.","Koundouros, Nikos; Karali, Evdoxia; Tripp, Aurelien; Valle, Adamo; Inglese, Paolo; Perry, Nicholas J S; Magee, David J; Anjomani Virmouni, Sara; Elder, George A; Tyson, Adam L; Dória, Maria Luisa; van Weverwijk, Antoinette; Soares, Renata F; Isacke, Clare M; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Glen, Robert C; Takats, Zoltan; Poulogiannis, George",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32559461/,191

We aim to evaluate NIV delivered in the ward by assessing (1) overall time of application and occurrence of adverse events and (2) differences between daytime and nighttime NIV application. METHODS We studied subjects with hypercapnic acute hypercapnic respiratory failure not fulfilling strict criteria for ICU admission, and excluded those who interrupted NIV prior to 48 h. Time spent on NIV, presence and extent of air leaks, and occurrence of desaturations were assessed for the overall study period, and compared between daytime and nighttime. RESULTS We enrolled 42 subjects, 25 of whom received NIV for at least 48 h and were included in the data analysis. NIV was successful for 20 subjects, who did not reach criteria for ICU admission. Both PaCO2 and pH significantly improved on average after 2 h and at the end of the study period. NIV was applied for 64.5% of the overall study period and had absent or compensated air leaks for 62.3% of the overall 48-h period. NIV was applied for 55.8% of daytime and for 79.3% of nighttime (P < .01). Effective NIV application was significantly longer overnight (76.9%) than during daytime (53.2%) (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS In selected subjects with hypercapnic acute respiratory failure not fulfilling criteria for ICU admission, the application of NIV in the ward is feasible; in addition, NIV can be safely administered overnight.","Olivieri, Carlo; Carenzo, Luca; Vignazia, Gian Luca; Campanini, Mauro; Pirisi, Mario; Della Corte, Francesco; Navalesi, Paolo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.03294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25352686/,191

Undernutrition conditions make them prone to anemia (low hemoglobin/Hb), and low lymphocyte level brings a higher risk for COVID-19 infection. Objective: To assess the effect of potato almond orange cookies on weight, Hb, and lymphocyte levels of undernourished older people amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This 3-week randomized controlled trial involved 48 subjects >= 60 years, divided randomly into treatment group (potato almond orange cookies) and control groups (potato almond cookies). Lymphocyte and Hb were collected before and after the study. Both groups received nutrition education. The analysis was performed using an independent t-test and paired t-test. Results: Weight gained in the treatment group (0.7 kg) was significantly different from the control group (p=0.002), with a 0.3 point change observed in the BMI of the treatment group. Changes were also seen in vitamin C intake in treatment group (+10.3 mg, p = 0.03) and vitamin E intake in both groups (+4.6 mcg, p = 0.001 and +2.9 mcg, p = 0.001, respectively), but not for inter-group. Weight, Hb, and lymphocyte level increased in both groups, with the highest weight increased in the treatment group while the highest Hb increased in the control group.

However, the relationship between microbiota and COVID-19 severity progression is still being assessed. This study aimed to analyse the diversity and taxonomic composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, to determine its association with COVID-19 clinical outcome. Methods and Findings Samples came from a retrospective cohort of adult patients with COVID-19, hospitalised in a tertiary centre. To study the nasopharyngeal microbiota, we utilized 16S rRNA sequencing. Raw sequences were processed by QIIME2. The associations between the microbiota, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and all-cause mortality were analysed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI), adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity. 177 patients were included: median age 68.0 years, 57.6% males, 59.3% had a Charlson comorbidity index ≥3, and 89.2% with pneumonia. The microbiota α diversity indexes were lower in patients with a fatal outcome, and this association persisted after adjustment for the main confounders; whereas the β diversity analysis showed a significant clustering, grouping the patients with a fatal outcome. After multivariate adjustment, the presence of Selenomonas spp., Filifactor spp., Actinobacillus spp., or Chroococcidiopsis spp., was associated with a reduced risk of IMV (adjusted OR 0.06[95%CI 0.01–0.0.47], p = 0.007). Conclusions The microbiota diversity and taxonomic composition are related to COVID-19 severity. Higher diversity and the presence of certain genera in the nasopharyngeal microbiota seem to be early biomarkers of a favourable clinical evolution in hospitalised patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Ventero, Maria Paz; Moreno-Perez, Oscar; Molina-Pardines, Carmen; Paytuví-Gallart, Andreu; Boix, Vicente; Galan, Irene; González-delaAleja, Pilar; López-Pérez, Mario; Sánchez-Martínez, Rosario; Merino, Esperanza; Rodríguez, Juan Carlos",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.461924,191

Whether or not reliable parameter estimates are obtainable from the available data can easily be overlooked. Such issues of parameter identifiability have important ramifications for both the predictive power of a model, and the mechanistic insight that can be obtained. Identifiability analysis is well-established for deterministic, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, but there are no commonly-adopted methods for analysing identifiability in stochastic models. We provide an accessible introduction to identifiability analysis and demonstrate how existing ideas for analysis of ODE models can be applied to stochastic differential equation (SDE) models through four practical case studies. To assess structural identifiability, we study ODEs that describe the statistical moments of the stochastic process using open-source software tools. Using practically-motivated synthetic data and Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we assess parameter identifiability in the context of available data. Our analysis shows that SDE models can often extract more information about parameters than deterministic descriptions.

It is also unsurprising that the language associated with apocalypticism would come to the fore. Building on recent scholarship, this article looks at some of the language about ?the apocalypse? and apocalypticism, including that associated with Revelation and the New Testament, and how understandings of the Bible in contemporary political discourses have now been updated. The focus is primarily on England/Britain, America and New Zealand because these countries have been the object of much of the work on the reception history of the Bible in politics. This article also analyses the dominant cliches about the Bible as a source of liberalism, neoliberalism, left-leaning radicalism, and the far right. Examples include the use of apocalyptic themes in relation to QAnon and conspiracy theories, ready-made ironic language to describe lockdown, radical social transformation, and constructing political positions outside the traditional liberal consensus.","Crossley, James",Journal for the Study of the New Testament,https://doi.org/10.1177/0142064x211025464,191

While primary partnerships serve as one protective factor, extended quarantine with one's partner introduces novel stress to a relationship, which may have unintended outcomes, including those that affect productivity.An online survey was provided to academic womxn invested in scholarship. Responses from participants who identified as in a relationship (n = 67) were coded using thematic analysis through a feminist lens.Participants highlighted three major themes across their responses: time and space, communication, and needs. These findings reflected stressors typical within couple relationships but highlighted important considerations for partners of academic womxn in support of their scholarly activity during quarantine.Though the flexibility available during the pandemic for academic womxn provided time and space for some to nurture their relationship as well as focus on scholar activity, this was not consistent across partners.Findings show the mixed experiences of partners and confirm the importance of communication, especially about time and space and professional needs. Recommendations can be extrapolated to other processional and career partnerships.

Acute cardiovascular care however remains a priority despite the pandemic. Patients presenting with non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) have been poorly characterized during the pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with NSTEMI during the peak of the pandemic between April-May 2020 at our tertiary centre in the UK. Data were collected from electronic patient clinical records including time from admission to angiography, length of stay, mortality, prescription of secondary prevention pharmacotherapy, and referral to cardiac rehabilitation. We compared this data to the same time period in 2019. Results As can be seen from table 1, in 2020, the mean age, median time to angiography, and length of stay were all significantly lower than the control period of 2019. Prescription of secondary prevention medication (Aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, Beta-blocker, Statin, and ACEi/ARB) and referral to cardiac rehabilitation also improved in 2020, however, neither was statistically significant. During the 2020 period, 1 patient died due to late presentation NSTEMI and multi-organ failure. There were 3 deaths in 2019: complications following coronary bypass surgery, upper GI bleed and a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Table 1 Comparison of NSTEMI patients in 2019 and 202020192020 p-valueAge (years) 71.2 ± 12.265.0 ± 12.1 p&lt;0.01 NSTEMI patients 5659P=NSNSTEMI undergoing angiography 5053P=NS Median Time to angiography (hours) 68.614 p&lt;0.01 Median length of stay (days)5 (IQR 2:8)2 (IQR 1:4) p&lt;0.01 Referral to cardiac rehabilitation 77.4% 84.5% P=NS Prescription of secondary prevention medication 69.8% 72.4% P=NS. Conclusion Our results show that the mean age of the patients presenting with NSTEMI during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic was younger suggesting that elderly patients failed to present. Compared to 2019, there was a significant improvement in patient treatment times with a significantly shorter stay in the hospital, probably as a result of the reduction in elective activity allowing un-restrained access to the catheter labs. We also saw improvement in prescription for secondary prevention and referral to cardiac rehabilitation services during this time suggesting that there may have been improved focus on these aspects of care again.","Oshieba, M.; Maqableh, G.; Choy, C.

This was followed by identification of the most important areas of support and the amounts allocated to them for Poland and its sixteen voivodeships under the available EU funds from the 2014–2020 perspective. Types and forms of support for health services from the funds of the Regional Operational Programme for the Opolskie Voivodeship 2014–2020 (ROP WO) were analysed in detail. The obtained results showed that Italy, Spain, and Poland provided the largest values of support under the available operational programmes from 2014–2020 to combat the effects of COVID-19. In Poland, funding was mainly provided by the European Regional Development Fund, with the dominant support allocated to entrepreneurship and health care. In the Opolskie voivodeship, which is the case study, the additional financing in the health area concerns: personal protective equipment, equipment, construction works, oxygen installations, and waste water management. In this article, a literature analysis of the issue was conducted prior to the research process, which included theories of post-2007 crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

179748,The safety and antibody kinetics of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of moderate to severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients,2021,"Travel-time prediction constitutes a task of high importance in transportation networks, with web mapping services like Google Maps regularly serving vast quantities of travel time queries from users and enterprises alike. Further, such a task requires accounting for complex spatiotemporal interactions (modelling both the topological properties of the road network and anticipating events -- such as rush hours -- that may occur in the future). Hence, it is an ideal target for graph representation learning at scale. Here we present a graph neural network estimator for estimated time of arrival (ETA) which we have deployed in production at Google Maps. While our main architecture consists of standard GNN building blocks, we further detail the usage of training schedule methods such as MetaGradients in order to make our model robust and production-ready. We also provide prescriptive studies: ablating on various architectural decisions and training regimes, and qualitative analyses on real-world situations where our model provides a competitive edge. Our GNN proved powerful when deployed, significantly reducing negative ETA outcomes in several regions compared to the previous production baseline (40+% in cities like Sydney).","Derrow-Pinion, Austin; She, Jennifer; Wong, David; Lange, Oliver; Hester, Todd; Perez, Luis; Nunkesser, Marc; Lee, Seongjae; Guo, Xueying; Wiltshire, Brett; Battaglia, Peter W.; Gupta, Vishal; Li, Ang; Xu, Zhongwen; Sanchez-Gonzalez, Alvaro; Li, Yujia; Velivckovi'c, Petar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11482v1.pdf,191
182652,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people experiencing homelessness in Toronto during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-26,"There is increasing recognition worldwide of the importance of academic activities, specifically in situations of pandemics. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the effects of COVID-19 on lecturers/researchers and Ph.D. and master students who have faced unexpected and continuous disruption in their teaching and research activities. To fulfil the aims, the study focused on a mixed method approach quantitative study based on a questionnaire administered on social networks and open questions. The unit of analysis was lecturers/researchers and Ph.D. and master students. The results obtained show that this lengthy interruption had severe impacts on their activities, requiring new competencies and capacities to deal with changes in a short period of time, including less positive feelings affecting them and their families. The main contribution of this study lies in identifying the barriers and opportunities created by this virus in the academic world and in presenting a theoretical framework to improve the situation, given that the confinement exponentiated negative and psychological feelings in academics, although telework is seen as a positive factor with continuity in the future, as a way to foster the social, environmental sustainability of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and the wellbeing of their human capital. As implications for practice, the evidence points to the need for academics to be provided with training in E-learning, about technological tools for use in distance-learning and to reconsider how they carry out their research on the ground.","Margarida, Rodrigues Rui Silva Rodrigues Franco Mário",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168718,191
182824,SARS and the maternal neonatal unit,2003-12-11,"Purpose - This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on investors' sentiments, behavioral biases and investment decisions in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Design/methodology/approach - The authors have assessed investors' behaviors and sentiments and the stock market overreaction during COVID-19 using a questionnaire and collected data from 401 investors trading in the PSX. Findings - Results of structural equation modeling revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected investors' behaviors, investment decisions and trade volume. It created feelings of fear and uncertainty among market participants. Evidence suggests that behavioral heuristics and biases, including representative heuristic, anchoring heuristic, overconfidence bias and disposition effect, negatively influenced investors' decisions at the PSX. Research limitations/implications - This study will contribute to behavioral finance literature in the context of developing countries as it has revealed the impact of COVID-19 on the emerging stock market, and its results are generalizable to other emerging stock markets. Practical implications - The findings of this study will help academicians, researchers and policymakers of developing countries. Academicians can formulate new behavioral models that can depict the solutions of dealing with an uncertain situation like COVID-19. Policymakers like the Securities Exchange Commission and the PSX can formulate crisis management strategies based on behavioral finance concepts to cope with situations like COVID-19 in the future and help lessen investors' losses in the stock markets. The role of the Securities Exchange Commission is crucial as it regulates the financial markets. It can arrange workshops to educate investors to manage their decisions during crisis time and focus on the best use of irrational and rational decision-making at the same time using Lo (2004) adaptive market hypothesis. Originality/value - The novelty of the paper is that the authors have introduced overconfidence and disposition effect as mediators that create a connection between representative and anchoring heuristics and investment decisions using primary data collected from investors (institutional and retail) to demonstrate the presence of psychological biases during COVID-19, and it has been done for the first time according to authors' knowledge. It is a contribution and addition to the behavioral finance literature in the context of developing countries' stock markets and their efficiency.","Parveen, S.; Satti, Z. W.; Subhan, Q.

Study Design and Setting: This is a single-site study within an academic center and regional programs within the state of Arkansas. We obtained residual serum samples from a convenience sample of adults who were outpatients and came to the hospital or regional clinic for non-COVID-related reasons. We collected remnant in three time periods (August 15 to September 5, September 12 to October 24, and November 7 to December 19). Results: In 2020, the overall age, gender, and race standardized prevalence of CoV-2 antibodies was 2.6% (August to September), 4.1% (September to October), and 7.4% (November to December). There was no difference in seroprevalence between urban compared to rural areas. Positive tests were not uniformly distributed across racial and ethnic minorities. Higher seroprevalence rates were found in Hispanics and Blacks or African Americans compared to whites across all time periods. Conclusions: In a state with a large rural population, 2.6-7.4% of people experienced CoV-2 infection by December 2020.

184088,Nitric oxide and the common cold.,2005,"The COVID19 pandemic situation has opened a wide range of opportunities for cyber-criminals, who take advantage of the anxiety generated and the time spent on the Internet, to undertake massive phishing campaigns. Although companies are adopting protective measures, the psychological traits of the victims are still considered from a very generic perspective. In particular, current literature determines that the model proposed in the Big-Five personality traits (i.e., Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) might play an important role in human behaviour to counter cybercrime. However, results do not provide unanimity regarding the correlation between phishing susceptibility and neuroticism. With the aim to understand this lack of consensus, this article provides a comprehensive literature review of papers extracted from relevant databases (IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science). Our results show that there is not a well-established psychological theory explaining the role of neuroticism in the phishing context. We sustain that non-representative samples and the lack of homogeneity amongst the studies might be the culprits behind this lack of consensus on the role of neuroticism on phishing susceptibility. © 2021 IEEE.","López-Aguilar, P.; Solanas, A.","45th IEEE Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/compsac51774.2021.00192,191
184208,Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.,2004,"This study investigates the positive aspects of the impact COVID-19 pandemic has had on rural development, providing several examples from the post-Soviet space. It is predicted that the intensification of dacha recreation phenomenon, which has been significantly influenced by the pandemic, will spatially extend beyond the periurban areas of the largest cities and will create the preconditions for the restoration of abandoned villages, development of rural tourism and preservation of ""archaic"" living techniques and traditional lifestyle. In an interdisciplinary context, we learn about the increased tendency of city dwellers to own second homes (dacha) in the countryside. Attention is drawn to the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease in solar activity, along with the decrease in the disinfection capacity of solar UV radiation. The curative proprieties of landscapes are investigated, methods of their valorisation are proposed, and landscape therapy is proposed to be considered during pandemics, some of the most effective activities being open-air walks, with inhalation of negative oxygen ions, phytoncides, terpenes. The growth of uncertainties due to unlimited and uncontrolled human society development is postulated. It is proved that development must consider the unpredicted effects of a catastrophe and use this knowledge to prevent other more devastating events and effects. In this context, the preservation of the primary, although outdated, living techniques is proposed, since they can act as important survival factors in critical mode. It is concluded that COVID-19 pandemic should be perceived as a milestone in the reorientation of geography and ecology towards understanding and advocating for nature preservation to be able to sustain human society in a continuous transformation.","Golubchikov, Yuri N.",Journal of Settlements and Spatial Planning,https://doi.org/10.24193/jssp.2021.1.06,191

By a variety of techniques, it was shown to be active against a wide range of human and animal influenza A viruses. The effect was, however, variable and ranged from high activity against two 1957 Asian strains to no observable activity against a 1971 strain. Like amantadine, the drug did not inhibit the growth of influenza B viruses. It was also inactive against a number of paramyxoviruses. Unlike amantadine, the drug did inhibit rhinoviruses, but to a lesser extent than myxoviruses. The coronavirus 229E was also sensitive to the action of the drug in vitro. Although an earlier trial in volunteers showed that, when given orally from 2 days before until 5 days after virus challenge, the drug was protective against infection with influenza A/Hong Kong/68 virus, a similar trial in volunteers challenged with rhinoviruses 2 and 9 revealed no useful activity against rhinoviruses in man.","Mathur, A; Beare, A S; Reed, S E",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4364762/,191

The objective of this study was to know how the confinement period affected the consumption of tobacco and other related products in the adult Spanish population. METHODS The survey consisted of 18 questions concerning sociodemographic characteristics, the consumption of tobacco and other related products, exposure to secondhand smoke and perception of COVID-19 risk associated with consumption. Questions about tobacco and other related products were posed in order to compare consumption prior to and during confinement. The survey was completed by 17,017 people. The analysis of association of variables was carried out with T-student. Variable frequency analysis was performed with χ2. RESULTS There was a reduction in the prevalence of daily tobacco smoking and no changes were observed in the products consumed in either period (6.73%). The prevalence of exposure to secondhand smoke at home during confinement among non-smokers decreased (61.83%). Most of survey respondents reported that tobacco and e-cigarette consumption increased the risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering severe complications (39.09% and 31.80% respectively).

The sera were collected in Egypt as a region adjacent to areas where MERS has been described, and in Hong Kong, China as a control region. Sera from dromedary camels had a high prevalence of antibody reactive to MERS-CoV by MERS NT (93.6%) and MERS ppNT (98.2%) assay. The antibody titres ranged up to 1,280 and higher in MN assays and 10,240 and higher in ppNT assays. No other investigated species had any antibody reactivity to MERS-CoV. While seropositivity does not exclude the possibility of infection with a closely related virus, our data highlight the need to attempt detection of MERSCoV or related coronaviruses in dromedary camels. The data show excellent correlation between the conventional MN assay and the novel ppNT assay. The newly developed ppNT assay does not require Biosafety Level 3 containment and is thus a relatively high-throughput assay, well suited for large-scale seroepidemiology studies which are needed to better understand the ecology and epidemiology of MERS-CoV.","Perera, R A; Wang, P; Gomaa, M R; El-Shesheny, R; Kandeil, A; Bagato, O; Siu, L Y; Shehata, M M; Kayed, A S; Moatasim, Y; Li, M; Poon, L L; Guan, Y; Webby, R J; Ali, M A; Peiris, J S; Kayali, G",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24079378/,191

The aim of this review was to systematically review studies examining the efficacy and tolerability of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders among older adults. METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. All searches were limited to English-language articles. The quality of each study was appraised using criteria developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine for randomized controlled trials. RESULTS A total of 8,785 citations were retrieved and pooled in EndNote and de-duplicated to 3,753. This set was uploaded to Covidence for screening. Two separate screeners (AG and SAF) evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full text of the eligible articles. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, benzodiazepines were associated with decreased anxiety at the end of the study period. The limited tolerability data show mild adverse effects from the benzodiazepines studied. Limitations of the trials included limited data on the long-term use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and a preponderance of trials examining generalized anxiety disorder, with relatively less data on other anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS Benzodiazepines are effective for treating anxiety disorders in late life, at least in the short term, but more data is needed to establish tolerability and their long-term benefits.","Gupta, Aarti; Bhattacharya, Gargi; Farheen, Syeda Arshiya; Funaro, Melissa; Balasubramaniam, Meera; Young, Juan; Tampi, Deena J; Tampi, Rajesh R",Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343283/,191

193832,Infection in solid-organ transplant recipients.,2007,"Mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM causes a chronic demyelinating disease in susceptible strains of rodents. Demyelination does not develop in infected RAG1-/- (recombination activation gene-deficient) mice but can be induced by several experimental interventions, including adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells or antibodies. A common feature of demyelination in these models is extensive infiltration of macrophages/microglia into the white matter. The data obtained thus far do not indicate whether macrophage/microglia infiltration, in the absence of T cells or antibody, is sufficient to mediate demyelination. To determine whether the expression of a single macrophage chemoattractant, in the context of virus infection, could initiate the demyelinating process, we engineered a recombinant coronavirus that expressed the chemokine CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. CCL2 has been implicated in macrophage infiltration into the central nervous system and is involved in demyelination in many experimental models of demyelination. Extensive macrophage/microglia infiltration and demyelination has developed in RAG1-/- mice infected with this recombinant virus. Thus, these results suggest that the minimal requirement for demyelination is increased expression of a single macrophage-attracting chemokine in the context of an inflammatory milieu, such as that induced by a viral infection.","Kim, Taeg S; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890951/,191

Phylogenetic analysis of the genomic sequence reveals it to be a distinct member of the Coronaviridae family. 5' RACE assay confirms the presence of at least six subgenomic transcripts all containing the predicted intergenic sequences. Five open reading frames (ORFs), namely ORF1a, 1b, S, M, and N, are found to be homologues to other CoV members, and three more unknown ORFs (X1, X2, and X3) are unparalleled in all other known CoV species. Optimal alignment and computer analysis of the homologous ORFs has predicted the characteristic structural and functional domains on the putative genes. The overall nucleotides conservation of the homologous ORFs is low (<5%) compared with other known CoVs, implying that HK-39 is a newly emergent SARS-CoV phylogenetically distant from other known members. SimPlot analysis supports this finding, and also suggests that this novel virus is not a product of a recent recombinant from any of the known characterized CoVs. Together, these results confirm that HK-39 is a novel and distinct member of the Coronaviridae family, with unknown origin.

The disease occurred in a breeding kennel in Italy and affected 11 dogs aged between 6 months and 2.5 years, that had been repeatedly administered vaccines containing a type 2 (old type) CPV strain. CPV infection was demonstrated in all diseased dogs by an immunochromatographic test. A CPV strain was isolated from the intestinal content of a 20-month-old pregnant Bernese mountain bitch that underwent a fatal outcome. The strain was characterised as CPV-2c by means of real-time PCR assays using minor groove binder probes. The present report provides further concerns about the real efficacy of type 2-based vaccines against the antigenic variants of CPV and stresses the need for developing new vaccines prepared with the variants currently circulating in the dog population.","Decaro, Nicola; Desario, Costantina; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Mari, Viviana; Lavazza, Antonio; Nardi, Manuela; Buonavoglia, Canio",The new microbiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18437851/,191
194735,Has allergenic pollen an impact on non-allergic diseases?,2011,"Lipid rafts and caveolae are detergent-insoluble plasma membrane microdomains, involved in cellular endocytic processes and signalling. Several viruses, including a human pathogen, echovirus 1, and an extensively studied simian virus 40 utilize these domains for internalization into the host cells. Interaction of viruses with receptors on the cell surface triggers specific conformational changes of the virus particle and can give rise to signalling events, which determine the mechanisms of virus entry. After internalization via cell surface lipid rafts or caveolae, virus-containing vesicles can fuse with caveosomes, pre-existing cytoplasmic organelles, or dock on other intracellular organelles. These pathways may deliver viruses further to different cellular destinations, where the viral replication cycle then takes place. The information concerning the viral entry processes is important for understanding the details of the infections, for finding new targets for antiviral therapy and for elucidating the cellular internalization pathways in general.","Pietiäinen, Vilja M; Marjomäki, Varpu; Heino, Jyrki; Hyypiä, Timo",Annals of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16203612/,191
194887,Novel 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): An updated overview for emergency clinicians,2020-05-01,"Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) capsids bind to the transferrin receptors (TfRs) of their hosts and use these receptors to infect cells. The binding is partially host specific, as FPV binds only to the feline TfR, while CPV binds to both the canine and feline TfRs. The host-specific binding is controlled by a combination of residues within a raised region of the capsid. To define the TfR structures that interact with the virus, we altered the apical domain of the feline or canine TfR or prepared chimeras of these receptors and tested the altered receptors for binding to FPV or CPV capsids. Most changes in the apical domain of the feline TfR did not affect binding, but replacing Leu221 with Ser or Asp prevented receptor binding to either FPV or CPV capsids, while replacing Leu221 with Lys resulted in a receptor that bound only to CPV but not to FPV. Analysis of recombinants of the feline and canine TfRs showed that sequences controlling CPV-specific binding were within the apical domain and that more than one difference between these receptors determined the CPV-specific binding of the canine TfR. Single changes within the canine TfR which removed a single amino acid insertion or which eliminated a glycosylation site gave that receptor the expanded ability to bind to FPV and CPV. In some cases, binding of capsids to mutant receptors did not result in infection, suggesting a structural role for the receptor in cell infection by the viruses.","Palermo, Laura M; Hueffer, Karsten; Parrish, Colin R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12885908/,191
194950,The emerging role of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in the kidney.,2007,"We have tested the fusogenic properties of cleaved and uncleaved spike (S) protein of murine coronavirus (MCV) JHMV variant cl-2 by expressing the S protein by recombinant vaccinia viruses (RVVs). The amino acid sequence of the putative cleavage site of cl-2 S protein, Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg-Arg, was replaced by Arg-Thr-Ala-Leu-Glu by in vitro mutagenesis of cl-2 S gene. The RVVs having cl-2 S gene [RVV t(+)] or mutated cl-2 S gene [RVV t(-)] were tested for their ability to induce fusion as well as cleavability in DBT cells. After inoculation with RVV t(+) onto DBT cells, the fusion formation was first observed at 8 h postinoculation (p.i.) and spread throughout the whole culture by 24 h. In cells infected with RVV t(-), fusion appeared by 2 h and most of cells were fused by 30 h p.i. The S protein and its cleavage products were detected in DBT cells expressing wild type S protein. However, no cleavage products of the S protein were detected in RVV t(-) infected cells producing mutated S protein, even though fusion was clearly visible. These results suggest that the cleavage event of JHMV-S protein of MCV is not a prerequisite for fusion formation, but that it enhances fusion.","Taguchi, F; Ikeda, T; Saeki, K; Kubo, H; Kikuchi, T",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209726/,191

In addition to the direct effect of the virus, we must take into account increasing disease anxiety due to the risk of infection, insecurity, confusing media activity, social isolation due to quarantine, socioeconomic impact, and the reduced capacity of the health-care system. In this paper, we present our experiences with the patient information telephone service operated by the psychotherapy department of the Nyírő Gyula National Institute of Psychiatry and Addiction (Nyírő-OPAI). Clinical psychologists and psychotherapists received the calls. The vast majority of the 264 phone calls registered during the two months of the pandemic (62%) were initiated by treated patients (availability of a doctor, questions related to the operation of the health-care system, prescribing medications). Still, we could also help patients and their families in potentially dangerous situations (21%): suicidal intentions, alcohol- and drug-related crises, severe neurocognitive disorders (dementias) with acute behavioural and psychological symptoms. In all cases, the telephone consultation led to the successful resolution of the crisis (low-threshold psychological intervention, counselling, assistance in admission to the institution). A relatively small number of calls (7%) were related to more complex psychotherapeutic needs. In summary, our experience shows that in extreme social situations, direct telephone assistance is suitable for supporting registered patients in the mental health system. This type of service also provides an opportunity to address acute crises and cases requiring more complex psychotherapeutic interventions.","Csigo, Katalin; Boross, Viktor; Lipardy, Krisztina; Mari, Gabriella; Ritzl, Andrea; Varga, Tunde; Keri, Szabolcs",Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica : a Magyar Pszichofarmakologiai Egyesulet lapja = official journal of the Hungarian Association of Psychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257594/,191

Social distancing is the most important preventive strategy for the spread of this contagion, short of a vaccine. Implementation of the same has forced many countries in to a complete lock-down. Closure of schools and universities has made education uncertain at all levels. Medical education is no exception. In this pandemic, the need for uninterrupted generation of future doctors is felt more than ever in our living memory. Continuity of medical education is thus imperative. While ""Live"" patient contact is an irreplaceable tenet of clinical teaching, these extraordinary times demand exceptional measures. Pedagogical innovations involving technology and simulation based teaching (Online lectures, video vase vignettes, virtual simulators, webcasting, online chat-rooms) need to be brought to the forefront. Since the medical educators have been pushed inevitably to rely on technology-based learning, they should not only embrace it but also develop and evaluate its sustainability and application in preclinical and clinical setting. Meanwhile, the students, whose medical educations are stuck in this pandemic time, should realize that there is no bigger teacher than a first-hand experience, and they are eyewitnesses to the making of history.","Sahi, Puneet Kaur; Mishra, Devendra; Singh, Tejinder",Indian pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412913/,191

METHODS Data of SARS cases notified from Dongcheng District Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC)and supplemented by other channels were collected. Clinicians and officials of local hospitals were interviewed in groups and medical records of fatal cases of SARS were reviewed to verify the diagnosis. Stored serum specimens of the patients were detected for IgG antibody against SARS Co-V by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All the data were input into dataset files by Microsoft Excel-2000 software and analyzed with SPSS version 10.0 software. RESULTS Outbreak of SARS in Dongcheng District started on March 14, 2003 with a peak in mid- and late April, and dropped in early May. A total of 572 reported cases were collected during this period in Dongcheng District, Beijing, and 99 of them were excluded from SARS, because of diagnosis of common cold, regular pneumonia, measles and rubella, etc. Actually, 473 SARS cases, which included 390 (82.5%) probable cases and 83 (17.5%) suspect cases, were analyzed. About 90% of the probable cases were positive for IgG antibody. Attack rate of SARS in permanent residents of Dongcheng District was 28.3 per 100 000. Forty-one of them died, with a case-fatality rate of 8.7%. Persons were all susceptible to infection of SARS Co-V, with the highest proportion at ages of 20-50 years, which accounted for 68.7% of the total cases. Average age of the patients at their onset was 40.7 years. No gender difference in SARS cases was found. Number of SARS cases in health-care workers (HCWs) accounted for 18.0% and that in retired workers accounted for 15.4% of the total cases. Cases occurred in all 10 sub-districts of Dongcheng, with the highest in Beixinqiao and Andingmen Sub-districts. Totally, 230 of the 572 notified cases (40.2%) were hospitalized at local hospitals under the jurisdiction of Dongcheng District. Eighteen of 85 cases of SARS occurred in HCWs of local hospitals, accounting for 4.5% of the total number of HCWs working at wards caring for SARS patients or fever clinics. There were 34.7% of SARS cases without any histories of contact before the onset of the disease. Familial aggregation phenomena were observed in 41.8% of the cases and 18.1% of households. And 7.4% (attack rate) of those exposed to SARS cases suffered from the illness during the periods of quarantine. CONCLUSIONS SARS appeared to be infectious in origin and caused outbreak in Dongcheng District, Beijing introduced by an imported case traveling from Hong Kong in a period between March and May 2003. People are all susceptible to infection of SARS Co-V, which mainly threatens the young adults and the middle-aged, as well as HCWs and the retired workers. The main mode of transmission is direct exposure to SARS patients in a near distance at hospitals or families via droplets spread. Prevention and control of SARS should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts. Current available measures to prevent and control SARS are proved to be effective.","Liang, Wan-Nian; Huang, Yong; Zhou, Wan-Xin; Qiao, Lei; Huang, Jian-Hui; Wu, Zheng-Lai",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15011961/,191

However, there are limited data on health information, beliefs, and behaviors that might indicate different exposure to risk. Objective: To determine the association of sociodemographic characteristics with reported incidence, knowledge, and behavior regarding COVID-19 among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: A US national survey study was conducted from March 29 to April 13, 2020, to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs, and behavior about COVID-19. The survey oversampled COVID-19 hotspot areas. The survey was conducted electronically. The criteria for inclusion were age 18 years or older and residence in the US. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were incidence, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 as measured by survey response. Results: The survey included 5198 individuals (mean [SD] age, 48 [18] years; 2336 men [45%]; 3759 white [72%], 830 [16%] African American, and 609 [12%] Hispanic). The largest differences in COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors were associated with race/ethnicity, sex, and age, with African American participants, men, and people younger than 55 years showing less knowledge than other groups. African American respondents were 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5 percentage points; P = .001) more likely than white respondents to report being infected with COVID-19, as were men compared with women (3.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 4.4 percentage points; P < .001). Knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was more common among African American respondents (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 10.9 percentage points; P < .001), people younger than 30 years (11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 15.7 percentage points; P < .001), and people with higher incomes (coefficient on earning &#8805;$100â¯000, 12.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.7 to 15.8 percentage points; P < .001). Knowledge of potential fomite spread was lower among African American respondents (-9.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -13.1 to -5.7 percentage points; P < .001), Hispanic respondents (-4.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.9 to -0.77 percentage points; P = .02), and people younger than 30 years (-10.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -14.1 to -6.5 percentage points; P < .001). Similar gaps were found with respect to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and preventive behaviors. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, there were gaps in reported incidence of COVID-19 and knowledge regarding its spread and symptoms and social distancing behavior. More effort is needed to increase accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, men, and younger people.","Alsan, Marcella; Stantcheva, Stefanie; Yang, David; Cutler, David",JAMA Netw Open,,191

A total of 19 E. cloacae isolates from pets with urinary tract infection were screened for the presence of fosA, fosA3, and fosC2 and for the genetic context of them by PCR amplification and sequencing. The transferability, resistance phenotypes, plasmid replicon typing properties and genetic environments of fosA- and/or fosA3-positive strains were characterized. Five E. cloacae isolates were positive for fosA and three coharbored fosA and fosA3. No fosC determinant was detected. Transconjugants of fosA3 were successfully acquired, while the acquisition of fosA transconjugants was failed. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the three fosA3-positive isolates and their transconjugants were &#8805;256 mg/L, whereas the MICs of the five fosA-positive isolates ranged from 64 mg/L to 256 mg/L. Three plasmid replicons (InCFrepB, InCL/M, and InCHI2) were identified in fosA- and fosA3-positive E. cloacae isolates. Different genetic contexts lay in the downstream region of fosA and fosA3, respectively. Eight distinct patterns based on the similarity value of more than 80% were typed for all the 8 fosA-positive isolates. In conclusion, the fosA concomitant with fosA3 were found in E. cloacae isolates. The fosA3 not only exhibits stronger activity of inactivating fosfomycin than fosA but also possesses stronger potential to spread than fosA. Different genetic backgrounds exist in these fosA- and fosA3-positive isolates, and different mobile elements may confer the dissemination of fosA and fosA3.","Chen, Lin; Ou, Bingming; Zhang, Minyu; Chou, Chung-Hsi; Chang, Shao-Kuang; Zhu, Guoqiang",Microb. drug resist.

We investigated this relation in the 530 000 inhabitants of the northeastern Italian province of Udine. METHODS: We analysed real-time RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens conducted at the Virology Laboratory of the University Hospital of Udine, Italy (which serves the whole province) from 1 March to 30 April 2020 Specimens were from positive individuals in four groups characterized by different disease severity (critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units, patients admitted to infectious disease units, symptomatic patients visiting the emergency department and not hospitalized, and asymptomatic individuals tested during contact tracing or screening activities). Duration of viral positivity was assessed from the first positive test to the day of the first of two consecutive negative tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate differences in the four groups. RESULTS: From 1 March to 30 April, 39 483 RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted on 23 778 individuals, and 974 individuals had a positive test result. Among those with multiple tests (n = 878), mean time to negativity was 23.7 days (standard error 0.3639; median 23, interquartile range 16-30 days). Mean time to negativity was longer in the group admitted to the intensive care unit than in the others, whereas no difference was observed between asymptomatic patients and those with mild disease.

METHODS: Eighty-two patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19 in a geriatric acute care unit were included. The association of the regular use of VKA prior to COVID-19 with survival after 7 days of COVID-19 was examined using a propensity-score-weighted Cox proportional-hazards model accounting for age, sex, severe undernutrition, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, prior stroke and/or transient ischemic attack, CHA2DS2-VASc score, HAS-BLED score, and eGFR. RESULTS: Among 82 patients (mean ± SD age 88.8 ± 4.5 years; 48% women), 73 survived COVID-19 at day 7 while 9 died. There was no between-group difference at baseline, despite a trend for more frequent use of VKA in those who did not survive on day 7 (33.3% versus 8.2%, p = 0.056). While considering ""using no VKA"" as the reference (hazard ratio (HR) = 1), the HR for 7-day mortality in those regularly using VKA was 5.68 [95% CI: 1.17; 27.53]. Consistently, COVID-19 patients using VKA on a regular basis had shorter survival times than the others (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of VKA was associated with increased mortality at day 7 in hospitalized frail elderly patients with COVID-19.","Ménager, Pierre; Brière, Olivier; Gautier, Jennifer; Riou, Jérémie; Sacco, Guillaume; Brangier, Antoine; Annweiler, Cédric; Geria-Covid Study Group, On Behalf Of The",Nutrients,,191
220121,Lower respiratory tract and plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in critically ill adult COVID-19 patients: Relationship with biomarkers of disease severity,2021,"With the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare practices and radiation oncology departments have begun to incorporate telemedicine services to practice social distancing and minimize the chances of disease spread. Given the severity of this pandemic, it will likely fundamentally impact the use of these services for years to come. Our institution and radiation oncology department have used telemedicine services for many years; we would like to report on our departmental experience to guide other radiation oncology practices on its long-term use for clinical evaluation and patient care. Our institution's telemedicine program provides clinical services for a number of remote locations and represents the largest telehealth network in the world, with over 300 sites and 60,000 patient encounters a year. Specifically for our radiation oncology department, over 200 patient encounters occur via telemedicine a year. Patients report great appreciation and satisfaction with these encounters, as they eliminate the time and energy needed for travel from long distances. It has resulted in improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness as well. Based on our institutional experience, our long-term vision for telemedicine (after the COVID-19 pandemic has hopefully subsided) is as an excellent and cost-efficient tool to provide long-term follow-up for patients, especially for those who live far away in rural or underserved areas.","Lewis, Gary D; Hatch, Sandra S; Wiederhold, Lee R; Swanson, Todd A",,,191
220565,Comparison of acute pneumonia caused by SARS-COV-2 and other respiratory viruses in children: a retrospective multi-center cohort study during COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"High-resolution retinal imaging is revolutionizing how scientists and clinicians study the retina on the cellular scale. Its exquisite sensitivity enables time-lapse optical biopsies that capture minute changes in the structure and physiological processes of cells in the living eye. This information is increasingly used to detect disease onset and monitor disease progression during early stages, raising the possibility of personalized eye care. Powerful high-resolution imaging tools have been in development for more than two decades; one that has garnered considerable interest in recent years is optical coherence tomography enhanced with adaptive optics. State-of-the-art adaptive optics optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT) makes it possible to visualize even highly transparent cells and measure some of their internal processes at all depths within the retina, permitting reconstruction of a 3D view of the living microscopic retina. In this review, we report current AO-OCT performance and its success in visualizing and quantifying these once-invisible cells in human eyes.

221343,Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination,2021,"Introduction: As a result of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Society for Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS) issued guidelines for patient management during COVID-19. Specifically, they suggested intubating COVID-19 positive or those with unknown COVID-19 status prior to emergent endovascular thrombectomy, cohorting by COVID-19 status, early ICU discharge, and postponing elective cases. We sought to determine how the implementation of SNIS guidelines affected outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing ischemic stroke patients who were treated with thrombectomy admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic 4/1/20-6/30/20 “COVID-19 peak” to patients admitted 4/1/19-6/30/19 “2019”. Statistical tests used for analysis included Kruskal- Wallis, chi-squared and Fisher's exact test. Results: The proportion of patients treated with thrombectomy was not significantly different, 23% in 2019 vs. 24% during the COVID-19 peak, p=0.67. There were 112 patients treated with thrombectomy: 57 (51%) in 2019, 55 (49%) during the COVID-19 peak. No patients treated with thrombectomy were positive for COVID-19, but 27 (49%) were tested. The median age was 69 for those treated in 2019 and 69 for those during the COVID-19 peak, p=0.44. Patients were similar in sex, race, and comorbidities. The time from onset to arrival was also statistically similar, p=0.19. In 2019, 16% received tPA compared to 9% during the COVID-19 peak, p=0.28. The median time to groin puncture was significantly shorter in 2019, 38 minutes, than during the COVID-19 peak, 44 minutes, p=0.01. The recanalization rate and mRS were similar between groups, p=0.06, and p=0.91, respectively. Conclusions: After implementing the SNIS guidelines, including pre-treatment intubation, we observed a significantly longer time to groin puncture. Anecdotally, the increased observed was remarkably small given the changes to care and did not negatively impact patient outcomes. This suggests that hospitals managing patients efficiently can implement changes in response to COVID- 19 and continue high level of care without impacting outcomes. Therefore, we recommend following the SNIS guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Atchie, B.; Jarvis, S.; Salottolo, K.; Bennett, A.; Burrell, C.; McCarthy, K.

The virus is believed to be evolved in a recombined form of bat and animal coronavirus with the capacity to infect human host using the ACE2 receptors as an entry point. Though the disease pathogenesis is not elucidated completely, the virus-mediated host response retains a similar pattern to that of previous SARS-CoV. Based on the available trend it is assumed that pediatric groups are less susceptible to the coronavirus. Understanding the possible mechanism that protects the children from hyper-inflammatory or disease severity could lead to better treatment modalities. In the present review, we have discussed the significance of age and sex-dependent pattern of ACE2 receptor expression and ACE2 variants in the immune protective mechanism of the disease virulence. We have also added a brief note on the importance of sex hormones in the pathogenesis of ACE2 mediated SARS-CoV2 infection.","Mariappan, Vignesh; S R, Rao; Balakrishna Pillai, Agieshkumar",IUBMB Life,,191

During both the initial and peak phases of the epidemic, the administration of disease-modifying drugs, typically immunosuppressants administered in pulses, was suspended due to the uncertainty about their impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, mainly in contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. The purpose of this study is to present a safety algorithm enabling patients to resume pulse immunosuppressive therapy (PIT) during the easing of lockdown measures. METHODS: We developed a safety algorithm based on our clinical experience with MS and the available published evidence; the algorithm assists in the detection of contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases and of patients with mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a view to withdrawing PIT in these patients and preventing new infections at day hospitals. RESULTS: We developed a clinical/microbiological screening algorithm consisting of a symptom checklist, applied during a teleconsultation 48hours before the scheduled session of PIT, and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal exudate 24hours before the procedure. CONCLUSION: The application of our safety algorithm presents a favourable risk-benefit ratio despite the fact that the actual proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals is unknown. Systematic PCR testing, which provides the highest sensitivity for detecting presymptomatic cases, combined with early detection of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce infections and improve detection of high-risk patients before they receive PIT.","Valero-López, G; Carreón-Guarnizo, E; Hernández-Clares, R; Iniesta-Martínez, F; Jiménez-Veiga, J; Moreno-Docon, A; Iborra-Bendicho, M A; Morales-Ortiz, A; Meca-Lallana, J E","Neurologia (Barc., Ed. impr.)",,191

230035,Will the emergent SARS-CoV2 B.1.1.7 lineage affect molecular diagnosis of COVID-19?,2021,"Inflammation is an old concept that has started to be considered as an important factor in infection and chronic diseases. The role of leukocytes, the plasmatic components, then of the mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines, and, in recent decades, of the endothelium has completed the concept of the inflammation process. The function of the endothelium appeared to be crucial as a regulator or the initiator of the inflammatory process. Culture of human endothelial cells and experimental systems made it possible to define the molecular basis of inflammation in vascular diseases, in diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, vasculitis and thromboembolic complications. Advanced glycation end product receptor (RAGE), present on endothelial cells (ECs) and monocytes, participates in the activation of these cells in inflammatory conditions. Inflammasome is a cytosolic multiprotein that controls the response to diverse microorganisms. It is positively regulated by stimulator of interferon response CGAMP interactor-1 (STING1). Angiogenesis and thrombotic events are dysregulated during inflammation. ECs appear to be a protector, but also a possible initiator of thrombosis.","Wautier, Jean-Luc; Wautier, Marie-Paule",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),,191

Data on COVID-19-specific symptoms and contact history to COVID-19 cases were retrospectively extracted from patient files and from contact tracing notes. The compliance to the universal testing protocol was high with 90%. Out of 6940 tested patients, 27 new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections (0.4%) were detected. Seven of those COVID-19 cases (26% of all new cases) were asymptomatic and had no positive contact history, but were identified through a positive PCR test. The number needed to identify an asymptomatic patient was 425 in the first wave of the epidemic, 1218 in the low incidence phase. The specificity of the method was above 99.9%.

In the present work, based on the mechanism of the four-way DNA branch migration cascades, we constructed a simple and effective signal amplification strategy for aptamer-based sensitive detection of MUC1. The specific binding of MUC1 to the aptamer sequence in the hairpin probe unfolds and switches its structure, triggering the formation of the DNA Holliday junction structure for cascaded branch migrations with the assistance of two fuel DNA duplexes. Importantly, a target analogue DNA complex can be generated in such processes for recycling the branch migration reactions for the production of substantial amounts of G-quadruplexes, which can bind the thioflavin T dye to show significantly intensified fluorescence for detecting MUC1 with a low detection limit of 2.8 nM without the involvement of any labels or enzymes. In addition, this detection strategy could be successfully applied to monitor the target MUC1 in diluted human serums with a high selectivity and acceptable accuracy to demonstrate its potential application for real samples with the advantages of simplicity and signal amplification capability.","Peng, Ying; Yang, Fang; Li, Xiaolong; Jiang, Bingying; Yuan, Ruo; Xiang, Yun",Analyst,,191

To study the upstream and downstream propagation of these industry-specific demand and supply shocks, we build a dynamic input-output model inspired by previous work on the economic response to natural disasters. We argue that standard production functions, at least in their most parsimonious parametrizations, are not adequate to model input substitutability in the context of Covid-19 shocks. We use a survey of industry analysts to evaluate, for each industry, which inputs were absolutely necessary for production over a short time period. We calibrate our model on the UK economy and study the economic effects of the lockdown that was imposed at the end of March and gradually released in May. Looking back at predictions that we released in May, we show that the model predicted aggregate dynamics very well, and sectoral dynamics to a large extent. We discuss the relative extent to which the model's dynamics and performance was due to the choice of the production function or the choice of an exogenous shock scenario. To further explore the behavior of the model, we use simpler scenarios with only demand or supply shocks, and find that popular metrics used to predict a priori the impact of shocks, such as output multipliers, are only mildly useful.","Pichler, Anton; Pangallo, Marco; Rio-Chanona, R.

The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our Paediatric Emergency Department during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the Paediatric Emergency Department were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection.

The nuclear export protein (XPO1) has a direct role in the export of SARS-CoV proteins including ORF3b, ORF9b, and nucleocapsid. Inhibition of XPO1 induces anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and antioxidant pathways. Selinexor is an FDA-approved XPO1 inhibitor. Through bioinformatics analysis, we predicted nuclear export sequences in the ACE-2 protein and confirmed by in vitro testing that inhibition of XPO1 with selinexor induces nuclear localization of ACE-2. Administration of selinexor inhibited viral infection prophylactically as well as therapeutically in vitro. In a ferret model of COVID-19, selinexor treatment reduced viral load in the lungs and protected against tissue damage in the nasal turbinates and lungs in vivo. Our studies demonstrated that selinexor downregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, and GMCSF, commonly associated with the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 patients. Our findings indicate that nuclear export is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection and for COVID-19 pathology and suggest that inhibition of XPO1 by selinexor could be a viable anti-viral treatment option.","Kashyap, Trinayan; Murray, Jackelyn; Walker, Christopher J; Chang, Hua; Tamir, Sharon; Hou, Bing; Shacham, Sharon; Kauffman, Michael G; Tripp, Ralph A; Landesman, Yosef",Antiviral Res,,191

Based on literature review, we highlight the findings regarding the protective role of vitamin D for infectious diseases of the respiratory system. However, randomized controlled trials are currently lacking. Adequate vitamin D status is obtained from sun exposure and foods rich in vitamin D. Studies in Brazil have shown that hypovitaminosis D is quite common in spite of high insolation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-centre, observational, retrospective study enrolling T1D patients who attended a remote visit on April 2020 at the Endocrinology division of the University Hospital Policlinico Consorziale, Bari, Italy. Lockdown-related changes in physical activity level and dietary habits were assessed on a semi-quantitative basis. Changes in general well-being were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-12 items with a binary scoring system. Glucose metrics were obtained from the Libreview platform for the first 2 weeks of February 2020 (T0) and the last 2 weeks before the phone visit (T1). RESULTS: Out of 84 patients assessed for eligibility, 48 had sufficient FGM data to be included in the analysis. FGM data analysis revealed significant reductions in coefficient of variation, number of hypoglycaemic events, and time below range, while no changes were found in time in range, time above range, mean sensor glucose, and glucose management indicator. Moreover, the frequency of sweets consumption was inversely related to the occurrence of hypoglycaemic events during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown-related lifestyle changes, albeit unhealthy, may lead to reduction in FGM-derived measures of hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability in patients with T1D.","Caruso, Irene; Di Molfetta, Sergio; Guarini, Francesca; Giordano, Fiorella; Cignarelli, Angelo; Natalicchio, Annalisa; Perrini, Sebastio; Leonardini, Anna; Giorgino, Francesco; Laviola, Luigi",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,,191

Here we present for the first time the near-real-time Global Gridded Daily CO$_2$ Emission Datasets (called GRACED) from fossil fuel and cement production with a global spatial-resolution of 0.1$^\circ$ by 0.1$^\circ$ and a temporal-resolution of 1-day. Gridded fossil emissions are computed for different sectors based on the daily national CO$_2$ emissions from near real time dataset (Carbon Monitor), the spatial patterns of point source emission dataset Global Carbon Grid (GID), Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) and spatiotemporal patters of satellite nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) retrievals. Our study on the global CO$_2$ emissions responds to the growing and urgent need for high-quality, fine-grained near-real-time CO2 emissions estimates to support global emissions monitoring across various spatial scales. We show the spatial patterns of emission changes for power, industry, residential consumption, ground transportation, domestic and international aviation, and international shipping sectors between 2019 and 2020. This help us to give insights on the relative contributions of various sectors and provides a fast and fine-grained overview of where and when fossil CO$_2$ emissions have decreased and rebounded in response to emergencies (e.g. COVID-19) and other disturbances of human activities than any previously published dataset. As the world recovers from the pandemic and decarbonizes its energy systems, regular updates of this dataset will allow policymakers to more closely monitor the effectiveness of climate and energy policies and quickly adapt.","Dou, Xinyu; Wang, Yilong; Ciais, Philippe; Chevallier, Fr'ed'eric; Davis, Steven J.; Crippa, Monica; Janssens-Maenhout, Greet; Guizzardi, Diego; Solazzo, Efisio; Yan, Feifan; Huo, Da; Bo, Zheng; Deng, Zhu; Zhu, Biqing; Wang, Hengqi; Zhang, Qiang; Gentine, Pierre; Liu, Zhu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08586v1.pdf,191

Heart transplant recipients may be at particular high risk due to their comorbidities and immunosuppressed state. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes the clinical course and the challenging management of early COVID-19 infection in two heart transplant recipients who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the perioperative period of the transplant procedure. The two patients developed a severe form of the disease and ultimately died despite the initiation of an antiviral monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine coupled with the interruption of mycophenolate mofetil.

264137,Cover 1,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Theoretically, the separate estimation of clearance (CL) and bioavailability (F) requires both intravenous and extravascular injection data. This study investigated whether CL and subcutaneous F of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in humans can be separately estimated from subcutaneous injection data only. METHODS: First, the geometric mean of linear pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, intercompartmental CL [Q], volume of distribution in the central compartment [Vc], and volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment [Vp]) after intravenous injection for mAbs in humans that have been reported in public data sources was estimated from 103 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics and 44 mAbs with nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Next, we estimated the CL and F of 25 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics from plasma/serum mAb concentration-time profiles after subcutaneous injection in humans by fixing the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp based on the public data. Moreover, the plasma/serum concentration-time profile of 25 mAbs after intravenous injection was simulated using the estimated CL and the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in parameters among subclasses (immunoglobulin [Ig] G1, 2, and 4) or in linearity (derivation from linear and nonlinear pharmacokinetics). Using only subcutaneous injection data, we successfully estimated the CL of 23/25 mAbs (92%) and F of all 25 mAbs (100%) within 1.5-fold of the observed value. Moreover, overall, the simulated concentration-time profiles were largely consistent with observed data (90.8% within 1.5-fold of the observed values). CONCLUSIONS: This approach does not require intravenous injection data to separately estimate CL and F after subcutaneous injection in humans and can therefore accelerate the clinical development of mAbs.","Haraya, Kenta; Tachibana, Tatsuhiko",Clin. pharmacokinetics,,191
264737,Serologic Response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 Patients with Different Severity,2020,"We consider the prediction of future research collaborations as a link prediction problem applied on a scientific knowledge graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the prediction of future research collaborations that combines structural and textual information of a scientific knowledge graph through a purposeful integration of graph algorithms and natural language processing techniques. Our work: (i) investigates whether the integration of unstructured textual data into a single knowledge graph affects the performance of a link prediction model, (ii) studies the effect of previously proposed graph kernels based approaches on the performance of an ML model, as far as the link prediction problem is concerned, and (iii) proposes a three-phase pipeline that enables the exploitation of structural and textual information, as well as of pre-trained word embeddings. We benchmark the proposed approach against classical link prediction algorithms using accuracy, recall, and precision as our performance metrics. Finally, we empirically test our approach through various feature combinations with respect to the link prediction problem. Our experimentations with the new COVID-19 Open Research Dataset demonstrate a significant improvement of the abovementioned performance metrics in the prediction of future research collaborations.","Kanakaris, N.; Giarelis, N.; Siachos, I.; Karacapilidis, N.",Entropy,,191

Transcription factors share their binding sites with other factors, co-factors and/or DNA-binding proteins. These proteins form complexes which bind to the DNA as one-units. The binding of two factors to a shared site does not always lead to a functional interaction. RESULTS: We propose a method to predict the combined functions of two factors using comparable binding and expression data (target). We based this method on binding and expression target analysis (BETA), which we re-implemented in R and extended for this purpose. target ranks the factor's targets by importance and predicts the dominant type of interaction between two transcription factors. We applied the method to simulated and real datasets of transcription factor-binding sites and gene expression under perturbation of factors. We found that Yin Yang 1 transcription factor (YY1) and YY2 have antagonistic and independent regulatory targets in HeLa cells, but they may cooperate on a few shared targets. CONCLUSION: We developed an R package and a web application to integrate binding (ChIP-seq) and expression (microarrays or RNA-seq) data to determine the cooperative or competitive combined function of two transcription factors.","Ahmed, Mahmoud; Min, Do Sik; Kim, Deok Ryong",BMC Genomics,,191

In the present work, we have examined the unevenness of global distribution of Covid-19 incidences till 18th June 2021 in terms of the economic condition of countries. Subsequently, we have tried to identify the main underlying factors behind unequal Covid-19 cases. Our analysis suggests that the degree of Isolation, the diffusion of coronavirus (interconnectivity), and the percentage of elderly people in the population are the main causes of the different unequal spread of Covid-19 cases in different countries.

They have been, specifically, the main mean through which the Prime Minister informed Italians about the ever-changing decree-laws and guidelines concerning Italy’s lockdown. Drawing upon literature regarding communication through media, the study was aimed to understand how interpersonal attraction towards the Prime Minister could influence propinquity perceived during his press conferences/live streams, and how this dimension could, in turn, influence Italians’ opinions about the Prime Minister himself, the government in office, and the effectiveness of containment measures. Results showed that perceived propinquity was fostered by both task attraction and social attraction towards the Prime Minister. Higher perceived propinquity resulted in a positive change of opinion about the Prime Minister himself which, in turn, fostered both a positive change of opinion about the Government in office and the perceived effectiveness of imposed rules and guidelines.

281603,The epidemiology and clinical characteristics of co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses in patients during COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The current COVID-19 pandemic scenario has driven surgical departments to a transformation. The worldwide spread of the disease has led to a public health quarantine where health care professionals are at high risk of infection. In this context, telemedicine has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission. This study aims to demonstrate that a combined framework based on telematics and in-person clinical encounter not only ensures medical care but the safety of healthcare professionals and patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive observational study on the follow-up of patients during the COVID19 Pandemic, combining telephone and traditional. RESULTS: A total of 5031 telephone calls were made, differentiating between medical referrals, specialized primary care visits, and outpatient consultation. They were classified as successful, required an in-person visit, or no successful telephone contact. Furthermore, we divided them into 2 groups: resolved and unresolved. 53% of all telematic visits were successful. CONCLUSIONS: Telematic medical systems are a feasible option in a orthopedics department and an interesting resource to preserve once the pandemic is resolved. Future lines of research should be opened to improve system success, analyze its cost-effectiveness ratio, and correct any legal conflicts that may exist.","Miguela Álvarez, S M; Bartra Ylla, A; Salvador Carreño, J; Castillón, P; García Cardona, C; Anglès Crespo, F",Rev. esp. cir. ortop. traumatol.

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Sakarya University Education and Training Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between April 1 and 30, 2020. METHODOLOGY: The study included 55 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of COVID-19, and whose illnesses showed a critical course that leads to AKI. The variables were studied as per objective. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 43 out of 55 patients (78.2%) died and 12 (21.8%) were discharged with recovery. The mortality was higher in patients at stage 3 (88.9% mortality) compared to stage 2 (53.8% mortality) (p=0.014). In the nonsurvivor group, RDW (red cell distribution width) and albumin levels were lower at admission; whereas, the LDH levels and CRP/albumin ratios were higher. On regression analysis, low albumin level (OR: 12.793, p = 0.010), high LDH level (OR: 8.454, p = 0.026), and presence of stage 3 AKI (OR: 10.268, p = 0.020) were found as independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, who developed AKI. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed AKI, it was seen that the presence of low albumin, high LDH, and stage 3 AKI at the time of admission could be used as predictors of mortality. Moreover,, it was shown for the first time that in these patients, the high CRP/albumin ratio and low RDW could be associated with mortality.

Several causes are associated with it, including infectious versus inflammatory and inherited cardiomyopathies. It can be acute, subacute, or chronic, and it can present as focal versus diffuse myocardial dysfunction. Viruses diseases, including the Coxsackie B3 virus, have been a well-established cause of viral myocarditis. It is a significant cause of mortality typically among young individuals due to lymphocytic or granulomatous inflammation of the myocardium. At present, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a detrimental cause of myocarditis with significant mortality and morbidity. Literature has revealed that most of the individuals affected by SARS-CoV-2 have significant other comorbidities, including cardiovascular, renal, or endocrine system-related comorbidities. It is noticed worldwide that patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obesity are at a higher risk of developing severe infection. Obesity itself is related to chronic low-grade inflammation, and SARS-CoV-2 infection creates an environment of an inflammatory storm by excessive activation of cytokines, thus creating a vicious cycle of injury and organ damage. We present the case of a 33-year-old Hispanic morbidly obese male without other comorbidities diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, complicated by severe systolic heart failure due to SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis.","Farooqi, A.; Tahir, N.; Parkash, O.; Ying, G.

Methodology: A systematic review was conducted regarding clinical studies on cases that had neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. The search was carried out in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and LILACS with the following keywords: “coronavirus” or “Sars-CoV-2” or “COVID-19” and “neurologic manifestations” or “neurological symptoms” or “meningitis” or “encephalitis” or “encephalopathy,” following the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Seven studies were included. Neurological alterations after CoV infection may vary from 17.3% to 36.4% and, in the pediatric age range, encephalitis may be as frequent as respiratory disorders, affecting 11 % and 12 % of patients, respectively. The Investigation included 409 patients diagnosed with CoV infection who presented neurological symptoms, with median age range varying from 3 to 62 years. The main neurological alterations were headache (69; 16.8 %), dizziness (57, 13.9 %), altered consciousness (46; 11.2 %), vomiting (26; 6.3 %), epileptic crises (7; 1.7 %), neuralgia (5; 1.2 %), and ataxia (3; 0.7 %). The main presumed diagnoses were acute viral meningitis/encephalitis in 25 (6.1 %) patients, hypoxic encephalopathy in 23 (5.6 %) patients, acute cerebrovascular disease in 6 (1.4 %) patients, 1 (0.2 %) patient with possible acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, 1 (0.2 %) patient with acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and 2 (1.4 %) patients with CoV related to Guillain-Barré syndrome. Conclusion: Coronaviruses have important neurotropic potential and they cause neurological alterations that range from mild to severe. The main neurological manifestations found were headache, dizziness and altered consciousness.","Correia, Alyne Oliveira; Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes; Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; Nogueira, Samuel Átila Rodrigues; Fonseca, Ricardo Brandão; Nobre, Maria Elizabeth Pereira",Neurol.

OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to evaluate the association of a battery of fulfillment, job satisfaction change, COVID-19 concerns, and coping measures. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the fulfillment and coping measures differed by gender and by experience levels among a battery of physician specialties. METHODS: The study was a purposive sample of convenience. Study participants included all trainees and attending orthopedic surgeons from our academic institution; all participants were invited to complete a survey built around a validated measure of professional fulfillment aimed at assessing response to acute change and stressors. We performed univariate statistics and a matrix correlational analysis to correlate different survey domains with variables of interest. RESULTS: The survey was sent electronically to 138 individuals; 63 surveys were completed (response rateâ=â45.7%). Twenty-seven (42.8%) individuals met the threshold criteria for fulfillment whereas 10 (15.9%) met the threshold for burnout. We found that surgeon perspectives on COVID-19 were not associated with burnout or professional fulfillment. Burnout was inversely associated with professional fulfillment (Râ=â-0.35). Support seeking was noted to be correlated with professional fulfillment (Râ=â0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Stressors related to COVID-19 pandemic were not correlated with physician burnout and fulfillment. This held true even when stratifying by gender and by attending vs. trainee. Continued efforts should be implemented to protect against physician burnout and ensure professional fulfillment for Orthopedic surgeons.","Lazarides, Alexander L; Belay, Elshaday S; Anastasio, Albert T; Cook, Chad E; Anakwenze, Oke A",Work,,191

In February 2020 an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews were conducted on 4807 SMEs in Sichuan to assess the challenges associated with work resumption and the associated policy requirements. It was found that most SMEs were unable to resume work because of a shortage of epidemic mitigation materials, the inability of employees to return to work, disrupted supply chains, and reduced market demand. Many SMEs were also facing cash flow risks as they had to continue to pay for various fixed expenditures even though they had little or no revenue. As these delays in work resumption have put unprecedented pressures on the survival of many SMEs, recommendations relevant to China and other affected countries regarding cash flow relief, work resumption and consumption stimulation are given to assist SME survival and economic recovery from the disaster situation.","Lu, Yi; Wu, Jing; Peng, Junlin; Lu, Li",Environ.

292629,Possible vertical transmission and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among infants born to mothers with COVID-19: A living systematic review,2020,"The world's poorest countries were hit hardest by COVID-19 due to their limited capacities to combat the pandemic. The urban water supply and water consumption are affected by the pandemic because it intensified the existing deficits in the urban water supply and sanitation services. In this study, we develop an integrated spatial analysis approach to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on multi-dimensional Urban Water Consumption Patterns (UWCPs) with the aim of forecasting the water demand. We selected the Tabriz metropolitan area as a case study area and applied an integrated approach of GIS spatial analysis and regression-based autocorrelation assessment to develop the UWCPs for 2018, 2019 and 2020. We then employed GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis and a CA-Markov model to analyze the water demand under the impacts of COVID-19 and to forecast the UWCPs for 2021, 2022 and 2023. In addition, we tested the spatial uncertainty of the prediction maps using the Dempster Shafer Theory. The results show that the domestic water consumption increased by 17.57% during the year 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum increase in water consumption was observed in spring 2020 (April-June) when strict quarantine regulations were in place. Based on our results, the annual water deficit in Tabriz has increased from ~18% to about 30% in 2020. In addition, our projections show that this may further increase to about 40-45% in 2021. Relevant stakeholders can use the findings to develop evidence-informed strategies for sustainable water resource management in the post-COVID era. This research also makes other significant contributions. From the environmental perspective, since COVID-19 has affected resource management in many parts of the world, the proposed method can be applied to similar contexts to mitigate the adverse impacts and developed better informed recovery plans.","Feizizadeh, Bakhtiar; Omarzadeh, Davoud; Ronagh, Zahra; Sharifi, Ayyoob; Blaschke, Thomas; Lakes, Tobia",Sci Total Environ,,191

Transthoracic echocardiography is an ideal imaging modality for goal-directed assessment and optimization of cardiac function and volume status. Prone positioning, while demonstrated to improve oxygenation, offload the right ventricle, and reduce short-term mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome, has previously precluded transthoracic echocardiography on these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability to perform focused transthoracic echocardiography examinations on acute respiratory distress syndrome patients in the prone position. Design: We performed a cross-sectional study of critically ill patients hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. Setting: This study was conducted in medical and surgical intensive units in a tertiary hospital. Patients: We examined 27 mechanically ventilated and prone patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. Participants were examined at the time of enrollment in an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04306393), and no patients were excluded from echocardiographic analysis. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We were able to perform transthoracic echocardiography and obtain satisfactory images for quantitative assessment of right ventricular function in 24 out of 27 (88.9%) and left ventricular function in 26 out of 27 (96.3%) of patients in the prone position, including many who were obese and on high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (&#8805; 15 cm H2O). Conclusions: Transthoracic echocardiography can be performed at the prone patient's bedside by critical care intensivists.

METHODS: From April 30 to May 12, 2020, four interviewers conducted 38 expert interviews via telephone, video or face-to-face by using a semi-standardized questionnaire. The standardized answers were analysed descriptively. The free text-answers were subject to a qualitative content analysis. The categories were analysed via quantitative frequency distributions. RESULTS: All chief physicians with responsibility for inpatient and outpatient health care at the UKE took part in this study (N=38). The leading physicians reported numerous changes regarding occupancy in the hospital, patient composition, work flows and diagnostic as well as therapeutic measures. Additionally, various arrangements were necessary to cover the needs of prevention, treatment and follow-up care as well as protection of staff. Measures showed, on the one hand, a strong reduction in occupancy and workload in most inpatient and outpatient clinics. On the other hand, the amount of work also increased by fundamental transitions of work flows, communication, staff structure and hygiene measures. Many respondents commented positively on the rapid and efficient setup of a digital communication structure. Partially, staff was strained by the pandemic itself and by the associated measures. CONCLUSION: The results of the study help to understand and assess the effects of the pandemic on health care, work flows and staff. The findings may support the specification and adaptation of prospective measures and processes for pandemic crisis situations. Future studies should investigate how staff beneath the highest executive level experienced and evaluated this crisis and consequences.","Härter, Martin; Bremer, Daniel; Scherer, Martin; von dem Knesebeck, Olaf; Koch-Gromus, Uwe",Gesundheitswesen,,191
298476,ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine: asymptomatic efficacy estimates - Authors' reply,2021,"PURPOSE: Results of the 2020 ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings are presented. METHODS: Pharmacy directors at 1,437 general and children's medical/surgical hospitals in the United States were surveyed using a mixed-mode method of contact by email and mail. Survey completion was online. IQVIA supplied data on hospital characteristics; the survey sample was drawn from the IQVIA hospital database. RESULTS: The response rate was 18.7%. Almost all hospitals (92.5%) have a method for pharmacists to review medication orders on demand. Most hospitals (74.5%) use automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) as their primary method for drug distribution. A third of hospitals use barcodes to verify doses during dispensing in the pharmacy and to verify ingredients when intravenous medications are compounded. More than 80% scan barcodes when restocking ADCs. Sterile workflow management technology is used in 21.3% of hospitals. Almost three-quarters of hospitals outsource some sterile preparations. Pharmacists can independently prescribe in 21.1% of hospitals. Pharmacist practice in ambulatory clinics in 46.2% of health systems and provide telepharmacy services in 28.4% of health systems. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists continue their responsibility in their traditional role in preparation and dispensing of medications. They have successfully employed technology to improve safety and efficiency in performance of these duties and have employed emerging technologies to improve the safety, timeliness, and efficiency of the administration of drugs to patients. As pharmacists continue to expand their role to all aspects of medication use, new opportunities highlighted in ASHP's Practice Advancement Initiative 2030 have been identified.","Pedersen, Craig A; Schneider, Philip J; Ganio, Michael C; Scheckelhoff, Douglas J",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,191
300927,Role of Renin-Angiotensin System in Acute Lung Injury Caused by Viral Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Translation of diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) into a digital format can improve access, but few digital programs have demonstrated outcomes using rigorous evaluation metrics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a digital DSMES program on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A single-arm, nonrandomized trial was performed to evaluate a digital DSMES program that includes remote monitoring and lifestyle change, in addition to comprehensive diabetes education staffed by a diabetes specialist. A sample of 195 participants were recruited using an online research platform (Achievement Studies, Evidation Health Inc). The primary outcome was change in laboratory-tested HbA1c from baseline to 4 months, and secondary outcomes included change in lipids, diabetes distress, and medication adherence. RESULTS: At baseline, participants had a mean HbA1c of 8.9% (SD 1.9) and mean BMI of 37.5 kg/m2 (SD 8.3). The average age was 45.1 years (SD 8.9), 70% were women, and 67% were White. At 4-month follow up, the HbA1c decreased by 0.8% (P<.001, 95% CI -1.1 to -0.5) for the total population and decreased by 1.4% (P<.001, 95% CI -1.8 to -0.9) for those with an HbA1c of >9.0% at baseline. Diabetes distress and medication adherence were also significantly improved between baseline and follow up. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides early evidence that a digitally enhanced DSMES program improves HbA1c and disease self-management outcomes.","Wilson-Anumudu, Folasade; Quan, Ryan; Castro Sweet, Cynthia; Cerrada, Christian; Juusola, Jessie; Turken, Michael; Bradner Jasik, Carolyn",JMIR Diabetes,,191

OBJECTIVE.­: To review the hematologic complications associated with the HIV and other viral pandemics, the current theories regarding their causation, and the incidence and clinical impact of these complications on infected patients. DATA SOURCES.­: Peer-reviewed medical literature and the author's personal experience. CONCLUSIONS.­: The HIV and other viral pandemics have been associated with a variety of hematologic complications that often cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. HIV infection is associated with multiple hematologic disorders, many of which have a lower incidence in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy but still represent a major clinical problem for HIV-infected patients. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-related hematologic complications, including HIV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, has evolved in recent years. Other viral pandemics, including H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and COVID-19, have also been associated with hematologic complications of varying severity. Our emerging understanding of the pathogenesis of the hematologic complications of HIV, COVID-19, and other viral pandemics may help in prevention, correct diagnosis, and treatment of these complications in current and future pandemics.","Karcher, Donald S",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

314230,Excessive lysosomal ion-trapping of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory viral illness that has spread rapidly across the world. However, the United Kingdom has been particularly affected. Evidence has suggested that stroke, cardiac, and spinal presentations decreased during the pandemic as the public avoided seeking care. The effect on neurosurgical presentations and referrals during COVID-19 is unclear. Our aim, therefore, was to describe the referral patterns to a high-volume neurosurgical department in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Electronic referrals were identified from the referrals database from January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, inclusive, with January used as the baseline. The demographic data and referral diagnoses were captured on Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Differences between referral volumes were evaluated using &#967;2 goodness-of-fit tests. RESULTS: A total of 2293 electronic referrals had been received during the study period. The median age was 63 years. Overall, the referrals had decreased significantly in volume during the study period [&#967;2(4) = 60.95; P < 0.001]. We have described the patterns in the daily referrals as the pandemic progressed. The reduction in the volume of referrals for degenerative spine cases and traumatic brain injuries was statistically significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The referrals for degenerative spine and traumatic brain injuries decreased significantly during the pandemic, which can be explained by the lower vehicular traffic and patient avoidance of healthcare services, respectively. The risk of neurological deterioration and increased morbidity and mortality, as a consequence, is of concern, and neurosurgeons worldwide should consider the optimal strategies to mitigate these risks as the pandemic eases.","Jayakumar, Nithish; Kennion, Oliver; Villabona, Alvaro Rojas; Paranathala, Menaka; Holliman, Damian",World Neurosurg,,191
314340,Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 2 weeks after the first dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,2021,"The Republic of Croatia initiated in 2015 a pilot project named e-School that included, among its aims, the development of a model of “digitally mature” schools, so that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have a relevant place at all educational levels and are incorporated into the curriculum with a view to improve the technological skills of both teachers and students alike. The implementation of this experimental project, which has been given the title of ‘School for Life’, is expected to be carried out this very year, 2020. Given the current situation that many education systems find themselves in as a result of the COVID19 pandemic, the project has proven to be a particularly timely and significant reform. However, classrooms and educational centres, that have normally been the witnesses of such transformations, have been replaced by a completely different scenario: i. e the home and family environment. It is in this new context in which many of the proposals the reform was created and promoted with must be applied today. Among its challenges was developing a comprehensive change in relation to teaching methods, with an increased emphasis to be placed on technological resources. Nowadays, computers and tablets, together with other technological resources, have become the primary means for its application. Facing this reality, the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education has published several reports in which they present guidelines, specific rules and diverse patterns that may be followed by teachers, headmasters, families and also students, in order to achieve an effective online learning model. Considering both circumstances, a running reform and the need of establishing a new virtual education model due to unexpected circumstances, we analyse in this article reports published by the Croatian government outlining the facilitation of this transition in which the value of the technological resources with regard to curricular reform has been shown.","Bautista, Alicia Sianes; Lissen, Encarnación Sánchez",Rev.

Here, we find that because of significantly reduced potential energy barriers, which also give rise to pronounced quantum effects, the rotational dynamics of the most dynamically active methyl groups in apilimod and tetrandrine are much faster than those in remdesivir. Because dynamics of methyl groups are essential for biochemical activity, screening studies based on the computed potential energy profiles may help identify promising candidates within a given class of drugs.","Mamontov, Eugene; Cheng, Yongqiang; Daemen, Luke L; Kolesnikov, Alexander I; Ramirez-Cuesta, Anibal J; Ryder, Matthew R; Stone, Matthew B",Chem Phys Lett,,191
317641,Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome: from basic to clinics,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mental illness (MI) is common among those who work in health care settings. Whether MI is related to employees' mental status at work is yet to be determined. An MI app is developed and proposed to help employees assess their mental status in the hope of detecting MI at an earlier stage. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to build a model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fit statistics based on 2 aspects of measures and outfit mean square errors for the automatic detection and classification of personal MI at the workplace using the emotional labor and mental health (ELMH) questionnaire, so as to equip the staff in assessing and understanding their own mental status with an app on their mobile device. METHODS: We recruited 352 respiratory therapists (RTs) working in Taiwan medical centers and regional hospitals to fill out the 44-item ELMH questionnaire in March 2019. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA), Rasch analysis, and CNN were used as unsupervised and supervised learnings for (1) dividing RTs into 4 classes (ie, MI, false MI, health, and false health) and (2) building an ELMH predictive model to estimate 108 parameters of the CNN model. We calculated the prediction accuracy rate and created an app for classifying MI for RTs at the workplace as a web-based assessment. RESULTS: We observed that (1) 8 domains in ELMH were retained by EFA, (2) 4 types of mental health (n=6, 63, 265, and 18 located in 4 quadrants) were classified using the Rasch analysis, (3) the 44-item model yields a higher accuracy rate (0.92), and (4) an MI app available for RTs predicting MI was successfully developed and demonstrated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The 44-item model with 108 parameters was estimated by using CNN to improve the accuracy of mental health for RTs. An MI app developed to help RTs self-detect work-related MI at an early stage should be made more available and viable in the future.","Yan, Yu-Hua; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chou, Willy; Hsing, Shu-Chen",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,191

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of testing serum IL-6 and other serological and clinical biomarkers, to predict a short-term negative clinical course of patients with noncritical COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 208 patients with noncritical COVID-19 pneumonia at admission were consecutively enrolled. Clinical and laboratory findings obtained on admission were analyzed by using survival analysis and stepwise logistic regression for variable selection. Three-day worsening as outcome in a logistic model to generate a prognostic score was used. RESULTS: Clinical worsening occurred in 63 patients (16 = died; 39 = transferred to intensive care unit; 8 worsening of respiratory failure). Forty-five of them worsened within 3 days after admission. The risk of clinical worsening was progressively enhanced along with increasing quartiles of IL-6 levels. Multivariate analysis showed that IL-6 (P = .005), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = .003), and SaO2/FiO2 (P = .014) were the best predictors for clinical deterioration in the first 3 days after admission. The combined score yielded an area under the curve = 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-0.93). A nomogram predicting the probability of 3-day worsening was generated. The score also showed good performance for 7-day and 14- or 21-day worsening and in predicting death occurring during all the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combining IL-6, CRP, and SaO2/FiO2 in a score may help clinicians to identify on admission those patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for a further 3-day clinical deterioration.","Vultaggio, Alessandra; Vivarelli, Emanuele; Virgili, Gianni; Lucenteforte, Ersilia; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Nozzoli, Carlo; Morettini, Alessandro; Berni, Andrea; Malandrino, Danilo; Rossi, Oliviero; Nencini, Francesca; Pieralli, Filippo; Peris, Adriano; Lagi, Filippo; Scocchera, Giulia; Spinicci, Michele; Trotta, Michele; Mazzetti, Marcello; Parronchi, Paola; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Liotta, Francesco; Fontanari, Paolo; Mazzoni, Alessio; Salvati, Lorenzo; Maggi, Enrico; Annunziato, Francesco; Almerigogna, Fabio; Matucci, Andrea",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,191

It explores the part played by key policy actors, particularly politicians and scientists, and focuses on two difficult policy issues during the first wave: the establishment of a 'test, trace and isolate' system and responses to the high death rate in care homes for older people. Drawing on a wide range of documentary evidence, including parliamentary papers and SAGE minutes, this book draws attention to the importance of longstanding structural problems in public health and the care sector, especially the impact of outsourcing and privatisation. © 2020 Bristol University Press.","Lewis, J.",The Challenge of Controlling COVID-19: Public Health and Social Care Policy in England During the First Wave,,191

Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.","Coulthard, Helen; Sharps, Maxine; Cunliffe, Louise; van den Tol, Annemieke",Appetite,,191
326996,Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccination,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the time needed to develop a vaccine or definitive treatment for the disease have caused great anxiety in communities, especially in pregnant women whose high levels of distress may have short and/or long-term maternal and fetal consequence. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between anxiety induced by COVID-19 and perceived social support in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This online cross-sectional study was conducted on 801 pregnant women from all over Iran in 2020. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the coronavirus disease anxiety scale. A standard multiple linear regression model was used to identify the association between perceived social support and anxiety, controlling for possible confounding variables. Partial r was used as an estimate of effect size. RESULTS: The mean anxiety score was 10.7 ± 8.0, in which its level was moderate in 122 (15.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.8-17.9%)) of the participants, and severe in 28 (3.4%; 95% CI: 2.3-5.0%) of them. The mean score of perceived social support was 48.2 ± 7.6. 6.9% (95% CI: 5.2-8.8%) and 93.1% (95% CI: 91.2-94.8%) of the participants reported mild and moderate levels of perceived social support, respectively. The results of the multiple linear model showed a significant negative correlation between perceived social support and anxiety levels in a way that for every 10 units increase in the perceived social support score, the anxiety level of pregnant women was decreased by 0.8 units (B= -0.08, t= -2.08, p = 0.037), which was a small effect size (partial r = -0.07). CONCLUSION: There was a small significant relationship between the perceived social support and COVID-19 anxiety.

The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global population with >110 million confirmed cases and 2.5 million deaths. The most common initial symptoms of COVID-19 infection are cough, dyspnoea, fever, malaise and anosmia. Severe clinical manifestations include respiratory compromise, pneumonia, organ failure and death. There have been many other less common symptoms as a result of COVID-19 described in the literature, including significant rates of olfactory dysfunction. However, we believe there has been only one other previously documented cases of bilateral hearing loss.Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a relatively common presentation seen by otolaryngologists. It is defined as rapid hearing loss, &#8805;30 dB occurring over 3 consecutive days in three contiguous sound frequencies. The exact pathological process is yet to be fully characterised, though it is most commonly unilateral and commonly develops shortly following viral infection. Treatment typically consists of glucocorticoid steroids administered orally, via intratympanic injection or a combination of both routes though there are currently no standardised management of these patients.Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is rare, accounting for <2% of all cases. We describe a case of bilateral SSNHL in a 68-year-old patient who presented with profound hearing loss shortly after symptomatic infection with COVID-19, which at the time of publication is the first such case reported in the literature.","Edwards, Michael; Muzaffar, Jameel; Naik, Paresh; Coulson, Christopher",BMJ case reports,,191

The perspective of end users on the characteristics and clinical use of these assays has not been previously considered. Methods: We surveyed 17,186 health care professions (HCPs) in 29 countries to gauge opinion on the design, use, diagnostic impact and diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 tests. Results were correlated with national statistics on the burden of disease and testing in individual countries. Results: HCPs overwhelmingly recognized the importance of COVID-19 tests but 37.1% were unsure of the appropriate timing of investigations relative to disease symptoms. Confidence in the diagnostic accuracy of assays varied inversely with COVID-19-related mortality in individual countries but had no relationship with the total number of tests performed. There was global consensus that the most important impact of positive antigen and antibody testing was confidence in returning to work following recovery. Saliva was the preferred sampling fluid for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in all groups surveyed. Conclusions: HCP input can ensure novel assays are fit for purpose in varied global health care settings, but HCPs may require support to effectively use novel diagnostics thus minimizing waste when supplies are limited.","Shields, Adrian M; Brown, Hannah; Phillips, Neil; Drayson, Mark T; Richter, Anton A; Richter, Alex G",Front Public Health,,191

It took 15 years from the time of that pandemic to isolate the virus.3 Burnet, recipient of the Nobel prize for physiology and medicine in 1960 for his contribution to the elucidation of acquired immunological tolerance, and who is likely best known to rheumatologists for his clonal selection theory of antibody production,4 was the first to cultivate the influenza virus on developing hen eggs in 1935.5 With his continuing research,6 this achievement ultimately enabled developments that culminated in the production and successful application of influenza vaccines almost a decade later.7 8 Why is influenza mentioned here? [...]because it has been proposed to occasionally elicit autoantibodies like rheumatoid factor and anti-phospholipid antibodies,9 observations that also have been reported for patients with COVID-19 in ARD recently.10 11 Third, because we have learnt in previous studies that disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, interfere with the efficacy of influenza vaccination only to a small extent,12 while rituximab has significant effects in this respect.13 These and other pieces of information are contained in a timely update of EULAR recommendations regarding vaccinations last year14 but also most recently in EULAR points to consider for the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes published in this issue.15 And fourth and finally, because the example of a single personality, a pillar and hero across many areas of medicine, Sir Burnet reveals how closely related research into infectious disease and investigations of immunological mechanisms are. All these foundations within the field remain relevant in current therapeutic approaches: convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and vaccination with spike protein are exploratory or approved and effective therapeutic or preventive options. [...]medicines that are part of the rheumatologists’ armamentarium appear to be efficacious against severe COVID-19.18 19 This excursion to Burnet, Ehrlich and Behring should remind us that epidemics and pandemics have been around since times past—obviously already much before the 20th century, such as the plague—and were ultimately successfully conquered. Several points-to-consider or recommendations are presented in this June issue: one on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 (accompanied by an elegant editorial)24 25;one on the important topic of adherence to treatment26;and one on the standardisation of scoring in arthritis models, an area where standardisation had not been undertaken hitherto.27 A review authored by one of the world’s premier groups provides an important summary of current knowledge and prospects on functional genomics.28 In the ‘Heroes and Pillars of Rheumatology’ section, eminent authors remind us of two major figures in rheumatology of the late 20th century into the most recent years, Charles L Christian and Joachim R Kalden, a US and a European hero, respectively, who have inspired the whole world with their research and personalities.29 30 These remarkable leaders were among the most important scientific and clinical pillars of modern rheumatology, mentoring numerous rheumatologists, including chairpersons of rheumatology departments who are active in our current day, and both having been Presidents of the respective major organisations across the Atlantic, namely, ACR and EULAR.","Smolen, Josef S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,,191

DN leadership and its importance have come to the fore during the COVID-19 crisis, where hospital discharges have increased rapidly to make way for highly complex admissions (HM Government, 2020). This paper examines the importance of the SPQDN qualification, exploring the role of the DN within practice education. Continuation of the vital DN qualification will ensure that the numbers of qualified DNs increase, ultimately protecting community capacity. With a move towards an apprenticeship model to achieve the SPQDN, DNs must engage with and influence curriculum development to confirm courses deliver requirements of the workplace, commissioners and the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan. Expectations of the DN role within practice education have changed, moving away from the practice teacher standards to the new Nursing and Midwifery Council Standards for Student Support and Assessment. This poses new challenges in DN education in practice. The implications of this transition threaten to de-value the quality of the assessment process by removing the high standards of preparation previously demanded; ultimately, this is a risk to the provision of the quality practice education that previously existed.","Ashworth, Lisa",Br J Community Nurs,,191

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Data were drawn from interviews with 327 individuals incarcerated after March 16, 2020, in Midwest1, Midwest2 and Southeast state using a questionnaire developed for this purpose. All study participants were actively involved in a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral health reentry intervention and the human subjects board approved the supplement of this study on COVID-19; interviews were conducted from April 15 to November 19, 2020. FINDINGS: Overall, 9.89% of participants contracted COVID-19. Most (68.50%) individuals learned about COVID-19 from television compared to official correctional facility announcements (32.42%). Participants wore face masks (85.02%), washed hands (84.40%) and practiced physical distancing when possible (66.36%). Participants reported that facilities suspended visitation (89.60%) and volunteers (82.57%), provided face masks (83.18%), sanitized (68.20%), conducted temperature checks (55.35%) and released individuals early (7.34%).

AIM: This study aims to investigate coronavirus disease-related occupational stress and its single and cumulative effect on mental health and self-efficacy among CMHWs. METHODS: A quick-response online cross-sectional survey WA conducted during the coronavirus disease outbreak. A total of 536 CMHWs were recruited in March 2020, in China. Demographics, occupational stress, depression, anxiety, positive and negative emotions, and self-efficacy were collected. Logistic regression analysis was employed to test the single and cumulative effect of occupational stress on mental health and self-efficacy. RESULTS: CMHWs did not show high level of depression or anxiety in this study. Those who provided service for suspected people who were quarantined reported higher risk of depression and anxiety. Staying out for more than 3 days was a risk factor of depression while cleaning/sterilising streets or communities was a protective factor of depression. Those who received psychiatric training showed higher positive emotion and self-efficacy, and providing psychological assistance online increased the self-efficacy. CMHWs with two different types of work had 0.996 times more risk of depression than those with only one type of work. CONCLUSION: The potential cumulative effect of occupation stress suggested that reasonable job assignment and organisational support are necessary safeguards for CMHWs.","Sun, Yaoyao; Song, Haidong; Liu, Hong; Mao, Fangxiang; Sun, Xiaohua; Cao, Fenglin",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,191

As a result, in the absence of centrally coordinated production and distribution efforts, supply chains for masks, respirators, and materials for advanced filtration technology are immensely burdened. Here we describe experimental efforts to nondestructively quantify three vital characteristics of mask approaches: breathability, material filtration effectiveness, and sensitivity to fit. We focus on protection against water aerosols $>$0.3$\mu$m using off-the-shelf particulate, flow, and pressure sensors, permitting rapid comparative evaluation of these three properties. We present and discuss both the pressure drop and the particle transmission as a function of flow to permit comparison of relative protection for a set of proposed filter and mask designs. The design considerations of the testing apparatus can be reproduced by university laboratories and medical facilities and used for rapid local quality control of respirator masks which are of uncertified origin, monitoring the long-term effects of various disinfection schemes, and evaluating improvised products not designed or marketed for filtration.","Sheets, Donal; Shaw, Jamie; Baldwin, Michael; Daggett, David; Elali, Ibrahim; Curry, Erin; Sochnikov, Ilya; Hancock, Jason N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02470v1.pdf,191

The necessity to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep health care systems efficient resulted in the forced, drastic limitation of economic activity. Many service sectors were hit particularly hard with this but industry and agriculture were also affected. In particular, the pandemic substantially influenced financial markets and we can observe that some markets or instruments vary in stability since they have been affected in the different degree. In the paper, we present the problem of stability of stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the low number of works related to CEE countries during the pandemic, we analyze the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which is one of the most important markets in the CEE. Our main goal was to find how various industries represented by stock market indices have reacted to the COVID-19 shock and consequently which sectors turned out to keep stability and remained resistant to the pandemic. In our investigation, we use two clustering methods: the K-means and the Ward techniques with the criterion of maximizing the silhouette coefficient and six indicators describing stability in terms of profitability, volume, overbought/oversold conditions and volatility. The results of the research present that during the pandemic it was possible to identify 5 clusters of sector indices in the short term and 4 in the medium term. We found that the composition of the clusters is quite stable over time and that none of the obtained clusters can be univocally considered the most or the least stable taking into account all the analyzed indicators. However, we showed that the obtained clusters have different stability origins, i.e. they vary from each other in terms of the investigated indicators of stability.","Buszko, Michal; Orzeszko, Witold; Stawarz, Marcin",PLoS One,,191
343980,Effects of ace inhibitors and angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers on ACE-2 expression in human alveolar epithelial cells,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic of historic proportions and continues to spread globally, with enormous consequences to human health. Currently there is no vaccine, effective therapeutic, or prophylactic. As with other betacoronaviruses, attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 are mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third-generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based differences in antiviral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH, and 6-O-desulfated enoxaparin with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 5.99 µg/liter, 1.08 mg/liter, 1.77 µg/liter, and 5.86 mg/liter, respectively. In summary, several sulfated polysaccharides show potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and can be developed for prophylactic as well as therapeutic purposes.IMPORTANCE The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world has created a pandemic situation unprecedented in modern history. While ACE2 has been identified as the viral receptor, cellular polysaccharides have also been implicated in virus entry. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) binds to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we report structure-based differences in antiviral activity and affinity to SGP for several sulfated polysaccharides, including both well-characterized FDA-approved drugs and novel marine sulfated polysaccharides, which can be developed for prophylactic as well as therapeutic purposes.","Tandon, Ritesh; Sharp, Joshua S; Zhang, Fuming; Pomin, Vitor H; Ashpole, Nicole M; Mitra, Dipanwita; McCandless, Martin G; Jin, Weihua; Liu, Hao; Sharma, Poonam; Linhardt, Robert J",J. virol,,191

344799,SARS-CoV-2 Is Present in Peritoneal Fluid in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Pro-inflammatory activation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) is causally linked to obesity and obesity-associated disorders. A number of studies have demonstrated the crucial role of mitochondrial metabolism in macrophage activation. However, there is a lack of pharmaceutical agents to target the mitochondrial metabolism of ATMs for the treatment of obesity-related diseases. Here, we characterize a near-infrared fluorophore (IR-61) that preferentially accumulates in the mitochondria of ATMs and has a therapeutic effect on diet-induced obesity as well as obesity-associated insulin resistance and fatty liver. IR-61 inhibits the classical activation of ATMs by increasing mitochondrial complex levels and oxidative phosphorylation via the ROS/Akt/Acly pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that specific enhancement of ATMs oxidative phosphorylation improves chronic inflammation and obesity-related disorders. IR-61 might be an anti-inflammatory agent useful for the treatment of obesity-related diseases by targeting the mitochondria of ATMs.","Wang, Yawei; Tang, Binlin; Long, Lei; Luo, Peng; Xiang, Wei; Li, Xueru; Wang, Huilan; Jiang, Qingzhi; Tan, Xu; Luo, Shenglin; Li, Huijuan; Wang, Ziwen; Chen, Zelin; Leng, Yu; Jiang, Zhongyong; Wang, Yang; Ma, Le; Wang, Rui; Zeng, Chunyu; Liu, Zujuan; Wang, Yu; Miao, Hongming; Shi, Chunmeng",Nat Commun,,191

High death numbers have caused a massive panic across the globe. Fast and early diagnosis is the key for preventing the virus from spreading. Besides PCR test, computed tomography (CT) of lungs is also used for diagnosis of COVID-19. Since the amount of testing kits for the diagnosis is insufficient and the conventional diagnosis methods are slow, developing AI-based fast diagnosis tools is not only an alternative way but also an urgent requirement for such alarming situations as those people faced with today. In this study, we employed three popular CNN models, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception, to classify CT scans of suspected patient cases as COVED-19 infected and non-COVID-19.

358510,Novel coronavirus pneumonia,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Health care providers (HCPs) have experienced more stress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. We compared sources and levels of stress, distress, and approaches to coping between nurses and physicians, and examined whether coping strategies helped mitigate the negative impact of stress and intentions to quit. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models. RESULTS: Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies. DISCUSSION: The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches.","Lou, Nigel Mantou; Montreuil, Tina; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Lavoie-Tremblay, Mélanie; Bhanji, Farhan; Kennedy, Heather; Kaneva, Pepa; Harley, Jason M",J. contin. educ. health prof,,191

362338,Public activities preceding the onset of acute respiratory infection syndromes in adults in England - implications for the use of social distancing to control pandemic respiratory infections,2020,"ABSTRACT: Long-term care residents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience high mortality rates and require frequent screening. Most resident testing occurs via nasopharyngeal swab that potentially causes epistaxis with rates of 5% to 8% in healthy populations. It is estimated that 48% of long-term care residents receive oral anticoagulation that increases risk of bleeding. A long-term care resident receiving oral anticoagulation experienced an episode of acute blood loss anemia after nasopharyngeal sampling. Current medications were not reviewed before testing, and oral anticoagulation was not held resulting in acute blood loss anemia. A medication review is indicated for skilled nursing and assisted living residents to identify oral anticoagulation before nasopharyngeal testing. Less invasive testing may be recommended or should bleeding occur, discontinuation of oral anticoagulation for a short term may be appropriate.","Watkins, April Kathleen; Heinzman, Kristopher M; Kurian, Thomas K; Hong, Mauricio; Clark, Angela P; Champion, Jane Dimmitt",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),,191
363934,The complex relationship between viruses and inflammatory bowel disease – review and practical advices for the daily clinical decision-making during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has re-ignited interest in the possible role of vitamin D in modulation of host responses to respiratory pathogens. Indeed, vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a potential preventative or therapeutic strategy. Recommendations for any intervention, particularly in the context of a potentially fatal pandemic infection, should be strictly based on clinically informed appraisal of the evidence base. In this narrative review, we examine current evidence relating to vitamin D and COVID-19 and consider the most appropriate practical recommendations. OBSERVATIONS: Although there are a growing number of studies investigating the links between vitamin D and COVID-19, they are mostly small and observational with high risk of bias, residual confounding, and reverse causality. Extrapolation of molecular actions of 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D to an effect of increased 25(OH)-vitamin D as a result of vitamin D supplementation is generally unfounded, as is the automatic conclusion of causal mechanisms from observational studies linking low 25(OH)-vitamin D to incident disease. Efficacy is ideally demonstrated in the context of adequately powered randomised intervention studies, although such approaches may not always be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: At present, evidence to support vitamin D supplementation for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 is inconclusive. In the absence of any further compelling data, adherence to existing national guidance on vitamin D supplementation to prevent vitamin D deficiency, predicated principally on maintaining musculoskeletal health, appears appropriate.","Raisi-Estabragh, Zahra; Martineau, Adrian R; Curtis, Elizabeth M; Moon, Rebecca J; Darling, Andrea; Lanham-New, Susan; Ward, Kate A; Cooper, Cyrus; Munroe, Patricia B; Petersen, Steffen E; Harvey, Nicholas C",Aging Clin Exp Res,,191

Despite several emerging vaccines, there remains no verifiable therapeutic targeted specifically to the virus. Here we present a highly effective small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system. Multiple siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were screened, and three candidate siRNAs emerged that effectively inhibit the virus by greater than 90% either alone or in combination with one another. We simultaneously developed and screened two novel LNP formulations for the delivery of these candidate siRNA therapeutics to the lungs, an organ that incurs immense damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encapsulation of siRNAs in these LNPs followed by in vivo injection demonstrated robust repression of virus in the lungs and a pronounced survival advantage to the treated mice. Our LNP-siRNA approaches are scalable and can be administered upon the first sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. We suggest that an siRNA-LNP therapeutic approach could prove highly useful in treating COVID-19 disease as an adjunctive therapy to current vaccine strategies.","Idris, Adi; Davis, Alicia; Supramaniam, Aroon; Acharya, Dhruba; Kelly, Gabrielle; Tayyar, Yaman; West, Nic; Zhang, Ping; McMillan, Christopher L D; Soemardy, Citradewi; Ray, Roslyn; O039,; Meally, Denis; Scott, Tristan A; McMillan, Nigel A J; Morris, Kevin V",Mol Ther,,191

One of the Indonesian government decisions to reduce the infection is home base teleworking (working from home) policies for mostly all sectors in Indonesia, one of them is the public sector. This new work style that has never been experienced before may cause psychological stress of workload and affect satisfaction. This research aims to measure the effects of teleworking on job satisfaction mediated by the workload in 168 public sector workers all over Indonesia. Data obtained using an online questionnaire from February – March 2020 and analyzed use Smart-PLS software. The result showed that teleworking has a significant effect on the workload, but not significant effect on job satisfaction. Workload has a negative and not significant effect on job satisfaction. Hence, the workload is not the best predictor for mediating the effect of teleworking and job satisfaction. Workers in the public sector feeling more stressed during teleworking and it caused their job satisfaction to decrease. This kind of situation can be a sign for the decision-maker on how to improve their worker's job satisfaction during the teleworking.","Novianti, Khusnul Rofida; Roz, Kenny",Apmba (Asia Pacific Management And Business Application),,191

The loss of TDP-43 function that is associated with these inclusions affects post-transcriptional processing of RNAs in multiple ways including pre-mRNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, modulation of mRNA stability and translation. In contrast, less is known about the role of TDP-43 in axonal RNA metabolism in motoneurons. Here we show that depletion of Tdp-43 in primary motoneurons affects axon growth. This defect is accompanied by subcellular transcriptome alterations in the axonal and somatodendritic compartment. The axonal localization of transcripts encoding components of the cytoskeleton, the translational machinery and transcripts involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism were particularly affected by loss of Tdp-43. Accordingly, we observed reduced protein synthesis and disturbed mitochondrial functions in axons of Tdp-43-depleted motoneurons. Treatment with nicotinamide rescued the axon growth defect associated with loss of Tdp-43. These results show that Tdp-43 depletion in motoneurons affects several pathways integral to axon health indicating that loss of TDP-43 function could thus make a major contribution to axonal pathomechanisms in ALS.","Briese, Michael; Saal-Bauernschubert, Lena; Lüningschrör, Patrick; Moradi, Mehri; Dombert, Benjamin; Surrey, Verena; Appenzeller, Silke; Deng, Chunchu; Jablonka, Sibylle; Sendtner, Michael",Acta Neuropathol Commun,,191

According to a representative public opinion survey 34% of Hungarian citizens believe that corporations are responsible for climate change. The business sector is motivated to take an active role in the mitigation and adaptation of climate change. As a result, the last few decades saw a marked increase in corporate measures aiming at the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other initiatives to tackle climate-related problems which result in numerous social issues. The aim of this paper is to assess whether Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can be applied as a tool in agribusiness fostering steps towards the implementation of the climate-oriented and sustainable agriculture in Hungary. The research makes an effort to explore the role and opportunities of the Hungarian agricultural sector in adapting to climate change, it also examines the extent of the mitigation and adaptation activities appearing in the CSR portfolio of the companies and what specific measures are taken to realize them. The results of the evaluation show that climate-oriented CSR activities of the companies are relatively undeveloped, but businesses are working to reduce the impact of climate change on the usage of exercising adaptation strategies. There are several actions that can help to reduce vulnerability to the consequences of climate change in the agriculture sector.

METHODS: We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology. RESULTS: The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CIâ¯=â¯10.3-15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score.

375437,SARS-CoV-2 Re-Infection in a Lung Transplant Recipient,2021,"Learning from data streams is among the most vital fields of contemporary data mining. The online analysis of information coming from those potentially unbounded data sources allows for designing reactive up-to-date models capable of adjusting themselves to continuous flows of data. While a plethora of shallow methods have been proposed for simpler low-dimensional streaming problems, almost none of them addressed the issue of learning from complex contextual data, such as images or texts. The former is represented mainly by adaptive decision trees that have been proven to be very efficient in streaming scenarios. The latter has been predominantly addressed by offline deep learning. In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap between these two worlds and propose Adaptive Deep Forest (ADF) - a natural combination of the successful tree-based streaming classifiers with deep forest, which represents an interesting alternative idea for learning from contextual data. The conducted experiments show that the deep forest approach can be effectively transformed into an online algorithm, forming a model that outperforms all state-of-the-art shallow adaptive classifiers, especially for high-dimensional complex streams.","Korycki, Lukasz; Krawczyk, Bartosz",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07340v1.pdf,191

Many of these systems, like in Ohio, included indicators based on an assessment of trends in reported cases. However, when cases are indexed by date of disease onset, reporting delays complicate the interpretation of trends. Despite a foundation of statistical literature to address this problem, these methods have not been widely applied in practice. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian spatio-temporal nowcasting model for assessing trends in county-level COVID-19 cases in Ohio. We compare the performance of our model to the current approach used in Ohio and the approach that was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We demonstrate gains in performance while still retaining interpretability using our model. In addition, we are able to fully account for uncertainty in both the time series of cases and in the reporting process. While we cannot eliminate all of the uncertainty in public health surveillance and subsequent decision-making, we must use approaches that embrace these challenges and deliver more accurate and honest assessments to policymakers.","Kline, David; Hyder, Ayaz; Liu, Enhao; Rayo, Michael; Malloy, Samuel; Root, Elisabeth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04544v1.pdf,191

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre national audit over 12 weeks from 6th April 2020. SETTING: UK secondary care ENT departments. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with acute tonsillitis or PTA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Re-presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS: 83 centres submitted 765 tonsillitis and 416 PTA cases. 54.4% (n=410) of tonsillitis and 45.3% (187/413) of PTAs were discharged from ED. 9.6% (39/408) of tonsillitis and 10.3% (19/184) of PTA discharges re-presented within 10 days, compared to 9.7% (33/341) and 10.6% (24/224) for those admitted from ED. The subsequent admission rate of those initially discharged from ED was 4.7% for tonsillitis and 3.3% for PTAs. IV steroids and antibiotics increased the percentage of patients able to swallow from 35.8% to 72.5% for tonsillitis (n=270/754 and 441/608) and from 22.3% to 71.0% for PTA (n=92/413 and 265/373). 77.2% of PTAs underwent drainage (n=319/413), with no significant difference in re-presentations in those drained vs not-drained (10.6% vs 9.5%, n=15/142 vs 4/42, p=0.846). Univariable logistic regression showed no significant predictors of re-presentation within 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Management of tonsillitis and PTA changed during the initial peak of the pandemic, shifting towards outpatient care. Some patients who may previously have been admitted to hospital may be safely discharged from the ED.","Smith, Matthew E",Clin. otolaryngol,,191

We utilized electronic health records across 6 hospitals in Massachusetts to characterize cohorts of individuals discharged following admission for COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2021, and compared them to individuals hospitalized for other indications during this period. Natural language processing was applied to narrative clinical notes to identify neuropsychiatric symptom domains up to 150 days following hospitalization. Among 6,619 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 drawn from a total of 42,961 hospital discharges, the most commonly documented symptom domains between 31 and 90 days after initial positive test were fatigue (13.4%), mood and anxiety symptoms (11.2%), and impaired cognition (8.0%). In models adjusted for sociodemographic features and hospital course, none of these were significantly more common among COVID-19 patients; indeed, mood and anxiety symptoms were less frequent (adjusted OR 0.72 95% CI 0.64-0.92). Between 91 and 150 days after positivity, most commonly-detected symptoms were fatigue (10.9%), mood and anxiety symptoms (8.2%), and sleep disruption (6.8%), with impaired cognition in 5.8%. Frequency was again similar among non-COVID-19 post-hospital patients, with mood and anxiety symptoms less common (aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were common up to 150 days after initial hospitalization, but occurred at generally similar rates among individuals hospitalized for other indications during the same period. Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 thus may benefit from standard if less-specific treatments developed for rehabilitation after hospitalization.

385327,Characteristics of Liver Function in Patients With SARS-CoV-2 and Chronic HBV Coinfection,2020,"ABSTRACT COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In 2020, due to the outbreak, it was considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. The infection caused by the novel coronavirus has high mortality in a small portion of the infected population, especially in elderly, immunosuppressed, diabetic, cardiac, and hypertensive individuals. Many infected are asymptomatic (and may be carriers) or present mild or moderate flu-like symptoms. The most severe clinical picture of COVID-19 is characterized by an inflammatory cytokine storm, with hematological changes and coagulation dysfunction, which can lead to tissue damage and death. Nonspecific laboratory biomarkers may be either increased or decreased as the course of the disease progresses and are often useful in predicting complications of the disease, such as the use of D-dimer and platelet/lymphocyte ratio. Specific laboratory diagnosis is based on the detection of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal and oropharyngeal swab samples; it is more effective when performed in the first days after symptom onset. Serological tests are useful in detecting the immune response, since both class M (IgM) and class G (IgG) immunoglobulin antibodies can be detected seven days after the onset of clinical symptoms, and may extend for more than 25 days, although not exempting the individual from remaining infectious, depending on their viral load and clinical presentation. The rational use of specific laboratory markers must respect the disease chronology, and the correct interpretation may provide subsidies for a better management of affected patients, as well as identifying asymptomatic carriers or those with mild symptoms.","Xavier, Analucia R.; Silva, Jonadab S.; Almeida, João Paulo C.

In this pilot study, we explore SEOP in gas mixtures with up to 45% 4He content under a wide range of experimental conditions. When an aluminum jacket cooling/heating design was employed (GEN-3 hyperpolarizer), 129Xe polarization (%PXe) of 55.9 ± 0.9% was observed with mono-exponential build-up rate Î³SEOP of 0.049 ± 0.001 min-1 for the 4He-rich mixture (1000 Torr Xe/900 Torr He, 100 Torr N2), compared to %PXe of 49.3 ± 3.3% at Î³SEOP of 0.035 ± 0.004 min-1 for the N2-rich gas mixture (1000 Torr Xe/100 Torr He, 900 Torr N2). When forced-air cooling/heating was used (GEN-2 hyperpolarizer), %PXe of 83.9 ± 2.7% was observed at Î³SEOP of 0.045 ± 0.005 min-1 for the 4He-rich mixture (1000 Torr Xe/900 Torr He, 100 Torr N2), compared to %PXe of 73.5 ± 1.3% at Î³SEOP of 0.028 ± 0.001 min-1 for the N2-rich gas mixture (1000 Torr Xe and 1000 Torr N2). Additionally, %PXe of 72.6 ± 1.4% was observed at a build-up rate Î³SEOP of 0.041 ± 0.003 min-1 for a super-high-density 4He-rich mixture (1330 Torr Xe/1200 Torr 4He/130 Torr N2), compared to %PXe = 56.6 ± 1.3% at a build-up rate of Î³SEOP of 0.034 ± 0.002 min-1 for an N2-rich mixture (1330 Torr Xe/1330 Torr N2) using forced air cooling/heating. The observed SEOP hyperpolarization performance under these conditions corresponds to %PXe improvement by a factor of 1.14 ± 0.04 at 1000 Torr Xe density and by up to a factor of 1.28 ± 0.04 at 1330 Torr Xe density at improved SEOP build-up rates by factors of 1.61 ± 0.18 and 1.21 ± 0.11 respectively. Record %PXe levels have been obtained here: 83.9 ± 2.7% at 1000 Torr Xe partial pressure and 72.6 ± 1.4% at 1330 Torr Xe partial pressure. In addition to improved thermal stability for SEOP, the use of 4He-rich gas mixtures also reduces the overall density of produced inhalable HP contrast agents; this property may be desirable for HP 129Xe inhalation by human subjects in clinical settings-especially in populations with heavily impaired lung function. The described approach should enjoy ready application in the production of inhalable 129Xe contrast agent with near-unity 129Xe nuclear spin polarization.","Birchall, Jonathan R; Nikolaou, Panayiotis; Irwin, Robert K; Barlow, Michael J; Ranta, Kaili; Coffey, Aaron M; Goodson, Boyd M; Pokochueva, Ekaterina V; Kovtunov, Kirill V; Koptyug, Igor V; Chekmenev, Eduard Y",J Magn Reson,,191

Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.","Benatti, Beatrice; Albert, Umberto; Maina, Giuseppe; Fiorillo, Andrea; Celebre, Laura; Girone, Nicolaja; Fineberg, Naomi; Bramante, Stefano; Rigardetto, Sylvia; Dell’Osso, Bernardo",Front.

From the early 1990s, a severe alder (Alnus spp.) decline due to an unknown Phytophthora species was observed in several European countries. Genetic analyses revealed that the disease was caused by the triploid hybrid P. x alni, which originated in Europe from the hybridization of P. uniformis and P. x multiformis. Here, we investigated the population structure of P. x alni (158 isolates) and P. uniformis (85 isolates) in several European countries using microsatellite markers. Our analyses confirmed the genetic structure previously observed in other European populations, with P. uniformis populations consisting of at most two multilocus genotypes (MLGs) and P. x alni populations dominated by MLG Pxa-1. The genetic structure of P. x alni populations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Sweden seemed to reflect the physical isolation of river systems. Most rare P. x alni MLGs showed a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at one or a few microsatellite loci compared with other MLGs. This LOH may allow a stabilization within the P. x alni genome or a rapid adaptation to stress situations. Alternatively, alleles may be lost because of random genetic drift in small, isolated populations, with no effect on fitness of P. x alni. Additional studies would be necessary to confirm these patterns of population diversification and to better understand the factors driving it.","Mizeriene, Goda; Cerny, Karel; Zyka, Vladimir; Bakonyi, József; Nagy, Zoltán Á; Oliva, Jonas; Redondo, Miguel Angel; Corcobado, Tamara; Martín-García, Jorge; Prospero, Simone",Phytopathology,,191

390546,News & Notes,2021,"Background: Remdesivir is the current recommended anti-viral treatment in moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, data on several aspects of its use such as impact of timing of therapy, efficacy, and safety in this severity category are limited. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment [SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted between June 25, 2020 and October 3, 2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Consecutive patients with moderate-tosevere COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 &lt;94%;severe: SpO2 &lt;90%) were included. Data were collected from the health records of the hospital. Remdesivir was administered along with other standard medications as per protocol. The main outcome was the impact of SORT interval on in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed based on SORT interval. Other measures analyzed included overall in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and safety. Results: Of 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included for the final analysis (males: 270 [78.0%];median [range] age: 60 [24-94] years). Overall, 243 (70.2%) patients had ≥1 comorbidity;109 (31.5%) patients had moderate disease, 237 (68.5%) had severe disease, and 50 (14.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Of the 346 patients, 76 (22.0%) patients died (moderate: 3 [2.8%], severe: 73 [30.8%]). In the subset of mechanically ventilated patients, 43 (86.0%) died. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients with SORT interval ≤9 days (n = 260) compared with those with SORT interval &gt;9 days (n = 86;18.1% vs 33.7%;P = .004). The odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT interval ≤9 days vs &gt;9 days (odds ratio = 0.44;95% CI, 0.25-0.76;P = .004). Adverse events (transaminitis ≥5 times upper limit of normal or estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30ml/min) leading to drug discontinuation were seen in 4 (1.1%) patients. Conclusion: In this large series of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, initiation of remdesivir ≤9 days from symptom-onset was associated with a significant mortality benefit. These findings indicate a treatment window and reinforce the need for earlier remdesivir initiation in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection.","Bansal, S.; Kalpakam, H.; Bysani, S.; Varsha, A.; Mehta, R.

390857,A Flow cytometric assay to detect platelet activating antibodies in VITT after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination,2021,"The coordinated supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) is important for ensuring regional sustainable development. However, research identifying key areas of imbalanced supply and demand of ESs at the urban agglomeration scale is limited. Therefore, in this study, using the Fujian Delta urban agglomeration of China as the research area, based on multi-source data, and analysis tools, such as ArcGIS, ENVI, and GeoDa, we constructed a research framework and indicator system for ESs supply and demand to determine the spatial change law, matching degree, and coupling coordination degree (CCD) of the ESs. On this basis, the key areas of imbalanced supply and demand of ESs were identified, and optimization strategies were proposed. The results showed that (1) there is obvious spatial heterogeneity between ESs supply and demand in the study area, and different degrees of spatial changes occurred with urbanization. Specifically, areas with large changes were concentrated in urban core areas and economic development zones. (2) The matching degree between ESs supply and demand is quite diverse and shows a trend of polarization. Under the influence of urbanization, some cities began facing ESs supply shortages. (3) Overall, the CCD between ESs supply and demand in the study area is in a state of mild incoordination, but with increasing urbanization, some cities have turned into a state of extreme incoordination. Our results indicate that the ESs supply and demand status in some cities at the urban agglomeration scale has become increasingly severe. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on certain ""key areas"" to formulate optimization strategies. For key areas with ""low supply-high demand"" and extreme incoordination, the population and land use intensity should be controlled to reduce the ESs demand level. Meanwhile, for key areas with ""high supply-low demand"" and extreme incoordination, the utilization efficiency of ecological resources should be improved to enhance the ESs supply capacity. The results of this study will help decision-makers optimize the relationship between ESs supply and demand in order to achieve the sustainable development of urban agglomeration.","Xin, Ruhong; Skov-Petersen, Hans; Zeng, Jian; Zhou, Jianhua; Li, Kai; Hu, Jiaqi; Liu, Xiang; Kong, Jiangwei; Wang, Qianwen",Sci Total Environ,,191

Where the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping country after country. The Italian and Moroccan authorities have declared a state of emergency in response to the growing threat of this novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak by March 09 and 20, respectively. In-state of emergency, citizens cannot go out to public spaces without special authorization from local authorities. But after all these efforts exerted by these authorities, the number of new cases of the COVID-19 continues to rise significantly, which confirms the lack of commitment of some citizens. First, we aim to investigate the cause of new infections despite all strategies of control followed in these countries including media reports, awareness, and treatment, self-distancing and quarantine, by estimating the number of these people who underestimate the lives and safety of citizens and put them at risk. To do this, we use real data of the COVID-19 in Italy and Morocco to estimate the parameters of the model, and then we predict the number of these populations. Second, we propose an optimal control strategy that could be the optimal and the efficient way for the Moroccan and Italian authorities and other countries to make the state of emergency more efficient and to control the spread of the COVID-19. The model is analyzed for both countries and then to compare the implications of the obtained results. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the strategy of control that we propose and to show what would have been happened in Morocco and Italy if this strategy of control was applied early.","Omar, Zakary; Sara, Bidah; Mostafa, Rachik",Rev. mex. ing. bioméd,,191

395763,Clinical Implications of SARS-CoV-2 Interaction With Renin Angiotensin System: JACC Review Topic of the Week,2020,"BACKGROUND: Medication management in residential aged care facilities is an ongoing concern. Numerous studies have reported high rates of inappropriate prescribing and medication use in aged care facilities, which contribute to residents' adverse health outcomes. There is a need for new models of care that enhance inter-disciplinary collaboration between residential aged care facility staff and healthcare professionals, to improve medication management. Pilot research has demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of integrating a pharmacist into the aged care facility team to improve the quality use of medicines. This protocol describes the design and methods for a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the outcomes and conduct economic evaluation of a service model where on-site pharmacists are integrated into residential aged care facility healthcare teams to improve medication management. METHODS: Intervention aged care facilities will employ on-site pharmacists to work as part of their healthcare teams 2 to 2.5 days per week for 12 months. On-site pharmacists, in collaboration with facility nurses, prescribers, community pharmacists, residents and families will conduct medication management activities to improve the quality use of medicines. Aged care facilities in the control group will continue usual care. The target sample size is 1188 residents from a minimum of 13 aged care facilities. The primary outcome is the appropriateness of prescribing, measured by the proportion of residents who are prescribed at least one potentially inappropriate medicine according to the 2019 Beers Criteria. Secondary outcomes include hospital and emergency department presentations, fall rates, prevalence and dose of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Score, staff influenza vaccination rate, time spent on medication rounds, appropriateness of dose form modification and completeness of resident's allergy and adverse drug reaction documentation. A cost-consequence and cost-effectiveness analysis will be embedded in the trial. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide information on clinical and economic outcomes of a model that integrates on-site pharmacists into Australian residential aged care facilities. The results will provide policymakers with recommendations relevant to further implementation of this model. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12620000430932 .

However, no empirical study currently exists in the literature that examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental education. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on dental education and dental students' experience. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was administrated to professional dental students that focused on their experiences related to COVID-19. The survey included questions about student demographics, protocols for school reopening and student perceptions of institutional responses, student concerns, and psychological impacts. RESULTS: Among the 145 respondents, 92.4% were pre-doctoral dental students and 7.6% were orthodontic residents; 48.2% were female and 12.6% students lived alone during the school closure due to the pandemic. Students' age ranged from 23 to 39 years. Younger students expressed more concerns about their emotional health (P = 0.01). In terms of the school's overall response to COVID-19, 73.1% students thought it was effective. The majority (83%) of students believed that social distancing in school can minimize the development of COVID-19. In general, students felt that clinical education suffered after transitioning to online but responded more positively about adjustments to other online curricular components. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted dental education. Our findings indicate that students are experiencing increased levels of stress and feel their clinical education has suffered. Most students appear comfortable with technology adaptations for didactic curriculum and favor masks, social distancing, and liberal use of sanitizers.","Hung, Man; Licari, Frank W; Hon, Eric S; Lauren, Evelyn; Su, Sharon; Birmingham, Wendy C; Wadsworth, Lori L; Lassetter, Jane H; Graff, Tyler C; Harman, William; Carroll, William B; Lipsky, Martin S",J. dent. educ,,191

METHODS: The target population was all Iranian people aged 6 years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28 314 people from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias and sampling design. RESULTS: Of the 28 314 Iranians selected, 11 256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until 20 August 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval 13.3%-15.2%), which was equal to 11 958 346 (95% CI 11 211 011-12 746 776) individuals. The adjusted prevalences of infection were 14.6%, 13.8%, 16.6%, 11.7% and 19.4% among men, women, urban population, rural population and individuals aged 60 years or more, respectively. Ardabil, Golestan and Khuzestan provinces had the highest prevalence and Alborz, Hormozgan and Kerman provinces had the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the study results, a large proportion of the Iranian population had not yet been infected by COVID-19. The observance of hygienic principles and social restrictions should therefore continue until the majority of the population has been vaccinated.","Khalagi, Kazem; Gharibzadeh, Safoora; Khalili, Davood; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Mirab Samiee, Siamak; Aghamohamadi, Saeide; Mir-Mohammad-Ali Roodaki, Maryam; Hashemi, Seyed Mahmoud; Tayeri, Katayoun; Namdari Tabar, Hengameh; Azadmanesh, Kayhan; Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh; Mohammad, Kazem; Hajipour, Firoozeh; Namaki, Saeid; Raeisi, Alireza; Ostovar, Afshin",Clin. microbiol. infect,,191

METHODS: P. berghei-infected mice were divided into six groups: infected control (IC) group, administered 1â¯mL Tween 20; GTE100 and GTE250 groups, administered 100 and 250â¯mg/kg GTE, respectively; GT100â¯+â¯CQ and GT250â¯+â¯CQ groups, co-administered 100 and 250â¯mg/kg GTE plus 30â¯mg/kg CQ, respectively; and CQ group, administered 30â¯mg/kg CQ. A separate group of non-infected mice were given 1â¯mL Tween 20, and served as a normal control group (NC). Extract and drug were dissolved in Tween 20 and administered orally once daily for 12 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment period, mice were anesthetized with chloroform and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Plasma was prepared from blood obtained from each mouse. Parameters evaluated at the end of the treatment period include parasitemia, red blood cell count, hematocrit, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). RESULTS: Infected mice treated with a combination of GTE and CQ (GT100â¯+â¯CQ and GT250â¯+â¯CQ groups) showed significantly reduced parasitemia levels (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) compared to those administered GTE alone as well as IC. Significant improvement in body weight (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) was also observed in infected mice treated with a combination of GTE and CQ (GT100â¯+â¯CQ and GT250â¯+â¯CQ groups), compared to mice receiving GTE alone (GTE100 and GTE250 groups). Plasma MDA and TNF-&#945; concentrations were significantly lowered, and IL-10 concentration was significantly increased in GT100â¯+â¯CQ and GT250â¯+â¯CQ groups, relative to the IC group (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). GSH concentration and SOD, CAT and GPx activities were significantly higher in GT100â¯+â¯CQ and GT250â¯+â¯CQ groups compared to the GTE100, GTE250, IC and NC groups (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). CONCLUSION: Data generated in this study showed that GTE enhanced the anti-plasmodial action of CQ in mice through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.","Oluba, Olarewaju M; Akpor, Oghenerobor B; Adebiyi, Feyikemi D; Josiah, Sunday J; Alabi, Olayinka O; Shoyombo, Ayoola O; Olusola, Augustine O",J.

417332,"Correction to: The Renin-Angiotensin System, Hypertension, and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: a Review",2021,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to linger. Decisions regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed. In this article, we review and compare disease-modifying therapies in terms of their effect on the immune system, published infection rates, potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and vaccine-related implications. We propose risk mitigation strategies and practical approaches to disease-modifying therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Crystal; Kar, Indrani; Chen, Claire Kaori; Sau, Crystal; Woodson, Sophia; Serra, Alessandro; Abboud, Hesham",CNS Drugs,,191

A quicker and more efficient diagnostic tool in emergency departments could improve management during this global crisis. Our main goal was assessing the accuracy of artificial intelligence in predicting the results of RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2, using basic information at hand in all emergency departments. METHODS: This is a retrospective study carried out between February 22, 2020 and March 16, 2020 in one of the main hospitals in Milan, Italy. We screened for eligibility all patients admitted with influenza-like symptoms tested for SARS-COV-2. Patients under 12 years old and patients in whom the leukocyte formula was not performed in the ED were excluded. Input data through artificial intelligence were made up of a combination of clinical, radiological and routine laboratory data upon hospital admission. Different Machine Learning algorithms available on WEKA data mining software and on Semeion Research Centre depository were trained using both the Training and Testing and the K-fold cross-validation protocol. RESULTS: Among 199 patients subject to study (median [interquartile range] age 65 [46-78] years; 127 [63.8%] men), 124 [62.3%] resulted positive to SARS-COV-2. The best Machine Learning System reached an accuracy of 91.4% with 94.1% sensitivity and 88.7% specificity. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that properly trained artificial intelligence algorithms may be able to predict correct results in RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2, using basic clinical data. If confirmed, on a larger-scale study, this approach could have important clinical and organizational implications.","Langer, Thomas; Favarato, Martina; Giudici, Riccardo; Bassi, Gabriele; Garberi, Roberta; Villa, Fabiana; Gay, Hedwige; Zeduri, Anna; Bragagnolo, Sara; Molteni, Alberto; Beretta, Andrea; Corradin, Matteo; Moreno, Mauro; Vismara, Chiara; Perno, Carlo Federico; Buscema, Massimo; Grossi, Enzo; Fumagalli, Roberto",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,,191

425089,Letter: SARS-CoV-2 infection in two inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with dual targeted therapy-Authors' reply,2021,"RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has caused an ongoing public health crisis. Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been performed to synthesize evidence for better understanding this new disease. However, some concerns have been raised about rapid COVID-19 research. This meta-epidemiological study aims to methodologically assess the current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19. METHODS: We searched in various databases for systematic reviews with meta-analyses published between 1 January 2020 and 31 October 2020. We extracted their basic characteristics, data analyses, evidence appraisal, and assessment of publication bias and heterogeneity. RESULTS: We identified 295 systematic reviews on COVID-19. The median time from submission to acceptance was 33 days. Among these systematic reviews, 73.9% evaluated clinical manifestations or comorbidities of COVID-19. Stata was the most used software programme (43.39%). The odds ratio was the most used effect measure (34.24%). Moreover, 28.14% of the systematic reviews did not present evidence appraisal. Among those reporting the risk of bias results, 14.64% of studies had a high risk of bias. Egger's test was the most used method for assessing publication bias (38.31%), while 38.66% of the systematic reviews did not assess publication bias. The I2 statistic was widely used for assessing heterogeneity (92.20%); many meta-analyses had high values of I2 . Among the meta-analyses using the random-effects model, 75.82% did not report the methods for model implementation; among those meta-analyses reporting implementation methods, the DerSimonian-Laird method was the most used one. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19 might suffer from low transparency, high heterogeneity, and suboptimal statistical methods. It is recommended that future systematic reviews on COVID-19 strictly follow well-developed guidelines. Sensitivity analyses may be performed to examine how the synthesized evidence might depend on different methods for appraising evidence, assessing publication bias, and implementing meta-analysis models.","Rosenberger, Kristine J; Xu, Chang; Lin, Lifeng",J. eval. clin. pract.

The concavity of the operated bullas was similar to the normal ones. Only few animals in each subgroup presented complete regeneration of the tympanic bulla. On the other hand, connective tissue at the osteotomy site was significantly seen in the operated tympanic bullas. The qualitative histological exams and the histomorphometry showed that there was no significant difference concerning the osseus regeneration stage among the subgroups. Taken together these results lead to the conclusion that a restricted osteotomy did not alter significantly the tympanic bulla conformation and complete regeneration of the tympanic bulla frequently did not occur before 12 weeks of postoperative period.","Maria da Silva, Adelina; José Fagundes, Djalma; Omar Taha, Murched; Goldenberg, Saul; Fabrino Machado, Gisele; Juliano, Yara; Ferreira Novo, Neil",Acta cir. bras.,,191

A pandemia de COVID-19 representa uma grande ameaça para o mundo e tem demonstrado que prevenir a escalada da doença em prisões faz parte do combate ao novo coronavírus na sociedade em geral. Sabe-se, até o momento, que a mais efetiva medida de contenção ao avanço da doença é o isolamento social. No entanto, em instituições penais, muitas vezes superlotadas, tal medida torna-se de difícil implementação e, quando acontece, leva a população privada de liberdade a um superisolamento, tendo consequências em sua saúde mental. Além disso, indivíduos presos sofrem com ambientes sem ventilação, falta de materiais de higiene pessoal, condições sanitárias básicas precárias e dificuldade de acesso a serviços de saúde. O presente artigo objetiva ser uma revisão narrativa sobre os efeitos da pandemia em presídios e como governos e sociedade civil têm se organizado a fim de reduzir as consequências sobre esses locais. A publicação foi dividida em três seções: na primeira, há uma revisão da literatura em saúde sobre a temática; na segunda, é tratado o modo como diferentes países estão lidando com a situação carcerária no contexto da pandemia; na terceira e última parte, é abordado o modo como o Sistema Penal brasileiro tem reagido à nova doença.","Carvalho, Sérgio Garófalo de; Santos, Andreia Beatriz Silva dos; Santos, Ivete Maria",Ciênc.

429697,Evolving reporting criteria of COVID-19 in Taiwan during the epidemic,2020,"In recent years, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a respiratory support system that has become prominent in the treatment of respiratory failure. HFNC provides higher concentration and flow of oxygen, resulting in decreasing anatomic dead space by preventing rebreathing and ensure positive end-expiratory. However, in COVID-19, the usage of HFNC is much controversial due to concerns about the benefits and risk of aerosol-dispersion. Considering the debates about the use of HFNC, we reviewed the literature related to the usage of HFNC in COVID-19. The available reports suggest that HFNC provides high concentrations of oxygen to the patients, who can not reach with conventional devices. HFNC can reduce the requiring of intubation in patients with COVID-19, and it can decrease the length of intensive care unit stay, and complications related to mechanical ventilation. Also HFNC can in achieving apneic oxygenation in patients during airway management. Besides that, the use of high-flow oxygen cannulas can produce aerosols. So, HFNC treatment should be carried out in a negative pressure room; when it is not possible, devices should be undertaken in a single room.","Gürün Kaya, Aslihan; Öz, Miraç; Erol, Serhat; Çiftçi, Fatma; Çiledag, Aydin; Kaya, Akin",Tuberk Toraks,,191
430067,"Letter by Sajeev et al Regarding Article, ""SARS-CoV-2 and Stroke in a New York Healthcare System""",2020,"Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza are lipophilic, enveloped viruses, and are relatively easy to inactivate by exposure to alcohols. The envelope mainly consists of the lipid bilayer, taken from the host cells at assembly/budding stage of the viral life cycle. Therefore the constitution of the lipid bilayer should be common in all SARS, MERS and influenza viruses, even after mutations, and thus these closely-related viruses will be disinfected by exposure to ethanol with the same concentration. Existing experimental data indicate that an ethanol concentration of 30~40 v/v% is sufficient to inactivate Influenza-A viruses in solution[1,2,3]. The author suggests that it may be possible to use alcoholic beverages of 16~20 v/v% concentration for this disinfection process, such as Whisky (1:1 hot water dilution) or Japanese Sake, because they are readily available and safe (non-toxic). By inhaling the alcohol vapor at 50~60$^\circ$C (122~140$^\circ$F) through the nose for one or two minutes, it will condense on surfaces inside the respiratory tract; mainly in the nasal cavity. The alcohol concentration will be intensified to ~36 v/v% by this process, which is enough to disinfect the corona virus on the mucous membrane. This method also provides more moisture into respiratory tract, and helps to clean the inside of the nasal cavity by stimulating blowing of the nose, and also makes the mucous escalator work actively so that the self-clearing mechanism in the trachea will remove viruses faster. An alternative prompt method is also discussed. We use 40 v/v% whisky or similar alcohol, dripping on a gauze, inhale the vapor slowly at room temperature. This method works well for the front part of the nasal cavity. This is suitable for clinical workers, because they may need to use prompt preventative measures at any time.","Shintake, Tsumoru",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12444v1.pdf,191

The effect on transplantation outcomes in nonmalignant disease is unknown. This analysis examined the effect of cryopreservation of related and unrelated donor grafts for transplantation for severe aplastic anemia in the United States during 2013 to 2019. Included are 52 recipients of cryopreserved grafts who were matched for age, donor type, and graft type to 194 recipients who received noncryopreserved grafts. Marginal Cox regression models were built to study the effect of cryopreservation and other risk factors associated with outcomes. We recorded higher 1-year rates of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 4.35; P = .01) and of 1-year overall mortality (HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.60 to 6.11; P = .0008) after transplantation of cryopreserved compared with noncryopreserved grafts, with adjustment for sex, performance score, comorbidity, cytomegalovirus serostatus, and ABO blood group match. The incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease did not differ between the 2 groups. Adjusted probabilities of 1-year survival were 73% (95% CI, 60% to 84%) in the cryopreserved graft group and 91% (95% CI, 86% to 94%) in the noncryopreserved graft group. These data support the use of noncryopreserved grafts whenever possible in patients with severe aplastic anemia.","Eapen, Mary; Zhang, Mei-Jie; Tang, Xiao-Ying; Lee, Stephanie J; Fei, Ming-Wei; Wang, Hai-Lin; Hebert, Kyle M; Arora, Mukta; Chhabra, Saurabh; Devine, Steven M; Hamadani, Mehdi; D039,; Souza, Anita; Pasquini, Marcelo C; Phelan, Rachel; Rizzo, J Douglas; Saber, Wael; Shaw, Bronwen E; Weisdorf, Daniel J; Horowitz, Mary M",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,,191

The pandemic offers a natural experiment wherein the policy problem governments faced was the same but the responses they made were different, creating opportunities for comparison of both the kinds of policy tools being used and the factors that accounted for their choice. Accordingly, after surveying on-line databases of policy tools used in the pandemic and subjecting these to topic modelling to reveal the characteristics of a ‘standard’ national pandemic response, we discuss the similarities and differences found in specific responses. This is done with reference to the nature and level of policy capacity of respective governments, highlighting the critical roles played by (in)adequate preparation and lesson-drawing from past experiences with similar outbreaks or crises. Taken together the articles show how the national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were shaped by the opportunity and capacity each government had to learn from previous pandemics and their capacity to operationalize and build political support for the standard portfolio of policy measures deployed to deal with the crisis. However, they also show how other factors such as the nature of national leadership, the organization of government and civil society, and blindspots towards the vulnerabilities of certain population segments also helped to shape policy responses to the pandemic.","Capano, Giliberto; Howlett, Michael; Jarvis, Darryl S.L.; Ramesh, M.; Goyal, Nihit",Policy Soc.,,191

The present retrospective study aimed to inves-tigate vitamin D status markers and vitamin D degradation products in a mixed cohort of 148 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with various clinical courses of COVID-19. (2) Methods: The serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 25,26(OH)2D3 were determined by a validated liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry method in leftover serum samples from 148 COVID-19 patients that were admitted to the University Hospital of the Medical Uni-versity of Graz between April and November 2020. Anthropometric and clinical data, as well as outcomes were obtained from the laboratory and hospital information systems. (3) Results: From the 148 patients, 34 (23%) died within 30 days after admission. The frequency of fatal outcomes did not differ between males and females. Non-survivors were significantly older than survivors, had higher peak concentrations of IL-6 and CRP, and required mechanical ventilation more frequently. The serum concentrations of all vitamin D metabolites and the vitamin D metabolite ratio (VMR) did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Additionally, the need for res-piratory support was unrelated to the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D vitamin D and the two vitamin D catabolites, as well as the VMR. (4) Conclusion: The present results do not support a relevant role of vitamin D for the course and outcome of COVID-19.","Zelzer, Sieglinde; Prüller, Florian; Curcic, Pero; Sloup, Zdenka; Holter, Magdalena; Herrmann, Markus; Mangge, Harald",Nutrients,,191

As an important method of rehabilitation therapy, exercise therapy has been proved to improve the level of human function, promote the recovery of diseases, and improve the human immune ability. The main objective of this study was to provide reliable methods and credible evidence for exercise therapy to improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The scheme was systematically reviewed in accordance with the preferred reporting items. We searched the following experimental databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), China Science and Wanfang Database. All trials using exercise therapy for rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients in the above database should be considered for inclusion. Relevant randomised controlled trials(RCTS), controlled before and after, interrupted time series and prospective analytic cohort studies regardless of publication date, language and geographic location, will be included. To summarize the therapeutic effect of exercise therapy on COVID-19 patients, high-quality literature was selected for data extraction and analysis. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles against inclusion criteria; perform data extraction and assess risk of bias in included studies. We will assess the certainty of the overall evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach and report findings accordingly. RESULTS: In this study, we hope to summarize effective exercise therapy that can improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and find strong evidence for it.

Its main role within Cuba's health system is as the national reference center for prevention, control, management and elimination of infectious diseases, including epidemics. Its 479 workers staff 32 departments, including laboratories, research and teach-ing facilities, a hospital and isolation center. The IPK's hospital treats later-stage AIDS patients, while the Institute is the nation-al reference center for attention to all HIV-positive patients and maintains the national HIV/AIDS registry, as well as registries for other infectious diseases. The institution was responsible for training the Cuban doctors who served in West Africa during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreaks and for those going abroad to assist in the COVID-19 response today, and its professionals offer an internationally-recognized biennial course on dengue.","Coutin, Gisele; Bacallao-Gallestey, Jorge; Castellanos-Serra, Lila",MEDICC Rev,,191
448512,Systemic inflammatory response and thrombosis due to alterations in the gut microbiota in COVID-19,2020,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 was first reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China, in December 2019. To contain the spread of the virus, authorities imposed a lockdown on Wuhan and other 16 cities in Hubei for months. This study aims to evaluate individual responses toward the pandemic in areas with different levels of infection severity. A total of 10 424 residents in Hubei participated in the online and telephone surveys. Results showed that various life stress and psychological distress were prevalent due to the pandemic and the massive lockdown. However, residents showed very high appraisal for central government and state media and support for lockdown strategy. Moreover, there were both similarities and differences in responses. People in Wuhan experienced more life difficulties, anxiety, and discrimination and had a lower appraisal for the local government and media than their counterparts. In contrast, perceived economic loss, evaluation of central government, and attitude toward lockdowns were not significantly different among residents at the epicenter and the surroundings.","Gao, Haiyan; Zou, Yuchun; Chen, Xi",Asia Pac J Public Health,,191
448637,Coinfections among COVID-19 patients: A need for combination therapy?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that illicit drug overdoses are increasing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of evidence on the causative pathways for this trend, but expert opinions, commentaries, and some reviews offer theoretical underpinnings. METHODS: In this rapid review, we collate the available published evidence, expert opinions, commentaries, and reviews on the unintended pathways between COVID-19 public health responses and increasing illicit drug overdoses. Using tenets of thematic analyses and grounded theory, we also offer a visual conceptual framework for these unintended pathways. RESULTS: Our framework focuses on five particular public health responses, namely social isolation/physical distancing/quarantine; staff/resource reallocations and reductions; closures of businesses and other places of employment; border closures and transportation restrictions; and the early release of people from prisons. As argued in the literature reviewed here, these public health responses have unintentionally created increased overdose risks by producing high risk use scenarios; increased risks of relapsing; disrupted addictions services and treatment; an increasingly toxic supply of drugs; and the risk of using with lowered tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Health care systems should respond to these pathways to mitigate the unintended consequences. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may represent an opportunity to enact proactive, progressive, and innovative solutions to an overdose crisis that will surely outlast the current pandemic.","Nguyen, Tribesty; Buxton, Jane A",Int J Drug Policy,,191

Due to the non-sequential ray propagation nature of these flat combiners and the ray construction nature of a lightfield display engine, however, adapting these two technologies to each other confronts several significant challenges. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of combining an integral-imaging-based lightfield display engine with a geometrical lightguide based on microstructure mirror arrays. The image artifacts and the key challenges in a lightguide-based LF-HMD system are systematically analyzed and are further quantified via a non-sequential ray tracing simulation. We further propose to utilize polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal (PDLC) films to address the inherent problems associated with a lightguide combiner such as increasing the viewing density and improving the image coupling uniformity. We finally demonstrate, to our best knowledge, the first lightguide-based LF-HMD system that takes the advantages of both the compact form factor of a lightguide combiner and the true 3D virtual image rendering capability of a lightfield display.","Xu, Miaomiao; Hua, Hong",Opt Express,,191

Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,191

While research shows that school closure, and the pandemic more generally, has led to student distress, the possibility that these disruptions can also prompt growth in is a worthwhile question to investigate. The current study examined stress-related growth (SRG) in a sample of students returning to campus after a period of COVID-19 remote learning (n = 404, age = 13-18). The degree to which well-being skills were taught at school (i.e., positive education) before the COVID-19 outbreak and student levels of SRG upon returning to campus was tested via structural equation modeling. Positive reappraisal, emotional processing, and strengths use in students were examined as mediators. The model provided a good fit [chi 2 = 5.37, df = 3, p = 0.146, RMSEA = 0.044 (90% CI = 0.00-0.10), SRMR = 0.012, CFI = 99, TLI = 0.99] with 56% of the variance in SRG explained. Positive education explained 15% of the variance in cognitive reappraisal, 7% in emotional processing, and 16% in student strengths use during remote learning. The results are discussed using a positive education paradigm with implications for teaching well-being skills at school to foster growth through adversity and assist in times of crisis.","Waters, L.; Allen, K.

465664,Low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility for hospital staff: Prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks?,2021,"RNA editing is a fundamental biological process with 2 major forms, namely adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I, recognized as A-to-G) and cytosine-to-uracil (C-to-U) deamination, mediated by ADAR and APOBEC enzyme families, respectively. A-to-I RNA editing has been shown to directly affect the genome/transcriptome of RNA viruses with significant repercussions for viral protein synthesis, proliferation and infectivity, while it also affects recognition of double-stranded RNAs by cytosolic receptors controlling the host innate immune response. Recent evidence suggests that RNA editing may be present in SARS-CoV-2 genome/transcriptome. The majority of mapped mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome are A-to-G/U-to-C(opposite strand) and C-to-U/G-to-A(opposite strand) substitutions comprising potential ADAR-/APOBEC-mediated deamination events. A single nucleotide substitution can have dramatic effects on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity as shown by the D614G(A-to-G) substitution in the spike protein. Future studies utilizing serial sampling from patients with COVID-19 are warranted to delineate whether RNA editing affects viral replication and/or the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Vlachogiannis, Nikolaos I; Verrou, Kleio-Maria; Stellos, Konstantinos; Sfikakis, Petros P; Paraskevis, Dimitrios",Clin Immunol,,191

We describe the rationale and methods of the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Registry (INSPIRE) that combines patient-reported outcomes with data from digital health records to understand predictors and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODSINSPIRE is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of individuals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in eight regions across the US. Included are adults fluent in English or Spanish, with self-reported symptoms suggestive of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, enrolled within 42 days of having a US Food and Drug Administration approved SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test). Recruitment occurs in-person, by phone or email, and through online advertisement. A secure online platform is used to facilitate the collation of consent-related materials, digital health records, and responses to self-administered surveys. Participants will be followed for up to 18 months, with patient-reported outcomes collected every three months via survey and linked to concurrent digital health data; follow-up includes no in-person involvement. Our maximum expected enrollment is 4,800 participants, including 3,600 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 1,200 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants (as a concurrent comparison group). These data will allow assessment of longitudinal outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and comparison of the relative risk of outcomes in individuals with and without infection. Patient-reported outcomes include self-reported health function and status, as well as clinical outcomes including health system encounters and new diagnoses. RESULTSParticipating sites obtained institutional review board approval. Enrollment and follow-up are ongoing. CONCLUSIONSThis study will characterize medium and long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection among a diverse population, predictors of sequelae, and their relative risk compared to persons with similar symptomatology but without SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The pandemic is not only a health crisis but also a crisis of global governance. For example, the nation states in dealing with the crises of the pandemic have turned inwards, toward native and national solutions, and therefore away from the much-needed global cooperation to respond to the pandemic. This is an important concern for systems medicine and integrative biology in both normative and instrumental sense. Moreover, if we are to ""pandemic-proof"" the planet and the life science innovation ecosystem, new ways of understanding global governance are called for. This article examines the ways in which national governments have reacted to the crises triggered and embodied by the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaces the different approaches and conflicts between scientific experts and policy makers, and reveals the failure of science and politics. I analyze the uneven and disjointed way Western democratic governments have responded to the crisis and the way unchecked normative values and ideas have influenced the pandemic policy and prevented effective measures to contain the pandemic. Finally, the complex relationships between politics, knowledge, science, and governments are explored and clarified, and the way the COVID-19 crisis highlighted the long-standing tensions between technocracy and democracy. In conclusion, it is time to think critically and reflexively for all knowledge actors in systems science and innovate both planetary health and its global governance.","Boschele, Marco",OMICS,,191

We examined the differences between matched (n = 49) and unmatched (n = 49) youth with regard to demographics, time from injury to study enrollment, perceived seriousness of injury, belief that future injury can be avoided, and household chaos. Youth who were successfully matched with a mentor were more likely to perceive the injury as very serious or somewhat serious compared with unmatched youth (95.9% vs. 79.6%, p = .028). All other factors were not significantly associated with successful mentor matching.

Two methods are available: the fecal immunochemical fecal test (FIT) at age 50 -54 annually;at age ≥ 55 biennially (followed by FIT+ colonoscopy, if positive) and screening colonoscopy at age ≥ 50 in 10years interval. Besides these screening methods, colorectal adenomas and cancers might be find out with diagnosticcolonoscopy or diagnostic FIT. During the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic (March to May) majority of the EndoscopyUnits were closed or their activity was limited. Aim of the analysis was the evaluation of the CRC related procedures(screening and diagnostic FIT;screening colonoscopies;diagnostic colonoscopies) performed in the first six months of theyear 2020 compared to the same period in the year 2019. Methods The analysis was performed using the National Registry of Reimbursed Health Services in the Czech Republic. Results Comparing the periods from January to June in year 2020 and 2019, the analyzed procedures altogether droppedby 20.6 % with maximum decrease in April (-71.6 %) and recovery phase in June (+27.6 %).

485418,Resuming ultrasound activity after the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted structures and communities across the globe. Numerous regions of the world have had varying responses in their attempts to contain the spread of the virus. Factors such as public health policies, governance, and sociopolitical climate have led to differential levels of success at controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, a more advanced surveillance metric for COVID-19 transmission is necessary to help government systems and national leaders understand which responses have been effective and gauge where outbreaks occur. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced COVID-19 surveillance metrics for Canada at the country, province, and territory level that account for shifts in the pandemic including speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Enhanced surveillance identifies risks for explosive growth and regions that have controlled outbreaks successfully. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 62 days of COVID-19 data from Canadian public health registries for 13 provinces and territories. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Canada as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: We compare the week of February 7-13, 2021, with the week of February 14-20, 2021. Canada, as a whole, had a decrease in speed from 8.4 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 7.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population. The persistence of new cases during the week of February 14-20 reported 7.5 cases that are a result of COVID-19 transmissions 7 days earlier. The two most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec both experienced decreases in speed from 7.9 and 11.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population for the week of February 7-13 to speeds of 6.9 and 9.3 for the week of February 14-20, respectively. Nunavut experienced a significant increase in speed during this time, from 3.3 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 10.9 daily new cases per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Canada excelled at COVID-19 control early on in the pandemic, especially during the first COVID-19 shutdown. The second wave at the end of 2020 resulted in a resurgence of the outbreak, which has since been controlled. Enhanced surveillance identifies outbreaks and where there is the potential for explosive growth, which informs proactive health policy.","Post, Lori; Boctor, Michael J; Issa, Tariq Z; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Achenbach, Chad J; Ison, Michael G; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren; White, Janine; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James F",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,191
487151,News & Notes,2020,"Yellow fever virus (YFV) live attenuated vaccine can, in rare cases, cause life-threatening disease, typically in patients with no previous history of severe viral illness. Autosomal recessive (AR) complete IFNAR1 deficiency was reported in one 12-yr-old patient. Here, we studied seven other previously healthy patients aged 13 to 80 yr with unexplained life-threatening YFV vaccine-associated disease. One 13-yr-old patient had AR complete IFNAR2 deficiency. Three other patients vaccinated at the ages of 47, 57, and 64 yr had high titers of circulating auto-Abs against at least 14 of the 17 individual type I IFNs. These antibodies were recently shown to underlie at least 10% of cases of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. The auto-Abs were neutralizing in vitro, blocking the protective effect of IFN-&#945;2 against YFV vaccine strains. AR IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency and neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs thus accounted for more than half the cases of life-threatening YFV vaccine-associated disease studied here. Previously healthy subjects could be tested for both predispositions before anti-YFV vaccination.","Bastard, Paul; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Hoffmann, Hans-Heinrich; Chbihi, Marwa; Le Voyer, Tom; Rosain, Jérémie; Philippot, Quentin; Seeleuthner, Yoann; Gervais, Adrian; Materna, Marie; de Oliveira, Patricia Mouta Nunes; Maia, Maria de Lourdes S; Dinis Ano Bom, Ana Paula; Azamor, Tamiris; Araújo da Conceição, Deborah; Goudouris, Ekaterini; Homma, Akira; Slesak, Günther; Schäfer, Johannes; Pulendran, Bali; Miller, Joseph D; Huits, Ralph; Yang, Rui; Rosen, Lindsey B; Bizien, Lucy; Lorenzo, Lazaro; Chrabieh, Maya; Erazo, Lucia V; Rozenberg, Flore; Jeljeli, Mohamed Maxime; Béziat, Vivien; Holland, Steven M; Cobat, Aurélie; Notarangelo, Luigi D; Su, Helen C; Ahmed, Rafi; Puel, Anne; Zhang, Shen-Ying; Abel, Laurent; Seligman, Stephen J; Zhang, Qian; MacDonald, Margaret R; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Rice, Charles M; Casanova, Jean-Laurent",J. exp. med,,191
487664,Use of chlorhexidine to eradicate oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients,2021,"Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public health control strategies have been proposed and tested against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as ""the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months"" or ""the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days"". We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications. For example, based on the model in Lombardy, Italy, achieving less than 100 deaths per day and 10000 total deaths within 100 days requires 441.7% more vaccination control effort than achieving less than 1000 deaths per day and 50000 total deaths within 100 days.","Xu, Zhe; Wu, Bo; Topcu, Ufuk",PLoS One,,191
487769,A novel compartmental model to capture the nonlinear trend of COVID-19,2021,"To determine what exacerbate severity of the COVID-19 among patients without comorbidities and advanced age and investigate potential clinical indicators for early surveillance, we adopted a nested case-control study, design in which severe cases (case group, n = 67) and moderate cases (control group, n = 67) of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without comorbidities, with ages ranging from 18 to 50 years who admitted to Wuhan Tongji Hospital were matched based on age, sex and BMI. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and risk factors associated with severe symptoms were analysed. Percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2), lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-10 were found closely associated with severe COVID-19. The adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that the independent risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 were CRP (OR 2.037, 95% CI 1.078-3.847, P = 0.028), SpO2 (OR 1.639, 95% CI 0.943-2.850, P = 0.080) and lymphocyte (OR 1.530, 95% CI 0.850-2.723, P = 0.148), whereas the changes exhibited by indicators influenced incidence of disease severity. Males exhibited higher levels of indicators associated with inflammation, myocardial injury and kidney injury than the females. This study reveals that increased CRP levels and decreased SpO2 and lymphocyte counts could serve as potential indicators of severe COVID-19, independent of comorbidities, advanced age and sex. Males could at higher risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 than females.","Li, Xinjie; Marmar, Tuohutaerbieke; Xu, Qiang; Tu, Jing; Yin, Yue; Tao, Qihui; Chen, Huilong; Shen, Tao; Xu, Dong",Epidemiol Infect,,191

Individuals with BCG vaccination were less likely to require hospital admission during the disease course (3.7% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.019). This association remained unchanged after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities (P = 0.017) using multivariate regression analysis.

489233,Defending Weapons Inspections from the Effects of Disinformatio,2021,"Complex networks in the real world are often with heterogeneous degree distributions. The structure and function of nodes can vary significantly, with vital nodes playing a crucial role in information spread and other spreading phenomena. Identifying and taking action on vital nodes enables change to the network's structure and function more efficiently. Previous work either redefines metrics used to measure the nodes' importance or focuses on developing algorithms to efficiently find vital nodes. These approaches typically rely on global knowledge of the network and assume that the structure of the network does not change over time, both of which are difficult to achieve in the real world. In this paper, we propose a localized strategy that can find vital nodes without global knowledge of the network. Our joint nomination (JN) strategy selects a random set of nodes along with a set of nodes connected to those nodes, and together they nominate the vital node set. Experiments are conducted on 12 network datasets that include synthetic and real-world networks, and undirected and directed networks. Results show that average degree of the identified node set is about 3-8 times higher than that of the full node set, and higher-degree nodes take larger proportions in the degree distribution of the identified vital node set. Removal of vital nodes increases the average shortest path length by 20-70% over the original network, or about 8-15% longer than the other decentralized strategies. Immunization based on JN is more efficient than other strategies, consuming around 12-40% less immunization resources to raise the epidemic threshold to [Formula: see text]. Susceptible-infected-recovered simulations on networks with 30% vital nodes removed using JN delays the arrival time of infection peak significantly and reduce the total infection scale to 15%. The proposed strategy can effectively identify vital nodes using only local information and is feasible to implement in the real world to cope with time-critical scenarios such as the sudden outbreak of COVID-19.","Dong, Zhihao; Chen, Yuanzhu; Tricco, Terrence S; Li, Cheng; Hu, Ting",Sci Rep,,191

The spectrum of neurologic involvement in children and adolescents is unclear. Objective: To understand the range and severity of neurologic involvement among children and adolescents associated with COVID-19. Setting, Design, and Participants: Case series of patients (age <21 years) hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and December 15, 2020, with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test result (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and/or antibody) at 61 US hospitals in the Overcoming COVID-19 public health registry, including 616 (36%) meeting criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Patients with neurologic involvement had acute neurologic signs, symptoms, or diseases on presentation or during hospitalization. Life-threatening involvement was adjudicated by experts based on clinical and/or neuroradiologic features. Exposures: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Main Outcomes and Measures: Type and severity of neurologic involvement, laboratory and imaging data, and outcomes (death or survival with new neurologic deficits) at hospital discharge. Results: Of 1695 patients (909 [54%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 9.1 [2.4-15.3] years), 365 (22%) from 52 sites had documented neurologic involvement. Patients with neurologic involvement were more likely to have underlying neurologic disorders (81 of 365 [22%]) compared with those without (113 of 1330 [8%]), but a similar number were previously healthy (195 [53%] vs 723 [54%]) and met criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (126 [35%] vs 490 [37%]). Among those with neurologic involvement, 322 (88%) had transient symptoms and survived, and 43 (12%) developed life-threatening conditions clinically adjudicated to be associated with COVID-19, including severe encephalopathy (n = 15; 5 with splenial lesions), stroke (n = 12), central nervous system infection/demyelination (n = 8), Guillain-Barré syndrome/variants (n = 4), and acute fulminant cerebral edema (n = 4). Compared with those without life-threatening conditions (n = 322), those with life-threatening neurologic conditions had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (median, 12.2 vs 4.4) and higher reported frequency of D-dimer greater than 3 µg/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (21 [49%] vs 72 [22%]). Of 43 patients who developed COVID-19-related life-threatening neurologic involvement, 17 survivors (40%) had new neurologic deficits at hospital discharge, and 11 patients (26%) died. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, many children and adolescents hospitalized for COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children had neurologic involvement, mostly transient symptoms. A range of life-threatening and fatal neurologic conditions associated with COVID-19 infrequently occurred. Effects on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes are unknown.","LaRovere, Kerri L; Riggs, Becky J; Poussaint, Tina Y; Young, Cameron C; Newhams, Margaret M; Maamari, Mia; Walker, Tracie C; Singh, Aalok R; Dapul, Heda; Hobbs, Charlotte V; McLaughlin, Gwenn E; Son, Mary Beth F; Maddux, Aline B; Clouser, Katharine N; Rowan, Courtney M; McGuire, John K; Fitzgerald, Julie C; Gertz, Shira J; Shein, Steven L; Munoz, Alvaro Coronado; Thomas, Neal J; Irby, Katherine; Levy, Emily R; Staat, Mary A; Tenforde, Mark W; Feldstein, Leora R; Halasa, Natasha B; Giuliano, John S; Hall, Mark W; Kong, Michele; Carroll, Christopher L; Schuster, Jennifer E; Doymaz, Sule; Loftis, Laura L; Tarquinio, Keiko M; Babbitt, Christopher J; Nofziger, Ryan A; Kleinman, Lawrence C; Keenaghan, Michael A; Cvijanovich, Natalie Z; Spinella, Philip C; Hume, Janet R; Wellnitz, Kari; Mack, Elizabeth H; Michelson, Kelly N; Flori, Heidi R; Patel, Manish M; Randolph, Adrienne G",JAMA Neurol,,191

A chemical investigation on the fruiting bodies of Phellinus pini led to the isolation of five aromatic cadinane sesquiterpenoids including four new ones, named piniterpenoids A-D (1-4), as well as three known lignans. Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis including HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR. All of the aromatic cadinane sesquiterpenoids inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction, with IC50 values ranging from 64.5 to 99.1 µM. A molecular docking study showed the disruption of the interaction of compound 1 via hydrogen interactions with Arg403, Asp405, and Arg408 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Arg393 and His34 residues of ACE2.

Las predicciones incluyen, población total contagiada, mortalidad y necesidad de recursos hospitalarios. Segundo objetivo: modelar la mortalidad y la necesidad de recursos hospitalarios, estratificando por edad el escenario de contagio del 70% de la población. Métodos Para el primer objetivo, nos basamos en el número de casos confirmados en el país hasta marzo 18, 2020 (n=93). Como suposiciones para el modelo, incluimos un índice de contagio R0=2,5 y el índice de casos reales por cada caso confirmado. Para la proporción de pacientes que necesitarían cuidados intensivos u otros cuidados intrahospitalarios, nos basamos en datos aportados por el Imperial College of London. Para el segundo objetivo usamos como tasa de mortalidad por edad, datos aportados por el Instituto Superiore di Sanità en Italia. Resultados Basándonos en los 93 casos reportados al 18 de marzo, si no se aplicase ninguna medida de mitigación, para el 18 de abril el país tendría un total de 613 037 casos. Medidas de mitigación que reduzcan el R0 en un 10%, generan una reducción del 50% del número de casos. Sin embargo, a pesar de reducirse los casos a la mitad, todavía habría un déficit en el número de camas requeridas y sólo uno de cada dos pacientes tendría acceso a dicho recurso. Conclusión En nuestro modelo encontramos que las medidas de mitigación que han sido implementadas hasta la fecha por el gobierno colombiano, se fundamentan en evidencia suficiente para pensar que es posible reducir significativamente el número de casos contagiados y con esto, el número de pacientes que requerirán manejo hospitalario.(AU)","González-Jaramillo, Valentina; González-Jaramillo, Nathalia; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos; Palacio-Acosta, Carlos A; Gómez-López, Arley; Franco, Oscar H",Rev. salud pública,,191

494790,Oral antiseptics against coronavirus: in-vitro and clinical evidence,2021,"INTRODUCTION: During the first COVID-19 wave, a considerable decline in hospital admissions was observed worldwide. AIM: This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess if there were any changes in the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory diseases in Greece during the first CO-VID-19 wave. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated respiratory disease hospitalization rates across 9 tertiary hospitals in Greece during the study period (March-April 2020) and the corresponding period of the 2 previous years (2018-2019) that served as the control periods. Demographic data and discharge diagnosis were documented for every patient. RESULTS: Of the 1,307 patients who were hospitalized during the study period, 444 (35.5%) were males with a mean (±SD) age of 66.1 ± 16.6 years. There was a 47 and 46% reduction in all-cause respiratory morbidity compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The mean incidence rate for respiratory diseases during the study period was 21.4 admissions per day, and this rate was significantly lower than the rate during the same period in 2018 (40.8 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.491-0.562; p < 0.001) or the rate during 2019 (39.9 admissions per day; IRR, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.502-0.574; p < 0.001). The greatest reductions (%) in the number of daily admissions in 2020 were observed for sleep apnoea (87% vs. 2018 and 84% vs. 2019) followed by admissions for asthma (76% vs. 2018 and 79% vs. 2019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60% vs. 2018 and 51% vs. 2019), while the lowest reductions were detected in hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism (6% vs. 2018 and 23% vs. 2019) followed by tuberculosis (25% vs. both 2018 and 2019). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in respiratory admissions in 2020 raises the reasonable question of whether some patients may have avoided seeking medical attention during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests an urgent need for transformation of healthcare systems during the pandemic to offer appropriate management of respiratory diseases other than COVID-19.","Kyriakopoulos, Christos; Gogali, Athena; Exarchos, Konstantinos; Potonos, Dimitrios; Tatsis, Konstantinos; Apollonatou, Vasiliki; Loukides, Stelios; Papiris, Spyros; Sigala, Ioanna; Katsaounou, Paraskevi; Aggelidis, Maximos; Fouka, Evangelika; Porpodis, Konstantinos; Kontakiotis, Theodoros; Sampsonas, Fotis; Karampitsakos, Theodoros; Tzouvelekis, Argyris; Bibaki, Eleni; Karagiannis, Konstantinos; Antoniou, Katerina; Tzanakis, Nikolaos; Dimeas, Ilias; Daniil, Zoe; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos; Kouratzi, Maria; Steiropoulos, Paschalis; Antonakis, Emmanouil; Papanikolaou, Ilias C; Ntritsos, Georgios; Kostikas, Konstantinos",Respiration,,191
496935,Relationship Between ACE2 and Other Components of the Renin-Angiotensin System,2020,"In an attempt to slow down the spread of the coronavirus, an increasing number of countries, including Israel, have made wearing masks mandatory for their citizens not just in close public places but also while waking in the streets. Failing to comply with this regulation entails a fine enforced by the police. Still, while many passersby do wear a mask that covers both their mouth and nose, others wear a mask improperly around their chin or neck or walk the streets wearing no mask at all. We speculate that the former passersby prepare themselves for a possible encounter with a police officer, in which case they could lie and claim that their mask unnoticeably slipped down from its proper position. The present paper reports the results of a field experiment designed to examine the hypothesis that, given the opportunity, passersby who wear their mask around their chin or neck are more likely to lie than those who wear no mask at all, although intuition may suggest otherwise. Incentivizing passersby's dishonesty with the Die-Under-the-Cup (DUCT) task, the experiment results support our hypothesis.","Tobol, Yossef; Siniver, Erez; Yaniv, Gideon",Econ Lett,,191

This study aimed to investigate the resilience of the Swedish national immunisation programme for children up to the age of five years during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, web-based survey of regional child health offices in Sweden between 10 September and 9 October 2020. It explored the organisation of child health services during the early stages of the pandemic, focusing on routine child immunisation. RESULTS: All 21 Swedish regional child health offices responded. They stated that child immunisation had been prioritised, communication with families had been intensified and there was greater flexibility at all organisational levels of child health services. In addition, the vaccine supply was sustained and child health centres remained open. However, there were periodic staff shortages, increased numbers of health visits cancelled by parents and most parent education groups were paused. CONCLUSION: The Swedish immunisation programme was resilient during the early COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to sustainable organisation co-ordinated by Sweden's network of regional child health offices.","Falkenstein Hagander, Kathy; Aronsson, Bernice; Danielsson, Madelene; Lepp, Tiia; Kulane, Asli; Schollin Ask, Lina",Acta paediatr. scand,,191

505040,Scientific Abstract Sessions,2021,"Nursing is a physically and emotionally demanding profession. Grueling job roles and challenging work environments, specifically in acute or critical care settings, place health care professionals at risk of burnout. Burnout in health care professionals results from a chronic negative work experience, leading to job dissatisfaction and, ultimately, poor patient outcomes. Symptoms and prevalence of burnout can be alleviated by implementing individual-focused strategies and minor modifications in work environments, job demands, and responsibilities. Currently, risk for burnout is increasing as COVID-19 challenges health care systems in which advanced practice nurses and other health care professionals struggle continuously to deliver high-quality patient care. In this article, the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 are considered and an overview is provided of burnout phenomenon, its causal factors, and its consequences. With consideration of current evidence in literature, I discuss some suggested strategies to improve resilience and facilitate well-being among health care professionals at individual and organizational levels.","Howell, Beverly Ann M",AACN Adv Crit Care,,191

508027,SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients: collaboration in the time of COVID-19,2020,"The nasal mucosa constitutes the primary entry site for respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here, we employed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local mucosal innate immune response in the authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with a rapid increase in tissue-associated viral subgenomic mRNA and secretion of infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, cytokines, and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tracts that are specific to SARS-CoV-2. The studies shed light on the role of the nasal mucosa in active viral transmission and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19. IMPORTANCE In order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tract. Here, we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural multicellular complexity of human nasal mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we found distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal mucosal infection model can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory pathogens.","Alfi, Or; Yakirevitch, Arkadi; Wald, Ori; Wandel, Ori; Izhar, Uzi; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Nevo, Yuval; Elgavish, Sharona; Dagan, Elad; Madgar, Ory; Feinmesser, Gilad; Pikarsky, Eli; Bronstein, Michal; Vorontsov, Olesya; Jonas, Wayne; Ives, John; Walter, Joan; Zakay-Rones, Zichria; Oberbaum, Menachem; Panet, Amos; Wolf, Dana G",J Virol,,191

In the initial events, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia implemented mandatory quarantine of returning travelers in order to contain COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a longitudinal study of the arriving travelers to Quarantine facilities and the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 as detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: During the study period, there was a total of 1928 returning travelers with 1273 (66%) males. The age range was 28 days-69 years. Of all the travelers, 23 (1.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the first swab, 14/1928 (0.7%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 0.63% and 0.92% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.57). The second swab was positive in 9 (0.5%) of the other 1914 who were initially negative with a positivity rate of 0.39% and 0.62% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.49). There was no statistical difference in the positivity rates between first and second swab (P = 0.4). Of all travelers, 40 (n = 26, 1.3%) were admitted from the quarantine facility to the hospital due to COVID-19 related positive results or development of symptoms such as fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms; and 14 (0.7%) were admitted due to non-COVID-19 related illness. CONCLUSION: This study showed the efforts put for facility quarantine and that such activity yielded a lower incidence of positive cases. There was a need to have a backup healthcare facility to accommodate those developing a medical need for evaluation and admission for non-COVID-19 related illnesses.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Sattar, Amar; Al-Khadra, Husain; Al-Qahtani, Saeed; Al-Mulhim, Mobarak; Al-Omoush, Omar; Kheir, Hatim O",Travel Med Infect Dis,,191

Affinity purification of these complexes, often using antibodies, followed by mass spectrometry (MS) has revolutionized our ability to identify the composition of MCs. However, conventional immunoprecipitations suffer from contaminating antibody/serum-derived peptides that limit the sensitivity of detection for low-abundant interacting partners using MS. Here, we present AptA-MS (aptamer affinity-mass spectrometry), a robust strategy primarily using a specific, high-affinity RNA aptamer against Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to identify interactors of a GFP-tagged protein of interest by high-resolution MS. Utilizing this approach, we have identified the known molecular chaperones that interact with human Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), and observed an increased association with several proteins upon heat shock, including translation elongation factors and histones. HSF1 is known to be regulated by multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs), and we observe both known and new sites of modifications on HSF1. We show that AptA-MS provides a dramatic target enrichment and detection sensitivity in evolutionarily diverse organisms and allows identification of PTMs without the need for modification-specific enrichments. In combination with the expanding libraries of GFP-tagged cell lines, this strategy offers a general, inexpensive, and high-resolution alternative to conventional approaches for studying MCs.","Ray, Judhajeet; Kruse, Angela; Ozer, Abdullah; Kajitani, Takuya; Johnson, Richard; MacCoss, Michael; Heck, Michelle; Lis, John T",Nucleic acids res,,191

The lack of highly efficacious antiviral drugs that can manage this ongoing global emergency gives urgency to establishing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We characterized the role of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating antiviral immunity. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 N resulted in the attenuation of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor-mediated interferon (IFN) production and IFN-induced gene expression. Similar to the SARS-CoV-1 N protein, SARS-CoV-2 N suppressed the interaction between tripartate motif protein 25 (TRIM25) and RIG-I. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 N inhibited polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]-mediated IFN signaling at the level of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interfered with the association between TBK1 and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), subsequently preventing the nuclear translocation of IRF3. We further found that both type I and III IFN production induced by either the influenza virus lacking the nonstructural protein 1 or the Zika virus were suppressed by the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Our findings provide insights into the molecular function of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein with respect to counteracting the host antiviral immune response.","Oh, Soo Jin; Shin, Ok Sarah",,,191

We aimed to describe rates and characterize predictors and health outcomes associated with AKI in a national cohort of US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In a cohort of 5216 US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 identified through July 23, 2020, we described changes in serum creatinine and examined predictors of AKI and the associations between AKI, health resource utilization, and death, utilizing logistic regressions. We characterized geographic and temporal variations in AKI rates and estimated variance explained by key variables utilizing Poisson regressions. RESULTS: In total, 1655 (32%) participants had AKI; 961 (58%), 223 (13%), and 270 (16%) met Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definitions of stage 1, 2, and 3 AKI, respectively, and 201 (12%) received KRT. Eight percent of participants had AKI within 1 day of hospitalization, and 47% did not recover to baseline serum creatinine by discharge. Older age, Black race, male gender, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lower eGFR were significant predictors of AKI during hospitalization with COVID-19. AKI was associated with higher mechanical ventilation use (odds ratio, 6.46; 95% confidence interval, 5.52 to 7.57) and longer hospital stay (5.56 additional days; 95% confidence interval, 4.78 to 6.34). AKI was also associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio, 6.71; 95% confidence interval, 5.62 to 8.04); this association was stronger in Blacks (P value of interaction <0.001). Hospital-level rates of AKI exhibited substantial geographic variability, ranging from 10% to 56%. Between March and July 2020, AKI rates declined from 40% to 27%; proportions of AKI stage 3 and AKI requiring KRT decreased from 44% to 17%. Both geographic and temporal variabilities were predominately explained by percentages of Blacks (31% and 49%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common during hospitalization with COVID-19 and associated with higher risk of health care resource utilization and death. Nearly half of patients with AKI did not recover to baseline by discharge. Substantial geographic variation and temporal decline in rates and severity of AKI were observed.

Excess deaths were concentrated in a limited number of regions-expected deaths exceeded 20% in just 16 regions-with more than 40% of the regions considered experiencing no excess mortality during the first 6 months of 2020. Highly connected regions, in colder and dryer climates, with high air pollution levels, and relatively poorly endowed health systems witnessed the highest incidence of excess mortality. Institutional factors also played an important role. The first wave hit regions with a combination of weak and declining formal institutional quality and fragile informal institutions hardest. Low and declining national government effectiveness, together with a limited capacity to reach out across societal divides, and a frequent tendency to meet with friends and family were powerful drivers of regional excess mortality.","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés; Burlina, Chiara",Journal of regional science,,191

Design: and Methods: We collected fresh plasma aliquots from 17 patients (LDH range, 281 to 822 U/L) and seven controls (LDH < 230 U/L). In-gel relative activity of the different LDH isoenzymes was determined by electrophoresis and densitometric analysis. Results: Despite the expected higher total LDH activity levels in patients (p<0.001), the in-gel relative activities of LDH isoenzymes did not differ between patients and controls (all p>0.05). We found no correlation between total plasma LDH activity and the in-gel relative activities of the different LDH isoenzymes, including LDH-3. Likewise, there was no correlation between LDH-3 and various routine haematological and serum parameters that have been previously reported to be altered in COVID-19 (such as lymphocyte count, albumin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, C-reactive protein, or ferritin). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that elevation of plasma LDH activity in patients with COVID-19 is not associated to a specific release of LDH-3 into the bloodstream, and do not support the use of LDH as a specific biomarker for lung affectation in patients with COVID-19.","Serrano-Lorenzo, Pablo; Coya, Olga N; López-Jimenez, Ana; Blázquez, Alberto; Delmiro, Aitor; Lucía, Alejandro; Arenas, Joaquín; Martín, Miguel A",Pract Lab Med,,191

Therefore, this study was aimed at examining its possible role in predicting severity and intrahospital mortality of COVID-19, alongside with other laboratory and biochemical procedures, clinical signs, symptoms, and comorbidity. This study, approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Center Kragujevac, was designed as an observational prospective cross-sectional clinical study which was conducted on 127 patients with diagnosed respiratory COVID-19 viral infection from April to August 2020. The primary goals were to determine the predictors of COVID-19 severity and to determine the predictors of the negative outcome of COVID-19 infection. All patients were divided into three categories: patients with a mild form, moderate form, and severe form of COVID-19 infection. All biochemical and laboratory procedures were done on the first day of the hospital admission. Respiratory (p < 0.001) and heart (p = 0.002) rates at admission were significantly higher in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. From all observed hematological and inflammatory markers, only white blood cell count (9.43 ± 4.62, p = 0.001) and LDH (643.13 ± 313.3, p = 0.002) were significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 group. We have observed that in the severe form of SARS-CoV-2, the levels of superoxide anion radicals were substantially higher than those in two other groups (11.3 ± 5.66, p < 0.001) and the nitric oxide level was significantly lower in patients with the severe disease (2.66 ± 0.45, p < 0.001). Using a linear regression model, TA, anosmia, ageusia, O2 -, and the duration at the ICU are estimated as predictors of severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. The presence of dyspnea and a higher heart rate were confirmed as predictors of a negative, fatal outcome. Results from our study show that presence of hypertension, anosmia, and ageusia, as well as the duration of ICU stay, and serum levels of O2 - are predictors of COVID-19 severity, while the presence of dyspnea and an increased heart rate on admission were predictors of COVID-19 mortality.","Cekerevac, Ivan; Turnic, Tamara Nikolic; Draginic, Nevena; Andjic, Marijana; Zivkovic, Vladimir; Simovic, Stefan; Susa, Romana; Novkovic, Ljiljana; Mijailovic, Zeljko; Andjelkovic, Marija; Vukicevic, Vladimir; Vulovic, Tatjana; Jakovljevic, Vladimir",Oxid Med Cell Longev,,191

We aimed to define factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 in MG patients and risk of MG exacerbation during COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated clinical features and outcomes after COVID-19 in 93 MG patients. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (38%) had severe pneumonia and we recorded 10 deaths (11%) due to COVID-19. Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) values tested before COVID-19 were shown to be protective against severe infection (95% CI 0.934-0.98) as well as good control of MG measured by the quantified myasthenia gravis score (95% CI 1.047-1.232). Long-term chronic corticosteroid treatment worsened the course of COVID-19 in MG patients (95% CI 1.784-111.43) and this impact was positively associated with dosage (p = 0.005). Treatment using azathioprine (95% CI 0.448-2.935), mycophenolate mofetil (95% CI 0.91-12.515) and ciclosporin (95% CI 0.029-2.212) did not influence the course of COVID-19. MG patients treated with rituximab had a high risk of death caused by COVID-19 (95% CI 3.216-383.971). Exacerbation of MG during infection was relatively rare (15%) and was not caused by remdesivir, convalescent plasma or favipiravir (95% CI 0.885-10.87). CONCLUSIONS: As the most important predictors of severe COVID-19 in MG patients we identified unsatisfied condition of MG with lower FVC, previous long-term corticosteroid treatment especially in higher doses, older age, the presence of cancer, and recent rituximab treatment.","Jakubíková, Michala; Týblová, Michaela; Tesar, Adam; Horáková, Magda; Vlazná, Daniela; Rysánková, Irena; Nováková, Iveta; Dolecková, Kristýna; Dusek, Pavel; Pitha, Jirí; Vohánka, Stanislav; Bednarík, Josef",Eur. j. neurol,,191

We explored whether the quality of evidence of COVID-19 publications is lower when compared to nonCOVID-19 publications in the three highest ranked scientific medical journals. METHODS: We searched the PubMed Database from March 12 to April 12, 2020 and identified 559 publications in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet which were divided into COVID-19 (cases, n = 204) and nonCOVID-19 (controls, n = 355) associated content. After exclusion of secondary, unauthored, response letters and non-matching article types, 155 COVID-19 publications (including 13 original articles) and 130 nonCOVID-19 publications (including 52 original articles) were included in the comparative analysis. The hierarchical level of evidence was determined for each publication included and compared between cases and controls as the main outcome. A quantitative scoring of quality was carried out for the subgroup of original articles. The numbers of authors and citation rates were also compared between groups. RESULTS: The 130 nonCOVID-19 publications were associated with higher levels of evidence on the level of evidence pyramid, with a strong association measure (Cramer's V: 0.452, P <0.001). The 155 COVID-19 publications were 186-fold more likely to be of lower evidence (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio, 7.0-47; P <0.001). The quantitative quality score (maximum possible score, 28) was significantly different in favor of nonCOVID-19 (mean difference, 11.1; 95% CI, 8.5-13.7; P <0.001). There was a significant difference in the early citation rate of the original articles that favored the COVID-19 original articles (median [interquartile range], 45 [30-244] vs. 2 [1-4] citations; P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the quality of COVID-19 publications in the three highest ranked scientific medical journals is below the quality average of these journals. These findings need to be verified at a later stage of the pandemic.","Zdravkovic, Marko; Berger-Estilita, Joana; Zdravkovic, Bogdan; Berger, David",PLoS One,,191

Students faced sudden changes to their lives and relied upon written messages for directives. This study investigated the language of university-based communications, based on models of crisis communication and epidemic management. METHODS: The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count was used to investigate the language in the most salient written messages from universities to students regarding the migration to online classes. RESULTS: As predicted, certain word types were used more frequently than others. The larger the student body, the more frequently universities used positive emotion/resilience and power/organizational words. and the more likely a COVID update would be posted on the homepage within three months' time. CONCLUSION: Messages should be guided by models of crisis management and carefully crafted, given the role of universities in managing large numbers of students during ongoing pandemic illness.","Mohlman, Jan; Basch, Corey",J Am Coll Health,,191

BACKGROUND: Some quantitative research was conducted on clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 and pregnant women's concerns and birth expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic, but no qualitative findings on childbearing women's experiences during the pandemic were published prior to our study. AIM: To explore childbearing experiences of COVID-19 positive mothers who gave birth in the months of March and April 2020 in a Northern Italy maternity hospital. METHODS: A qualitative interpretive phenomenological approach was undertaken. Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 women. Thematic analysis was completed using NVivo software. Ethical approval was obtained from the research site's Ethics Committee prior to commencing the study. FINDINGS: The findings include four main themes: 1) coping with unmet expectations; 2) reacting and adapting to the 'new ordinary'; 3) 'pandemic relationships'; 4) sharing a traumatic experience with long-lasting emotional impact. DISCUSSION: The most traumatic elements of women's experiences were the sudden family separation, self-isolation, transfer to a referral centre, the partner not allowed to be present at birth and limited physical contact with the newborn. CONCLUSION: Key elements of good practice including provision of compassionate care, presence of birth companions and transfer to referral centers only for the most severe COVID-19 cases should be considered when drafting maternity care pathways guidelines in view of future pandemic waves.","Fumagalli, Simona; Ornaghi, Sara; Borrelli, Sara; Vergani, Patrizia; Nespoli, Antonella",Women and birth (Online),,191

Its association with frailty is less well-described, particularly in independent community-dwelling older adults. Although nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining bone and muscle health, the complex relationship between osteosarcopenia and nutrition in the pathogenesis of frailty remains to be elucidated. In this cross-sectional analysis of 230 independent, community-dwelling individuals (mean age 67.2 ± 7.4 years), we examined the associations between osteosarcopenia with nutritional status and frailty, and the mediating role of nutrition in the association between osteosarcopenia and frailty. Osteosarcopenia was defined as fulfilling both the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 consensus definition (low relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass adjusted for height, in the presence of either of either low handgrip strength or slow gait speed) and T-score ≤ −2.5 SD on bone mineral densitometry. We assessed frailty using the modified Fried criteria and nutrition using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment. We performed multiple linear regression, followed by pathway analysis to ascertain whether nutrition mediates the relationship between osteosarcopenia and frailty. Our study population comprised: 27 (11.7%) osteosarcopenic, 35 (15.2%) sarcopenic, 36 (15.7%) osteoporotic and 132 (57.4%) normal (neither osteosarcopenic, sarcopenic nor osteoporotic). Osteosarcopenia (β = 1.1, 95% CI 0.86–1.4) and sarcopenia (β = 1.1, 95% CI 0.90–1.4) were significantly associated with frailty, but not osteoporosis.

While performing a multi-component analysis regarding the Algerian outbreak, the toolkit of phylogenetic, phylogeographic, haplotype, and genomic analysis were effectively implemented. We estimated the Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) in reference to the Algerian pandemic and highlighted the multiple introductions of the disease and the missing data depicted in the transmission loop. In addition, we emphasized the significant role played by local and international travels in disease dissemination. Most importantly, we unveiled mutational patterns, the effect of unique mutations on corresponding proteins, and the relatedness regarding the Algerian sequences to other sequences worldwide. Our results revealed individual amino-acid replacements such as the deleterious replacement A23T in the orf3a gene in Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241. Additionally, a connection between Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 and sequences originating from the USA was observed through a USA characteristic amino-acid replacement T1004I in the nsp3 gene, found in the aforementioned Algerian sequence. Similarly, successful tracing could be established, such as Algeria/G37318-8849/2020|EPI_ISL_766863, which was imported from Saudi Arabia during the pilgrimage.

Commitment to implementing proven public health strategies will require bold public health leadership and courageous acts by politicians. Developing new innovative communication, mitigation, and health care approaches, particularly in the era of social media, is also clearly warranted. We believe that the best public health evidence must inform activities in three priority areas to stop this pandemic: (1) coordinated and consistent stay-at-home orders across multiple jurisdictions, including potential nationwide mandates; (2) rapid scale-up of SARS-CoV-2 testing; and (3) improved health care capacity to respond.

595293,Diagnosis and Management of Pneumonia in the Emergency Department,2008-02-22,"BACKGROUND: Overcrowding, reduced nurse to patient ratio, limited distance between incubators and absence of microbiological surveillance have been shown to promote spread of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms (MDRGN) in patients with birthweight < 1500 g. Patients > 1500 g treated on an intermediate care unit are unrepresented in recent literature. We therefore intended to present data obtained from a short-term overcrowded neonatal intermediate care unit (NIMCU) at a level III (international categorization) perinatal center at University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany. METHODS: During a 25 day overcrowding (OV) and 28 day post-overcrowding period (POST-OV) on NIMCU, epidemiological data obtained from continuously hold microbiological surveillance were investigated and compared to the last 12 months of ward-regular bed occupancy preceding OV (PRAE-OV). RESULTS: During OV, the number of patients simultaneously treated at the NIMCU increased from 18 to 22, resulting in a reduced bed-to-bed space. Nurse: patient ratio was 4:22 during OV compared to 3:18 during PRAE-OV. Cumulative incidence of MDRGN was 4.7% in OV and 2.4% POST-OV compared to 4.8% to PRAE-OV, respectively, without any significant variations. During OV and POST-OV, septic episodes due to MDRGN were not observed. In one case, potential nosocomial transmission of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to Piperacillin and 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of nosocomial spread of MDRGN in an overcrowded NIMCU is based on staff’s diligent training and adequate staffing. Concise microbiological surveillance should be guaranteed to escort through overcrowding periods. In our setting, impact of bed-to-bed distance on MDRGN transmission seemed to be less strong.","Fischer, Doris; Schlößer, Rolf L.; Kempf, Volkhard A.

596430,Getting it right: automated surveillance of healthcare-associated infections,2021,"AIMS: The current pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infects a wide age group but predominantly elderly individuals, especially men and those with cardiovascular disease. Recent reports suggest an association with use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for coronaviruses. Higher ACE2 concentrations might lead to increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 in patients on RAAS inhibitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured ACE2 concentrations in 1485 men and 537 women with heart failure (index cohort). Results were validated in 1123 men and 575 women (validation cohort). The median age was 69 years for men and 75 years for women. The strongest predictor of elevated concentrations of ACE2 in both cohorts was male sex (estimate = 0.26, P < 0.001; and 0.19, P < 0.001, respectively). In the index cohort, use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was not an independent predictor of plasma ACE2. In the validation cohort, ACE inhibitor (estimate = –0.17, P = 0.002) and ARB use (estimate = –0.15, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of lower plasma ACE2, while use of an MRA (estimate = 0.11, P = 0.04) was an independent predictor of higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. CONCLUSION: In two independent cohorts of patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of ACE2 were higher in men than in women, but use of neither an ACE inhibitor nor an ARB was associated with higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. These data might explain the higher incidence and fatality rate of COVID-19 in men, but do not support previous reports suggesting that ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the vulnerability for COVID-19 through increased plasma ACE2 concentrations.","Sama, Iziah E; Ravera, Alice; Santema, Bernadet T; van Goor, Harry; ter Maaten, Jozine M; Cleland, John G F; Rienstra, Michiel; Friedrich, Alex W; Samani, Nilesh J; Ng, Leong L; Dickstein, Kenneth; Lang, Chim C; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Anker, Stefan D; Ponikowski, Piotr; Metra, Marco; van Veldhuisen, Dirk J; Voors, Adriaan A",Eur Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388565/; https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa373,191

As of July 27, 2020, the cumulative confirmed number of cases was about 4.2 million with almost 300,000 of them entailing hospitalizations. Due to data collection limitations the confirmed totals reported by the CDC undercount the actual number of cases and hospitalizations in the U.S. Using standard assumptions provided by the CDC, we estimate that as of July 27, 2020, the actual number of cumulative COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is about 47 million with almost 1 million involving hospitalizations. Applying value per statistical life (VSL) and relative severity/injury estimates from the Department of Transportation (DOT), we estimate an overall non-fatal unadjusted valuation of $2.2 trillion for the U.S. with a weighted average value of about $46,000 per case. This is almost 40% higher than the total valuation of $1.6 trillion (using about $11 million VSL from the DOT) for all approximately 147,000 COVID-19 fatalities. We also show a variety of estimates that adjust the non-fatal valuations by the dreaded and uncertainty aspect of COVID-19, age, income, and a factor related to fatality categorization. The adjustments show current overall non-fatal valuations ranging from about $1.5 trillion to about $9.6 trillion. Finally, we use CDC forecast data to estimate non-fatal valuations through November 2020, and find that the overall cumulative valuation increases from about $2.2 trillion to about $5.7 trillion or to about 30% of GDP. Because of the larger numbers of cases involved our calculations imply that non-fatal infections are as economically serious in the aggregate as ultimately fatal infections.","Kniesner, Thomas J.; Sullivan, Ryan",J Risk Uncertain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169048/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11166-020-09339-0,191

Millions of people worldwide are already infected by this virus, and severe infection causes hyper inflammation, thus disrupting lung function, exacerbating breath difficulties, and death. Various inflammatory mediators bio-synthesized through the arachidonic acid pathway play roles in developing cytokine storms, injuring virus-infected cells. Since pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, are key brokers for physiological processes such as inflammation, fever, allergy, and pain but, their function in COVID-19 is not well defined. This study addresses eicosanoid's crucial role through the arachidonic pathway in inflammatory cascading and recommends using bioactive lipids, NSAIDs, steroids, cell phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitors, and specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) to treat COVID-19 disease. The role of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (SEHIs) in promoting the activity of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and 17-hydroxide-docosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA) is also discussed.

598508,Infectious Triggers of Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction,2016-05-24,"BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is closely associated with the health of the host; although the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and the whole virome has rarely been studied, it is likely of medical importance. Examination of the interactions between the gut bacterial microbiome and virome of rhesus monkey would significantly contribute to revealing the gut microbiome composition. METHODS: Here, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of rhesus monkeys in a longitudinal cohort treated with an antibiotic cocktail, and we documented the interactions between the bacterial microbiome and virome. The depletion of viral populations was confirmed at the species level by real-time PCR. We also detected changes in the gut metabolome by GC-MS and LC-MS. RESULTS: A majority of bacteria were depleted after treatment with antibiotics, and the Shannon diversity index decreased from 2.95 to 0.22. Furthermore, the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) decreased from 104.47 to 33.84, and the abundance of eukaryotic viruses also changed substantially. In the annotation, 6 families of DNA viruses and 1 bacteriophage family were present in the normal monkeys but absent after gut bacterial microbiome depletion. Intriguingly, we discovered that changes in the gut bacterial microbiome composition may promote changes in the gut virome composition, and tryptophan, arginine, and quinone may play roles in the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and virome. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the clearly altered composition of the virome was correlated with depletion in the bacterial community and that metabolites produced by bacteria possibly play important roles in the interaction.

Neutralizing antibodies are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. A number of neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) were reported for their in vitro activities. However, in vivo protection of these nanobodies was not reported in animal models. In the current report, we characterized several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from a screen of an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibited picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and 15 circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs were engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15, a novel trimer constituted of three Nbs, was constructed to be bispecific for human serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited sub-ng/ml neutralization potency against the wild-type and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo.

However, there remains a limited understanding of how best to support patients during this time, particularly through the use of digital health interventions. Recognizing and understanding the potential unmet needs of elective orthopedic surgery patients is central to motivating healthier behavior change, improving recovery, and optimizing overall surgical success in the short and long term. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore patient perspectives on technology features that would help support them to change their lifestyle behaviors during the pre- and postoperative periods, and that could potentially maintain long-term healthy lifestyles following recovery. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with pre- and postoperative elective orthopedic patients were conducted between May and June 2020 using telephone and video call–based software. Patient perspectives on the use of digital technologies to complement current surgical care and support with lifestyle behavior changes were discussed. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Four themes were developed from the data regarding the design and functionality of digital technologies to best support the perioperative journey. These center around an intervention’s ability to incorporate interactive, user-centered features; direct a descriptive and structured recovery; enable customizable, patient-controlled settings; and deliver both general and specific surgical advice in a timely manner. Interventions that are initiated preoperatively and continued postoperatively were perceived as beneficial. Interventions designed with personalized milestones were found to better guide patients through a structured recovery. Individualized tailoring of preparatory and recovery information was desired by patients with previously high levels of physical activity before surgery. The use of personalized progression-based exercises further encouraged physical recovery; game-like rewards and incentives were regarded as motivational for making and sustaining health behavior change. In-built video calling and messaging features offered connectivity with peers and clinicians for supported care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Specific intervention design and functionality features can provide better, structured support for elective orthopedic patients across the entire surgical journey and beyond. This study provides much-needed evidence relating to the optimal design and timing of digital interventions for elective orthopedic surgical patients. Findings from this study suggest a desire for personalized perioperative care, in turn, supporting patients to make health behavior changes to optimize surgical success. These findings should be used to influence future co-design projects to enable the design and implementation of patient-focused, tailored, and targeted digital health technologies within modern health care settings.","Robinson, Anna; Slight, Robert D; Husband, Andrew K; Slight, Sarah P",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683208/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25885,191
603810,The temporal course of T- and B-cell-responses to vaccination with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273,2021-09-20,"Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 μM concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.","Durdagi, Serdar; Avsar, Timucin; Orhan, Muge Didem; Serhatli, Muge; Balcioglu, Bertan Koray; Ozturk, Hasan Umit; Kayabolen, Alisan; Cetin, Yuksel; Aydinlik, Seyma; Bagci-Onder, Tugba; Tekin, Saban; Demirci, Hasan; Guzel, Mustafa; Akdemir, Atilla; Calis, Seyma; Oktay, Lalehan; Tolu, Ilayda; Butun, Yasar Enes; Erdemoglu, Ece; Olkan, Alpsu; Tokay, Nurettin; Işık, Şeyma; Ozcan, Aysenur; Acar, Elif; Buyukkilic, Sehriban; Yumak, Yesim",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.424423,191

However, to date there is mixed evidence, at best, to support this claim. We consider the reasons why conspiracy theory beliefs do not appear to be based in any straightforward way on control beliefs, interrogating existing findings and presenting new data that call the relationship into question. Across six studies conducted online using MTurk samples, we observed no effect of control manipulations on conspiracy theory beliefs, while replicating previously reported correlational evidence of their association. The results suggest that conspiracy beliefs are not suitable for compensating for threats to control.

604433,Can COVID-19 present unusual GI symptoms?,2020-03-21,"INTRODUCTION: Travel medicine deals with prevention and management of health problems of travelers to avoid or reduce the risk of avoidable illnesses. Primary healthcare physicians are the key individuals to provide the same. The objective of current study was to explore the level of knowledge, attitude, and current practical application of travel medicine among primary health care physicians serving in the Riyadh Health Cluster, Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional study among 210 primary healthcare physicians serving in Riyadh Health Cluster was conducted using a paper-based self-administered questionnaire collecting information on socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge, attitude as well as practice of travel medicine. RESULTS: The majority of study participants were females (117, 55.7%) and 63% (n = 133) were non-Saudi physicians. More than 30% that is 66 participants had clinical experience of less than 5 years and around 67% (i.e., 141) participants were serving at the designation of registrar/senior registrar. One hundred sixty-seven participants (79.5%) had ever provided health advice to the travelers. Majority of the study participants had gained information on the travel medicine through Ministry of Health guidelines (66%). Nearly 11.4% participants were not sure about the cause of occurrence of typhoid infection. As reported by 30.5%, travelers never really sought advice on the travel insurance. Nearly 79.5% participants reported to have provided post-travel consultation for diarrhea, followed by respiratory infection (45.2%), fever (42%), and skin problems (21%). CONCLUSION: The knowledge, attitude, and practice of travel medicine among primary healthcare physicians was found to be sub-optimal in Riyadh.","Sharahili, Abeer Ahmed; AL-Eanzi, Fayiz; Ghzwany, Amal Ahmed; Alazmi, Alhanouf Mamluh; Alhwsawi, Esra Ali",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2354_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568140/,191
604438,World Brain Day 2021: Global campaign to stop multiple sclerosis,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults with multiple comorbidities experience high rates of hospitalization and poor outcomes from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Changes in care utilization by persons in advanced illness management (AIM) programs during the COVID-19 pandemic are not well known. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in care utilization by homebound AIM patients in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic before and during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Descriptive statistics and tests of differences were used to compare care utilization rates, including emergency department (ED) and inpatient admissions, acute and sub-acute rehabilitation, and AIM program utilization during the pandemic with rates one year prior. RESULTS: Acute and post-acute utilization for enrollees (n=1,468) decreased March-May 2020 compared to one year prior (n=1,452), while utilization of AIM program resources remained high. Comparing 2019 and 2020, ED visits/1000 enrollees were 109 versus 44 (p<0.001), inpatient admissions 213 versus 113 (p<0.001), and rehabilitation facility admissions 56 versus 31 (p=0.014); AIM program home visits were 1935 versus 276 (p<0.001), remote visits (telehealth/telephonic) 0 versus 1079 (p<0.001), and all other phone touches 3032 versus 5062 (p<0.001). Home hospice admissions/1000 increased: 16 to 31 (p=0.011). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results demonstrate decreased acute and post-acute utilization, while maintaining high levels of connectedness to the AIM program, amongst a cohort of homebound older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with one year prior. While further study is needed, our results suggest that AIM programs can provide support to this population in the home setting during a pandemic.","Abrashkin, Karen A; Zhang, Jenny; Poku, Asantewaa",Gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045054/,191
605014,Impact of Cryopreservation and Transit Times of Allogeneic Grafts on Hematopoietic and Immune Reconstitution.,2021-09-28,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed individuals' lifestyles to a great extent, particularly in Italy. Although many concerns about it have been highlighted, its impact on children and adolescents has scarcely been examined. The purpose of this study was to explore behavioral consequences and coping strategies related to the pandemic among families in Italy, by focusing on developmental ages from the caregivers' perspective, 3 weeks into quarantine. An exploratory cross-sectional online survey was conducted over 14 days. Google Forms was employed to conduct the survey. Demographic variables and pre-existing Psychological Weaknesses (PsW) were asked. Adults' sleep difficulties (SleepScore) and coping strategies during quarantine were assessed. Behavioral changes related to quarantine of both subjects completing the form (COVIDStress) and their children (when present) were questioned. Of the 6,871 respondents, we selected 6,800 valid questionnaires; 3,245 declared children aged under 18 years of age (caregivers). PsWs were recognizable in 64.9% among non-caregivers and in 61.5% of caregivers, with a mean PsW score of 1.42 ± 1.26 and 1.30 ± 1.25 over 3 points, respectively. The 95.5% of the non-caregivers and the 96.5% of caregivers presented behavioral changes with a mean COVIDStress of 3.85 ± 1.82 and 4.09 ± 1.79 over 8, respectively (p<0.001). Sleep difficulties were present in the 61.6% of the non-caregivers and in the 64.4% of the caregivers (p < 0.001), who showed higher SleepScores (2.41 ± 1.26 against 2.57 ± 1.38 points over 6, p < 0.001). COVIDStress (and SleepScore) strongly correlated with PsW (p < 0.001). Caregivers observed behavioral changes in their children in the 64.3% of the <6 years old and in 72.5% of 6–18 years old. Caregivers' discomfort related to quarantine (COVIDStress, SleepScore) was strongly associated to behavioral changes in both age groups of <6 and 6–18 (p < 0.001). Presence of caregivers' coping strategies was less associated to behavioral changes in the <6 sample (p = 0.001) but not in the 6–18 (p = 0.06). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted families in Italy with regard to behavioral changes, especially in high-risk categories with PsWs and caregivers, especially the ones with children aged <6 years. While coping strategies functioned as protective factors, a wide array of stress symptoms had implications for children's and adolescents' behaviors. It is recommended that public children welfare strategies be implemented, especially for higher-psychosocial-risk categories.","Uccella, Sara; De Grandis, Elisa; De Carli, Fabrizio; D'Apruzzo, Maria; Siri, Laura; Preiti, Deborah; Di Profio, Sonia; Rebora, Serena; Cimellaro, Paola; Biolcati Rinaldi, Alessandra; Venturino, Cristina; Petralia, Paolo; Ramenghi, Luca Antonio; Nobili, Lino",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614580/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.608358,191

606859,Acute Necrotizing Encephalitis in Viral Respiratory Tract Infection: An Autopsy Case Report,2020-05-12,"INTRODUCTION: During the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, as New Yorkers were enjoined by authorities to stay-at-home, patient encounters were transitioned from office visits to telemedicine consultations. It was thought that increased stress during the pandemic would worsen rates of insomnia, and concerns regarding use of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy during a respiratory pandemic would affect compliance. We sought to describe telemedicine success rates, the distribution of sleep problems evaluated remotely by telemedicine, and PAP compliance in our patient population. METHODS: Telemedicine encounters from March 16th through May 31st, 2020, were reviewed for show-rates, patient characteristics and clinician impressions, and were compared to administrative data from the 2.5 months prior to the stay-at-home period (the “control period”). PAP compliance was analyzed for forty randomly selected patients established on PAP therapy between January 1st and October 1st, 2019, and whose machines transmitted data to a digital management system between October 1st and December 31st, 2019. Compliance reports and AHI were compared between the stay-at-home- and control- periods for this randomly selected group of patients. RESULTS: The telemedicine show rate was 89.37% (compared to a 91.91% in-office show-rate during the control period); all these encounters were successfully completed. Sleep apnea was the predominant diagnosis during the stay-at-home period (44.33% of encounters), followed by insomnia (23.16%). Insomnia complaints were significantly higher during the stay-at-home period compared to the control period (23.16% versus 14.6% of encounters; p < .05), and among new- versus follow-up- patients (41.76% versus 35.99%). PAP compliance and AHI, however, were not statistically different for forty randomly selected patients between the control and stay-at-home periods. CONCLUSION: Most stay-at-home period telemedicine encounters were successful. Sleep apnea, then insomnia, were common findings among new and follow-up patients during the stay-at-home period, and insomnia rates increased during the pandemic. PAP compliance and AHI were similar in a random cohort when compared between the stay-at-home and control periods.

Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1/2/2020 and 3/25/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists. Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were analyzed. Instances of notes referencing depression or anxiety decreased 75-81% in outpatient settings with onset of coronavirus in March 2019, and by 44-45% in emergency departments. In adjusted logistic regression, presence of individual psychiatric symptoms in outpatient notes was associated with significant decreases in likelihood of coronavirus testing (for depression, OR=0.636, 95% CI 0.606-0.667). Conversely, presence of violence in an emergency department note was associated with greater likelihood of testing (OR=1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761). Conclusions and Relevance: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms in both outpatient and emergency department settings diminished sharply in the context of increasing coronavirus infection in Massachusetts, suggesting that efforts to provide additional resources to manage psychiatric symptoms will be needed.

Many pharmacy schools have not adopted yet specific programs targeting the development of LLL skills, though LLL is widely accepted as an essential competence. This paper examines the effectiveness and utility of a longitudinal CPD training program. METHODS: A CPD simulation course was introduced to a cohort of fifth year students in Northern Cyprus in the 2018–2019 academic year. The program was delivered as an interactive orientation course in one semester; meanwhile, in the second semester, the students applied the CPD cycle and completed their portfolios during their final experiential practice. A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate the outcomes of the intervention using students’ preparedness for lifelong learning (SPLLL) self-administered questionnaire delivered pre-post program, focus group sessions for students to reflect on the course experience, and instructors’ evaluations of portfolios. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the course, students’ assessment scores were significantly higher overall and for all scale domains, including “knowledge, skills, attitude and practice”, compared to the baseline assessment. Additionally, compared to fifth year students who responded to the second SPLLL questionnaire, the intervention group students’ assessment was significantly higher in knowledge, skills, and practice. The qualitative analysis reported high student satisfaction and achievement of the course objectives. Nineteen of the students scored high on their portfolios. CONCLUSION: The CPD simulation course provided students with opportunities to practice and develop self-assessment and self-management skills that are all desirable for lifelong learning and prepared them for CPD.","Khamis, Sarah; Abdi, Abdikarim Mohamed; Basgut, Bilgen",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302925/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02394-w,191
608089,Is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a protective factor in SARS-CoV-2 infection? The importance of bronchodilator treatment(),2020-09-26,"Over recent years, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their potential biomedical applications have received much attention from the global scientific community in an increasing manner. Firstly, MSCs were successfully isolated from human bone marrow (BM), but in the next steps, they were also extracted from other sources, mostly from the umbilical cord (UC) and adipose tissue (AT). The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) has suggested minimum criteria to identify and characterize MSCs as follows: plastic adherence, surface expression of CD73, D90, CD105 in the lack of expression of CD14, CD34, CD45, and human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and also the capability to differentiate to multiple cell types including adipocyte, chondrocyte, or osteoblast in vitro depends on culture conditions. However, these distinct properties, including self-renewability, multipotency, and easy accessibility are just one side of the coin; another side is their huge secretome which is comprised of hundreds of mediators, cytokines, and signaling molecules and can effectively modulate the inflammatory responses and control the infiltration process that finally leads to a regulated tissue repair/healing or regeneration process. MSC-mediated immunomodulation is a direct result of a harmonic synergy of MSC-released signaling molecules (i.e., mediators, cytokines, and chemokines), the reaction of immune cells and other target cells to those molecules, and also feedback in the MSC-molecule-target cell axis. These features make MSCs a respectable and eligible therapeutic candidate to be evaluated in immune-mediated disorders, such as graft versus host diseases (GVHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Crohn’s disease (CD), and osteoarthritis (OA), and even in immune-dysregulating infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper discussed the therapeutic applications of MSC secretome and its biomedical aspects related to immune-mediated conditions. Sources for MSC extraction, their migration and homing properties, therapeutic molecules released by MSCs, and the pathways and molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the exceptional immunoregulatory competence of MSCs were discussed. Besides, the novel discoveries and recent findings on immunomodulatory plasticity of MSCs, clinical applications, and the methods required for their use as an effective therapeutic option in patients with immune-mediated/immune-dysregulating diseases were highlighted.","Markov, Alexander; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Aravindhan, Surendar; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Jarahian, Mostafa; Chartrand, Max Stanley; Pathak, Yashwant; Marofi, Faroogh; Shamlou, Somayeh; Hassanzadeh, Ali",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-021-02265-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33736695/,191

We have previously reported all the 22 N-glycosites and site-specific N-glycans in the S protein protomer. Herein, we report the O-glycosylation landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which were characterized through high-resolution mass spectrometry. Following digestion with trypsin and trypsin/Glu-C, and de-N-glycosylation using PNGase F, we determined the GalNAc-type O-glycosylation pattern of S proteins, including O-glycosites and the six most common O-glycans occupying them, via Byonic identification and manual validation. Finally, 255 intact O-glycopeptides composed of 50 peptides sequences and 43 O-glycosites were discovered by higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD), and three O-glycosites were confidently identified by electron transfer/higher energy collision-induced dissociation (EThcD) in the insect cell-expressed S protein. Most glycosites were modified by non-sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex (1). In contrast, in the human cell-expressed S protein S1 subunit, 407 intact O-glycopeptides composed of 34 peptides sequences and 30 O-glycosites were discovered by HCD, and 11 O-glycosites were unambiguously assigned by EThcD. However, the measurement of O-glycosylation occupancy hasn’t been made. Most glycosites were modified by sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1)Hex (1)NeuAc (1) and HexNAc(1)Hex (1)NeuAc (2). Our results reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is an O-glycoprotein; the O-glycosites and O-glycan compositions vary with the host cell type. These comprehensive O-glycosylation landscapes of the S protein are expected to provide novel insights into the viral binding mechanism and present a strategy for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","Zhang, Yong; Zhao, Wanjun; Mao, Yonghong; Chen, Yaohui; Zheng, Shanshan; Cao, Wei; Zhu, Jingqiang; Hu, Liqiang; Gong, Meng; Cheng, Jingqiu; Yang, Hao",Front Chem,https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2021.689521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552909/,191

The European and African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (E-AHPBA), the premier representative body for practicing HPB surgeons in Europe and Africa, conducted this survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on HPB surgery. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all E-AHPBA members to assess the effects of the pandemic on unit capacity, management of HPB cancers, use of COVID-19 screening and other aspects of service delivery. RESULTS: overall, 145 (25%) members responded. Most units, particularly in COVID-high countries (>100,000 cases) reported insufficient critical care capacity and reduced HPB operating sessions compared to COVID-low countries. Delayed access to cancer surgery necessitated alternatives including increased neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and colorectal liver metastases, and locoregional treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. Other aspects of service delivery including COVID-19 screening and personal protective equipment varied between units and countries. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound adverse impact on the delivery of HPB cancer care across the continents of Europe and Africa. The findings illustrate the need for safe resumption of cancer surgery in a “new” normal world with screening of patients and staff for COVID-19.","Balakrishnan, Anita; Lesurtel, Mickael; Siriwardena, Ajith K.; Heinrich, Stefan; Serrablo, Alejandro; Besselink, Marc G.H.; Erkan, Mert; Andersson, Bodil; Polak, Wojciech G.; Laurenzi, Andrea; Olde Damink, Stefan W.M.; Berrevoet, Frederik; Frigerio, Isabella; Ramia, Jose M.; Gallagher, Thomas K.; Warner, Susanne; Shrikhande, Shailesh V.; Adam, Rene; Smith, Martin D.; Conlon, Kevin C.",HPB (Oxford),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32565039/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpb.2020.05.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1365182X20310406; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1365182X20310406,191

When the National Health Service proposes to scrape general practitioner records, it is very important that we understand these concerns in some depth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate views of mental health service users on acceptable data sharing to provide clear recommendations for future data sharing systems. METHODS: A total of 4 focus groups with 4 member-checking groups were conducted via the internet between October 2020 and March 2021, with a total of 22 service users in the United Kingdom. Thematic analysis was used to identify the themes. RESULTS: Six main themes, with several subthemes were identified, such as the purpose of data sharing—for profit, public good, and continuation of care; discrimination through the misattribution of physical symptoms to mental health conditions (ie, diagnostic overshadowing) alongside the discrimination of individuals or groups within society (ie, institutional discrimination); safeguarding data by preserving anonymity and confidentiality, strengthening security measures, and holding organizations accountable; data accuracy and informed consent—increasing transparency about data use and choice; and incorporating service user involvement in system governance to provide insight and increase security. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the limited research on the views and concerns of mental health service users regarding acceptable data sharing. If adopted, the recommendations should improve the confidence of service users in sharing their data. The five recommendations include screening to ensure that data sharing benefits the public, providing service users with information about how their data are shared and what for, highlighting the existing safeguarding procedures, incorporating service user involvement, and developing tailored training for health care professionals to address issues of diagnostic overshadowing and inaccurate health records. Adopting such systems would aid in data sharing for legitimate interests that will benefit patients and the National Health Service.","Adanijo, Abimbola; McWilliams, Caoimhe; Wykes, Til; Jilka, Sagar",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477558/; https://doi.org/10.2196/30596,191

612011,Clinical Evaluation of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test and a Diagnostic Platform Switch during 48 Hours in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Many women experience urgency (UUI) and mixed (MUI) urinary incontinence but commonly hesitate to seek care. Treatment access and self-management for these conditions can be supported through eHealth approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the mobile app Tät II for self-management of UUI and MUI in women. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included women ≥18 years old with UUI or MUI and ≥2 leakages per week. Those with red-flag symptoms were excluded. Participants were recruited via analog and digital advertisements and screened for initial selection through a web-based questionnaire. Data were collected using another questionnaire and a 2-day bladder diary. A telephone interview confirmed the symptom diagnosis. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive access to a treatment app (including pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, psychoeducation, lifestyle advice, tailored advice, exercise log, reinforcement messages, and reminders) or an information app (control group), with no external treatment guidance provided. The primary outcome was incontinence symptoms at the 15-week follow-up, measured using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)−Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF). Urgency symptoms were assessed using the ICIQ−Overactive Bladder Module (ICIQ-OAB) and quality of life using the ICIQ−Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life Module (ICIQ-LUTSqol). Incontinence episode frequency (IEF) was calculated per bladder diary entries. Improvement was measured using the Patient’s Global Impression of Improvement. All outcomes were self-reported. Cure was defined as no leakages per the bladder diary. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between April 2017 and March 2018, 123 women (mean age 58.3, SD 9.6 years) were randomized to the treatment (n=60, 2 lost to follow-up) or information (n=63) group. Of these, 35 (28%) women had UUI, and 88 (72%) had MUI. Mean ICIQ-UI SF score at follow-up was lower in the treatment group than in the information group (estimated difference −3.1, 95% CI −4.8 to −1.3). The estimated between-group difference was −1.8 (95% CI −2.8 to −0.99) for mean ICIQ-OAB score and −6.3 (95% CI −10.5 to −2.1) for the mean ICIQ-LUTSqol score at follow-up. IEF reduction from baseline to follow-up was greater in the treatment group (−10.5, IQR −17.5 to −3.5) than in the information group (P<.001). Improvement was reported by 87% (52/60) of treatment group participants and by 30% (19/63) of information group participants. The cure rate was 32% in the treatment group, and 6% in the information group (odds ratio 5.4, 95% CI 1.9-15.6; P=.002). About 67% (40/60) of the treatment group participants used the app more than thrice a week. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment app was effective for improving urgency and mixed incontinence in women. When self-management is appropriate, this app may be a good alternative to pharmacological treatment or other conservative management, thus increasing access to care.

612407,Differences of SARS-CoV-2 serological test performance between hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases,2020-11-05,"The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made the world seem unpredictable. During such crises we can experience concerns that others might be against us, culminating perhaps in paranoid conspiracy theories. Here, we investigate paranoia and belief updating in an online sample (N=1,010) in the United States of America (U.S.A). We demonstrate the pandemic increased individuals’ self-rated paranoia and rendered their task-based belief updating more erratic. Local lockdown and reopening policies, as well as culture more broadly, markedly influenced participants’ belief-updating: an early and sustained lockdown rendered people’s belief updating less capricious. Masks are clearly an effective public health measure against COVID-19. However, state-mandated mask wearing increased paranoia and induced more erratic behaviour. Remarkably, this was most evident in those states where adherence to mask wearing rules was poor but where rule following is typically more common. This paranoia may explain the lack of compliance with this simple and effective countermeasure. Computational analyses of participant behaviour suggested that people with higher paranoia expected the task to be more unstable, but at the same time predicted more rewards. In a follow-up study we found people who were more paranoid endorsed conspiracies about mask-wearing and potential vaccines – again, mask attitude and conspiratorial beliefs were associated with erratic task behaviour and changed priors. Future public health responses to the pandemic might leverage these observations, mollifying paranoia and increasing adherence by tempering people’s expectations of other’s behaviour, and the environment more broadly, and reinforcing compliance.","Suthaharan, Praveen; Reed, Erin; Leptourgos, Pantelis; Kenney, Joshua; Uddenberg, Stefan; Mathys, Christoph; Litman, Leib; Robinson, Jonathan; Moss, Aaron; Taylor, Jane; Groman, Stephanie; Corlett, Philip",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-145987/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469574/,191

Objective: To investigate the association between contraction of COVID-19 and incidence of acute MS attacks in RRMS patients six months post-infection. Methods: This retrospective cohort study compares the risk of relapse in RRMS patients with (n=56) and without COVID-19 (n=69). Incidence of relapse was recorded for six-month following contraction of COVID-19. Incidence of RRMS exacerbation in patients with COVID-19 was compared to patients without COVID-19 (the independent control group) and the same patients six months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A lower incidence rate of RRMS exacerbation was observed in patients that contracted COVID-19 than in patients who did not contract COVID-19 (incidence rate ratio: 0.275; p=0.026). Self-controlled analysis showed no significant difference in relapse rates before the COVID-19 pandemic and after contracting COVID-19 (p=0.222). The relapse risk was not different between patients who had been hospitalized due to COVID-19 severity and those who had not (p=0.710). Conclusion: COVID-19 contraction may not increase the risk of acute MS attacks shortly following contraction. We hypothesize that COVID-19-associated lymphopenia may partly preclude the autoreactive memory cells from expansion and initiating relapses through a so-called bystander effect of COVID-19 infection.,"Etemadifar, Masoud; Sedaghat, Nahad; Aghababaee, Ali; Kargaran, Parisa K; Maracy, Mohammad Reza; Ganjalikhani-Hakemi, Mazdak; Rayani, Milad; Abhari, Amir Parsa; Khorvash, Reza; Salari, Mehri; Nouri, Hosein",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.102915; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034821001826?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034821001826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799284/,191

Present situation invigorated researchers to look for potent targets, development as well as repurposing of conventional therapeutic drugs. NSP12, a RNA polymerase, is key player in viral RNA replication and, hence, viral multiplication. In our study, we have screened a battery of FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase using in silico molecular docking approach. Identification of potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 (RNA polymerase) were screeened from FDA approved drugs by virtual screening for therapeutic applications in treatment of COVID-19. In this study, virtual screening of 1749 antiviral drugs was executed using AutoDock Vina in PyRx software. Binding affinities between NSP12 and drug molecules were determined using Ligplot(+) and PyMOL was used for visualization of docking between interacting residues. Screening of 1749 compounds resulted in 14 compounds that rendered high binding affinity for NSP12 target molecule. Out of 14 compounds, 5 compounds which include 3a (Paritaprevir), 3d (Glecaprevir), 3h (Velpatasvir), 3j (Remdesivir) and 3l (Ribavirin) had a binding affinity of − 10.2 kcal/mol, −9.6 kcal/mol, − 8.5 kcal/mol, − 8.0 kcal/mol and − 6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, a number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between these 5 compounds and NSP12 active site were observed. Further, 3l (Ribavirin) was docked with 6M71 and molecular dynamic simulation of the complex was also performed to check the stability of the conformation. In silico analysis postulated the potential of conventional antiviral drugs in treatment of COVID-19. However, these finding may be further supported by experimental data for its possible clinical application in present scenario.","Singh, Sanjay Kumar; Upadhyay, Atul Kumar; Reddy, M.

615409,"Design of the pilot, proof of concept REMOTE-COVID trial: remote monitoring use in suspected cases of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)",2021-03-05,"Serologic, point-of-care tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are an important tool in the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of current point-of-care antibody tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on lateral flow assays, but these do not offer quantitative information. To address this, we developed a novel antibody test leveraging hemagglutination, employing a dry card format currently used for typing ABO blood groups. 200 COVID-19 patient and 200 control plasma samples were reconstituted with O-negative RBCs to form whole blood and added to dried viral-antibody fusion protein, followed by a stirring step and a tilting step, 3-minute incubation, and a second tilting step. The sensitivity for the hemagglutination test, Euroimmun IgG ELISA test and RBD-based CoronaChek lateral flow assay was 87.0%, 86.5%, and 84.5%, respectively, using samples obtained from recovered COVID-19 individuals. Testing pre-pandemic samples, the hemagglutination test had a specificity of 95.5%, compared to 97.3% and 98.9% for the ELISA and CoronaChek, respectively. A distribution of agglutination strengths was observed in COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples, with the highest agglutination score (4) exhibiting significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than weak positives (2) (p<0.0001). Strong agglutinations were observed within 1 minute of testing, and this shorter assay time also increased specificity to 98.5%. In conclusion, we developed a novel rapid, point-of-care RBC agglutination test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that can yield semi-quantitative information on neutralizing antibody titer in patients. The five-minute test may find use in determination of serostatus prior to vaccination, post-vaccination surveillance and travel screening.","Kruse, Robert L; Huang, Yuting; Lee, Alyssa; Zhu, Xianming; Shrestha, Ruchee; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Littlefield, Kirsten; Pekosz, Andy; Bloch, Evan M; Tobian, Aaron A R; Wang, Zack Z",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34469185/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01186-21,191
615915,Testing for Novel Coronavirus Antibodies: A Necessary Adjunct,2020-05-22,"Malaria continues to be one of the top infectious agents contributing to morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Annually, Botswana accounts only for a small proportion of cases (<<1%). Despite significantly reduced incidence rate, the country still experiences sporadic outbreaks that hamper the goal of malaria elimination. This review evaluated previous and current biological factors that impact malaria in Botswana, specifically focussing on the vectors, the parasite and the host. This was accomplished via a literature review evaluating these variables in Botswana. Current literature suggests that Anopheles arabiensis is the main malaria vector in the country. Several other potential vectors have been found widely distributed throughout Botswana in high numbers, yet remain largely unstudied with regards to their contribution to the country's malaria burden. We also report the most up to date list of all Anopheles species that have been found in Botswana. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of symptomatic malaria in the country and some drug resistance markers have been documented for this species. Plasmodium vivax has been reported in asymptomatic subjects, even though a large proportion of the Botswana population appears to be Duffy antigen negative. Very little is known about the true distribution of P. vivax and no point of care testing infrastructure for this species exists in Botswana, making it difficult to tailor treatment to address possible recrudescence or relapse. Due to a genetically diverse population with a substantial Khoisan contribution into the Bantu genetic background, several phenotypes that potentially impact prevalence and severity of malaria exist within the country. These include sickle cell trait, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and Duffy negativity. This review highlights the information that currently exists on malaria in Botswana. It also postulates that a comprehensive understanding of these aforementioned biological factors may help to explain malaria persistence in Botswana.","Bango, Zackary Austin; Tawe, Leabaneng; Muthoga, Charles Waithaka; Paganotti, Giacomo Maria",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820302896; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104458; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820302896?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668367/,191
616204,Comorbidities impact on the prognosis of severe acute community-acquired pneumonia,2017-05-26,"Reducing airborne infectious risk is crucial for controlling infectious respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19). The airborne transmissibility of COVID-19 is high so that the common ventilation rate may be insufficient to dilute the airborne pathogens, particularly in public buildings with a relatively large occupancy density. Reducing occupancy can reduce the pathogen load thereby reducing airborne infection risk. However, reduced occupancy deteriorates work productivity due to the lost hours of work. This study proposes an occupancy-aided ventilation strategy for constraining the airborne infection risk and minimizing the loss of work productivity. Firstly, two mechanisms of occupancy schedule (alternative changeovers between normal occupancy and reduced occupancy) for reducing the airborne infection risk and loss of work productivity are revealed based on analyzing features of the indoor concentration profile of exhaled aerosols. Secondly, optimization of the occupancy schedule is developed to maximize the total time length of normal occupancy for the minimum loss in work productivity while satisfying the constraint on airborne infection risk (e.g., with the reproduction number less than one). The airborne infection risk is evaluated with the rebreathed fraction model. Case studies on COVID-19 in a classroom demonstrate that the proposed occupancy-aided ventilation is effective with an earning ratio of 1.67 (the ratio of the improvement in health outcome to the loss in work productivity) and is robust to the variable occupancy loads and occupancy flexibilities.","Zhang, Sheng; Ai, Zhengtao; Lin, Zhang",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33311839/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107506; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320308738?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132320308738,191

So far, sewage testing has been increasingly employed as an alternative surveillance tool for this disease. However, sample site characteristics impact the testing results and should be addressed in the early use stage of this emerging tool. In this study, we implemented the sewage testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus across sampling sites with different sewage system characteristics. We first validated a testing method using “positive” samples from a hospital treating COVID-19 patients. This method was used to test 107 sewage samples collected during the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong (from June 8 to September 29, 2020), covering sampling sites associated with a COVID-19 hospital, public housing estates, and conventional sewage treatment facilities. The highest viral titer of 1975 copy/mL in sewage was observed in a sample collected from the isolation ward of the COVID-19 hospital. Sewage sampling at individual buildings detected the virus 2 days before the first cases were identified. Sequencing of the detected viral fragment confirmed an identical nucleotide sequence to that of the SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human samples. The virus was also detected in sewage treatment facilities, which serve populations of approximately 40,000 to more than one million people.","Xu, Xiaoqing; Zheng, Xiawan; Li, Shuxian; Lam, Nga Sze; Wang, Yulin; Chu, Daniel K.W.; Poon, Leo L.M.; Tun, Hein Min; Peiris, Malik; Deng, Yu; Leung, Gabriel M.; Zhang, Tong",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091338/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721030710?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721030710,191

Respiratory care, early mobilization, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were started in the ad hoc isolation ward of our rehabilitation center. At baseline, muscle function was consistent with intensive care unit-acquired weakness and the patient still needed mechanical ventilation (MV) and oxygen support. During the first week of RRP in isolation, the patient was successfully weaned from MV, the tracheal cannula was removed, and the walking capacity was recovered. At the end of the RRP, continued in a standard department, respiratory muscles strength increased by 7% and muscle function improved as indicated by the quadriceps size enlargement of 13% and the change of the Medical Research Council sum score from 48/60 to 58/60. DISCUSSION: Providing RRP in patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS involves risks for operators and organizational difficulties, especially in rehabilitation centers; nevertheless, its continuity is important to prevent the development of permanent disabilities in previously healthy subjects.

Instructors who participate in the CAPER project also take part in a larger research study that uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to track the instructors’ progress with adapting new teaching methods into their classrooms. When the COVID-19 pandemic caused global disruption to daily life, there were two cohorts of community college instructors participating in the CAPER project. While the immediate impact of the pandemic on community college instructors was not the subject of the original research project, the data from 12 in-depth interviews conducted in the midst of the pandemic revealed rich insights into teacher beliefs and attitudes, adaptation methods, and online learning as an opportunity for change during a global pandemic. This subset of the data also speaks to the importance of the CAPER project for professional development, as community college instructors in the CAPER program used their new skills to integrate active learning techniques in the online learning environment. In this article, we analyze community college instructors’ adaptations to online learning through the lens of conceptual change theory.","Deutschman, Megan C.; Hyson, Audrey Rose; Seithers, Laura C.; Jensen, Murray",J Microbiol Biol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884081/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2613,191

For coronaviruses, these organelles take the form of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) interconnected by a convoluted membrane network. We used electron microscopy to identify murine coronaviruses with mutations in nsp3 and nsp14 that replicated normally while producing only half the normal amount of DMVs under low-temperature growth conditions. Viruses with mutations in nsp5 and nsp16 produced small DMVs but also replicated normally. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed that the most strongly affected of these, the nsp3 mutant, produced more viral RNA than wild-type virus. Competitive growth assays were carried out in both continuous and primary cells to better understand the contribution of DMVs to viral fitness. Surprisingly, several viruses that produced fewer or smaller DMVs showed a higher fitness than wild-type virus at the reduced temperature, suggesting that larger and more numerous DMVs do not necessarily confer a competitive advantage in primary or continuous cell culture. For the first time, this directly demonstrates that replication and organelle formation may be, at least in part, studied separately during infection with positive-stranded RNA virus.","Al-Mulla, Hawaa M.

Severe cases of COVID‐19 can manifest inflammation in organs other than the lung, in tissues not known to support viral replication, and also in a hypercoagulable state. These observations have suggested that SARS‐CoV‐2 can provoke a hyperimmune response in some cases that could lead to secondary organ damage. METHODS: With evidence of elevated levels of interleuking‐6 (IL‐6) in patients with severe COVID‐19, we conducted a small pilot off‐label compassionate care study of the IL‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab patients with severe COVID‐19. RESULTS: Following a single infusion of tocilizumab in patients with severe manifested rapid declines in C‐reactive protein (CRP), D‐Dimer, and gradual rises in lymphocyte and platelet counts.

620460,Drug Allergy Management on the Move.,2021-08-01,"APOBEC3 enzymes are innate immune effectors that introduce mutations into viral genomes. These enzymes are cytidine deaminases which transform cytosine into uracil. They preferentially mutate cytidine preceded by thymidine making the 5’TC motif their favored target. Viruses have evolved different strategies to evade APOBEC3 restriction. Certain viruses actively encode viral proteins antagonizing the APOBEC3s, others passively face the APOBEC3 selection pressure thanks to a depleted genome for APOBEC3-targeted motifs. Hence, the APOBEC3s left on the genome of certain viruses an evolutionary footprint. The aim of our study is the identification of these viruses having a genome shaped by the APOBEC3s. We analyzed the genome of 33,400 human viruses for the depletion of APOBEC3-favored motifs. We demonstrate that the APOBEC3 selection pressure impacts at least 22% of all currently annotated human viral species. The papillomaviridae and polyomaviridae are the most intensively footprinted families; evidencing a selection pressure acting genome-wide and on both strands. Members of the parvoviridae family are differentially targeted in term of both magnitude and localization of the footprint. Interestingly, a massive APOBEC3 footprint is present on both strands of the B19 erythroparvovirus; making this viral genome one of the most cleaned sequences for APOBEC3-favored motifs. We also identified the endemic coronaviridae as significantly footprinted. Interestingly, no such footprint has been detected on the zoonotic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. In addition to viruses that are footprinted genome-wide, certain viruses are footprinted only on very short sections of their genome. That is the case for the gamma-herpesviridae and adenoviridae where the footprint is localized on the lytic origins of replication. A mild footprint can also be detected on the negative strand of the reverse transcribing HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1 and HBV viruses. Together, our data illustrate the extent of the APOBEC3 selection pressure on the human viruses and identify new putatively APOBEC3-targeted viruses.","Poulain, Florian; Lejeune, Noémie; Willemart, Kévin; Gillet, Nicolas A.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797103/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008718,191

Measures to mitigate the risks of transmitting COVID-19 are creating significant challenges to restarting all surgical services safely. We describe the development of a risk stratification tool to prioritise patients for cataract surgery taking account both specific risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as surgical ‘need’. In addition we report the demographics and comorbidities of patients on our waiting list. METHODS: A prospective case review of electronic records was performed. A risk stratification tool was developed based on review of available literature on systemic risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as a surgical ‘need’ score. Scores derived from the tool were used to generate 6 risk profile groups to allow prioritised allocation of surgery. RESULTS: There were 744 patients awaiting cataract surgery of which 66 (8.9 %) patients were ‘shielding’. One hundred and thirty-two (19.5 %) patients had no systemic comorbidities, 218 (32.1 %) patients had 1 relevant systemic comorbidity and 316 (46.5 %) patients had 2 or more comorbidities. Five hundred and ninety patients (88.7 %) did not have significant ocular comorbidities. Using the risk stratification tool, 171 (23 %) patients were allocated in the highest 3 priority stages. Given an aging cohort with associated increase in number of systemic comorbidities, the majority of patients were in the lower priority stages 4 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has created an urgent challenge to deal safely with cataract surgery waiting lists. This has driven the need for a prompt and pragmatic change to the way we assess risks and benefits of a previously regarded as low-risk intervention. This is further complicated by the majority of patients awaiting cataract surgery being elderly with comorbidities and at higher risk of mortality related to COVID-19. We present a pragmatic method of risk stratifying patients on waiting lists, blending an evidence-based objective assessment of risk and patient need combined with an element of shared decision-making. This has facilitated safe and successful restarting of our cataract service.","Cheng, Kelvin KW; Anderson, Martin J; Velissaris, Stavros; Moreton, Robert; Al-Mansour, Ahmed; Sanders, Roshini; Sutherland, Shona; Wilson, Peter; Blaikie, Andrew",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06165-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596884/,191

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre national audit over 12 weeks from 6 April 2020. SETTING: UK secondary care ENT departments. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with acute tonsillitis or PTA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Re‐presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS: 83 centres submitted 765 tonsillitis and 416 PTA cases. 54.4% (n = 410) of tonsillitis and 45.3% (187/413) of PTAs were discharged from ED. 9.6% (39/408) of tonsillitis and 10.3% (19/184) of PTA discharges re‐presented within 10 days, compared to 9.7% (33/341) and 10.6% (24/224) for those admitted from ED. The subsequent admission rate of those initially discharged from ED was 4.7% for tonsillitis and 3.3% for PTAs. IV steroids and antibiotics increased the percentage of patients able to swallow from 35.8% to 72.5% for tonsillitis (n = 270/754 and 441/608) and from 22.3% to 71.0% for PTA (n = 92/413 and 265/373). 77.2% of PTAs underwent drainage (n = 319/413), with no significant difference in re‐presentations in those drained vs not‐drained (10.6% vs 9.5%, n = 15/142 vs 4/42, P = .846). Univariable logistic regression showed no significant predictors of re‐presentation within 10 days.

The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence and diversity of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in urban surface water and in brown rats trapped in the center of Vienna, Austria, using molecular methods, and to subsequently identify their source and potential transmission pathways. Out of 15 water samples taken from a side arm of the River Danube, Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts were detected in 60% and 73% of them, with concentrations ranging between 0.3–4 oocysts/L and 0.6–96 cysts/L, respectively. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were identified in 13 and 16 out of 50 rats, respectively. Eimeria, a parasite of high veterinary importance, was also identified in seven rats. Parasite co-ocurrence was detected in nine rats. Rat-associated genotypes did not match those found in water, but matched Giardia previously isolated from patients with diarrhea in Austria, bringing up a potential role of rats as sources or reservoirs of zoonotic pathogenic Giardia.

During January 21-July 25, 2020, in response to official requests for assistance with COVID-19 emergency public health response activities, CDC deployed 208 teams to assist 55 state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments. CDC deployment data were analyzed to summarize activities by deployed CDC teams in assisting state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to identify and implement measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 transmission (1). Deployed teams assisted with the investigation of transmission in high-risk congregate settings, such as long-term care facilities (53 deployments; 26% of total), food processing facilities (24; 12%), correctional facilities (12; 6%), and settings that provide services to persons experiencing homelessness (10; 5%). Among the 208 deployed teams, 178 (85%) provided assistance to state health departments, 12 (6%) to tribal health departments, 10 (5%) to local health departments, and eight (4%) to territorial health departments. CDC collaborations with health departments have strengthened local capacity and provided outbreak response support. Collaborations focused attention on health equity issues among disproportionately affected populations (e.g., racial and ethnic minority populations, essential frontline workers, and persons experiencing homelessness) and through a place-based focus (e.g., persons living in rural or frontier areas). These collaborations also facilitated enhanced characterization of COVID-19 epidemiology, directly contributing to CDC data-informed guidance, including guidance for serial testing as a containment strategy in high-risk congregate settings, targeted interventions and prevention efforts among workers at food processing facilities, and social distancing.","Dirlikov, Emilio; Fechter-Leggett, Ethan; Thorne, Stacy L.; Worrell, Caitlin M.; Smith-Grant, Jennifer C.; Chang, Jonathan; Oster, Alexandra M.; Bjork, Adam; Young, Stanley; Perez, Alvina U.; Aden, Tricia; Anderson, Mark; Farrall, Susan; Jones-Wormley, Jaime; Walters, Katherine Hendricks; LeBlanc, Tanya T.; Kone, Rebecca Greco; Hunter, David; Cooley, Laura A.; Krishnasamy, Vikram; Fuld, Jennifer; Luna-Pinto, Carolina; Williams, Tanya; O’Connor, Ann; Nett, Randall J.; Villanueva, Julie; Oussayef, Nadia L.; Walke, Henry T.; Shugart, Jill M.; Honein, Margaret A.; Rose, Dale A.; Bang, Noelle Anderson, CDC; David; Barham, Terrika; Benton, Shaliondel; Blain, Amy; Boyd, Mary; Bradley, Bruce; Bright, Shakia; Bruce, Michael; Cabada, Victor; Castro, Georgina; Cherry-Brown, Dena; Coleman, Erik; Cowins, Janet; Craig, Pamela; Daniel, Johnni; Davis, Darlene; De, Stacy; Drexler, Naomi; Dull, Jessica; Farr, Sherry; Finley, Phillip; Finn, Karrie; Freeman, Denise; Fukayama, Corinne; Gaarenstroom, Nicole; Ghertner, Micha; Glover, Maleeka; Grant, Gail; Griffing, Sean; Harris, DeMoncheri; Harris, Diane; Hayes, Nikki; Hee, Seung; Henry, Corey; Henry, Donna; Hines, Janine; Hudson, Amy; Iqbal, Kashif; Isenberg, Jennifer; Jenkins, Mary; Kabore, Charlotte; Karpathy, Sandor; Kennebrew, Daphne; Kun, Karen; Lash, Ryan; Lavinghouze, Rene; Leavitt, Rachel; Lee, Sooji; Leidman, Eva; Leon, Oscar; Leonard, Sarah; Lowry, Garry; Lundeen, Elizabeth; Lynch, Mechele; Mabry, Michon; Manning, Jana; McCall, Kelsey; McGruder, Henraya; Merkle, Sarah; Meyer, Jenna; Moonan, Patrick; Moore, Jazmyn; Norwood, Pamelian; Nu, Seseni; Oeltmann, John; Palipudi, Krishna; Parise, Monica; Parry, Ritchard; Patta, Abrienne; Pendergraft, Chandra; Pettrone, Kristen; Pfeifer, Heidi; Powell, Tracy; Preacely, Nykiconia; Qi, Yanping; Ricaldi, Jessica; Richardson-Moore, Regina; Roberson, LaShonda; Rodriguez, Sergio; Rodriguez, Tomas; Ruiz, Andrew; Saydah, Sharon; Senesie, Abdoulie; Sexton, Connie; Shanklin, Shari; Sieradzki, Christopher; Simpson, Amberia; Simpson, De’Lisa; Snodgrass, Stephanie; Speissegger, Lisa; Spieckerman, Alisa; Stollar, Danielle; Stone, Nimalie; Sunshine, Brittany; Swann, Philana; Uddin, Rezwana; Valencia, Diana; Walker, Chastity; Washington, Malaika; Welch, Seh; Williams, Shawna; Woodruff, Rebecca; Woodson, Evonne; Yatabe, Graydon; Yusuf, Hussain",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6939a3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001876/,191

More information about risk factors for mortality of critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain to be evaluated. METHODS: We included adult patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were critically ill and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 20, 2020. Data were collected and compared between patients who died and improved. Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors for death of SARS-CoV-2-infected critically ill patients. RESULTS: A total of 160 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, of which 146 patients with appeared outcomes were included into the final analysis. The random blood glucose, serum sodium and effective plasma osmolarity were higher in deceased patients, especially in patients with diabetes. There were 7 patients with diabetes with hyperosmolar status and all of them were deceased. Multivariable regression revealed that older age (odds ratio 4.28, 95% CI 1.01–18.20; p = 0.049), higher C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.01, 1.00–1.03; p = 0.024), higher interleukin-6 (odds ratio 1.01, 1.00–1.03; p = 0.0323), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (odds ratio 1.10, 1.01–1.20; p = 0.032) at admission were associated with increased odds of death.

We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6-7 incipient phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple regions, in spite of their low frequency.

To date, there is still no clinically effective treatment for this comorbidity, and drug repositioning might be a good strategy considering the established clinical safety profile. In this context, since COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract, a promising approach would be the pulmonary drug delivery. OBJECTIVE: Identify repurposing drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the data of ongoing clinical trials and in silico studies and also assess their potential to be applied in formulations for pulmonary administration. METHOD: A narrative literature review was conducted between June and July 2020, by extracting the results from Clinical Trials, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct databases. RESULTS: By crossing the results obtained from diverse sources, 21 common drugs were found, from which only 4 drugs presented studies of pulmonary release formulations, demonstrating the need for greater investment and incentive in this field. CONCLUSION: Even though the lung is a target that facilitates viral infection and replication, formulations for pulmonary delivery of suitable drugs are still lacking for COVID-19 treatment. However, it is indisputable that the pandemic constitutes a concrete demand, with a profound impact on public health, and that, with the appropriate investments, it will give the pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to reinforce the pulmonary delivery field.","Sarcinelli, Michelle Alvares; Martins da Silva, Thalita; Artico Silva, Andressa Daniele; Ferreira de Carvalho Patricio, Beatriz; Mendes Paiva, Flávia Costa; Santos de Lima, Raissa; Leal da Silva, Manuela; Antunes Rocha, Helvécio Vinícius",J Drug Deliv Sci Technol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2021.102430; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1773224721001106?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649708/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1773224721001106,191
625937,The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in COVID-19 induced lung injury,2020-11-10,"While vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2 are being approved, the number of available doses is limited as it may take months until the production of vaccines can meet the actual demand. The majority of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines elicits strong immune responses when administered as prime-boost regimens. Since the immunological response to the first (“prime”) injection may provide already a substantial reduction in infectiousness and protection against severe disease, it may be more effective—under certain conditions—to vaccinate as many people as possible with only one shot, instead of administering a person a second (“boost”) shot. Such a strategic vaccination campaign may help to more effectively slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce hospitalizations, and reduce fatalities. Yet, the conditions which make single-dose vaccination favorable over prime-boost administrations are not well understood. Here, we formulate a model that helps explore these decisive conditions as a function of the various time scales and epidemiological mechanisms at work. We study how these conditions arise from disease prevalence, vaccination rates, basic reproduction number, prime and prime-boost efficacies, prime-boost intervals, and waning rates. By combining epidemiological modeling, random sampling techniques, and decision tree learning, we find that prime-first vaccination is robustly favored over prime-boost vaccination campaigns, even for high vaccination rates, high disease prevalence, and a relatively low single-dose efficacy.","Böttcher, Lucas; Nagler, Jan",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758886/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252962; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21252962v1?rss=1,191
626012,Persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR positivity in COVID‐19 convalescent plasma donors,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Moral distress is a state in which a clinician cannot act in accordance with their ethical beliefs because of external constraints. Physician trainees, who work within rigid hierarchies and who lack clinical experience, are particularly vulnerable to moral distress. We examined the dynamics of physician trainee moral distress in end-of-life care by comparing experiences in two different national cultures and healthcare systems. OBJECTIVE: We investigated cultural factors in the US and the UK that may produce moral distress within their respective healthcare systems, as well as how these factors shape experiences of moral distress among physician trainees. DESIGN: Semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews about experiences of end-of-life care and moral distress. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen internal medicine residents in the US and fourteen junior doctors in the UK. APPROACH: The work was analyzed using thematic analysis. KEY RESULTS: Some drivers of moral distress were similar among US and UK trainees, including delivery of potentially inappropriate treatments, a poorly defined care trajectory, and involvement of multiple teams creating different care expectations. For UK trainees, healthcare team hierarchy was common, whereas for US trainees, pressure from families, a lack of guidelines for withholding inappropriate treatments, and distress around physically harming patients were frequently cited. US trainees described how patient autonomy and a fear of lawsuits contributed to moral distress, whereas UK trainees described how societal expectations around resource allocation mitigated it. CONCLUSION: This research highlights how the differing experiences of moral distress among US and UK physician trainees are influenced by their countries’ healthcare cultures. This research illustrates how experiences of moral distress reflect the broader culture in which it occurs and suggests how trainees may be particularly vulnerable to it. Clinicians and healthcare leaders in both countries can learn from each other about policies and practices that might decrease the moral distress trainees experience.","Rosenwohl-Mack, Sarah; Dohan, Daniel; Matthews, Thea; Batten, Jason Neil; Dzeng, Elizabeth",J Gen Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111237/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06314-y,191

627532,External Environmental Pollution as a Risk Factor for Asthma,2021-01-12,"Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.","Sims, Natalie; Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara",Environ Int,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283358/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412020304542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020304542?v=s5,191

Although recommended for the treatment of viral pneumonia, steroid therapy appears to be a double‐edged sword, predisposing patients to secondary bacterial and invasive fungal infections (IFIs) whereby impacting morbidity and mortality. Mucormycosis is a fungal emergency with a highly aggressive tendency for contiguous spread, associated with a poor prognosis if not promptly diagnosed and managed. Classically, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) and other immunosuppressive conditions including corticosteroid therapy are known risk factors for mucormycosis. Upon the background lung pathology, immune dysfunction and corticosteroid therapy, patients with severe viral pneumonia are likely to develop IFIs like aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Notably, the combination of steroid therapy and DM can augment immunosuppression and hyperglycaemia, increasing the risk of mucormycosis in a susceptible individual. Here, we report a case of sinonasal mucormycosis in a 44‐year‐old woman with hyperglycaemia secondary to poorly controlled diabetes following dexamethasone therapy on a background of influenza pneumonia and review 15 available literatures on reported cases of influenza and COVID‐19 associated mucormycosis.","Ahmadikia, Kazem; Hashemi, Seyed Jamal; Khodavaisy, Sadegh; Getso, Muhammad Ibrahim; Alijani, Neda; Badali, Hamid; Mirhendi, Hossein; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Tabari, Azin; Mohammadi Ardehali, Mojtaba; Kord, Mohammad; Roilides, Emmanuel; Rezaie, Sassan",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590551/,191

It is thus critical to optimize emergency response planning from a broad, integrated perspective. We developed a mathematical model incorporating climate-driven variation in community transmissions and movement-modulated spatial diffusions of COVID-19 into various intervention scenarios. We find that an intensive 8-wk intervention targeting the reduction of local transmissibility and international travel is efficient and effective. Practically, we suggest a tiered implementation of this strategy where interventions are first implemented at locations in what we call the Global Intervention Hub, followed by timely interventions in secondary high-risk locations. We argue that thinking globally, categorizing locations in a hub-and-spoke intervention network, and acting locally, applying interventions at high-risk areas, is a functional strategy to avert the tremendous burden that would otherwise be placed on public health and society.","Li, Ruiyun; Chen, Bin; Zhang, Tao; Ren, Zhehao; Song, Yimeng; Xiao, Yixiong; Hou, Lin; Cai, Jun; Xu, Bo; Li, Miao; Chan, Karen Kie Yan; Tu, Ying; Yang, Mu; Yang, Jing; Liu, Zhaoyang; Shen, Chong; Wang, Che; Xu, Lei; Liu, Qiyong; Bao, Shuming; Zhang, Jianqin; Bi, Yuhai; Bai, Yuqi; Deng, Ke; Zhang, Wusheng; Huang, Wenyu; Whittington, Jason D.; Stenseth, Nils Chr.; Guan, Dabo; Gong, Peng; Xu, Bing",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012002117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989148/,191

Also, the cardiovascular system, especially the heart, is affected by COVID-19. So we aimed to evaluate the angiographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients presented by ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). RESULTS: Our retrospective study showed that STEMI patients with COVID-19 had elevated inflammatory markers with mean of their CRP (89.69 ± 30.42 mg/dl) and increased laboratory parameters of thrombosis with mean D-dimer (660.15 ± 360.11 ng/ml). In 69.2% of patients, STEMI was the first clinical presentation and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 developed during the hospital stay; about one third of patients had a non-obstructive CAD, while patients with total occlusion had a high thrombus burden. CONCLUSION: STEMI may be the initial presentation of COVID-19. A non-obstructive CAD was found in about one third of patients; on the other hand, in patients who had a total occlusion of their culprit artery, the thrombus burden was high. Identification of the underlying mechanism responsible for the high thrombus burden in these patients is important as it may result in changes in their primary management strategy, either primary PCI, fibrinolytic therapy, or a pharmaco-invasive strategy. Furthermore, adjunctive anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy may need to be revised.","Alaarag, Ahmed; Hassan, Timoor; Samir, Sameh; Naseem, Mohamed",Egypt Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33025310/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-020-00103-y,191

The most severely affected patients are older men, individuals of black and Asian minority ethnicity and those with comorbidities. COVID-19 is also associated with an increased risk of hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism. The overwhelming majority of patients admitted to hospital have respiratory failure and while most are managed on general wards, a sizeable proportion require intensive care support. The long-term complications of COVID-19 pneumonia are starting to emerge but data from previous coronavirus outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) suggest that some patients will experience long-term respiratory complications of the infection. With the pattern of thoracic imaging abnormalities and growing clinical experience, it is envisaged that interstitial lung disease and pulmonary vascular disease are likely to be the most important respiratory complications. There is a need for a unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 balancing the delivery of high-quality clinical care with stretched National Health Service (NHS) resources. In this guidance document, we provide a suggested structure for the respiratory follow-up of patients with clinicoradiological confirmation of COVID-19 pneumonia. We define two separate algorithms integrating disease severity, likelihood of long-term respiratory complications and functional capacity on discharge. To mitigate NHS pressures, virtual solutions have been embedded within the pathway as has safety netting of patients whose clinical trajectory deviates from the pathway.

632791,Community-acquired pneumonia in children,2013-10-31,"BACKGROUND: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection can activate NF-κB pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial cells and result in severe inflammation. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are not translated into proteins and play an important role in many biological and pathological processes such as inflammation, viral infection, and mitochondrial damage. However, whether ncRNAs participate in TGEV-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells is largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to analyze the profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs in Mock- and TGEV-infected intestinal porcine epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell line. A total of 523 mRNAs, 65 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 123 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were differentially expressed. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed differentially expressed mRNAs were linked to inflammation-related pathways, including NF-κB, Toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, Jak-STAT, TNF, and RIG-I-like receptor pathways. The interactions among mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA were analyzed. The data showed that ssc_circ_009380 and miR-22 might have interaction relationship. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-22 directly bound to ssc_circ_009380. We also observed that overexpression of miR-22 led to a reduction of p-IκB-α and accumulation of p65 in nucleus in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-22 had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing of ssc_circ_009380 inhibited accumulation of p65 in nucleus and phosphorylation of IκB-α. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs and ncRNAs were primarily enriched in inflammation-related pathways and ssc_circ_009380 promoted activation of NF-κB pathway by binding miR-22 during TGEV-induced inflammation.

Methods A retrospective research design was used to compare the clinical characteristics of tinnitus between the patients in 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the matching period in 2019. While anxiety was quantified using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the test of minimum masking level (MML). The assessments were repeated after the sound therapy plus educational counselling (STEC) and compared with EC alone therapy. Results A large increase in anxiety was evident in 2020 in both case rate and SAS. The treatment of both methods was less effective in 2020. SAS, THI and MML were all deteriorated after the EC alone treatment in 2020, while an improvement was seen in 2019. This suggests that EC alone could not counteract the stress by COVID-19 at all, and the stress, if not managed well, can significantly increase the severity of tinnitus and associated anxiety. Conclusions By using the EC subgroup in virtual control, we conclude that anxiety can serve as a promoting factor to tinnitus.

This study investigated the patterns of delaying surgery for breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea and evaluated factors that may have affected the decision to delay surgery. Methods: From February 18 to April 18, 2020, which was the critical period for COVID-19 in South Korea, patients with breast cancer who were scheduled for surgery were evaluated in terms of their decision in delaying the procedure. The patients were divided into two groups: delaying and non-delaying surgery groups. The association between personal and clinicopathological factors and delaying surgery was evaluated. Results: In patients belonging to the delaying surgery group, the mean delay period was 15.9 (standard deviation [SD], ±10.9) days. Patients in the non-delaying surgery group were relatively younger (p = 0.003), single (p = 0.038), had planned mastectomy (p = 0.041), received needle biopsy for diagnosis (p = 0.021), and had a higher clinical N stage (p = 0.049) and multifocal lesions of breast cancer (p = 0.020). However, there were no significant differences in terms of the pathological T and N stages between the two groups. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was no occurrence of nosocomial infection in the non-delaying surgery group and no statistical difference in pathological stage between the delaying and non-delaying surgery groups. Although patients in the delaying surgery group tended to be relatively older and married and had planned small-scale surgery with a good prognosis of breast cancer, the prognosis did not appear to have changed whether delaying or proceeding with surgery for breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Lee, Jeeyeon; Jung, Jin Hyang; Kim, Wan Wook; Park, Chan Sub; Park, Ho Yong",Front Surg,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2020.576196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134309/,191
638837,Immunological Map in COVID-19,2021-05-12,"Morbidity and mortality from bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and associated losses in performance and carcass merit continue to plague the beef cattle industry. Several viral/bacterial agents are responsible for BRD, and interactions occur among the agents. Viral agents often predispose animals to bacterial infections, and Mannheimia haemolytica is the most frequently isolated organism in cattle with BRD. Laboratory tests are available to characterize organisms causing BRD using easily obtained nasal swab samples. Testing for persistent infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus can be done by a 2-stage technique using PCR and immunohistochemistry. Preconditioning programs that include preweaning viral vaccination programs along with castration could have a significant influence on decreasing BRD in the cattle feeding industry. Metaphylactic antibiotic programs continue to be effective; however, antibiotic resistance is a public concern, and additional management options (e.g., direct-fed microbials or other compounds with antimicrobial properties) deserve attention. Diets with an increased energy concentration achieved by decreasing the dietary roughage concentration may slightly increase the rate of BRD morbidity; however, these diets also increase ADG, DMI, and G:F compared with lower-energy, greater-roughage diets. The extent to which performance and BRD morbidity are affected by dietary protein concentration needs further study, but low and high protein concentrations should probably be avoided. Several trace minerals (e.g., Cu, Se, and Zn) affect immune function, but the effects of supplementation on performance and immune function in model challenge systems and in field studies are equivocal. Adding vitamin E to receiving diets at pharmacological levels (e.g., >1,000 IU·animal(−1)·day(−1)) seems beneficial for decreasing BRD morbidity, but it has little effect on performance. Given the limited ability to consistently modify immune function and BRD morbidity through dietary manipulations, we recommend that the diets for newly received cattle be formulated to adjust nutrient concentrations for low feed intake and to provide optimal performance during the receiving period.","Duff, G.

METHODS: In this case series, we report three patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis from three hospitals in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak in China. RESULT: Patient 1 was a 53-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. Though receiving intensive support, he died of irreversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 48 days after the onset of the illness. Patient 2 was a 75-year-old woman with a history of schistosomiasis-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. Her family members requested that invasive rescue measures not be undertaken, and she died of acute respiratory distress syndrome 40 days after presenting with COVID-19 infection. Patient 3 was an 87-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and esophageal variceal hemorrhage. He was discharged from the hospital 29 days after illness onset.

This was a prospective year-round viral surveillance study in children <2 years of age admitted with acute respiratory symptoms and/or fever from March 2010 to September 2012 and enrolled from a government-run hospital, Al-Bashir in Amman, Jordan. Clinical and demographic data, including antibiotic use, were collected. Combined nasal/throat swabs were collected, aliquoted, and frozen at −80°C. Specimen aliquots were shipped to Vanderbilt University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and tested by rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV. Of the 2433 subjects enrolled from 16 March 2010 to 10 September 2012, 2427 subjects had viral testing and clinical data. Of 1898 specimens prospectively tested for other viruses between 16 March 2010 and 18 March 2012, 474 samples did not have other common respiratory viruses detected. These samples were tested at CDC for MERS-CoV and all were negative by rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV. Of the remaining 531 samples, collected from 19 March 2012 to 10 September 2012 and tested at Vanderbilt, none were positive for MERS-CoV. Our negative findings from a large sample of young Jordanian children hospitalized with fever and/or respiratory symptoms suggest that MERS-CoV was not widely circulating in Amman, Jordan, during the 30-month period of prospective, active surveillance occurring before and after the first documented MERS-CoV outbreak in the Middle East region.","Khuri-Bulos, N.; Payne, D.

The dynamic trafficking of positive strand RNA virus nucleocapsid proteins and PRRSV N protein in particular between the cytoplasm and nucleolus is unknown. In this study live imaging of permissive and non-permissive cell lines, in conjunction with photo-bleaching (FRAP and FLIP), was used to investigate the trafficking of fluorescent labeled (EGFP) PRRSV-N protein. The data indicated that EGFP-PRRSV-N protein was not permanently sequestered to the nucleolus and had equivalent mobility to cellular nucleolar proteins. Further the nuclear import of N protein appeared to occur faster than nuclear export, which may account for the observed relative distribution of N protein between the cytoplasm and the nucleolus.","You, Jae-Hwan; Howell, Gareth; Pattnaik, Asit K.; Osorio, Fernando A.; Hiscox, Julian A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550142/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208002687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.04.037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208002687,191

The University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy was approached to collaborate with DPH to create a certification program to meet the needs of this order. Objectives To utilize a unique, pharmacist-led practice model to increase the number of competent vaccinators to administer the COVID-19 vaccine, and to reduce vaccine hesitancy with timely vaccine information. Practice description A didactic and in-person training program was developed, with an evaluation completed by a vaccination-certified pharmacist. Additionally, faculty members, staff and students developed short videos answering questions about COVID-19 vaccines. Practice innovation We are aware of no other such programs utilizing pharmacists and pharmacy students as primary creators of training and certification of health care professionals to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. Evaluation Methods Success was gauged by the rapid increase in number of eligible health care professionals who completed the developed training program and became certified as COVID-19 vaccinators. When addressing vaccine hesitancy, success was defined by the number of videos created and number of views and likes the videos received. Results As of April 30, 2021, 1834 health care professionals registered to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 1195 (65%) participants completed the online training developed by pharmacists, and 872 participants (48%) attended pharmacist-led in-person competencies. As of July 29, 2021, efforts resulted in 14,972 views and 257 “Likes” for 79 videos promoted through social media platforms. Conclusion A partnership between the Connecticut DPH and the UConn School of Pharmacy allowed the rapid increase in capacity to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to citizens of Connecticut.

644505,SARS‐CoV‐2 replicating in nonprimate mammalian cells probably have critical advantages for COVID‐19 vaccines due to anti‐Gal antibodies: A minireview and proposals,2020-08-02,"Nigeria agriculture, food security and dietary intake have not been exempted from the disruptions in countless sectors around the world due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The country first experienced the outbreak on February 27, 2020, and the experience since then has shown negative effects not only on the socioeconomic conditions but also on agriculture, food security and dietary intake. Long term in-depth analysis of the effects of this pandemic on food security and dietary intake using quantitative data is still very difficult due to paucity of data and the great level of the improbability of the trajectory of the spread of the Virus. This study is a rapid assessment of the short and long-term potential effects of the disease. It relied on a review of situation reports especially by the Nigeria Centre of Disease Control and other reports around the world on COVID-19, personal observations, and public opinion via mobile telephone survey of Lagos and Oyo States, Nigeria. Findings show that food demand and supply shocks caused by COVID-19 outbreak affect agriculture, food and dietary intake negatively through COVID-19 policies. It leads to a reduction in household income coupled with hike in food prices. Owing to the Nigeria’s crude farming practice, there was a scarcity of hired labour required for production process during 2020 farming season. This implies a high likelihood of low output and further surge in food prices in the future. Food access was also compromised with the accumulation of unsold fresh produce by the smallholder farmers and the low salary earners during movement restrictions and of loss income as a result of international border closure. Food and dietary intake is affected as people are shifting diets to more affordable and low quality foods, while food stability is not guaranteed due to market insecurity, prompting an extraordinary level of indecision. The study concludes that the shock of COVID-19 is not only a demand management problem but a multidimensional crisis requiring monetary, fiscal, and health policy responses with global collaboration and cooperation.","Obayelu, Abiodun Elijah; Obayelu, Oluwakemi Adeola; Bolarinwa, Kamilu Kolade; Oyeyinka, Richard Akinwumi",Food Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758778/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41055-021-00085-w,191

This study captured the experiences of therapists who have worked with ethnic minority females to improve outcomes for this group. Twelve therapists in the United Kingdom, London were recruited for semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Shame was cited as a barrier to accessing help. This influenced therapeutic work such as not challenging shame or linking this to a negative interpretation of parents. Emotional and interpersonal factors were thought to be more common risk factors for the ED. The minimising of weight and shape concern and non-fat-phobic anorexia was thought to lead to a complex and delayed route to accessing ED services. Therapists felt restricted by service management who they felt required them to deliver a narrow range of therapies that had not necessarily demonstrated therapeutic outcomes in ethnic minority females. Nevertheless, therapists reported using curiosity to guide their cultural adaptations when feeling uncertain. When working with ethnic minority females, therapists face challenges from the therapeutic and diagnostic framework that services are aligned to.

Assessment of coagulation and other markers could be useful to understand their coagulopathy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of inflammatory and coagulation parameters, including prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TATs), fibrin monomers, and D-dimer, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We compared the markers in patients with thrombosis, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and poor outcome. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients, 9 (11%) experienced an acute thrombotic event (4 with pulmonary embolism, 3 with venous thrombosis, and 2 with stroke). PF1.2 was elevated in 32 (39%) patients, TATs in 54 (67%), fibrin monomers in 49 (60%), and D-dimer in 76 (94%). Statistically significant elevation in PF1.2 and TATs was seen in patients admitted to the ICU, while D-dimer and fibrin monomers were significantly elevated in patients with poor outcomes. The presence of multiple abnormal coagulation parameters was associated with ICU admission. Other parameters with statistically significant results included abnormal WBC counts and elevated C-reactive protein, which were associated with ICU admission and poor outcomes.

646179,Adjusting Coronavirus Prevalence Estimates for Laboratory Test Kit Error,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND: In mammals, CEACAM1 and closely related members represent paired receptors with similar extracellular ligand-binding regions and cytoplasmic domains with opposing functions. Human CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 which have inhibitory ITIM/ITSM and activating ITAM-like motifs, respectively, in their cytoplasmic regions are such paired receptors. Various bacterial pathogens bind to CEACAM1 on epithelial and immune cells facilitating both entry into the host and down-regulation of the immune response whereas interaction with granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 leads to their uptake and destruction. It is unclear whether paired CEACAM receptors also exist in other vertebrate clades. RESULTS: We identified more than 80 ceacam genes in Xenopus tropicalis and X. laevis. They consist of two subgroups containing one or two putative paired receptor pairs each. Analysis of genomic sequences of paired receptors provide evidence that their highly similar ligand binding domains were adjusted by recent gene conversion events. In contrast, selection for diversification is observed among inhibitory receptor orthologs of the two frogs which split some 60 million years ago. The allotetraploid X. laevis arose later by hybridization of two closely related species. Interestingly, despite the conservation of the genomic landscape surrounding the homeologous ceacam loci only one locus resembles the one found in X. tropicalis. From the second X. laevis locus more than 80 % of the ceacam genes were lost including 5 of the 6 paired receptor genes. This suggests that once the gene for one of the paired receptors is lost the remaining gene cluster degrades rapidly probably due to lack of selection pressure exerted by pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of paired receptors and selection for diversification suggests that also in amphibians CEACAM1-related inhibitory proteins are or were used as pathogen receptors.

Methods: This is cross-sectional survey data obtained from IMGs on temporary work visas pertaining to their role in healthcare, impact of visa-related restrictions on their professional and personal lives was sent to the participants. Results: A total of 2630 IMGs responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (1493, 56.8%) were physicians in active practice, with Internal Medicine (1684, 65.7%) being the predominant specialty encountered. 64.1% were practicing in Medically Underserved Areas (MUA) or Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA), with 45.6% practicing in a rural area. Nearly 89% of respondents had been involved with direct care of COVID-19 patients, with 63.7% assuming administrative responsibilities for COVID-19 preparedness. 261 physicians (11.5%) were subject to quarantine, while 28 (1.2%) reported a confirmed COVID-19 infection. 93% physicians expressed inability to serve in COVID-19 surge areas due to visa-related restrictions, while 57% had been approached by recruiters due to staffing shortages. 72% physicians reported that their families would be at risk for deportation in case of their disability or death. Most respondents (98.8%) felt that permanent resident status would help alleviate the above concerns. Conclusion: A significant proportion of the US physician workforce is adversely impacted by work-based visa restrictions and processing backlog.

The nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vast reach of the virus, leave many unknows for the repercussions on behavioral health, yet existing research suggests that behavioral health concerns should take a primary role in response to the pandemic. We propose a 4-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most extreme reactions. While we can expect symptoms to remit overtime, many will also have longer-term or more severe concerns. Behavioral health interventions will likely need to change overtime and different types of interventions should be considered for different target groups, such as for those who recover from COVID-19, health-care professionals, and essential personnel; and the general public either due to loss of loved ones or significant life disruption.

649080,Ultra-Sensitive High-Resolution Profiling of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies for Detecting Early Seroconversion in COVID-19 Patients,2020-05-02,"The pestilential pathogen SARS-CoV-2 has led to a seemingly ceaseless pandemic of COVID-19. The healthcare sector is under a tremendous burden, thus necessitating the prognosis of COVID-19 severity. This in-depth study of plasma proteome alteration provides insights into the host physiological response towards the infection and also reveals the potential prognostic markers of the disease. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we performed deep plasma proteome analysis in a cohort of 71 patients (20 COVID-19 negative, 18 COVID-19 non-severe, and 33 severe) to understand the disease dynamics. Of the 1200 proteins detected in the patient plasma, 38 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed between non-severe and severe groups. The altered plasma proteome revealed significant dysregulation in the pathways related to peptidase activity, regulated exocytosis, blood coagulation, complement activation, leukocyte activation involved in immune response, and response to glucocorticoid biological processes in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we employed supervised machine learning (ML) approaches using a linear support vector machine model to identify the classifiers of patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19. The model used a selected panel of 20 proteins and classified the samples based on the severity with a classification accuracy of 0.84. Putative biomarkers such as angiotensinogen and SERPING1 and ML-derived classifiers including the apolipoprotein B, SERPINA3, and fibrinogen gamma chain were validated by targeted mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays. We also employed an in silico screening approach against the identified target proteins for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. We shortlisted two FDA-approved drugs, namely, selinexor and ponatinib, which showed the potential of being repurposed for COVID-19 therapeutics. Overall, this is the first most comprehensive plasma proteome investigation of COVID-19 patients from the Indian population, and provides a set of potential biomarkers for the disease severity progression and targets for therapeutic interventions.","Suvarna, Kruthi; Biswas, Deeptarup; Pai, Medha Gayathri J.; Acharjee, Arup; Bankar, Renuka; Palanivel, Viswanthram; Salkar, Akanksha; Verma, Ayushi; Mukherjee, Amrita; Choudhury, Manisha; Ghantasala, Saicharan; Ghosh, Susmita; Singh, Avinash; Banerjee, Arghya; Badaya, Apoorva; Bihani, Surbhi; Loya, Gaurish; Mantri, Krishi; Burli, Ananya; Roy, Jyotirmoy; Srivastava, Alisha; Agrawal, Sachee; Shrivastav, Om; Shastri, Jayanthi; Srivastava, Sanjeeva",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995121/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.652799,191

652870,An international perspective on hospitalized patients with viral community-acquired pneumonia,2018-11-04,"Background Aerosolization of respiratory droplets is considered the main route of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, reducing the viral load of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shed via respiratory droplets is potentially an ideal strategy to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The in vitro virucidal activity of intranasal Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) has been demonstrated recently to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titres. This study evaluated the virucidal activity of the aqueous solution of Iodine-V (a clathrate complex formed by elemental iodine and fulvic acid) as in Essential Iodine Drops (EID) with 200 μg elemental iodine/ml content against SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain whether it is a better alternative to PVP-I. Methods SARS-CoV-2 (USAWA1/2020 strain) virus stock was prepared by infecting Vero 76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587) until cytopathic effect (CPE). The virucidal activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in three dilutions (1:1; 2:1 and 3:1) in triplicates by incubating at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) for either 60 or 90 seconds. The surviving viruses from each sample were quantified by a standard end-point dilution assay. Results EID (200 μg iodine/ml) after exposure for 60 and 90 seconds was compared to controls. In both cases, the viral titre was reduced by 99% (LRV 2.0). The 1:1 dilution of EID with virus reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus from 31,623 cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCCID50) to 316 CCID50 within 90 seconds. Conclusion Substantial reductions in LRV by Iodine-V in EID confirmed the activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, demonstrating that Iodine-V in EID is effective at inactivating the virus in vitro and therefore suggesting its potential application intranasally to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.","Zoltán, Köntös",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.07.370726,191

653900,A primer on stable parameter estimation and forecasting in epidemiology by a problem-oriented regularized least squares algorithm,2017-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury and inflammation on cardiac MRI in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been described in recent publications. Concurrently, a chronic COVID-19 syndrome (CCS) after COVID-19 infection has been observed manifesting with symptoms like fatigue and exertional dyspnea. PURPOSE: To explore the relationship between CCS and myocardial injury and inflammation as an underlying cause of the persistent complaints in previously healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study from January 2021 to April 2021, study participants without known cardiac or pulmonary diseases prior to COVID-19 infection with persisting CCS symptoms like fatigue or exertional dyspnea after convalescence and healthy control participants underwent cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI protocol included T1 and T2 relaxation times, extracellular volume (ECV), T2 signal intensity ratio, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and χ(2) test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 41 participants with CCS (39±13 years; 18 men) and 42 control participants (39±16 years; 26 men) were evaluated. Median time between initial mild to moderate COVID-19 disease without hospitalization and cardiac MRI was 103 days (interquartile range: 88-158). Troponin T levels were normal. Parameters indicating myocardial inflammation and edema were comparable between participants with CCS and control participants: T1 relaxation time (978±23 ms vs 971±25 ms; P=.17), T2 relaxation time (53±2 ms vs 52±2 ms; P=.47), T2 signal intensity ratio (1.6±0.2 vs 1.6±0.3; P=.10). Visible myocardial edema was present in none of the participants. Three of 41 (7%) participants with CCS demonstrated non-ischemic LGE compared to none in the control group (0 of 42 [0%]; P=.07). None of the participants fulfilled the 2018 Lake Louise criteria for the diagnosis of myocarditis. CONCLUSION: Individuals without hospitalization for COVID-19 and with CCS did not demonstrate signs of active myocardial injury or inflammation on cardiac MRI.

Pharmacological targeting of the nucleolin RNA binding domain RBD1,2 can inhibit RSV infections in vitro and in vivo; however, the site(s) on RBD1,2 which interact with RSV are not known. We undertook a series of experiments designed to: document RSV-nucleolin co-localization on the surface of polarized MDCK cells using immunogold electron microscopy, to identify domains on nucleolin that physically interact with RSV using biochemical methods and determine their biological effects on RSV infection in vitro, and to carry out structural analysis toward informing future RSV drug development. Results of immunogold transmission and scanning electron microscopy showed RSV-nucleolin co-localization on the cell surface, as would be expected for a viral receptor. RSV, through its fusion protein (RSV-F), physically interacts with RBD1,2 and these interactions can be competitively inhibited by treatment with Palivizumab or recombinant RBD1,2. Treatment with synthetic peptides derived from two 12-mer domains of RBD1,2 inhibited RSV infection in vitro, with structural analysis suggesting these domains are potentially feasible for targeting in drug development. In conclusion, the identification and characterization of domains of nucleolin that interact with RSV provide the essential groundwork toward informing design of novel nucleolin-targeting compounds in RSV drug development.","Mastrangelo, Peter; Chin, Allysia A.; Tan, Stephanie; Jeon, Amy H.; Ackerley, Cameron A.; Siu, Karen K.; Lee, Jeffrey E.; Hegele, Richard G.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567674/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020261,191

The detection of viral RNA allows the identification of infected persons, while the detection of antibodies may reveal a response to a previous infection. Tests for coronavirus should be rigorously evaluated in terms of their analytical and clinical performance. This poses not only logistic challenges, but also methodological ones. Some of these are generic for the diagnostic accuracy paradigm, while others are more specific for tests for viruses. Problematic for evaluations of the clinical performance of tests for viral RNA is the absence of an independent reference standard. Many studies lack rigor in terms of the recruitment of study participants. Study reports are often insufficiently informative, which makes it difficult to assess the applicability of study findings. Attempts to summarize the performance of these tests in terms of a single estimate of the clinical sensitivity fails to do justice to the identifiable sources of the large heterogeneity in mechanisms for generating false negative results.","Bossuyt, Patrick M.",J Clin Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622902/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435620307502; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435620307502?v=s5,191
658241,"COVID-19 cases from the first local outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in China presented more serious clinical features: a prospective, comparative cohort study",2021-05-08,"The COVID-19 pandemic is heavily influencing people’s general well-being worldwide. Since its outbreak, many studies have explored the population’s general psychological well-being, while only a few studies have addressed how the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown are affecting sexuality. Sexual health, an important aspect of general well-being, has relevant consequences on people’s daily lives. Although it is well known that distress can affect sexuality, and it is possible to speculate that the outbreak’s psychological outcomes are affecting the population’s sexual life; recent literature does not explore couples’ sexuality and their relationship quality during the lockdown. The present preliminary research aimed to understand if the Italian population’s sexuality has changed, and if so, how it had changed since the spread of COVID-19, and which variables were influencing couples’ relationship quality during the COVID-19 lockdown. A questionnaire reserved especially for cohabiting couples was designed and distributed online from April 11 to May 5, 2020, the 5th and 8th weeks, respectively, after the start of the lockdown. Of the 124 respondents who completed the online survey, 73% were females. Despite the pandemic’s psychological consequences, when asked directly, most couples responded that they did not perceive any differences in their sexuality. However, some female participants did report a decrease in pleasure, satisfaction, desire, and arousal. The main reasons behind the changes in sexuality in women, therefore, appear to be worry, lack of privacy, and stress. Even when participants seemed to show high levels of resilience, the negative aspects of lockdown could affect their quality of sexual life. This study needs to be completed using qualitative data from online focus groups that have investigated how sexual life has changed and the main needs of couples. All the same, our results will serve to better address population needs and experiences, and provide ad hoc interventions during this unprecedented time of crisis.","Panzeri, Marta; Ferrucci, Roberta; Cozza, Angela; Fontanesi, Lilybeth",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.565823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132969/,191

Design: A multiple baseline within subject design across parent behaviors was replicated across three participating dyads. A pre–post intervention comparison was provided with a non-cleft twin. Participants: Three mother-child dyads participated in this study. Children ranged in age from 21 to 27 months at the beginning of the study and all had a diagnosis of CL/P. A noncleft twin without CL/P was assessed pre- and post-intervention to provide a normative comparison. Results: Parents demonstrated a positive intervention effect by substantially increasing their use of EMT + PE intervention strategies during telepractice intervention sessions (Tau 0.675 to 1.1333). Following the conclusion of intervention, parents were able to maintain their use of strategies once direct coaching had been discontinued. Children demonstrated increased talking rate, improved speech production and expanded expressive vocabulary measures over the course of intervention. Speech and language development of a child without cleft palate was provided as a comparison.

It can lead to multiorgan failure, including respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation, and kidney injury, with significant associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory or kidney disease. Dapagliflozin, a sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor, has shown significant cardio‐ and renoprotective benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes (with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and may provide similar organ protection in high‐risk patients with COVID‐19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DARE‐19 (NCT04350593) is an investigator‐initiated, collaborative, international, multicentre, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study testing the dual hypotheses that dapagliflozin can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, kidney and/or respiratory complications or all‐cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, in adult patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 but not critically ill on admission. Eligible patients will have ≥1 cardiometabolic risk factor for COVID‐19 complications. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Primary efficacy endpoints are time to development of new or worsened organ dysfunction during index hospitalization, or all‐cause mortality, and the hierarchical composite endpoint of change in clinical status through day 30 of treatment. Safety of dapagliflozin in individuals with COVID‐19 will be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: DARE‐19 will evaluate whether dapagliflozin can prevent COVID‐19‐related complications and all‐cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, and assess the safety profile of dapagliflozin in this patient population.

Much research has focused on the issues surrounding anxiety, depression, and stress among healthcare workers. The consequences of mental health problems on healthcare workers’ physical health, health-compromising behaviours, suicide ideation, family relationships, and job satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic are not well studied. Enhanced psychological stress has known effects on an individual’s physical health. In healthcare workers with pre-existing comorbidities, psychological stressors may exacerbate their current health problems. Healthcare professionals are known to have a high risk of substance use, hence they may be at risk of development of substance use addiction or vulnerable to addiction relapse. Frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers are being pushed above and beyond their limits, possibly resulting in suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, the burden of high workload and burnout may also have serious manifestations in relationships with family and an intention to quit their jobs.

Elevation of D-dimer is the major remarkable abnormal coagulation test in seriously ill COVID-19 patients. In nearly 50% of COVID-19 patients, the value of D-dimer was significantly enhancing. Recent literature indicated that COVID-19 patients were at higher risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are some of the factors leading to these conditions. The majority of COVID-19 patients showed a higher profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe clinical conditions. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukins (ILs) elevated in COVID-19 infected patients. TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1 are major cytokines vital for the inhibition of intrinsic anticoagulant pathways. COVID-19 becomes a higher complication with a significant effect on blood cell production and hemostasis cascades. Deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis are common complications. Changes in hematological parameters are also frequently observed in COVID-19 patients. Especially, thrombocytopenia is an indicator for poor prognosis of the disease and is highly expected and aggravates the likelihood of death of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Thrombopoiesis reduction in COVID-19 patients might be due to viral abuse of the bone marrow/the viral load may affect thrombopoietin production and function. In other ways, immune-inflammation-mediated destruction and increased consumption of platelets are also the possible proposed mechanisms for thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the counting of platelet cells is an easily accessible biomarker for disease monitoring. All SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be admitted and identifying potential higher-risk patients. It is also obligatory to provide appropriate treatments with intensive care and strict follow-up. In addition, considerations of chronic diseases are essential for better prognosis and recovery.

The present study endeavours to explore the relationship between religiosity, social capital, and psychological well-being of the general public, particularly in terms of coping with the pandemic. In addition to this, the study aims to highlight the importance of public awareness regarding social distancing, use of religion as a coping mechanism, and living a healthy lifestyle during pandemic. For knowing the perception of the masses, an online survey by using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out among coronavirus patients, the general public, social media activists, students, and professionals across Indonesia. The findings indicate that the pandemic has altered the lifestyle of the masses in different ways and that people have varied perceptions towards this virus regarding its spread and preventive measures. The study also reveals that, social capital (β = .418, p < .001), psychological well-being (β = .343, p < .001), and religious coping (β = .145, p <. 01) have a significant amount of the variance of coronavirus situational stress (F = 69.77, p < .001, R2 = 0.485). Lastly, the study suggests that, adopting preventative measures, standard operating procedures that are sustainable and healthy forms of coping with the pandemic will be equally as important as medical care in order to contain and eventually eradicate the virus.

Revision of possible pathophysiologic mechanisms,2020-06-02,"Dromedary camels remain the currently identified reservoir for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The virus is released in the secretions of the infected camels, especially the nasal tract. The virus shedding curve through the nasal secretions was studied. Although human transmission of the virus through the respiratory tract of close contact people with dromedary reported previously, the exact mechanism of transmission is still largely unknown. The main goal of this study was to check the possibility of MERS-CoV shedding in the exhaled air of the infected camels. To achieve this goal, we conducted a follow-up study in one of the dromedary camel herds, December 2018–April 2019. We tested nasal swabs, breath samples from animals within this herd by the real-time PCR. Our results showed that some of the tested nasal swabs and breath were positive from 24 March 2019 until 7 April 2019. The phylogenetic analysis of the obtained S and N gene sequences revealed the detected viruses are clustering together with some human and camel samples from the eastern region, especially from Al-Hufuf city, as well as some samples from Qatar and Jordon. These results are clearly showing the possibility of shedding of the virus in the breath of the infected camels. This could explain, at least in part, the mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from animals to humans. This study is confirming the shedding of MERS-CoV in the exhaled air of the infected camels. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the MERS-CoV.","Hemida, Maged Gomaa; Ali, Mohammed; Alhammadi, Mohammed; Alnaeem, Abdelmohsen",Epidemiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050973/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820002459,191

Here, we measured the effectiveness of glass wool filters to simultaneously concentrate enteric viruses and bacteria of bovine origin from water. The recovery efficiencies were determined for bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, bovine rotavirus group A, bovine coronavirus, poliovirus Sabin III, toxigenic Escherichia coli ,and Campylobacter jejuni seeded into water with three different turbidity levels (0.5, 215, and 447 NTU). Twenty liters of dechlorinated tap water (pH 7) were seeded with the test organisms, and then passed through a glass wool filter using a peristaltic pump (flow rate = 1 liter min(−1)). Retained organisms were eluted from the filters by passing beef extract-glycine buffer (pH 9.5) in the direction opposite of sample flow. Recovered organisms were enumerated by qPCR except for C. jejuni, which was quantified by culture. Mean recovery efficiencies ranged from 55 to 33 % for the bacteria and 58 to 16 % for the viruses. Using bootstrapping techniques combined with Analysis of Variance, recovery efficiencies were found to differ among the pathogen types tested at the two lowest turbidity levels; however, for a given pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for C. jejuni. Glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for concentrating several waterborne pathogens of bovine origin simultaneously, although recovery may be low for some specific taxa such as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1.","Abd-Elmaksoud, Sherif; Spencer, Susan K.; Gerba, Charles P.; Tamimi, Akrum H.; Jokela, William E.; Borchardt, Mark A.",Food Environ Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12560-014-9159-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059211/,191
665085,Cord blood hemopoietic progenitor profiles predict acute respiratory symptoms in infancy,2008-01-24,"Feline morbillivirus (FeMV), a novel virus from the family of Paramyxoviridae, was first identified in stray cat populations. The objectives of the current study were to (i) determine the molecular prevalence of FeMV in Malaysia; (ii) identify risk factors associated with FeMV infection; and (iii) characterise any FeMV isolates by phylogenetic analyses. Molecular analysis utilising nested RT-PCR assay targeting the L gene of FeMV performed on either urine, blood and/or kidney samples collected from 208 cats in this study revealed 82 (39.4%) positive cats. FeMV-positive samples were obtained from 63/124 (50.8%) urine and 20/25 (80.0%) kidneys while all blood samples were negative for FeMV. In addition, from the 35 cats that had more than one type of samples collected (blood and urine; blood and kidney; blood, urine and kidney), only one cat had FeMV RNA in the urine and kidney samples. Risk factors such as gender, presence of kidney-associated symptoms and cat source were also investigated. Male cats had a higher risk (p = 0.031) of FeMV infection than females. In addition, no significant association (p = 0.083) was observed between the presence of kidney-associated symptoms with FeMV status. From the 82 positive samples, FeMV RNA was detected from 48/82 (58.5%) pet cats and 34/126 (27.0%) shelter cats (p < 0.0001). Partial L and N gene sequencing of the RT-PCR-positive samples showed 85–99% identity to the published FeMV sequences and it was significantly different from all other morbilliviruses. A phylogenetic analysis of the identified Malaysian FeMVs was performed with isolates from Japan, Thailand and China. Molecular characterisation revealed high relatedness of the Malaysian isolates with other Asian FeMVs, indicating that the virus had been circulating only within the region. Therefore, this study confirmed the existence of FeMV among domestic cats in Malaysia. The findings suggest further characterisation of the local isolates, including the whole genome sequencing and that studies at determining the direct consequences of FeMV infection in domestic cats are needed.","Mohd Isa, Nur Hidayah; Selvarajah, Gayathri Thevi; Khor, Kuan Hua; Tan, Sheau Wei; Manoraj, Hemadevy; Omar, Nurul Husna; Omar, Abdul Rahman; Mustaffa-Kamal, Farina",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519304717; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.08.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519304717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500720/,191

Methods: We surveyed SARS-CoV-2 infection among the HCWs in a hospital through screening for antibody levels and the detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR between May 2020 and December 2020. Occupational and non-occupational potential predictors of disease were surveyed for the HCWs included in this study. Results: Among 1925 personnel in the hospital, 1732 were included to the study with a response rate of 90%. The overall infection rate of HCWs was 16.3% at the end of 2020, before vaccinations started. In the multivariate analysis, being janitorial staff (OR: 2.24, CI: 1.21–4.14, p = 0.011), being a medical secretary (OR: 4.17, CI: 2.12–8.18, p < 0.001), having at least one household member with a COVID-19 diagnosis (OR: 8.98, CI: 6.64–12.15, p < 0.001), and number of household members > 3 (OR: 1.67, CI: 1.26–2.22, p < 0.001) were found to be significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Medical secretaries and janitorial staff were under increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The community-hospital gradient can explain the mode of transmission for infection among HCWs. In the setting of this study, community measures were less strict, whereas hospital infection control was adequate and provided necessary personal protective equipment. Increasing risk in larger households and households with diagnosed COVID-19 patient indicates the community-acquired transmission of the infection.","Pınarlık, Fatihan; Genç, Zeliha; Kapmaz, Mahir; Tekin, Süda; Ergönül, Önder",Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449648/; https://doi.org/10.3390/idr13030067,191
666092,"Diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 Cycle Threshold Value Predicts Disease Severity, Survival, and Six-Month Sequelae in COVID-19 Symptomatic Patients",2021-02-11,"INTRODUCTION: Israel ranks very high globally in performing bariatric surgery (BS) per capita. In the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the bariatric surgeons’ community faced many concerns and challenges, especially in light of a decree issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 22nd, to ban all elective surgery in public hospitals. The aim of this study is to portray the practices and attitudes of Israeli bariatric surgeons in the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS: Anonymous web-based questionnaire sent to all active bariatric surgeons in Israel. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software package. RESULTS: 53 out of 63 (84%) active surgeons responded to the survey. 18% practice in the public sector only, 4% in the private sector only and 78% in both sectors. 76% practice BS for more than 10 years and 68% perform more than 100 procedures a year. Almost all the surgeons (98%) experienced a tremendous decrease in operations. Nevertheless, there were substantial differences by sectors. In the public sector, 86% of the surgeons ceased to operate while 14% did not comply with the government’s decree. In the public sector 69% of the surgeons were instructed by the administrators to stop operating. The majority of surgeons who continued to operate (77%) changed nothing in the indications or contra-indications for surgery. Among the surgeons who opted to refrain from operating on special sub-groups, the most frequent reasons were pulmonary disease (82%), age above 60 (64%), Ischemic heart disease (55%) and living in heavily affected communities. Roughly only half (57%) of the surgeons implemented changes in informed consent and operating room (OR) measures, contrary to guidelines and recommendations by leading professional societies. When asked about future conditions for reestablishing elective procedures, the reply frequencies were as follows: no special measures - 40%; PCR negativity - 27%; IgG positivity - 15%; waiting until the end of the pandemic- 9%. CONCLUSIONS: We showed in this nation-wide survey that the variance between surgeons, regarding present and future reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, is high. There were substantial differences between the private and the public sectors. Although the instructions given by the MOH for the public sector were quite clear, the compliance by surgeons and administrators was far from complete. The administrators in the public sector, but more so in the private sector were ambiguous in instructing staff, leading surgeons to a more “personal non-structured” practice in the first phase of the pandemic. These facts must be considered by regulators, administrators and surgeons when planning for reestablishing elective BS or in case a second wave of the pandemic is on its way.","Beglaibter, Nahum; Zelekha, Orly; Keinan-Boker, Lital; Sakran, Nasser; Mahajna, Ahmad",Isr J Health Policy Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126921/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-020-00420-2,191
666731,"The perceived efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in observational studies: The results of the confounding effect of ""goals of care""",2021-02-17,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the causative agent of the COVID19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for a small accessory protein termed Orf9b, which targets the mitochondrial outer membrane protein TOM70 in infected cells. TOM70 is involved in a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I). This cascade depends on the recruitment of Hsp90-bound proteins to the N-terminal domain of TOM70. Binding of Orf9b to TOM70 decreases the expression of IFN-I; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We show that the binding of Orf9b to TOM70 inhibits the recruitment of Hsp90 and chaperone-associated proteins. We characterized the binding site of Orf9b within the C-terminal domain of TOM70 and found that a serine in position 53 of Orf9b and a glutamate in position 477 of TOM70 are crucial for the association of both proteins. A phosphomimetic variant Orf9b(S53E) showed drastically reduced binding to TOM70 and did not inhibit Hsp90 recruitment, suggesting that Orf9b–TOM70 complex formation is regulated by phosphorylation. Eventually, we identified the N-terminal TPR domain of TOM70 as a second binding site for Orf9b, which indicates a so far unobserved contribution of chaperones in the mitochondrial targeting of the viral protein.","Brandherm, Lukas; Kobaš, Antonio Mario; Klöhn, Mara; Brüggemann, Yannick; Pfaender, Stephanie; Rassow, Joachim; Kreimendahl, Sebastian",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502139/,191

Here, we demonstrate that influenza evolution within infected humans recapitulates many evolutionary dynamics observed at the global scale. We deep-sequence longitudinal samples from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections. We find parallel evolution across three scales: within individual patients, in different patients in our study, and in the global influenza population. In hemagglutinin, a small set of mutations arises independently in multiple patients. These same mutations emerge repeatedly within single patients and compete with one another, providing a vivid clinical example of clonal interference. Many of these recurrent within-host mutations also reach a high global frequency in the decade following the patient infections. Our results demonstrate surprising concordance in evolutionary dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales.

We report on two paediatric patients who presented with encephalopathy during COVID-19 illness. Both patients had ADEM-like changes in their neuroimaging, negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR in CSF, and paucity of PIMS-TS laboratory findings. However, the first patient was positive for serum MOG antibodies with normal CSF analysis, and the second had negative MOG antibodies but showed significant CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis. We concluded that the first case was a typical case of demyelination, which could have been triggered by different cofactors. In the second case, however, we postulated that the encephalopathic process was triggered by SARS-CoV-2, as no other cause was identified. With these two contrasting cases, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalitis can show ADEM-like changes, which can present during the postinfectious phase of COVID-19 illness. As ADEM is a relatively common type of postinfectious encephalitis in children, the distinguishing line between the two conditions of encephalitis and ADEM can be relatively fine. The development of more reliable diagnostic tools (e.g., anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in CSF) might play an assisting role in the differentiation of these encephalopathic processes.","Vraka, Katerina; Ram, Dipak; West, Siobhan; Chia, Wei Yen Evelyn; Kurup, Praveen; Subramanian, Gayathri; Tan, Hui Jeen",Case Rep Neurol Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6658000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833883/,191

The virus is closely related (96.3%) to bat coronavirus RaTG13, based on phylogenetic analysis. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed even from asymptomatic carriers. The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily. Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus. There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation.

Background Molecular testing for viral pathogens has resulted in increasing detection of multiple viruses in respiratory secretions of ill children. The clinical impact of multiple virus infections on clinical presentation and outcome is unclear. Objectives To compare clinical characteristics and viral load between children with multiple virus versus single virus illnesses. Patients/methods Eight hundred and ninety‐three residual nasal wash samples from children treated for respiratory illness at Children’s Hospital, Seattle, from September 2003 to September 2004 were evaluated by quantitative PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza (Flu), parainfluenza, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses (CoV). Illness severity and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical charts. Results Coinfections were identified in 103 (18%) of 566 virus‐positive samples. Adenovirus was most commonly detected in coinfections (52%), followed by CoV (50%). Illnesses with a single virus had increased risk of oxygen requirement (P = 0·02), extended hospital stays (P = 0·002), and admissions to the inpatient (P = 0·02) or intensive care units (P = 0·04). For Adv and PIV‐1, multiple virus illnesses had a significantly lower viral load (log(10) copies/ml) than single virus illnesses (4·2 versus 5·6, P = 0·007 and 4·2 versus 6·9, P < 0·001, respectively). RSV, Flu‐A, PIV‐3, and hMPV viral loads were consistently high whether or not another virus was detected. Conclusions Illnesses with multiple virus detections were correlated with less severe disease.

In addition to the widely described respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 may cause life-treating complications directly or indirectly related to this infection. Among these, thrombotic complications have emerged as an important issue in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients in intensive care units. Thrombotic complications due to COVID-19 are likely to occur due to a pro-coagulant pattern encountered in some of these patients or to a progressive endothelial thrombo-inflammatory syndrome causing microvascular disease. In the present authors’ experience, from five different hospitals in Italy and the UK, imaging has proved its utility in identifying these COVID-19-related thrombotic complications, with translational clinical relevance.

OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of superinfections in COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective, observational study including patients with COVID-19 consecutively admitted to the University Hospital of Pisa, Italy, between 4 March and 30 April 2020. Clinical data and outcomes were registered. Superinfection was defined as a bacterial or fungal infection that occurred ≥48 h after hospital admission. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with superinfections. RESULTS: Overall, 315 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized and 109 episodes of superinfections were documented in 69 (21.9%) patients. The median time from admission to superinfection was 19 days (range 11–29.75). Superinfections were caused by Enterobacterales (44.9%), non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (15.6%), Gram-positive bacteria (15.6%) and fungi (5.5%). Polymicrobial infections accounted for 18.3%. Predictors of superinfections were: intestinal colonization by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (OR 16.03, 95% CI 6.5–39.5, P < 0.001); invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4–13.1, P < 0.001); immunomodulatory agents (tocilizumab/baricitinib) (OR 5.09, 95% CI 2.2–11.8, P < 0.001); C-reactive protein on admission >7 mg/dl (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.7–7.7, P = 0.001); and previous treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.1–7.2, P = 0.028). Length of hospital stay was longer in patients who developed superinfections ompared with those who did not (30 versus 11 days, P < 0.001), while mortality rates were similar (18.8% versus 23.2%, P = 0.445). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bacterial and fungal superinfections in COVID-19 is consistent. Patients who need empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunomodulant drugs should be carefully selected. Infection control rules must be reinforced.","Falcone, Marco; Tiseo, Giusy; Giordano, Cesira; Leonildi, Alessandro; Menichini, Melissa; Vecchione, Alessandra; Pistello, Mauro; Guarracino, Fabio; Ghiadoni, Lorenzo; Forfori, Francesco; Barnini, Simona; Menichetti, Francesco",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaa530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374002/,191

The increasing availability of HBV/C genetic sequences and detailed annotations provides an opportunity to investigate the epidemiological factors underlying its evolutionary history. In this study, the Bayesian phylogeography framework was used to investigate the origins and patterns in spatial dissemination of HBV/C by analyzing East Asian sequences obtained from 1992 to 2010. The most recent common ancestor of HBV/C was traced back to the early 1900s in China, where it eventually diverged into two major lineages during the 1930s‐1960s that gave rise to distinct epidemic waves spreading exponentially to other East Asian countries and the USA. Demographic inference of viral effective population size over time indicated similar dynamics for both lineages, characterized by exponential growth since the early 1980s, followed by a significant bottleneck in 2003 and another increase after 2004. Although additional factors cannot be ruled out, we provide evidence to suggest this bottleneck was the result of limited human movement from/to China during the SARS outbreak in 2003. This is the first extensive evolutionary study of HBV/C in East Asia as well as the first to assess more realistic spatial ecological influences between co‐circulating infectious diseases.","Lin, Serena Y.

However, the distribution and zoonotic potential of Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in these animals remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 889 fecal specimens were collected in this study from farmed masked palm civets in Hainan, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Chongqing, southern China, and analyzed for these pathogens by nested PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Altogether, 474 (53.3%), 34 (3.8%) and 1 (0.1%) specimens were positive for E. bieneusi, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium sp., respectively. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 11 novel E. bieneusi genotypes named as PL1–PL11 and two known genotypes Peru8 and J, with PL1 and PL2 accounting for 90% of E. bieneusi infections. Phylogenetically, PL4, PL5, PL9, PL10 and PL11 were clustered into Group 1, while PL1, PL2, PL3, PL6, PL7 and PL8 were clustered into Group 2. Assemblage B (n = 33) and concurrence of B and D (n = 1) were identified among G. duodenalis-positive animals. Further multilocus genotyping of assemblage B has revealed that all 13 multilocus genotypes in civets formed a cluster related to those from humans. The Cryptosporidium isolate from one civet was identified to be genetically related to the Cryptosporidium bamboo rat genotype II. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this first report of enteric protists in farmed masked palm civets suggests that these animals might be potential reservoirs of zoonotic E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis genotypes.

Dans le même temps, il existe un risque accru de développer une COVID19 sévère : 10 à 20 % des patients dialysés infectés par le SARS-CoV-2 sont décédés dans les centres d’hémodialyse en France depuis le début de la pandémie. Les patients dialysés sont donc à la fois les plus susceptibles de bénéficier d’une protection vaccinale contre le SRAS-CoV-2 et les plus à risque de ne pas développer de réponse immunitaire. Description Des données issues de la pratique clinique sont donc nécessaires. Méthodes Nous rapportons notre expérience avec un vaccin à ARNm BNT162b2 dans une analyse rétrospective monocentrique de 241 patients dialysés dont 193 ayant eu une analyse IgG anti-Spike-Protein-Receptor-Binding-Domain (IgG II Quant Abbott© assay, seuil IgG >50 AU/mL). Résultats Nous montrons qu’une campagne de vaccination proactive avec information personnelle à chaque patient est efficace pour convaincre la plupart des patients de se faire vacciner (95 %, vs 78 % pour la campagne de vaccination grippale) et initie fréquemment une réponse en anticorps spécifique anti-Spike RBD (182/193, 94,3 %). Seul le statut immunodéprimé est associé à une absence de séroconversion (OR 7,6 [1,5-38,2], p = 0,02). Nous identifions également des facteurs associés à une faible réponse (dernier quartile ; IgG<500AU/mL) : statut immunodéprimé, âge, absence d’inhibiteurs du RAAS, faible nombre de lymphocytes, protéine C réactive élevée ; et avec une réponse élevée (quartile élevé ; IgG>7000AU/mL) : âge ; précédente infection par le SRAS-CoV2 et cancer actif (Fig. 1). Conclusion A partir de cette expérience, nous proposons une stratégie intégrant la surveillance des IgG anti-spike pour guider la revaccination et la gestion des centres de dialyse en temps de pandémie.","Bachelet, T.; Bourdenx, J.

678097,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Fecal Samples from Patients with Asymptomatic and Mild COVID-19 in Korea,2020-06-10,"Defective IFN production and exacerbated inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses are hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19. Based on these hallmarks, and considering the pivotal role of macrophages in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we hypothesize that the transcription factors MAFB and MAF critically contribute to COVID-19 progression by shaping the response of macrophages to SARS-CoV-2. Our proposal stems from the recent identification of pathogenic lung macrophage subsets in severe COVID-19, and takes into consideration the previously reported ability of MAFB to dampen IFN type I production, as well as the critical role of MAFB and MAF in the acquisition and maintenance of the transcriptional signature of M-CSF–conditioned human macrophages. Solid evidences are presented that link overexpression of MAFB and silencing of MAF expression with clinical and biological features of severe COVID-19. As a whole, we propose that a high MAFB/MAF expression ratio in lung macrophages could serve as an accurate diagnostic tool for COVID-19 progression. Indeed, reversing the macrophage MAFB/MAF expression ratio might impair the exacerbated inflammatory and profibrotic responses, and restore the defective IFN type I production, thus becoming a potential strategy to limit severity of COVID-19.","Vega, Miguel A.; Simón-Fuentes, Miriam; González de la Aleja, Arturo; Nieto, Concha; Colmenares, María; Herrero, Cristina; Domínguez-Soto, Ángeles; Corbí, Ángel L.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312178/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.603507,191

Wastewater surveillance had a high detection rate (>80%) of SARS-CoV-2 when the daily incidence exceeded 13 per 100,000 people. Detection rates were positively associated with wastewater treatment plant catchment size.

Design and setting: Cross sectional study involving secondary analysis of publicly available data from a global online COVID-19 survey and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Participants: 106,497 participants from 58 countries. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were a worries index and a depression index. Predictors were stringency of policies, trust in government, and gender. Multivariable regression was conducted to determine the three-way interaction between the predictor variables for mental health outcomes, adjusting for age, income and education. Results: The median age of participants (56.4% women) was 37 years (interquartile range 29 to 48 years). Women had higher worries and depression scores than men. 45.4% distrusted the government and 43.8% trusted the government to take care of its citizens. Among those who strongly trusted the government, an increase in the stringency of policies was associated with a significant increase in the worries index. Among men who distrusted the government, an increase in policy stringency was associated with an increase in the depression index but not the worries index. In women that strongly distrusted the government, there was an inversed U-shaped association between policy stringency and both the worries and depression indices. Conclusion: As the stringency of public health measures increases, so too do depression and worries. The association is moderated by gender and trust in government.

A total of 1,421 healthcare professionals who were in contact with at least one positive COVID‐19 patient participated in a cross‐sectional online survey from April to June 2020. Mental health was measured with the General Health Questionnaire‐12, and loneliness was assessed with the 3‐item UCLA Loneliness Scale. More than 80% of participants showed a certain prone to experience mental health problems, and 90% felt that they had not enough workplace protective measures to manage COVID‐19 patients. Presence of loneliness was positively related to higher mental health problems after controlling for other covariates. Other factors related to higher mental health problems were a higher COVID‐19 risk perception, being in quarantine, checking COVID‐19‐related news several times a day and having a lower training on managing infectious diseases. Neither living alone, nor supervisor social support, were related to healthcare professionals' mental health. Results suggest that the impact of COVID‐19 in terms of mental health in the healthcare professionals could be more related to subjective appraisals of social isolation rather than to be physically alone. There were also a variety of cognitive, behavioural and training‐related factors that were associated with the healthcare professionals’ mental health, and that should be potentially managed in the mental healthcare interventions.","Cabello, María; Izquierdo, Ana; Leal, Itziar",Health Soc Care Community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761161/,191

With this work, we set the foundations for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in Portugal by monitoring the trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA circulation in the community, on a nationwide perspective during different epidemiological phases of the pandemic. The Charité assays (E_Sarbecco, RdRP, and N_Sarbecco) were applied to monitor, over 32-weeks (April to December 2020), the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the inlet of five wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which together serve more than two million people in Portugal. Raw wastewater from three Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reference hospitals was also analyzed during this period. In total, more than 600 samples were tested. For the first weeks, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was sporadic, with concentrations varying from 10(3) to 10(5) genome copies per liter (GC/L). Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increased steeply by the end of May into late June, mainly in Lisboa e Vale do Tejo region (LVT), during the reopening phase. After the summer, with the reopening of schools in mid-September and return to partial face-to-face work, a pronounced increase of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was detected. In the LVT area, SARS-CoV-2 RNA load agreed with reported trends in hotspots of infection. Synchrony between trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewater and daily new COVID-19 cases highlights the value of WBE as a surveillance tool, particularly after the phasing out of the epidemiological curve and when hotspots of disease re-emerge in the population which might be difficult to spot based solely on syndromic surveillance and contact tracing.

COVID-19 has peculiar characteristics and outcomes, suggesting a unique immunopathogenesis. METHODS: Thirty-six immunocompetent non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in a single center, most requiring intensive care. Clinical and biological characteristics (including T cell phenotype and function and plasma concentrations of 30 cytokines) and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: At similar baseline respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation for significantly longer than non-COVID-19 patients (15 [7–22] vs. 4 (0–15) days; p = 0.0049). COVID-19 patients had lower levels of most classical inflammatory cytokines (G-CSF, CCL20, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, TNF-α, TGF-β), but higher plasma concentrations of CXCL10, GM-CSF and CCL5, compared to non-COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients displayed similar T-cell exhaustion to non-COVID-19 patients, but with a more unbalanced inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine response (IL-6/IL-10 and TNF-α/IL-10 ratios). Principal component analysis identified two main patterns, with a clear distinction between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that GM-CSF, CXCL10 and IL-10 levels were independently associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: We identified a unique cytokine response, with higher plasma GM-CSF and CXCL10 in COVID-19 patients that were independently associated with the longer duration of mechanical ventilation.

For instance, a greater concentration of ambient NO(2) was associated with faster transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether outbreaks of infectious diseases arouse individuals’ concern on the need to protect the environment and therefore promote more pro-environmental behaviors. To this end, we examined the relationship between infectious disease vulnerability and pro-environmental behaviors using data from a cross-societal survey (N = 53 societies) and an experiment (N = 214 individuals). At both the societal and the individual levels, infectious disease vulnerability increased pro-environmental behaviors. At the societal level, this relationship was mediated by citizens’ level of environmental concern. At the individual level, the relationship was mediated by empathy.

Three were known to have preexisting diabetes and two had newly diagnosed diabetes based on significantly elevated glycated hemoglobin levels at admission. Four recovered and were discharged to their homes and one had a complicated course and died. CONCLUSION: Our cases demonstrate that COVID-19 infection can trigger DKA. DKA can occur among patients who are known to have diabetes mellitus or appears as a first presentation. Clinicians should be extremely careful in checking for admission hyperglycemia and closely monitor respiratory status during fluid resuscitation of COVID-19-related DKA.","Alsadhan, Ibrahim; Alruwashid, Shahad; Alhamad, Maram; Alajmi, Sarah; Alshehri, Sara; Alfadhli, Eman; Ekhzaimy, Aishah",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011393X20300357?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132404/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0011393X20300357; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.curtheres.2020.100609,191

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to researchers, scientists, and clinicians and affected the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a multitude of existing anti-viral, antibiotic, antimalarial, and anticancer drugs have been tested, and some have shown potency in the treatment and management of COVID-19, albeit others failed to leave any positive impact and a few also became controversial as they showed mixed clinical outcomes. In the present article, we have brought together some of the candidate therapeutic drugs being repurposed or used in the clinical trials and discussed their safety and efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19.","Dowarah, Jayanta; Marak, Brilliant N.; Chand Singh Yadav, Umesh; Prakash Singh, Ved",Bioorg Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.105016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004520682100393X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004520682100393X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34144277/,191

No previous population-based studies have evaluated ST and child development in India. This study aimed to determine the burden of ST, associated sociodemographic factors, and its impact on domains of child development. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the field practice area of rural and urban health centers in Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 718 children (396 rural and 322 urban) were selected, using a cluster random sampling method. ST estimates were obtained from parents/guardian after a 7-day observation period. The Communication DEALL Developmental Checklist was used to assess child development. The mean ST was 2.39 hours/day (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.23–2.54), and the prevalence of excessive ST was 73% (95% CI: 69.2–76.8). Excessive ST was significantly associated with the mothers’ ST, screen usage at bedtime, birth order (in children < 2 years), and attending school (in children ≥ 2 years). Increased ST was significantly associated with developmental delay, in particular, in the domains of language acquisition and communication. In children aged ≥ 2 years, a delay in ≥ 3 domains was associated with ST (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 17.75, 95% CI: 5.04–62.49, p < 0.001), as was language delay (AOR = 52.92, 95% CI: 12.33–227.21, p < 0.001). In children aged < 2 years, a delay in ≥ 2 domains was associated with ST (AOR = 16.79, 95% CI: 2.26–124.4, p < 0.001), as was language delay (AOR = 20.93, 95% CI: 2.68–163.32, p < 0.01). A very high prevalence of excessive ST was identified, with a significant association with developmental delay in children. There is an urgent need to include education on ST limits at the primary healthcare level.","Varadarajan, Samya; Govindarajan Venguidesvarane, Akila; Ramaswamy, Karthik Narayanan; Rajamohan, Muthukumar; Krupa, Murugesan; Winfred Christadoss, Sathiasekaran Bernard",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228768/,191

The questionnaire, which is potentially capable of differentiating patients with fractures, does not appear to have the differential capacity in terms of osteoporosis. PURPOSE: This study aims to conduct the reliability and validity study of QUALEFFO-31 in Turkish and to evaluate the capacity of the questionnaire to distinguish patients in terms of osteoporosis. METHODS: The original English version was translated into Turkish by two translators whose native language was Turkish. Subsequently, this Turkish version was translated back into English by two different bilingual translators whose native language was English. After this preliminary questionnaire was tested in 30 patients, words, terminology, information errors, and parts difficult to understand were revised, and the questionnaire was finalized. Internal consistency and test–retest analyses were used for the reliability study. For the validity study, convergent-discriminant validity, concurrent validity, factor analysis, known-group validity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were evaluated. Internal consistency levels were optimal except for the mental function. ICC coefficients showed good retest reliability for all domains and total tests. The convergent and discriminant validity ratios for the mental function domain were 78% for both and 100% for the other domains. There was a moderate and good negative correlation between QUALEFFO-31 and SF-36 domains which had similar names. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 3 structures. However, there was a spread to the other factors in physical function domain items. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) markers were not at a very good fitting level except for the relative chi-square index. When CFA was performed according to the assumed model, the fitting level increased in all analyses. There was no significant differential capacity in terms of osteoporosis or fracture for either QUALEFFO-31 or SF-36. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of QUALEFFO-31 has a sufficient level of reliability, validity, and psychometric properties. Nevertheless, improvements in pain and mental function domains and some changes applying to the model may increase the psychometric capacity of the questionnaire. The questionnaire, which is potentially capable of differentiating patients with fractures, does not appear to have the differential capacity in terms of osteoporosis.

685641,INITIAL HIGH VIRAL LOAD IS ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGED SHEDDING OF HUMAN RHINOVIRUS IN ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS,2018-10-01,"Interferon (IFN) cytokines induce an autonomous antiviral state in cells of the infected site to restrict virus spreading and critically regulate overall antiviral response. The antiviral state leads to host protection through expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes that restrict viral infection through multiple mechanisms, for example, directly in viral genome degradation and indirectly through cellular metabolic inhibition. Young pigs were split into four treatment groups: control, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV, also known as porcine arterivirus) infected, influenza B virus (IBV) infected, and IBV/PRRSV coinfection. Lung tissue was collected at 3, 5, and 7 days post infection (dpi) for control, PRRSV and IBV/PRRSV coinfection, and at 3 and 5 dpi for IBV. Transcriptomic analysis, using usegalaxy.org tools, was performed against the S.scrofa 11.1 reference genome. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was carried out using DeSeq2 based on the model treatment + dpi + treatment:dpi + E. Downstream analysis examined the interaction of DEG at each dpi for over-enriched gene ontology (G.O.) terms and pathways. Comparisons of the infected groups vs. the controls yielded a total of (n = 1412) DEGs for the PRRSV group and (n = 1578) for the IBV/PRRSV group across all timepoints. The IBV group had (n = 64) total DEGs across 3 and 5 dpi. Expression data were considered statistically significant based on false discovery rate (FDR) ⫹ 0.1. Venn diagram comparisons of the DEGs across dpi showed that groups shared only 16 DEGs at 3 dpi, no DEGs were shared at 5 dpi, and for 7 dpi, only the PRRSV and IBV/PRRSV groups were compared and shared a total of 43 DEGs. Across the comparisons, differential expression was observed in antiviral genes such as IRF1, MX1, and OAS2. The IBV and IBV/PRRSV groups showed higher expression of antiviral genes at earlier dpi than the PRRSV group. Additionally, downregulated genes from the comparisons clustered around Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways effecting lung development and cellular integrity. Early expression of host IFN and antiviral genes may lead to viral RNA degradation, and assembly and transcription inhibition in the IBV infections. In comparison, expression of antiviral genes in the PRRSV group decreased across time. The decrease may explain why PRRSV infections persist, while IBV clears. Moreover, all infected groups showed prolonged upregulation in neutrophil degranulation pathway activity, possibly exacerbating symptomatic lung lesion pathology seen in these respiratory infections.","Fleming, Damarius S.; Miller, Laura C.; Tian, Yun; Li, Yonghai; Ma, Wenjun; Sang, Yongming",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9110934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33187194/,191
686866,The impact of viral respiratory infections in the first year post-transplant period of pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients,2016-09-30,"Host heterogeneity in disease transmission is widespread but precisely how different host traits drive this heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Part of the difficulty in linking individual variation to population-scale outcomes is that individual hosts can differ on multiple behavioral, physiological and immunological axes, which will together impact their transmission potential. Moreover, we lack well-characterized, empirical systems that enable the quantification of individual variation in key host traits, while also characterizing genetic or sex-based sources of such variation. Here we used Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila C Virus as a host-pathogen model system to dissect the genetic and sex-specific sources of variation in multiple host traits that are central to pathogen transmission. Our findings show complex interactions between genetic background, sex, and female mating status accounting for a substantial proportion of variance in lifespan following infection, viral load, virus shedding, and viral load at death. Two notable findings include the interaction between genetic background and sex accounting for nearly 20% of the variance in viral load, and genetic background alone accounting for ~10% of the variance in viral shedding and in lifespan following infection. To understand how variation in these traits could generate heterogeneity in individual pathogen transmission potential, we combined measures of lifespan following infection, virus shedding, and previously published data on fly social aggregation. We found that the interaction between genetic background and sex explained ~12% of the variance in individual transmission potential. Our results highlight the importance of characterising the sources of variation in multiple host traits to understand the drivers of heterogeneity in disease transmission.","Siva-Jothy, Jonathon A.; Vale, Pedro F.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465160/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009196,191

The cornerstone of effective stroke care continues to be timely reperfusion treatment. This requires early recognition of symptoms by the public and first responders, triage to an appropriate stroke centre and efficient assessment and investigation by the attending stroke team. The aim of treatment is to achieve recanalisation and reperfusion of the ischaemic penumbra with intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular thrombectomy in appropriately selected patients. All patients should be admitted directly to an acute stroke unit for close monitoring for early neurological deterioration and prevention of secondary complications. Prompt investigation of the mechanism of stroke allows patients to start appropriate secondary preventative treatment. Future objectives include improving accessibility to endovascular thrombectomy, using advanced imaging to extend therapeutic windows and developing neuroprotective agents to prevent secondary neuronal damage.","Hurford, Robert; Sekhar, Alakendu; Hughes, Tom A T; Muir, Keith W",Pract Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2020-002557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32507747/,191

For that reason, we conducted a study using a phenomenographic approach in order to understand how university students perceive COVID-19 and the associated lockdown. Data were collected from 25 students in Pakistan. They were asked to demonstrate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in illustrations. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with these students, to gain further insights into their perspectives on the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis revealed four interlinked directions for understanding students’ experiences. These themes were: 1) escape into peace, 2) hope for personal freedom, 3) fear of becoming a victim of COVID-19, and 4) concerns regarding education, future career, and opportunities. All four themes were analyzed and condensed into an outcome space, which further gathers the perceptions of students under one theme as “Hope for life while paradoxically living with fear”. Studying the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on students not only highlighted their concerns, but also emphasized the importance of starting regular psychological evaluations and stress-releasing sessions, along with online education to overcome growing depression.","Shahbaz, Sumbal; Ashraf, Muhammad Zeshan; Zakar, Rubeena; Fischer, Florian; Zakar, Muhammad Zakria",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984059/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251641,191
