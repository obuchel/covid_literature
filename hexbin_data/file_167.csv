1194,Chronic psychosocial stress: does it modulate immunity to the influenza vaccine in Hong Kong Chinese elderly caregivers?,2012-07-08,"Previous studies evaluated the effects of psychosocial stress on influenza vaccine responses. However, there were methodological limitations. This study aims to determine whether chronic stress is associated with poorer influenza-specific immune responses to influenza vaccines in Hong Kong Chinese elderly people. This is a prospective study with a 12-week follow-up. Subjects were recruited from government general out-patient clinics, non-government organizations, and public housing estates in Hong Kong. Participants include 55 caregivers of spouses with chronic conditions that impaired their activities of daily living and 61 age- and sex-matched non-caregivers. A single-dose trivalent influenza vaccine was given to all subjects by intramuscular ingestion. Blood samples were collected before vaccination, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks after vaccination. Influenza vaccine strain-specific antibody titers were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition method. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed for ratios and absolute counts, and cytokine concentration were measured by flow cytometry. Validated scales were used to assess psychological (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and caregiver strain), social (multidimensional social support scale), and lifestyle factors (physical exercise, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption) at baseline prior to vaccination. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were also collected. Albumin levels were measured as an indicator for nutritional status in subjects. Caregivers had statistically significant (p < 0.05) lower cell-mediated immune responses to influenza vaccination at 12 weeks when compared with those of the controls. No differences in humoral immune response to vaccination were observed between caregivers and controls. Hong Kong Chinese elderly who experience chronic stress have a significantly lower cell-mediated immune response to influenza vaccination when compared with non-caregivers.","Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Wong, Chun Kwok; Chan, Frank Wan Kin; Chan, Paul K.

2283,Association between ambient temperature and lower urinary tract symptoms: a community-based survey,2016,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the individual change of International prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) in each patient by temperature conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) was explored using the IPSS and OABSS questionnaires that were completed by 2.486 subjects (923 males and 1.563 females) aged 60 years and older. Korea Meteorological Administration data was used to determine daily average temperature and daily temperature difference on the interview dates at each site. RESULTS: The mean IPSS and mean age for males was 13.45±8.24 and 75.03±6.20 years, respectively. The mean OABSS and mean age for females was 4.41±3.10 and 73.74±6.03years, respectively. Daily average temperature and daily temperature difference ranged from-3.4-28.3(o)C and 2.2-16.9(o)C, respectively. Age was a significantly risk factor for IPSS, OABSS, and QoL (P<0.001, <0.001, and 0.005, respectively). After multiple regression analysis, daily average temperatures did not show a statistically significant change in IPSS and OABSS. Only daily temperature differences were associated with male LUTS. CONCLUSIONS: While LUTS could be worsened in low temperatures generally, IPSS and OABSS were not affected by daily average temperature conditions. Daily temperature differences may be more influential than daily average temperatures.","Shim, Sung Ryul; Kim, Jae Heon; Won, Jong Ho; Song, Eun Seop; Song, Yun Seob",Int Braz J Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920570/,167
2579,Myopericarditis: A Diagnosis of Uncertainty,2015-10-25,"Myocarditis can present in many different forms and can be overlooked by more life-threatening conditions. At times it may mimic conditions such as acute myocardial infarction and although it may have features highly suggestive of myocarditis, other etiologies need to be excluded. Thus, due to its clinical presentation, lab findings, and electrocardiogram analysis, it often can be confused with other conditions, making it a diagnostic dilemma of uncertainty. Myopericarditis is normally caused by viral infections, most common of which is coxsackievirus. Here we report a case of a 52-year-old gentleman who presented with a clinical picture of acute myocardial ischemia versus dissection, which overlooked a rather less threatening etiology of myopericarditis.","Khan, Rafay; Iroka, Nneka; Tulpule, Sunil; Arshed, Sabrina; Ansari, Mohammad; Sahgal, Puneet; Yousif, Abdalla",Cardiol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295574/,167
2599,A statistical method utilizing information of imported cases to estimate the transmissibility for an influenza pandemic,2017-02-21,"BACKGROUND: In a new influenza pandemic, travel data such as arrival times of cases seeded by the originating country can be regarded as a combination of the epidemic size and the mobility networks of infections connecting the originating country with other regions. It can be a complete and timely source for estimating the basic reproduction number (R (0)), a key indicator of disease transmissibility. METHOD: In this study, we developed a likelihood-based method using arrival times of infected cases in different countries to estimate R (0) for influenza pandemics. A simulation was conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. We further applied the method to the outbreak of the influenza pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico. RESULTS: In the numerical application, the estimated R (0) was equal to 1.69 with a 95% confidence interval (1.65, 1.73). For the simulation results, the estimations were robust to the decline of travel rate and other parameter assumptions. Nevertheless, the estimates were moderately sensitive to the assumption of infectious duration. Generally, the findings were in line with other relevant studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach as well as the estimate is potential to assist officials in planning control and prevention measures. Improved coordination to streamline or even centralize surveillance of imported cases among countries will thus be beneficial to public health.","Chong, Ka Chun; Zee, Benny Chung Ying; Wang, Maggie Haitian",BMC Med Res Methodol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5320693/,167

They have been found to be very similar in sequence and structure to those previously reported for a Spanish isolate (PMMV-S). In contrast, a Dutch isolate termed P 11 codes for a coat protein of 160 amino acids and its 3′ non-coding region is 291 nucleotides long, which may have arisen by duplication. The nucleotide and the predicted coat protein amino acid sequence analysis show that this isolate should be considered as a new virus within the tobamovirus group.

8570,AIDS-Myelopathy: A Neuropathological Study,2011-11-02,"Diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is an infectious bacterial disease of calves that occurs during the first few days of life. The Escherichia coli that cause the disease possess special attributes of virulence that allow them to colonize the small intestine and produce an enterotoxin that causes hypersecretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen. These enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are shed into the environment by infected animals in the herd and are ingested by newborn calves soon after birth. There is some natural immunity to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, however, it often fails to protect calves born and raised under modern husbandry conditions. Hence, methods have been developed to stimulate protective immunity by vaccination of the dam. The protective antibodies are transferred passively to calves through the colostrum.","Acres, Stephen D.",J Dairy Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130746/,167

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the use of a multispecies probiotic can prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: Three Dutch SCI rehabilitation centres. METHODS: Fifty-six people aged 18–75 years with SCI during inpatient rehabilitation, who require antibiotics, will be given probiotics or placebo randomly assigned (T0). After cessation of the antibiotics (T1), the participants will use probiotics/placebo for 3 more weeks (T2). Defaecation, assessed by the Bristol Stool Scale, and bowel management will be monitored daily until 2 weeks after cessation of probiotics/placebo intake (T3). Also, the degree of nausea and information on quality of life will be collected at T0, T1, T2 and T3. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The difference between the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea between people with SCI using probiotics compared to those using a placebo at the moment the antibiotics stops, the probiotics stops and two weeks thereafter. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The time to reach effective bowel management, degree of nausea and quality of life. REGISTRATION: The Dutch Trial Register- NTR 5831.","Faber, W. X.

11455,Effect of edaravone therapy in Korean amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients,2019-08-30,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Trauma exposure is widespread but is especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals. LGBTQ individuals also experience higher rates of discrimination, victimization, and minority stress which can complicate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment but also represent independent intervention targets. In this review, we highlight existing evidence-based practices, current limitations, and provide recommendations for care in the absence of established guidelines for treatment PTSD among LGBTQ patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Trauma-focused therapies (e.g., CPT, PE) and medications (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs) have shown benefit for people with PTSD. However, evaluations of these interventions have failed to examine the role of LGBTQ identities in recovery from trauma, and existing PTSD treatments do not account for ongoing threat to safety or the pervasive minority stress experienced by LGBTQ patients. In addition, many LGBTQ patients report negative experiences with healthcare, necessitating increased education and cultural awareness on the part of clinicians to provide patient-centered care and, potentially, corrective mental health treatment experiences. SUMMARY: Providers should routinely assess trauma exposure, PTSD, and minority stress among LGBTQ patients. We provide assessment and screening recommendations, outline current evidence-based treatments, and suggest strategies for integrating existing treatments to treat PTSD among LGBTQ patients.","Livingston, Nicholas A.; Berke, Danielle; Scholl, James; Ruben, Mollie; Shipherd, Jillian C.",Curr Treat Options Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223966/,167

11778,Impact and Diagnostic Gaps of Comprehensive Genomic Profiling in Real-World Clinical Practice,2020-05-04,"Mycobacterium bovis is the main pathogen of bovine, zoonotic, and wildlife tuberculosis. Despite the existence of programs for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) control in many regions, the disease remains a challenge for the veterinary and public health sectors, especially in developing countries and in high-income nations with wildlife reservoirs. Current bTB control programs are mostly based on test-and-slaughter, movement restrictions, and post-mortem inspection measures. In certain settings, contact tracing and surveillance has benefited from M. bovis genotyping techniques. More recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become the preferential technique to inform outbreak response through contact tracing and source identification for many infectious diseases. As the cost per genome decreases, the application of WGS to bTB control programs is inevitable moving forward. However, there are technical challenges in data analyses and interpretation that hinder the implementation of M. bovis WGS as a molecular epidemiology tool. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe M. bovis genotyping techniques and discuss current standards and challenges of the use of M. bovis WGS for transmission investigation, surveillance, and global lineages distribution. We compiled a series of associated research gaps to be explored with the ultimate goal of implementing M. bovis WGS in a standardized manner in bTB control programs.","Guimaraes, Ana M.

12090,The statistical importance of a study for a network meta-analysis estimate,2020-07-16,"BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in in situ gene expression technologies constitute a new and rapidly evolving field of transcriptomics. With the recent launch of the 10x Genomics Visium platform, such methods have started to become widely adopted. The experimental protocol is conducted on individual tissue sections collected from a larger tissue sample. The two-dimensional nature of this data requires multiple consecutive sections to be collected from the sample in order to construct a comprehensive three-dimensional map of the tissue. However, there is currently no software available that lets the user process the images, align stacked experiments, and finally visualize them together in 3D to create a holistic view of the tissue. RESULTS: We have developed an R package named STUtility that takes 10x Genomics Visium data as input and provides features to perform standardized data transformations, alignment of multiple tissue sections, regional annotation, and visualizations of the combined data in a 3D model framework. CONCLUSIONS: STUtility lets the user process, analyze and visualize multiple samples of spatially resolved RNA sequencing and image data from the 10x Genomics Visium platform. The package builds on the Seurat framework and uses familiar APIs and well-proven analysis methods.

The sequence motifs identified represent functionally important sites on protein molecules. When multiple blocks exist in a single motif they are often close together in the 3-D structure. Furthermore, occasionally these motif blocks were found to be split by introns when the correlation with exon structures was examined.","Ogiwara, Atsushi; Uchiyama, Ikuo; Seto, Yasuhiko; Kanehisa, Minoru",Protein Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7528547/,167

There is an urgent need to train hospice palliative care teams (HPCTs) to enhance their ability to provide spiritual care. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a meaning-centered, spiritual care training program (McSCTP) for HPCTs (McSCTP-HPCTs). METHODS: The modules’ content was informed by Viktor Frankl’s meaning-centered logotherapy with its emphasis on spiritual resources, as well as the spiritual care model of the Interprofessional Spiritual Care Education Curriculum (ISPEC). Following development, we conducted a pilot test with four nurses. We used the results to inform the final program, which we tested in an intervention involving 13 members of HPCTs. We took measurements using self-administered questionnaires at three points before and after the intervention. Using descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test, we analyzed the participants’ demographic and career-related characteristics, as well as the degree of variance between three outcome variables: compassion fatigue (CF), spiritual care competencies (SCCs), and spiritual care therapeutics (SCT). RESULTS: We divided the McSCTP-HPCTs into five modules. Module I: The HPCTs’ SCC evaluation, understanding the major concepts of spiritual care and logotherapy; Modules II-IV: Meaning-centered interventions (MCIs) related to spiritual needs (existential, relational, and transcendental/religious); Module V: The process of meaning-centered spiritual care. The preliminary evaluation revealed significant differences in all three outcome variables at the posttest point (CF, p = 0.037; SCCs, p = 0.005; SCT, p = 0.002). At the four-week follow-up test point, we only found statistical significance with the SCCs (p = 0.006).

Our purpose is to provide a monitoring tool that enables world news to be detected in an SDG-oriented manner, by considering multilingual as well as wide geographic coverage. The association of the goals with news basis the World Bank Group Topical Taxonomy, from which the selection of search words approximates the 17 development goals. News is extracted from The GDELT Project (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) which gathers both printed as well as online news from around the world. 60 851 572 relevant news stories were identified in 2019. The intertwining of world news with SDGs as well as connections between countries are interpreted and highlight that even in the most SDG-sensitive countries, only 2.5% of the news can be attributed to the goals. Most of the news about sustainability appears in Africa as well as East and Southeast Asia, moreover typically the most negative tone of news can be observed in Africa. In the case of climate change (SDG 13), the United States plays a key role in both the share of news and the negative tone. Using the tools of network science, it can be verified that SDGs can be characterized on the basis of world news. This news-centred network analysis of SDGs identifies global partnerships as well as national stages of implementation towards a sustainable socio-environmental ecosystem. In the field of sustainability, it is vital to form the attitudes and environmental awareness of people, which strategic plans cannot address but can be measured well through the news.","Czvetkó, Tímea; Honti, Gergely; Sebestyén, Viktor; Abonyi, János",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868610/,167

Advances in synthetic biology have now made it possible for the virus to be synthesized in a laboratory, with methods publicly available. Smallpox introduction into a susceptible population, with increased immunosuppression and an aging population, raises questions of how vaccination should be used in an epidemic situation when supply may be limited. We constructed three modified susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models to simulate targeted, ring and mass vaccination in response to a smallpox outbreak in Sydney, Australia. We used age-specific distributions of susceptibility, infectivity, contact rates, and tested outputs under different assumptions. The number of doses needed of second- and third-generation vaccines are estimated, along with the total number of deaths at the end of the epidemic. We found a faster response is the key and ring vaccination of traced contacts is the most effective strategy and requires a smaller number of doses. However if public health authorities are unable to trace a high proportion of contacts, mass vaccination with at least 125,000 doses delivered per day is required. This study informs a better preparedness and response planning for vaccination in a case of a smallpox outbreak in a setting such as Sydney.","Costantino, Valentina; Kunasekaran, Mohana; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993194/,167

However, for patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery (EAS), the effect of inter-hospital transfer on outcomes is largely unknown. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study. Outcomes of transferred patients undergoing EAS were compared to patients primarily admitted to a tertiary care hospital from 01/2016 to 12/2018 using univariable and multivariable analyses. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Some 973 patients with a median (IQR) age of 58.1 (39.4–72.2) years and a median body mass index of 25.8 (22.5–29.3) kg/m(2) were included. The transfer group comprised 258 (26.3%) individuals and the non-transfer group 715 (72.7%). The population was stratified in three subgroups: (1) patients with low surgical stress (n = 483, 49.6%), (2) with hollow viscus perforation (n = 188, 19.3%) and (3) with potential bowel ischemia (n = 302, 31.1%). Neither in the low surgical stress nor in the hollow viscus perforation group was the transfer status associated with mortality. However, in the potential bowel ischemia group inter-hospital transfer was a predictor for mortality (OR 3.54, 95%CI 1.03–12.12, p = 0.045). Moreover, in the hollow viscus perforation group inter-hospital transfer was a predictor for reduced hospital length of stay (RC -10.02, 95%CI −18.14/−1.90, p = 0.016) and reduced severe complications (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.18–0.77, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Other than in patients with low surgical stress or hollow viscus perforation, in patients with potential bowel ischemia inter-hospital transfer was an independent predictor for higher mortality. Taking into account the time sensitiveness of bowel ischemia, efforts should be made to avoid inter-hospital transfer in this vulnerable subgroup of patients.","Lavanchy, Joël L.; Dubuis, Jean-Baptiste; Osterwalder, Alice; Winterhalder, Sebastian; Haltmeier, Tobias; Candinas, Daniel; Schnüriger, Beat",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8166360/,167

It is argued that conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems and changes in economic activities must be made to ward off new diseases, and why cooperation between ministries is critical to restrict the decline of biological diversity in a megadiverse country like India.","Nulkar, Gurudas; Bedarkar, Madhura; Ghate, Ketaki; Nulkar, Sakshi",Indian J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204827/,167

In the last century, it was reported that this molecule may be produced in high concentrations by several species belonging to the plant kingdom and stored in specialized tissues. In this review, the main information related to the chemistry of melatonin and its metabolism has been summarized. Furthermore, the biosynthetic pathway characteristics of animal and plant cells have been compared, and the main differences between the two systems highlighted. Additionally, in order to investigate the distribution of this indolamine in the plant kingdom, distribution cluster analysis was performed using a database composed by 47 previously published articles reporting the content of melatonin in different plant families, species and tissues. Finally, the potential pharmacological and biostimulant benefits derived from the administration of exogenous melatonin on animals or plants via the intake of dietary supplements or the application of biostimulant formulation have been largely discussed.","Mannino, Giuseppe; Pernici, Carlo; Serio, Graziella; Gentile, Carla; Bertea, Cinzia M.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8469784/,167

Here, we show the mechanism and diagnostic implications of FXII contact activation. Screening of recombinant FXII mutants identified a continuous stretch of residues Gln317–Ser339 that was essential for FXII surface binding and activation, thrombin generation and coagulation. Peptides spanning these 23 residues competed with surface-induced FXII activation. Although FXII mutants lacking residues Gln317–Ser339 were susceptible to activation by plasmin and plasma kallikrein, they were ineffective in supporting arterial and venous thrombus formation in mice. Antibodies raised against the Gln317–Ser339 region induced FXII activation and triggered controllable contact activation in solution leading to thrombin generation by the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The antibody-activated aPTT allows for standardization of particulate aPTT reagents and for sensitive monitoring of coagulation factors VIII, IX, XI.","Heestermans, Marco; Naudin, Clément; Mailer, Reiner K.; Konrath, Sandra; Klaetschke, Kristin; Jämsä, Anne; Frye, Maike; Deppermann, Carsten; Pula, Giordano; Kuta, Piotr; Friese, Manuel A.; Gelderblom, Mathias; Sickmann, Albert; Preston, Roger J.

By using multi-region input-output analysis, we find that China’s relative decoupling in the new normal is technology driven, evidenced by the narrowing gap between its technology-adjusted and non-adjusted consumption emissions. By applying structural decomposition analysis, we further explore the driving forces behind the slowdown in China’s imported emissions growth, finding that it is attributable to restructuring of import patterns resulting from changes in the structures of domestic demand. These changes could have been caused by China moving along the global value chain and rebalancing its industrial linkages toward trade in carbon-efficient goods to avoid transferring emissions-intensive production to other regions, indicating a shift to less emissions-intensive trade rather than pure outsourcing.","Mi, Zhifu; Zheng, Jiali; Green, Fergus; Guan, Dabo; Meng, Jing; Feng, Kuishuang; Liang, Xi; Wang, Shouyang",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482520/,167

Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as citrullination, carbamylation, and acetylation are correlated with the pathogenesis of RA. PTM and cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis, autophagy, NETosis, leukotoxic hypercitrullination (LTH), and necrosis are related to each other and induce autoantigenicity. Certain microbial infections, such as those caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella copri, can induce autoantigens in RA. Anti-modified protein antibodies (AMPA) containing anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), anti-carbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies, and anti-acetylated protein antibodies (AAPAs) play a role in pathogenesis as well as in prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis.

In the meanwhile, Fragmentation and Coagulation Process (FCP), a stochastic partition model, has recently been proposed for identifying dynamic customer groups and modeling their purchase behavior. However, FCP is not able to forecast the purchase behavior because such a data-driven method requires transaction observations to conduct clustering. To tackle this challenge, we propose FCP filter, a clustering-prediction framework based on FCP, which can forecast purchase behavior and filter random noise of individual transaction data. In our model, FCP clusters customers into groups by their temporal interests to filter random noise of individual transaction data. Then a predictor is built on grouped data. The predicted results are also fed to FCP to adjust the parameter for prior knowledge at the next time step. Our model is superior in capturing temporal dynamics and having flexible number of groups. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our model is able to discover the latent group of individual customers and provides accurate predictions for dynamic purchase behavior.","Zhang, Yuanzhe; Luo, Ling; Wang, Yang; Wang, Zhiyong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206192/,167

Since the pandemic reached Europe, the EU has adopted a number of trade-related measures, including the issuance of guidelines for national border management, as well as export authorisation requirements. On 14 March 2020, the Commission adopted “Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/402 of 14 March 2020 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation”, temporarily restricting exports of “personal protective equipment” to destinations outside of the EU. On 14 April 2020, the Commission announced that it would narrow down export authorisation requirements to protective masks only and extend the geographical and humanitarian exemptions. Governments around the world have been implementing trade-related measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some trade restrictive, but a number of countries have also called for the elimination of export controls and restrictions on essential goods. As the greater implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on trade are still difficult to assess, the emergency measures taken by affected countries already require legal scrutiny.

This study explores the experiences of post-injury care for individuals with cervical spinal cord injury and their family members during admissions in specialised and non-specialised units in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with individuals with a cervical spinal cord injury and their family member, focussing on the experience of care across units. Eight people with spinal cord injury levels from C2 to C6, were interviewed in their current care settings. Six participants had family members present to support them. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed with data inputted into NVivo for thematic analysis. RESULTS: The study identified six themes from the participant interviews that highlighted different experiences of care in non-specialised and specialised settings. A number of these were related to challenges with the system, whilst others were about the personal journey of recovery. The themes were titled as: adjustment, transitions, “the golden opportunity”, “when you can’t eat”, communication, and “in the hands of the nurses and doctors”. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst participants reported being well cared for in non-specialised units, they felt that they did not receive specialist care and this delayed their rehabilitation. Participants were dependent on healthcare professionals for information and care and at times lost hope for recovery. Staff in non-specialised units require training and guidance to help provide support for those with dysphagia and communication difficulties, as well as reassurance to patients and families whilst they wait for transfer to specialised units.","McRae, Jackie; Smith, Christina; Emmanuel, Anton; Beeke, Suzanne",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7443811/,167

Without a vaccine, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue for years and cause millions of deaths, primarily among the elderly and the chronically ill. A vaccine for the COVID-19 could safeguard community well-being, but cannot be counted upon at this point. We believe it is imperative for communities to form and implement strategies to manage the spread and impacts of COVID-19 and that understanding the overall death rate and for young people (ages 15–35) as well at the length of the pandemic in important to planning. We calculate an overall death rate at 1/116, a death rate of 1/3944 for young adults, and that at the current rate of infection the pandemic will last for just under 10 years or possibly indefinitely as there is no guarantee that immunity will last. Measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining are effective but have detrimental economic, educational, social and psychological impacts. Community leaders and organizers need to understand that a growing number of young people will likely not adhere to social distancing and self-quarantining indefinitely. We recommend that communities form and implement plans to managing the spread and impact of COVID-19 within a specific time frame and urge young people to adhere to measures to stop the spread for the specific time frame. Community plans should be based on a community development (CD) approach and should entail inclusive and participatory decision-making process that engaged young people. Communities should use this time to transitioning to a well-being-based local economy and implement interventions that allow for human interaction such as negative pressure ventilation and filtration of air in indoor spaces, availability of universal testing, contract tracing and the widespread use of personal powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs).","Bliss, Clinton; Musikanski, Laura; Phillips, Rhonda; Davidson, Larry",Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7443854/,167

During the past few months, we have witnessed an impressive number of initiatives to encourage networking opportunities, to foster interactions between the different stakeholders involved (health care, industry, governments, academics, ordinary people), and to develop innovative solutions and collaborative infrastructures in support of the health sector. Adopting an open and collaborative approach and joining forces is essential in the fight against the COVID‐19 crisis. Also, the involvement of crowds as innovation partners can be of great support. Therefore, our work aims to review and classify those initiatives, based on the crowdsourcing model, that have been put into place to face the emergency generated by the novel coronavirus pandemic. We illustrate the 16 crowdsourcing initiatives devoted to the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak that we identified, detailing their development and implementation. Then, we propose a classification of them, along two dimensions: type of crowdsourcing configuration and kind of tasks, being able to find a relationship between these two aspects. Evidence from the analyzed projects suggests that across disparate domains, crowdsourcing can be an effective strategy in the response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. To conclude, we suggest some important implications for innovation best practices and lessons that can be learned for the future: crowdsourcing, harnessing the power of crowds and online communities, can help tackle the COVID‐19 pandemic, by providing original, actionable, quick, and low‐cost solutions to the challenges of the current health and economic crisis.","Vermicelli, Silvia; Cricelli, Livio; Grimaldi, Michele",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753275/,167

In this paper, a hybrid forecasting model has been proposed to determine the number of confirmed cases for upcoming 10 days based on the earlier confirmed cases found in India. The proposed model is based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and mutation-based Bees Algorithm (mBA). The meta-heuristic Bees Algorithm (BA) has been modified applying 4 types of mutation, and mutation-based Bees Algorithm (mBA) is applied to enhance the performance of ANFIS by optimizing its parameters. Proposed mBA-ANFIS model has been assessed using COVID-19 outbreak dataset for India and USA, and the number of confirmed cases in the next 10 days in India has been forecasted. Proposed mBA-ANFIS model has been compared to standard ANFIS model as well as other hybrid models such as GA-ANFIS, DE-ANFIS, HS-ANFIS, TLBO-ANFIS, FF-ANFIS, PSO-ANFIS and BA-ANFIS. All these models have been implemented using Matlab 2015 with 10 iterations each.

However, as clinical procedures are a subjective assessment, the accuracy depends highly on the doctor’s experience. Motivated by this, a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis method was proposed for performing bone age assessment. Inspired by clinical approaches and aimed to reduce expensive manual annotations, informative regions localization based on a complete unsupervised learning method was firstly performed and an image-processing pipeline was proposed. Subsequently, an image model with pre-trained weights as a backbone was utilized to enhance the reliability of prediction.

53078,P078 Delivering far reaching patient education in rheumatological conditions and treatments: RadioRheumatology podcasts,2021-04-26,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This review is focused on enlisting viral proteins from different host sources, irrespective of their origin, that may act as future cancer curatives. Unlike the viral proteins that are responsible for tumor progression, these newly emerged viral proteins function as tumor suppressors. Their ability to regulate various cell signaling mechanisms specifically in cancer cells makes them interesting candidates to explore their use in cancer therapy. The discussion about such viral components may provide new insights into cancer treatment in the absence of any adverse effects to normal cells. The study also highlights avian viral proteins as a substitute to human oncolytic viruses for their ability to evade pre-existing immunity. ABSTRACT: Viruses are obligatory intracellular parasites that originated millions of years ago. Viral elements cover almost half of the human genome sequence and have evolved as genetic blueprints in humans. They have existed as endosymbionts as they are largely dependent on host cell metabolism. Viral proteins are known to regulate different mechanisms in the host cells by hijacking cellular metabolism to benefit viral replication. Amicable viral proteins, on the other hand, from several viruses can participate in mediating growth retardation of cancer cells based on genetic abnormalities while sparing normal cells. These proteins exert discreet yet converging pathways to regulate events like cell cycle and apoptosis in human cancer cells. This property of viral proteins could be harnessed for their use in cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss viral proteins from different sources as potential anticancer therapeutics.","Manocha, Ekta; Caruso, Arnaldo; Caccuri, Francesca",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125098/,167

In this context, we have gathered studies reported in the literature in which psychoactive benzodiazepine drugs were used as ligands in the preparation of organometallic and metal complexes and provide details on some of their biological effects. We also highlight that most commonly known benzodiazepine-based drugs display molecular features that allow the preparation of metallacycles via C-H activation. These organometallic compounds merit further attention regarding their potential biological effects, not only in terms of psychoactive drugs but also in the search for drug replacements, for example, for cancer treatments.","da Silva, Artur V.; Meneghetti, Simoni M.

53424,COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy: no increase in placental lesions,2021-05-22,"INTRODUCTION: There are concerns around the safety of performing surgery during COVID-19 outbreaks with few sources of robust evidence. METHOD: We analysed 5020 consecutive patients who underwent surgery during the acceleration phase of COVID-19 at our hospital from 31st January to 13th April 2020. Data were also analysed for all patients who had a COVID-19 positive test result during the same study period. RESULTS: 156 patients (3%) developed COVID-19 symptoms after surgery; 28 patients (<1%) subsequently had a positive swab result. All-cause mortality was 44 patients (0.9%); 33 deaths (75%) were due to non COVID-19 diagnoses. There were no adverse COVID-19 related outcomes in any of the 648 patients who had cancer operations. Of 28 COVID-19 positive patients, 11 died (8 orthopaedic, 2 urology, 1 vascular surgery) of which 10 had an emergency admission; all were over 70 years of age. Recent surgery was not an independent prognostic factor for survival after COVID-19 infection. 12% of positive COVID-19 swabs were from long-stay patients. CONCLUSIONS: Of 5020 operative patients, 0.2% died from COVID-19 and most complications were not related to the infection. With careful consideration, surgery can be provided safely during times of COVID-19 outbreaks with particular emphasis on avoiding in-hospital transmission.","Fifer, H; Coe, P; Geogloman, I; Qaiser, R; Saleh, A; Adair, R; Peter, M; Dobbins, B; Saha, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135829/,167

Multiple studies reports a reduction of STEMI hospitalizations rates during COVID 19 pandemic outbreak. Contradictory STEMI complications rates are reported during COVID 19 pandemic regarding case fatalities rates, cardiogenic shock, life threatening arrhythmias and others. Purpose. To evaluate the impact of the COVID 19 outbreak on STEMI patient outcomes and complication rates in country with low COVID 19 incidence and mortality and without changes in Cardiology hospital services. Methods. Was conducted a retrograde study collecting data for STEMI hospitalizations, revascularization procedures and case fatalities and other complications from March 9th 2020 (first COVID 19 case in our country) to April 30th (period of total lockdown) compared with the same period of 2019 in our center. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used to compare STEMI admissions and revascularization procedures and risk ratio (RR) to compare case fatality rate and other complications rate. RESULTS: Hospital admissions for STEMI declined during 2020 (COVID 19 period) from a total of 217 patients in 2019 to 155 patients hospitalization in 2020 representing IRR 0.72 (p = 0.009). Reduction were observed in the number of primary PCI from 168 procedures in 2019 to 113 in 2020 (IRR 0.67 p = 0.001). Symptom onset to our ICU (including regional transportation) was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (939.97 ± 1122 versus 436.15 ± 383 minutes p <0.0001) The STEMI case fatality was importantly increased during pandemic outbreak (13.55%) compared to 2019 (8.3%) (RR= 1.63 p = 0.001), but a similar a primary PCI-STEMI case fatality 6.2% versus 5.95%. Also an increase was observed for cardiogenic shock (IRR =1.75 p = 0.003). Results; Hospitalizations and related invazive revascularization procedures for STEMI significantly reduced during COVID 19 pandemic. We identified a substantial increase of STEMI case fatalities and cardiogenic shock during pandemic outbreak.

This heterogeneity is scarcely explored in very old male AD mice models due to their reduced survival. In the present work, using 915 (432 APP23 and 483 C57BL/6 littermates) mice, we confirmed the better survival curves in male than female APP23 mice and respective wildtypes, providing the chance to characterize behavioral signatures in middle-aged, old, and long-lived male animals. The sensitivity of a battery of seven paradigms for comprehensive screening of motor (activity and gait analysis), neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms was analyzed using a cohort of 56 animals, composed of 12-, 18- and 24-month-old male APP23 mice and wildtype littermates. Most variables analyzed detected age-related differences. However, variables related to coping with stress, thigmotaxis, frailty, gait, and poor cognition better discriminated the behavioral phenotype of male APP23 mice through the three old ages compared with controls. Most importantly, non-linear age- and genotype-dependent behavioral signatures were found in long-lived animals, suggesting crosstalk between chronological and biological/behavioral ages useful to study underlying mechanisms and distinct compensations through physiological and AD-associated aging.","Giménez-Llort, Lydia; Marin-Pardo, Daniela; Marazuela, Paula; Hernández-Guillamón, Mar",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8228433/,167

Among these discourses, coverage on influencers was prominent, likely as many of the issues arising from COVID-19 contingencies – such as digitalization, public messaging, and misinformation – are cornerstones of this digital economy. In response, this cross-cultural study draws on a corpus of Australian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean online news articles published between January and May 2020, to understand how local news ecologies were parsing the impacts of COVID-19 on influencers. From the coding of 150 news articles guided by Grounded Theory, this article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on influencers, and influencers’ engagements with and reactions to the pandemic. Our study of individual governments’ past engagements with their influencer industries suggest that local backstories and contexts are crucial to decipher why news angles tend to pitch particular stories on influencers.","Abidin, Crystal; Lee, Jin; Barbetta, Tommaso; Miao, Wei Shan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280558/,167

57285,ASPC President's Page: Advancing and Refining Cardiovascular Disease Prevention,2021-05-26,"A highly infectious novel coronavirus (now referred to as SARS-CoV-2) was first noted in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and by March 11, 2020, was declared a global pandemic by the WHO. The widespread community transmission of a virus, new to our species, continues to raise urgent questions about implications for pregnant women and those considering conception. Almost immediately, international committees, including ASRM and ESHRE, drew up guidelines to protect the public and our patients. Across the globe, clinics were closed, patients turned away and questions regarding spread of the virus, safety during early pregnancy and potential impact on fertility and pregnancy began to arise. Where are we now? What have we learned? And what more do we need to know to improve our ability to care for and counsel our patients? Clinic Practice – While there was considerable controversy in the U.S., closing clinics was the correct course of action when an unknown virus had entered our countries and so little was known and resources (think NY, think Italy) were inadequate. The majority of clinics pivoted to more virtual visits and stopped transfers and retrievals. The duration of these changes varied across states and countries, with most clinics now functioning at full capacity for procedures but still utilizing virtual visits for many patients. We will discuss what we learned from this process, including impact on clinics and patients, as well as the greater community in which we all live. Pregnancy – The physiology of pregnancy, including increased heart rate and oxygen consumption, decreased lung capacity and a shift away from cell-mediated immunity, all increased the risk for severe illness. Studies have now shown this increased risk for severe disease, mechanical ventilation and even death in pregnant women compared with their non-pregnant counterparts. Additionally, there is increased risk for pre-term labor and fetal death. Studies suggest infection earlier in pregnancy increases risk for complications. What about our patients? The first trimester is a highly critical period for fetal development. As a result, infectious and non-infectious exposures, occurring during the first trimester, are most likely to lead to severe effects on fetal development. Preliminary results no increased risk for pregnancy loss and no effect on nuchal translucency. However, some studies have shown the possibility of vertical transmission and increase in fetal inflammation. We will review the literature and update on current understanding of first trimester exposure and consequences for both mother and child. Infertility – SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for viral entry. The ACE2 receptor is present in both the male and female reproductive systems. Early case studies of severe cases of COVID-19 identified orchitis, while the presence in non-fatal disease remains controversial. Lowered sperm counts have been identified and some studies have found SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in the semen. ACE2 receptor is present in both the ovary and the endometrium, while infection is possible, there have been few studies specifically looking at these endpoints and no clear risk identified for women. Vaccination – The rapid development and deployment of effective vaccination has brought hope to end the pandemic, even as new variants are arising. While vaccine hesitancy is common in many places, the mis-information regarding association between vaccines and infertility has hit our field particularly hard. Updating information to share with our patients, colleagues and friends will be critical to move forward and combat the pandemic.

Their actions and attitudes, either in support of or opposition to public health recommendations, have resulted in widespread variation in local-level pandemic response. Despite evidence that religion significantly impacts the general public’s response to the pandemic, the influence of religion on officials’ behaviors and attitudes is unknown. Using a unique, two-wave, representative survey of frontline officials, we examine how religion influenced officials’ reported personal health behaviors (mask wearing, social distancing) and attitudes toward institutional reopenings. Results show high levels of compliance with public health recommendations, but religious nationalism negatively influences all outcomes. Other religious factors, like affiliation and attendance, vary in their influence and even work differently among officials compared to the general public. Frontline officials are key for understanding how religion influences the pandemic and state action more generally.","Adler, Gary J; Ortiz, Selena E; Plutzer, Eric; Mayrl, Damon; Coley, Jonathan S; Sager, Rebecca",Sociol Relig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499755/,167

Stroke, especially ischemic stroke, causes severe neural cell death, and no effective therapy is currently available for neuroregeneration after stroke. Although many therapies have been shown to be effective in preclinical studies of ischemic stroke, almost none of them passed clinical trials, and the reasons for most failures have not been well identified. In this review, we focus on several novel methods, such as traditional Chinese medicine, stem cell therapy, and exosomes that have not been used for ischemic stroke till recent decades. We summarize the proposed basic mechanisms underlying these therapies and related clinical results, discussing advantages and current limitations for each therapy emphatically. Based on the limitations such as side effects, narrow therapeutic window, and less accumulation at the injury region, structure transformation and drug combination are subsequently applied, providing a deep understanding to develop effective treatment strategies for ischemic stroke in the near future.","Yang, Lijun; Qian, Jing; Yang, Bo; He, Qiaojun; Wang, Jiajia; Weng, Qinjie",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514732/,167

Online survey questions considered “before” and “during” confinement. Confinement reduced all PA intensities (η(p)(2)=0.09–0.45, p<0.001) and increased daily sitting time (η(p)(2)=0.58, p<0.001). The largest reduction was in moderate intensity PA [metabolic equivalent of task-minutes/week (MET), η(p)(2)=0.45, p<0.001]. SQL decreased, with the score for “I am satisfied with my life” (η(p)(2)=0.42, p<0.001) decreasing from 28.4±5.7 to 20.6±9.7 arbitrary units (AU). Concerning SL, the largest change was detected for “the conditions of my life are excellent” (η(p)(2)=0.54, p<0.001). Time changes in all variables were demonstrative of large negative changes in both sexes. The difference in change between sexes was largest in terms of magnitude for the variable “the conditions of my life are excellent” (difference between groups, Δd=0.98).

Since WGS is unquestionably becoming a new foundation for molecular analyses, we decided to compare three currently used tools for variant calling of human whole genome sequencing data. We tested DeepVariant, a new TensorFlow machine learning-based variant caller, and compared this tool to GATK 4.0 and SpeedSeq, using 30×, 15× and 10× WGS data of the well-known NA12878 DNA reference sample. According to our comparison, the performance on SNV calling was almost similar in 30× data, with all three variant callers reaching F-Scores (i.e. harmonic mean of recall and precision) equal to 0.98. In contrast, DeepVariant was more precise in indel calling than GATK and SpeedSeq, as demonstrated by F-Scores of 0.94, 0.90 and 0.84, respectively.

Reply.,2020-05-15,"Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) extract (RE) has multiple pharmacological and biological activities, including use as a food additive and medicine. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary RE supplementation on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, intestinal morphology and microbiota of weaning piglets. A total of 192 crossbred weaned piglets [Duroc × (Large White × Landrace)] (initial body weight = 6.65 ± 0.33 kg, weaned days = 23 ± 1 d) were group housed (six pigs per pen; n = 8 pens/treatment). Pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based control diet or the basal diet supplemented with 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg RE. Pigs were allowed ad libitum access to fed for 21-d. The growth performance and apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, and intestinal morphology and antioxidant status were evaluated. The components of the microbial microflora were also determined in the cecal samples. Compared with the control, dietary supplementation with RE increased the final body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake (linear, P = 0.038, 0.016, and 0.009, respectively), and decreased the diarrhea ratio in piglets (linear, P < 0.05). The digestibility of crude protein (linear, P = 0.034) and gross energy (linear, P = 0.046) increased with treatment with RE. Piglets fed RE showed longer villus height (linear, P = 0.037 and 0.028, respectively) and villus height/crypt depth (linear, P = 0.004 and 0.012; quadratic, P = 0.023 and 0.036, respectively) in the jejunum and ileum, in addition to a lesser crypt depth in the jejunum (linear, P = 0.019) and ileum (quadratic, P = 0.042). The addition of RE increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (linear, P = 0.035 and 0.008 respectively) and glutathione peroxidase activity (linear, P = 0.027 and 0.039 respectively), and decreased the content of malondialdehyde (linear, P = 0.041 and 0.013; quadratic, P = 0.023 and 0.005 respectively) in the serum and liver. Dietary RE supplementation, compared with the control, increased the number of Bifidobacterium (linear, P = 0.034) and Bacteroidetes (linear, P = 0.029), while decreased Escherichia coli (linear, P = 0.008; quadratic, P = 0.014) in the cecal contents. Thus, dietary RE supplementation can improve growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, intestinal morphology and the microbiota in weaned piglets, and 200 mg/kg may be considered the optimum dosage.","Yang, Mei; Yin, Yexin; Wang, Fang; Bao, Xuetai; Long, Lina; Tan, Bie; Yin, Yulong; Chen, Jiashun",Journal of animal science,https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skab237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370023/,167

The process is initiated by fusion peptides that are small, hydrophobic components of viral membrane-embedded glycoproteins and are typically conserved within virus families. Here, we attempted to identify the correct fusion peptide region in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of dual membrane systems with varied oligomeric units of putative candidate peptides. Of all of the systems tested, only a trimeric unit of a 40-amino-acid region (residues 816-855 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike) was effective in triggering the initial stages of membrane fusion, within 200 ns of simulation time. Association of this trimeric unit with dual membranes resulted in the migration of lipids from the upper leaflet of the lower bilayer toward the lower leaflet of the upper bilayer to create a structural unit reminiscent of a fusion bridge. We submit that residues 816-855 of Spike represent the bona fide fusion peptide of SARS-CoV-2 and that computational methods represent an effective way to identify fusion peptides in viral glycoproteins.","Borkotoky, Subhomoi; Dey, Debajit; Banerjee, Manidipa",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412850/,167

Through defining education outcomes in a work -based context, EPAs offer potential to identify skill gaps in individual or student cohorts and focus improvements. This scoping review aims to map available evidence to provide an overview of EPA use in entry-level healthcare education (Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health) and understand how EPAs are being used and in what contexts. METHOD The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology was used to explore how and in what context EPAs are being used in entry level health professional education. Databases searched include CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science and PsychInfo. RESULTS A total of 748 abstracts were returned after duplicates removed, 127 full-text articles were screened with 30 included for data extraction. Publications in this area have recently accelerated with disciplines of professions of medicine, pharmacy, dietetics and physician assistants reporting on EPA development, implementation and evaluation. EPA use has been reported in the USA, Canada, Europe Australia and Central America. CONCLUSION Major motivations reported for EPA use is to improve patient safety by aligning performance and expectations and to improve student assessment. Several studies report on the use of EPAs to evaluate different curriculum models or identify curriculum gaps. Entrustable Professional Activities are increasingly well accepted for workplace assessment in multiple entry level health professions and offer strong potential for application to education research.","Bramley, Andrea Louise; McKenna, Lisa",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884655/,167

63398,COVID-19: A message of hope from a young girl with severe cystic fibrosis.,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adrenalectomy via three or four trocars is a well-established procedure. This report describes the initial experience with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) using the transperitoneal approach for left adrenalectomy. METHODS Between April 2010 and August 2011, all consecutive patients with adrenal masses, including Conn's syndrome, Cushing's adenoma, and nonfunctional adrenal tumors, who agreed to undergo SILS adrenalectomy were included in a prospective study. The left 2.5-cm subcostal incision was the sole point of entry. Data of patients who underwent SILS adrenalectomy were compared with those from an uncontrolled group of patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy during the same study period. RESULTS There were 20 patients in each study group (20 men, 20 women; mean age [SD] = 50 [6.5] years). SILS was successfully performed and none of the patients required conversion to an open procedure. In one case of SILS procedure, an additional lateral 5-mm port was needed for retraction of the kidney. The mean (SD) duration of the operation was 95 (20) min in the SILS group and 80 (8) min in the conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy group (p = 0.052). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. There were no differences between the two study groups with respect to postoperative pain, number of patients who resumed oral intake within the first 24 h, final pathologic diagnosis, and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION SILS left adrenalectomy is a technically feasible and safe procedure in carefully selected patients. The definitive clinical, aesthetic and functional advantages of this technique require further analysis.","Vidal, Óscar; Astudillo, Emiliano; Valentini, Mauro; Ginestà, Cesar; García-Valdecasas, Juan C; Fernandez-Cruz, Laureano",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1555-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22392358/,167
63617,Global evidence on occupational sun exposure and keratinocyte cancers: a systematic review.,2020-04-22,"BACKGROUND The da Vinci Single-Port (SP) robot is a novel platform designed to facilitate single-incision robotic surgery (rSILS). The objective of this study was to describe our initial experience using this platform for SP robotic (SPr) right colectomy. METHODS Under a Food and Drug Administration-regulated feasibility study and Institutional Review Board approval, a patient with cecal adenocarcinoma underwent an SPr right colectomy. The primary endpoint was the safety and feasibility of the first SPr right colectomy performed in the USA. Secondary endpoints included perioperative metrics, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS An SPr Standard right colectomy was performed through a 4-cm single incision without the need for conversion or additional port placement. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL and there were no intraoperative complications. The robot was docked once with a docking time of 19 min. Total console time was 116 min and operative time was 219 min. The patient tolerated clear liquids on postoperative day (POD) 0 and a low-residue diet on POD 1. The patient had flatus and a bowel movement on POD 1. She was discharged home on POD 3. Final pathology showed pT3N0 cecal adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 0/24 lymph nodes positive for disease. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience demonstrates that an SPr right colectomy is feasible and can be safely completed. We completed an oncologic resection of a cecal adenocarcinoma without complications. The SP robot facilitates the utilization of robotic technology in a single-incision platform to perform colorectal procedures and offers promising benefits in the advancement of robotic surgery.","Marks, J H; Kunkel, E; Salem, J; Martin, C; Schoonyoung, H P; Agarwal, S",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-020-02218-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451805/,167

STUDY DESIGN Prospective study. ANIMALS Fifteen healthy research mares. METHODS Healthy mares with normal ovarian palpation and ultrasonographic appearance were enrolled. Horses were restrained in standing stocks and sedated. A right or left paralumbar ovariectomy was performed with a laparoscopic portal and 2 instrument portals. Ovaries were excised with traumatic forceps and a blunt tip vessel sealer and divider. Temperatures of the vessel sealer and divider were recorded with a thermocouple device adhered to the tip of the instrument. Variables were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). RESULTS Surgical time was 30 minutes (IQR, 25-32) including use of the vessel sealer and the divider for 4.1 minutes (IQR, 3.2-5.8). The tip of the instrument reached temperatures of 77°C (IQR, 72-85) during activation and 64°C (IQR, 61-67) at end cycle. The median increase in end-cycle instrument tip temperature per activation cycle was 2°C (IQR, -1-6). All mares returned to their intended use. CONCLUSION Despite the instrument temperatures observed during unilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy, surgical complications were minimal. The clinical relevance of the increase in instrument tip temperature of the vessel sealer and divider is presently unclear, but surgeons should use the instrument with caution, especially in close proximity to viscera. The increase in temperature observed at the tip of the vessel sealer and divider during unilateral ovariectomy could be associated with morbidity. The clinical relevance of instrument tip heating during other procedures, such as adhesiolysis and intestinal resection, is unknown and should be evaluated.","Easley, Jeremiah T; McGilvray, Kirk C; Hendrickson, Dean A; Bruemmer, Jason; Hackett, Eileen S",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29205394/,167
63890,Linking chronic periodontitis and oral cancer: A review.,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND The average life expectancy is increasing worldwide, surpassing 80 years in some countries. Recently, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) using modern devices and techniques has led to improved clinical outcomes following acute ischemic stroke. However, thus far, it remains uncertain whether MT is effective in elderly patients aged over 80 years. METHODS Between July 2013 and June 2016, 207 patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation received MT at our center. The applied MT strategies were forced arterial suction thrombectomy (FAST) and stent retriever thrombectomy. Patients were divided into those <80 years (n = 173) and those ≥80 years (n = 34). We compared clinical and angiographic parameters between groups. RESULTS The median age was 67.5 in the younger group and 82 in the elderly group; 92.5% of the younger group and 70.6% of the elderly group received MT via the FAST technique. Angiographic outcomes, including procedural time, mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion (85.5% vs. 82.4%, p = 0.633), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, were not different between the groups. A favorable clinical outcome rate was significantly higher in the younger group (62.4% vs. 44.1%, p = 0.047). Younger age, a low NIHSS score, and fast onset to reperfusion time were favorable prognostic factors in elderly patients. CONCLUSION Modern MT in elderly patients with acute ischemic stroke is safe and effective compared to younger patients despite a lower favorable clinical outcome. Our findings may suggest that an appropriate MT strategy with respect to the location of the target occlusion and vascular tortuosity might be helpful to achieve fast reperfusion and improved outcomes for elderly patients.","Son, Seungnam; Kang, Dong-Hun; Hwang, Yang-Ha; Kim, Yong-Sun; Kim, Yong-Won",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-017-3269-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28730457/,167

Our study fills this critical gap by systematically reviewing studies that examine this relationship. We apply Aday and Andersen's Access Framework to operationalize access to care. We also use this framework to map components of access to care that may relate to NP SOP through concepts identified in this review. Our findings suggest that full state-level NP SOP policy is associated with increases in various components of access to care, but additional work is needed to evaluate causality and underlying mechanisms behind this policy's effect on access.

METHODS In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0%; p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition. They could show atypical symptoms without fever or cough and multiple organ dysfunction. Old-old patients tend to have more complications than young-old patients during hospitalization. Careful nursing, observation, and systemic treatment are very important in elderly patients.","Guo, Ting; Shen, Qinxue; Guo, Wei; He, Wenlong; Li, Jinhua; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Yunnian; Zhou, Zhiguo; Deng, Dingding; Ouyang, Xiaoli; Xiang, Zhi; Jiang, Minyan; Liang, Minyong; Huang, Peng; Peng, Zaimei; Xiang, Xudong; Liu, Wenlong; Luo, Hong; Chen, Ping; Peng, Hong",Gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000508734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32474561/,167

Diabetic patients are more susceptible to COVID-19. Since the mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes is on the top of list, hyperglycemia is considered an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19. Up to now, there is few effective treatment for severe patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Clinical studies observed that cytokine storms existed in patients with severe COVID-19. Sustained high levels of cytokines cause diffuse damage to pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging therapeutic method in the field of anti-infection, which can activate the self-protective immune response, suppress excessive inflammatory response, and be used to assist the treatment of traditional drugs to shorten the course of disease. Metformin has been shown to be effective in HDT and can assist in the treatment of the viral and bacterial infectious disease. This paper discusses the rationality and potential therapeutic mechanism of metformin in the treatment of severe COVID-19. It was speculated that the use of metformin for controlling blood glucose in severe COVID-19 patients with diabetes may prevent or inhibit the occurrence of ARDS, thereby reducing the mortality of COVID-19 patients. The possible mechanism is that metformin could inhibit cytokine storm via suppressing interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, prevent the process of lung fibrosis, suppress endocytosis, thereby elevating angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression.","Pan, Yonghong; Han, Rui; He, Yong",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200514-00662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081905/,167

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical significance of renal, liver, and lipid testing. METHODS We reviewed the charts of 261 PWH who initiated care at an academic HIV clinic between 1/1/16 and 12/21/18. Analysis included one-sided binomial exact tests and multiple linear, Poisson, and Beta regression models. RESULTS The most common abnormality was a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min (10%). Age < 40 years [estimated relative rate (rr) 0.019, CI 0.003-0.14], cobicistat (rr 0.178, 95% CI 0.084-0.378), and tenofovir alafenamide were associated with a decreased risk of GFR < 60 ml/min. An increased AST or ALT ≥ 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) was found in 5% and 3%, respectively. Hepatitis C and use of darunavir and lopinavir were associated with increased AST or ALT. When a GFR was < 60 ml/min or an AST or ALT was ≥ 2X ULN, no action was taken in 53% of cases. In 18% of cases the only intervention was repeat testing. The most common interventions after lipid results were calculation of a 10-year cardiovascular risk score (31%) and addition of a statin (18%). Taking action after lipid results was strongly associated with age ≥ 40 (rr 0.37, 95% CI 3.0-18.3).

However, the source, pathways, and influence factors of house dust and the association of house dust with child inflammation in an e-waste recycling area are not well-known. This study investigated dust trace elements in children's living environment and the associations of house dust trace elements with influence factors and child inflammation. A total of 108 dust samples from children's residences, roads, and kindergartens in Guiyu (an exposed area) and Haojiang and Shantou urban areas (reference areas) were collected and analyzed, as well as children's questionnaire data. The Mann-Whitney U test found there were higher trace element concentrations in road dust (Co, Ni, and Cu), kindergarten dust (Al, V, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn), and house dust (V, Co, Cu, As, and Cd) in Guiyu than in Haojiang and Shantou urban areas (P < 0.05). Our analysis showed that house dust and road dust have similar distribution patterns of trace elements. Spearman's correlations showed close relationships among quantities of trace elements (P < 0.05). Higher trace element concentrations in dust were found in houses that used indoor shoe cabinets and opened windows frequently (P < 0.05). In houses of children with airway inflammation, higher dust Ba concentrations were found (P < 0.05), and if their fathers did not work with e-waste, we found higher dust Pb concentrations (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05). Health assessments showed a high risk of exposure through ingestion and an acceptable risk of exposure through inhalation of dust trace elements for children. However, relationships between airway inflammation and house dust trace elements showed the inhalation risk might be underestimated. This study suggests trace element exposure via dust poses a health risk for children living in e-waste recycling areas.","Xu, Ruibin; Zheng, Xiangbin; Lin, Yucong; Lin, Ciming; Guo, Yufeng; Huo, Xia",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118658/,167

However, there are unsolved ambiguities underlying mechanisms for this growth signaling thereby creating therapeutic complications. This study shows that a vital component of the pathway CRAF is directly impacted by an end product of the cascade, glutathione transferases (GST) P1 (GSTP1), driving a previously unrecognized autocrine cycle that sustains proliferation of mKRAS and mBRAF cancer cells, independent of oncogenic stimuli. The CRAF interaction with GSTP1 occurs at its N-terminal regulatory domain, CR1 motif, resulting in its stabilization, enhanced dimerization, and augmented catalytic activity. Consistent with the autocrine cycle scheme, silencing GSTP1 brought about significant suppression of proliferation of mKRAS and mBRAF cells in vitro and suppressed tumorigenesis of the xenografted mKRAS tumor in vivo. GSTP1 knockout mice showed significantly impaired carcinogenesis of mKRAS colon cancer. Consequently, hindering the autocrine loop by targeting CRAF/GSTP1 interactions should provide innovative therapeutic modalities for these cancers.","Niitsu, Yoshiro; Sato, Yasushi; Takanashi, Kunihiro; Hayashi, Tsuyoshi; Kubo-Birukawa, Naoko; Shimizu, Fumiko; Fujitani, Naoki; Shimoyama, Rai; Kukitsu, Takehiro; Kurata, Wataru; Tashiro, Yasuyuki; Listowsky, Irving",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2000361117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719131/,167
67852,COVID-19 and Clinical Trials: Current Challenges and Future Directions.,2021-01-22,"BACKGROUND The development of carbohydrate-binding agents as novel therapeutics for the inhibition of highly glycosylated enveloped viruses has generated much attention in recent literature. Possessing a potential dual mode of action by inhibiting virus entry and exposing the virion to neutralization by the host immune system upon the deletion of envelope glycans under drug pressure, these substances might provide a new direction in antiviral treatment. Phenylboronic acids are widely known to bind the cis-diol functionality of carbohydrate structures, thereby identifying themselves as potential lead structures. To date, few details have been disclosed of the structure-activity relationship of these substances in correlation to their antiviral activity. METHODS In this study, a compound library of a diverse range of ortho-, meta- and para- ring-substituted monophenylboronic acids and glutamine phenylboronic acid analogues was prepared, characterized and evaluated to probe antiviral activity versus a broad range of (enveloped) viruses. RESULTS The compounds described herein lack antiviral activity. They also did not show measurable binding to HIV type-1 (HIV-1) gp120, using surface plasmon resonance technology. However, of note is the general lack of toxicity, which suggests that further investigation of the compounds as potential therapeutics is needed. CONCLUSIONS The monophenylboronic acids tested exhibited no antiviral activity as potential carbohydrate binders versus a broad range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The compounds tested did not bind HIV-1 gp120, possibly because of their small size and lack of multivalency.","Trippier, Paul C; McGuigan, Christopher; Balzarini, Jan",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp1632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20710065/,167

METHODS This single-center retrospective chart review included patients 21 years of age and younger with a preoperative diagnosis of appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy from January 2010 through December 2015. Cases of gangrenous and perforated appendicitis were excluded. Subgroup analyses of patients with acute appendicitis were performed. Operative time (OT), length of stay (LOS), and cost were compared between groups stratified by body mass index (BMI) and operative technique. RESULTS A total of 625 appendectomies were performed-457 for acute appendicitis. Sixty-eight patients were overweight. The SP technique (n = 30) had shorter OT (median minutes, 41 vs 68; P < .001), lower cost (median , $5741 vs $8530; P < .001), and shorter LOS (median hours, 16 vs 19; P = .045) than the TP technique had (n = 38). Seventy patients were obese: 19 were treated with SP and 51 with TP. LOS did not differ significantly between the SP and TP groups, but subjects treated with SP had shorter OT (median minutes, 39 vs 63; P < .001) and lower cost (median, $6401 vs $8205; P = .043). CONCLUSIONS The SP technique for acute appendicitis was found to have a significantly shorter OT and lower cost in all weight groups. There were minimal differences in LOS.

68717,"Covid-19, Angiogenesis, and ARDS Endotypes.",2020-05-21,"BACKGROUND Uncertainties remain about the current risk of myocardial infarction (MI) after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. METHODS AND RESULTS We undertook a systematic review to estimate the long-term risk of MI, compared to recurrent stroke, with temporal trends in ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack patients. Annual risks and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of MI and recurrent stroke were estimated using random-effect meta-analyses. We calculated incidence ratios of MI/recurrent stroke, for fatal and nonfatal events, using similar analyses. Rate ratios for MI in patients with potential risk factors compared to those without were calculated using Poisson regression.A total of 58 studies (131 299 patients) with a mean (range) follow-up of 3.5 (1.0-10.0) years were included. The risk of MI was 1.67%/y (95% CI 1.36-1.98, Phet<0.001 for heterogeneity) and decreased over time (Pint=0.021); 96% of the heterogeneity between studies was explained by study design, study period, follow-up duration, mean age, proportion of patients on antithrombotic therapy, and incident versus combined ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. The risk of recurrent stroke was 4.26%/y (95% CI 3.43-5.09, Phet<0.001), with no change over time (Pint=0.63). The risk of fatal MI was half the risk of recurrent strokes ending in fatality (incidence ratio=0.51, 95% CI 0.14-0.89, Phet=0.58). The risk of nonfatal MI was 75% smaller than the risk of recurrent nonfatal stroke (incidence ratio=0.25, 95%CI 0.02-0.50, Phet=0.68). Male sex, hypertension, coronary and peripheral artery diseases were associated with a doubled risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS After ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack, the risk of MI is currently <2%/y, and recurrent stroke is a more common cause of death than MI.","Boulanger, Marion; Béjot, Yannick; Rothwell, Peter M; Touzé, Emmanuel",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.117.007267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348322/,167

The aim of our work was to describe country-level data (the number of patients with stroke, proportion of patients with acute stroke, TIAs, patients treated with IVT or MT, DNT and ONT) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. METHODS The study examined data from the stroke register at the National Health Information Centre. Data from three time periods (1: March-April 2020; 2: March-April 2019 and 3: January-February 2020) were compared using an independent sample t-test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two sample rank-sum test. RESULTS The number of stroke patients admitted to hospitals in Slovakia during the COVID-19 period showed a decrease (1673 versus 2328 in period 2 and 2155 in period 3). The proportions of patients with TIA remained the same in periods 1 and 2 (9.7 vs 11.7%) and in periods 1 and 3 (9.7 vs 11.8%). The percentage of patients treated with IVT during the pandemic (22.4%) did not differ from period 2 (20.0%) or period 3 (21.4%). No difference was found in the rate of MT between the COVID-19 period (10.2%) and the same period in 2019 (10.7%) and January-February 2020 (13.1%). Median DNT remained unchanged in periods 1 (30 min), 2 (35 min) and 3 (30 min) no differences were found in median ONT in periods 1 (130 min), 2 (130 min) and 3 (140 min). CONCLUSION We found a decreased number of stroke patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in Slovakia, but no evidence for a change in the quality of acute stroke care.","Gdovinová, Zuzana; Vitková, Marianna; Baráková, Anna; Cvopová, Alena",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185918/,167

To this end, this research sought to check the performance of locally isolated hydrolase-producing bacteria (HPB) to improve food waste biodegradation rate. Two under-explored HPB identified as Bacillus paralicheniformis GRA2 and Bacillus velezensis TAP5 were able to produce maximum amylase, cellulase, protease and lipase activities, and demonstrated a significant hydrolase synergy in co-culture fermentation. In vitro biodegradation analysis of both autoclaved and non-autoclaved FW revealed that the HPB inoculation was effective to degrade total solids (>62%), protein (>19%), total fat (>51), total sugar (>86%), reducing sugar (>38%) and starch (>50%) after 8-day incubation. All co-culture treatments were recorded superior to the respective monocultures and the uninoculated control. The results of FW biodegradation using batch-biodigester trial indicated that the 1500 mL and 1000 mL inoculum size of HPB inoculant reached a plateau on the 4th day, with gross biodegradation percentage (GBP) of >85% as compared to control (66.4%). The 1000 mL inoculum was sufficient to achieve the maximum GBP (>90%) of FW after an 8-day biodigestion in a FWB.","Roslan, Muhamad Aidilfitri Mohamad; Jefri, Nur Qaiyyum Ummi Aiman; Ramlee, Nurhidayah; Rahman, Nor Aini Abdul; Chong, Nur Hazlin Hazrin; Bunawan, Hamidun; Bharudin, Izwan; Kadir, Mohd Hafiz Abd; Mohammad, Masita; Razali, Halim",Saudi journal of biological sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.02.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012331/,167

The recent literature underscores the need to implement protocols for symptom control and the training of non-specialists by palliative care teams. AIM The aim of the study was to describe a palliative care unit's consultation and assistance intervention at the request of an Infectious Diseases Unit during the COVID-19 pandemic, determining what changes needed to be made in delivering palliative care. DESIGN This is a single holistic case study design using data triangulation, for example, audio recordings of team meetings and field notes. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS This study was conducted in the Palliative Care Unit of the AUSL-IRCCS hospital of Reggio Emilia, which has no designated beds, consulting with the Infectious Diseases Unit of the same hospital. RESULTS A total of 9 physicians and 22 nurses of the Infectious Diseases Unit and two physicians of the Palliative Care Unit participated in the study.Our Palliative Care Unit developed a feasible 18-day multicomponent consultation intervention. Three macro themes were identified: (1) new answers to new needs, (2) symptom relief and decision-making process, and (3) educational and training issues. CONCLUSION From the perspective of palliative care, some changes in usual care needed to be made. These included breaking bad news, patients' use of communication devices, the limited time available for the delivery of care, managing death necessarily only inside the hospital, and relationships with families.","Tanzi, S; Alquati, S; Martucci, G; De Panfilis, L",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216320947289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736486/,167

BACKGROUND Exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with the development of lens opacities. ICs and cath-lab staff can receive high doses of ionizing radiation without protection, and may thus be at risk for lens opacity formation. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study at an interventional cardiology conference. Study participants completed a questionnaire pertaining to occupational exposure to radiation and potential confounders for the development of cataracts, followed by slit-lamp examination and grading of lens findings. RESULTS A total of 117 attendees participated in the study, including 99 (85%; 49 ± 11 years-old; 82% male) with occupational exposure to ionizing radiation and 18 (15%; 39 ± 12 years-old; 61% male) unexposed controls. The prevalence of overall cortical and posterior subcapsular lens changes (including subclinical findings) was higher in exposed participants compared with controls (47 vs. 17%, P = 0.015). Occupational exposure and age over 60 were independent predictors of lens changes (odds ratio [95% CI]: 6.07 [1.38-43.45] and 7.72 [1.60-43.34], respectively). The prevalence of frank opacities was low and similar between the two groups (14 vs. 6%, P = 0.461). Most lens findings consisted of subclinical changes in the periphery of the lens without impact on visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS Compared with unexposed controls, ICs and cath-lab staff had a higher prevalence of lens changes that may be attributable to ionizing radiation exposure. While most of these changes were subclinical, they are important due to the potential to progress to clinical symptoms, highlighting the importance of minimizing staff radiation exposure.","Karatasakis, Aris; Brilakis, Harilaos S; Danek, Barbara A; Karacsonyi, Judit; Martinez-Parachini, Jose Roberto; Nguyen-Trong, Phuong-Khanh J; Alame, Aya J; Roesle, Michele K; Rangan, Bavana V; Rosenfield, Kenneth; Mehran, Roxana; Mahmud, Ehtisham; Chambers, Charles E; Banerjee, Subhash; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.27173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28707381/,167

The objective of this study was to understand the factors contributing to the perceived stress levels of HCWs in a public primary care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their training, protection and support (TPS), job stress (JS), and perceived stigma and interpersonal avoidance. METHODS This cross-sectional study using an electronic self-administered questionnaire was conducted at the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics in March 2020. Data was collected anonymously. Analysis was performed using regression modelling. RESULTS The response rate was 69.7% (n = 1,040). The mean perceived stress level of HCWs in various departments ranged from 17.2 to 20.3. Respondents who reported higher perceived stress were those who made alternative living arrangements, were more affected by the current pandemic, reported higher JS and were Muslims. Respondents who reported lower perceived stress were those who had been through the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic in 2009 as HCWs, and those who had higher confidence in the organisation's TPS. CONCLUSION All HCWs, regardless of scope of work, were similarly stressed by the current pandemic compared to the general population. Improving the confidence of HCWs in their training, protection and the support of personal protective equipment, and retaining experienced HCWs who can provide advice and emotional support to younger colleagues are important. Adequate psychological support for HCWs in the pandemic can be transformed into reserves of psychological resilience for future disease outbreaks.","Lee, Eng Sing; Tan, Shu Yun; Lee, Poay Sian Sabrina; Koh, Hui Li; Soon, Shok Wen Winnie; Sim, Kang; Tang, Wern Ee; Chong, Phui-Nah",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264830/,167

Available data on incidence, risk factors and clinical significance of chyle leak are highly heterogeneous. METHODS For this cohort study all patients who underwent pancreatic surgery between January 2008 and December 2012 were identified from a prospective database. Chyle leak was defined as any drainage output with triglyceride content of 110 mg/dl or more. Risk factors for chyle leak were assessed by univariable and multivariable analyses. The clinical relevance of chyle leak was evaluated using hospital stay and resolution by 14 days for short-term outcome and overall survival for long-term outcome. RESULTS Chyle leak developed in 346 (10·4 per cent) of 3324 patients. Pre-existing diabetes, resection for malignancy, distal pancreatectomy, duration of surgery 180 min or longer, and concomitant pancreatic fistula or abscess were independent risk factors for chyle leak. Both isolated chyle leak and coincidental chyle leak (with other intra-abdominal complications) were associated with prolonged hospital stay. Some 178 (87·7 per cent) of 203 isolated chyle leaks and 90 (70·3 per cent) of 128 coincidental chyle leaks resolved with conservative management within 14 days. Initial and maximum drainage volumes were associated with duration of hospital stay and success of therapy by 14 days. Impact on survival was restricted to chyle leaks that persisted at 14 days in patients with cancer undergoing palliative surgery. CONCLUSION Chyle leak is a relevant complication, with an incidence of more than 10 per cent after pancreatic surgery, and has a major impact on hospital stay. Drainage volume is associated with hospital stay and success of therapy.","Strobel, O; Brangs, S; Hinz, U; Pausch, T; Hüttner, F J; Diener, M K; Schneider, L; Hackert, T; Büchler, M W",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27763684/,167

Two weeks postoperatively, slitlamp examination showed greyish-white lesions in the donor-host interface. Corneal scraping and donor broth culture tested negative for both bacteria and fungi. In vivo confocal microscopy showed elongated particles resembling Candida pseudofilaments. Despite antimicrobial therapy, the clinical picture worsened and surgical approach was chosen: the graft was peeled off, inverted (epithelium facing down) and ex vivo photoactivated chromophore for infectious keratitis-corneal collagen cross-linking (PACK-CXL) was performed; the recipient bed was washed with antibiotics/antifungals and the graft was resutured. Microbiological and histological evaluations of biopsy specimen tested positive for Candida albicans. Postoperative slitlamp examination revealed a progressive recovery of graft transparency with disappearance of the infiltrates. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of ex vivo PACK-CXL on inverted DALK graft for the treatment of interface infectious keratitis.

73179,[COVID-19: Questions and answers from Infectious Diseases Specialty].,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether the route and surgical technique by which hysterectomy is performed influence the incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of total hysterectomy cases performed at Brigham and Woman's Hospital or Faulkner Hospital during 2009 through 2011. RESULTS During the study period, 2382 total hysterectomies were performed; 23 of these (0.96%) were diagnosed with cuff dehiscence, and 4 women had recurrent dehiscence. Both laparoscopic (odds ratio, 23.4; P = .007) and robotic (odds ratio, 73; P = .0006) hysterectomies were associated with increased odds of cuff dehiscence in a multivariate regression analysis. The type of energy used during colpotomy, mode of closure (hand sewn, laparoscopic suturing, or suturing assisted by a device), and suture material did not differ significantly between groups; however, continuous suturing of the cuff was a protective factor (odds ratio, 0.24; P = .03). Women with dehiscence had more extensive procedures, as well as an increased incidence of additional major postoperative complications (17.4% vs 3%, P = .004). CONCLUSION The rate of cuff dehiscence in our cohort correlates with the current literature. This study suggests that the risk of dehiscence is influenced mainly by the scope and complexity of the surgical procedure. It seems that different colpotomy techniques do not influence the rate of cuff dehiscence; however, continuous suturing of the cuff may be superior to interrupted suturing.","Fuchs Weizman, Noga; Einarsson, Jon I; Wang, Karen C; Vitonis, Allison F; Cohen, Sarah L",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2013.00351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25901104/,167

Due to the spread of similar species of the Culex mosquitoes in India, there is a need to understand the replication kinetics of this virus in mosquito models. As a part of preparedness and to identify the presence of this CQV in humans and swine, this study was carried out to develop diagnostic tests. Methods Serological and molecular diagnostic assays were developed for testing the mosquito population, human and swine serum samples. In this line, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid (S) genes-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed for CQV. Real-time RT-PCR was used for screening of retrospectively collected human serum samples (n=1020) with acute febrile illness during 2014-2017. Simultaneously, an in-house anti-CQV swine and human IgG ELISAs were also developed to detect anti-CQV IgG antibody. Human serum samples (n=883) with post-onset of disease (POD) >4 days and swine serum samples (n=459) were tested for the presence of anti-CQV IgG antibodies. CQV NIV 612,045 isolate was used for susceptibility and replication kinetics experiment using three different species of mosquitoes to understand its behaviour in Indian mosquitoes. Results All human serum samples (n=1020) screened for the presence of CQV using real-time RT-PCR were found to be negative. Anti-CQV IgG antibody positivity was recorded in two of 883 human serum samples tested. Virus susceptibility experiments indicated that three species of mosquito, namely Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus supported multiplication of CQV by intrathoracic as well as artificial membrane/oral feeding routes. Interpretation & conclusions Anti-CQV IgG antibody positivity in human serum samples tested and the replication capability of CQV in mosquitoes indicated a possible disease causing potential of CQV in Indian scenario. Screening of more human and swine serum samples using these assays is required as a proactive measure for understanding the prevalence of this neglected tropical virus.","Shete, Anita; Yadav, Pragya D; Gokhale, Mangesh; Jain, Rajlaxmi; Pardeshi, Prachi; Majumdar, Triparna; Mourya, Devendra T",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1195_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719230/,167

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity of healing any divide between organized medicine and state and local health officials seems self-evident. Using the recommendations abstracted from a 2005 article by Dr. Ronald Davis, ""Marriage Counseling for Medicine and Public Health,"" this cross-sectional study explores the formal relationships that existed between state-level public health and medical practice across the U.S. at the end of 2019. METHODS A questionnaire was distributed to every state's senior public health official and medical society executive (N=104) between August and December 2019 to examine the extent of these entities' partnerships. Analysis was completed in January 2020. RESULTS Among the respondents, 40%-63.1% (n=65) currently engage in the recommended activities, with 1 exception: state health departments infrequently invite medical society executives to speak at major conferences or meetings (26.2%). The majority of respondents (71.1%-85.9%) judged that each recommended activity would improve the practices of medicine and public health. CONCLUSIONS Survey results illustrate a desire for reconciliation, but poor implementation of recommended strategies aimed at building a healthy marriage between the 2 sectors. More formal efforts are needed among state medical and public health organizations to capitalize on the current climate of rapprochement. The burden of COVID-19 on the national health system could provide a worthy cause around which these efforts would coalesce.","Scutchfield, F Douglas; Howard, Jeffrey D; Gouge, Kaylee R; Malone, Payton D; Wilson, Kaylee N",American journal of preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33358275/,167

Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) in COVID-19 patients is associated with high levels of cytokines and chemokines that cause multiple organ failure, systemic inflammation, and hemodynamic instabilities. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common complication of COVID-19, is a consequence of cytokine storm. In this regard, several drugs have been being investigated to suppress this inflammatory condition. Purinergic signaling receptors comprising of P1 adenosine and P2 purinoceptors play a critical role in inflammation. Therefore, activation or inhibition of some subtypes of these kinds of receptors is most likely to be beneficial to attenuate cytokine storm. This article summarizes suggested therapeutic drugs with potential anti-inflammatory effects through purinergic receptors.","Zarei, Malek; Sahebi Vaighan, Navideh; Ziai, Seyed Ali",Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08923973.2021.1988102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647511/,167

74698,Innovative strategies for reducing the burden of chronic liver disease.,2020-09-01,"Due to the rise of antibiotic resistance and the small number of effective antiviral drugs, new approaches for treating infectious diseases are urgently needed. Identifying targets for host-based therapies represents an emerging strategy for drug discovery. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a central mode of signaling in the eukaryotic cell and may be a promising target for therapies that bolster the host's ability to control infection. Deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes are key regulators of the host inflammatory response, and we previously demonstrated that a selective DUB inhibitor and its derivative promote anti-infective activities in host cells. To find compounds with anti-infective efficacy but improved toxicity profiles, we tested a library of predominantly 2-cyano-3-acrylamide small-molecule DUB inhibitors for anti-infective activity in macrophages against two intracellular pathogens: murine norovirus (MNV) and Listeria monocytogenes We identified compound C6, which inhibited DUB activity in human and murine cells and reduced intracellular replication of both pathogens with minimal toxicity in cell culture. Treatment with C6 did not significantly affect the ability of macrophages to internalize virus, suggesting that the anti-infective activity interferes with postentry stages of the MNV life cycle. Metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic assays showed that C6 has a half-life in mouse liver microsomes of ∼20 min and has a half-life of approximately 4 h in mice when administered intravenously. Our results provide a framework for targeting the host ubiquitin system in the development of host-based therapies for infectious disease. Compound C6 represents a promising tool with which to elucidate the role of DUBs in the macrophage response to infection.","Passalacqua, Karla D; Charbonneau, Marie-Eve; Donato, Nicholas J; Showalter, Hollis D; Sun, Duxin; Wen, Bo; He, Miao; Sun, Hanshi; O'Riordan, Mary X D; Wobus, Christiane E",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.03021-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27139470/,167

METHODS We studied a prospective cohort of 60 VLBW infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit within the first 6 h of life between March 2010 and June 2012. rSO2 (expressed as a number of summary measures) was continuously monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 5100 Somanetic) during the first 48 h of life, SCVf was measured at 4-6, 12, 24 and 48 h after birth, and CFOE was calculated. RESULTS The mean gestational age was 27.9 (SD 2.39); 8 infants died (13.3%) and 7 developed IVH grade III-IV: 1 in the alive group and 6 in the deceased group (p < 0.001). The odds ratio for death was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.015-1.15, p = 0.016) for each 10 periods of rSO2 values <40% in the first 48 h, and 4.2 (95% CI: 1.27-14.05, p = 0.019) for SVCf values <40 ml/kg/min. Among alive babies, mean CFOE decreased at 24, 36 and 48 h; among deceased babies it did not (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, these results retained significance. CONCLUSIONS Both rSO2 ≤40% and SVCf <40 ml/kg/min independently increase the risk of death. The trend in CFOE supports the ischemic-hypoperfusion hypothesis as a mechanism for cerebral damage.","Cerbo, Rosa Maria; Scudeller, Luigia; Maragliano, Roberta; Cabano, Rita; Pozzi, Margherita; Tinelli, Carmine; Bollani, Lina; Stronati, Mauro",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000438452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26338680/,167
75466,Mechanisms of pain transmission and pharmacologic management.,2011,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the main plasma volume regulator, which maintains cardiovascular and hydrosaline homeostasis. In the classical pathway, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) generates Angiotensin II (AngII), which is powerfully inflammatory and vasoconstrictive. This classical pathway is also regulated by ACE2, which converts AngI to Ang 1-9, and degrades AngII to Ang 1-7, whose vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory functions balance out the effects of AngII. ACE2 has been associated with the pathogenesis of respiratory infections such as RSV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies have shown that ACE2 corresponds to the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor, which together with other receptors such as the TMPRSS2, allows the virus to attach, fuse, and enter the host cell. These studies have shown that in animals infected with coronavirus there is a drop in tissue concentration of ACE2 and Ang 1-7, leading to overexpression of AngII and its vasoconstrictive and inflammatory effects. Experiments with recombinant ACE2 have shown a protective effect against overexpression of RAAS in coronavirus-infected animals, which is similar to that demonstrated with the use of AngII receptor blockers (AT1). Evidence on the protective role of ACE2 seems to support the recommendations re garding not discontinuing these drugs in COVID-19 infection. In this article, we present the current knowledge about the role of RAAS in coronavirus infection, based on physiopathological concepts, molecular bases, and experimental and clinical evidence.","Cano, F; Gajardo, M; Freundlich, M",Revista chilena de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.32641/rchped.vi91i3.2548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730512/,167

METHODS We searched a database of SRs in eyes and vision maintained by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision United States on the DTA of OCT for detecting glaucoma. Two authors working independently screened the records, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews checklist. We extracted quantitative DTA estimates as well as qualitative statements on their relevance to practice. RESULTS We included four SRs published between 2015 and 2018. These SRs included between 17 and 113 studies on OCT for glaucoma diagnosis. Two reviews were at low risk of bias and the other two had two to four domains at high or unclear risk of bias with concerns on applicability. The two reliable SRs reported the accuracy of average retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and found a sensitivity of 0.69 (0.63 to 0.73) and 0.78 (0.74 to 0.83) and a specificity of 0.94 (0.93 to 0.95) and 0.93 (0.92 to 0.95) in 57 and 50 studies, respectively. Only one review included a clear specification of the clinical pathway. Both reviews highlighted the limitations of primary DTA studies on this topic. CONCLUSIONS The quality of published DTA reviews on OCT for diagnosing glaucoma was mixed. Two reliable SRs found moderate sensitivity at high specificity for average RNFL thickness in diagnosing manifest glaucoma. Our overview suggests that the methodological quality of both primary and secondary DTA research on glaucoma is in need of improvement.","Michelessi, Manuele; Li, Tianjing; Miele, Alba; Azuara-Blanco, Augusto; Qureshi, Riaz; Virgili, Gianni",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493760/,167

Training activities, conferences, lectures, face-to-face workshops were suspended until the Health Situation was over. Alternatives to face-to-face training were needed to guarantee the continuity of these activities. Online training, teaching and evaluation emerged as a relatively fast, simple, operational and flexible solution. Universities and faculties promoted online teaching through virtual classes. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy supported this initiative by signing an agreement with the Board of Deans and Chancellors of Pharmacy to make it possible for undergraduate students to continue their studies and supervised practices in hospital pharmacy departments. Specialized training was affected. Pharmacy residency programs were significantly modified by hospital pharmacies to be able to provide the new clinical and research activities required, everyday, by the pandemic situation. Postgraduate and residency training were also negatively affected. Again, online activities made up for restrictions to face-to-face teaching and training. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy promoted continuing education and provided updated information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus through its website. Thus, numerous virtual sessions, lectures and webinars have been held, and high-quality material was offered to provide up-todate knowledge, on the pharmacological management of patients with COVID-19. Online teaching and education has demonstrated to be an invaluable tool for hard times. During the lockdown, technology has kept us closer and has emerged as an ally. Many of us have found a new means of communication, information, and training. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy has substantially contributed to make it possible.","Soy-Muner, Dolors",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533676/,167

A questionnaire survey was administered to physicians of patients in the Japanese cTTP registry to characterise these outcomes. We analysed 55 patients in remission, with 41 cases receiving prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP; median dosage: 13·2 ml/kg per month) and 14 receiving on-demand FFP. Patients receiving prophylactic FFP were considered as having a more severe form of the disease and had lower platelet counts and higher serum creatinine levels than those receiving on-demand FFP (median 138 × 109 /l vs. 243 × 109 /l, P = 0·003 and 0·71 mg/dl vs 0·58 mg/dl, P = 0·009, respectively). Patients who received prophylactic FFP more commonly developed organ damage, including renal impairment, cerebral infarctions, and cardiac hypofunction, than those who did not. Adverse FFP-related events were seen in 78% of the prophylactic FFP group, with allergic reactions being most common. Since current protocols for FFP administration to the prophylactic FFP group in Japan may be insufficient for preventing cumulative organ damage, a higher dosage of ADAMTS13 supply using recombinant ADAMTS13 agent is needed in these patients.","Sakai, Kazuya; Fujimura, Yoshihiro; Miyata, Toshiyuki; Isonishi, Ayami; Kokame, Koichi; Matsumoto, Masanori",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046888/,167
76648,Covid-19 skin manifestations: an update.,2021-06-14,"Several factors have recently converged, elevating the need for highly parallel diagnostic platforms that have the ability to detect many known, novel, and emerging pathogenic agents simultaneously. Panviral DNA microarrays represent the most robust approach for massively parallel viral surveillance and detection. The Virochip is a panviral DNA microarray that is capable of detecting all known viruses, as well as novel viruses related to known viral families, in a single assay and has been used to successfully identify known and novel viral agents in clinical human specimens. However, the usefulness and the sensitivity of the Virochip platform have not been tested on a set of clinical veterinary specimens with the high degree of genetic variance that is frequently observed with swine virus field isolates. In this report, we investigate the utility and sensitivity of the Virochip to positively detect swine viruses in both cell culture-derived samples and clinical swine samples. The Virochip successfully detected porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in serum containing 6.10 × 10(2) viral copies per microliter and influenza A virus in lung lavage fluid containing 2.08 × 10(6) viral copies per microliter. The Virochip also successfully detected porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum containing 2.50 × 10(8) viral copies per microliter and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in turbinate tissue homogenate. Collectively, the data in this report demonstrate that the Virochip can successfully detect pathogenic viruses frequently found in swine in a variety of solid and liquid specimens, such as turbinate tissue homogenate and lung lavage fluid, as well as antemortem samples, such as serum.","Nicholson, Tracy L; Kukielka, Deborah; Vincent, Amy L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Miller, Laura C; Faaberg, Kay S",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01876-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21270231/,167

It is a negative sense, single stranded RNA virus that results in epidemics of respiratory infections that typically peak in the winter in temperate climates and during the rainy season in tropical climates. Generally, one of the two genotypes (A and B) predominates in a single season, alternating annually, although regional variation occurs. RSV is a cause of disease and death in children, older people, and immunocompromised patients, and its clinical effect on adults admitted to hospital is clarified with expanded use of multiplex molecular assays. Among adults, RSV produces a wide range of clinical symptoms including upper respiratory tract infections, severe lower respiratory tract infections, and exacerbations of underlying disease. Here we discuss the latest evidence on the burden of RSV related disease in adults, especially in those with immunocompromise or other comorbidities. We review current therapeutic and prevention options, as well as those in development.","Nam, Hannah H; Ison, Michael G",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l5021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506273/,167

Therefore, a re-evaluation of the algorithm was conducted to determine which recommendations were still relevant and which needed modification. METHODS The authors conducted a twofold approach: a review of literature to include new evidence since 2011 (controlled trials, meta-analyses and practice guidelines); and a participatory component involving electronic surveys, participatory conferences, clinical speakers and expert patients. RESULTS Overall, prescribers tended to make decisions based on personal experience and conversations with colleagues rather than evidence-based guidelines. To test if the algorithm was useful worldwide, it was presented in the United Arab Emirates, where the feedback was in agreement with the algorithm and its limitations. CONCLUSIONS Since its initial publication, the QAAPAPLE algorithm has been updated to guide clinicians on the use of LAIs. The new algorithm has also been assessed outside Canada to test its generalisability worldwide, and indicated its flexibility, efficiency and user-friendliness in order to guide clinicians on the use of LAIs.","Stip, Emmanuel; Grignon, Sylvain; Roy, Marc André; Bloom, David; Osman, Ossama; Amiri, Leena; Abdul Aziz, Karim; Javaid, Syed Fahad; Arnone, Danilo",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737175.2020.1826930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962466/,167

METHODS We conducted a quasi-experimental before-after study. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of inpatients with DFI admitted between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 (control group, n = 30). Inpatients diagnosed with DFI between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 were prospectively enrolled as the intervention group and received treatment through dedicated ID teamwork (intervention group, n = 35). RESULTS The distribution of infection severity and level of metabolic criteria were similar between the groups. Compared with the control group, the intervention group received adequate initial empirical treatment more frequently (43.5% vs 96.8%, p < 0.001), and had a shorter median duration of fever (7.5 vs 1 day, p < 0.001). Rates of healing and relapse within six months were similar between the groups, although the intervention group showed more sites of osteomyelitis (p = 0.036) and a higher percentage of polymicrobial infections (48.6% vs 10.0%, p = 0.001).

A suspected growing elderly population needing emergency colorectal surgery stimulated this study of the prevalence and impact of frailty. METHODS Elderly patients (defined as aged at least 65 years by Medicare and the United States Census Bureau) who underwent emergency colorectal resection between 2012 and 2016 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program population database. The five-item modified frailty index (mFI-5) score was calculated, and patients stratified into groups 0, 1 or 2 + . Main outcome measures were the prevalence of frailty, and its impact on 30-day postoperative morbidity, mortality, reoperation, duration of hospital stay (LOS), discharge destination and readmission. RESULTS A total of 10 025 patients were identified with a median age 75 years, of whom 41·8 per cent were men. The majority (87·7 per cent) had an ASA fitness grade of III or greater and 3129 (31·2 per cent) were frail (mFI-5 group 2+). Major morbidity occurred in one-third of patients and the postoperative mortality rate was 15·9 per cent. Some 52·0 per cent of patients had a prolonged hospital stay and 11·0 per cent were readmitted. Although most patients (88·0 per cent) lived independently before surgery, only 45·4 per cent were discharged home directly. Frailty (mFI-5 2+) predicted mortality, overall and major morbidity, reoperation, prolonged LOS, discharge to an institution and readmission, but frailty was independent of sex. CONCLUSION Frailty is associated with morbidity, mortality and loss of independence in elderly patients needing emergency colorectal surgery.","Simon, H L; Reif de Paula, T; Profeta da Luz, M M; Nemeth, S K; Moug, S J; Keller, D S",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32639045/,167

Recent data demonstrate that also the main components of the angiotensin concerting enzyme 2 (ACE2) system (at least ACE2 itself, as well as the biologically active angiotensin (1-7) and its cognate receptor Mas) are expressed in the brain. Aside from these members, alamadine and MrgD are discussed as further members that have neuro-active roles in the CNS. Little is known about the possible functions of MrgD within the brain. Concerning angiotensin (1-7) acting through the Mas receptor, data were accumulating that this system is involved in numerous processes contributing to neuronal plasticity and even learning and memory. Malfunctions in the brain ACE2 system are associated with disturbances in neuronal plasticity. Since SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity towards ACE2, Neuro-Covid may directly or indirectly depend on a disturbed balance in the ACE2 derived angiotensin system in the brain. Since the ACE2 system in the brain is far from being understood, a deeper understanding of e.g. the angiotensin (1-7) / Mas system is needed, especially with regard to the roles of angiotensin (1-7) in neuronal plasticity.","von Bohlen Und Halbach, Oliver",Histology and histopathology,https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142714/,167

79077,Smoking in users of a cervical cancer screening center of the Mexican government at Mexico City.,2020,"Chromosome 14 allelic loss is common in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and may reflect essential tumor suppressor gene loss in tumorigenesis. An intact chromosome 14 was transferred to an NPC cell line using a microcell-mediated chromosome transfer approach. Microcell hybrids (MCHs) containing intact exogenously transferred chromosome 14 were tumor suppressive in athymic mice, demonstrating that intact chromosome 14 NPC MCHs are able to suppress tumor growth in mice. Comparative analysis of these MCHs and their derived tumor segregants identified 4 commonly eliminated tumor-suppressive CRs. Here we provide functional evidence that a gene, Mirror-Image POLydactyly 1 (MIPOL1), which maps within a single 14q13.1-13.3 CR and that hitherto has been reported to be associated only with a developmental disorder, specifically suppresses in vivo tumor formation. MIPOL1 gene expression is down-regulated in all NPC cell lines and in approximately 63% of NPC tumors via promoter hypermethylation and allelic loss. SLC25A21 and FOXA1, 2 neighboring genes mapping to this region, did not show this frequent down-regulated gene expression or promoter hypermethylation, precluding possible global methylation effects and providing further evidence that MIPOL1 plays a unique role in NPC. The protein localizes mainly to the nucleus. Re-expression of MIPOL1 in the stable transfectants induces cell cycle arrest. MIPOL1 tumor suppression is related to up-regulation of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) protein pathways. This study provides compelling evidence that chromosome 14 harbors tumor suppressor genes associated with NPC and that a candidate gene, MIPOL1, is associated with tumor development.","Cheung, Arthur Kwok Leung; Lung, Hong Lok; Ko, Josephine Mun Yee; Cheng, Yue; Stanbridge, Eric J; Zabarovsky, Eugene R; Nicholls, John M; Chua, Daniel; Tsao, Sai Wah; Guan, Xin-Yuan; Lung, Maria Li",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0900198106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19667180/,167

Furthermore, many gynecologic conditions, including abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain and infertility, are imputed to deficient cesarean scar healing. Hysteroscopy is the most commonly reported approach for the revision of cesarean scar defects (CSDs). Nevertheless, existing evidence is inadequate to conclude that either hysteroscopy or laparoscopy is effective or superior to each other. Although several management options have been suggested recently, the laparoscopic approach has not been thoroughly scrutinized. We present a case and reviewed the data related to the laparoscopic repair of CSDs and compared the hysteroscopic and laparoscopic management options based on the data from previously published articles. As a result of our analyses, the laparoscopic approach increases uterine wall thickness when compared with the hysteroscopic approach, and both surgical techniques seem to be effective for the resolution of gynecologic symptoms. Hysteroscopic treatment most likely corrects the scar defect but does not strengthen the uterine wall; thus, the potential risk of dehiscence or rupture in subsequent pregnancies does not seem to be improved. Because large uterine defects are known risk factors for scar dehiscence, the repair of the defect to reinforce the myometrial endurance seems to be an appropriate method of treatment.","Api, Murat; Boza, Aysen; Gorgen, Husnu; Api, Olus",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2015.06.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122897/,167

80766,Pheohyphomycosis: A curious case of cyst.,2020-07-22,"Background Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally, with an increasing incidence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The successful treatment of acute stroke requires an organized, efficient and well-resourced emergency care system. However, debate exists surrounding the prioritization of stroke treatment programs given the high costs of treatment and the increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in LMICs. Economic data is helpful to guide evidence-based priority setting in health systems development, particularly in low-resource settings where scarcity requires careful stewardship of resources. This systematic review surveys the existing evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of interventions to address acute stroke in LMIC settings. Methods The authors conducted a PRISMA style systematic review of economic evaluations of interventions to address acute stroke in LMICs. Five databases were systematically searched for articles, which were then reviewed for inclusion. Results Of the 153 unique articles identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Four studies demonstrate the heavy economic burden on patients and households due to stroke. Two studies estimate that preventive measures are more cost-effective than acute treatments. Four studies directly examine the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis and thrombectomy in three middle-income countries (Iran, China, and Brazil) with results ranging from roughly $2578 to $34,052 (2019 USD) per quality adjusted life-year saved. These results are similar to the cost-effectiveness ratios estimated in high-income settings. Finally, one study examined a care bundle that included acute treatment elements. Conclusions The findings reinforce the need for additional research support informed decision-making. The available evidence suggests that preventive measures should be prioritized over emergency treatment for acute stroke, particularly in settings of resource scarcity. Cost-effectiveness ratios do not compare favorably to estimates for other emergency care interventions in LMICs, such as basic emergency care training, implementation of triage systems, and basic trauma care. Cost-effectiveness is also likely to vary depending on local epidemiology. Overall, decision-makers should balance the economic evidence alongside social, political and cultural priorities when making resource allocation choices.","Barbosa, Euridxe; Gulela, Brito; Taimo, Maria A; Lopes, Dino M; Offorjebe, O Agatha; Risko, Nicholas",African journal of emergency medicine : Revue africaine de la medecine d'urgence,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2020.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318909/,167

Given the fact that numerous systematic reviews already exist on yoga and mental health, it becomes vital to undertake an overview on the same. The objective of the overview was to summarise the evidence from different systematic reviews of distinct yoga interventions used to improve mental health and recommend yoga practices for the same. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020185221). MEDLINE via Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature. Search terms used were ""Yoga practice, mental health and systematic review"". Reviews from earliest possible date till May 2020, including those examining the effects of any single or combination of yoga interventions on mental health reported on children, youth and adults were selected. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool was used to evaluate the evidence of the included reviews. Out of the 90 reviews found, eight unique reviews were selected for the overview. Overall, 243 studies were analyzed, with an overlap of only 6 studies across the reviews.

80788,[Invasive fungal infections in ICU patients - What's New?],2021-04-01,"Ultra-high field MRI can functionally image the cerebral cortex of human subjects at the submillimeter scale of cortical columns and laminae. Here, we investigate both in concert, by imaging ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in primary visual cortex (V1) across different cortical depths. We ensured that putative ODC patterns in V1 (a) are stable across runs, sessions, and scanners located in different continents, (b) have a width (∼1.3 mm) expected from post-mortem and animal work and (c) are absent at the retinotopic location of the blind spot. We then dissociated the effects of bottom-up thalamo-cortical input and attentional feedback processes on activity in V1 across cortical depth. Importantly, the separation of bottom-up information flows into ODCs allowed us to validly compare attentional conditions while keeping the stimulus identical throughout the experiment. We find that, when correcting for draining vein effects and using both model-based and model-free approaches, the effect of monocular stimulation is largest at deep and middle cortical depths. Conversely, spatial attention influences BOLD activity exclusively near the pial surface. Our findings show that simultaneous interrogation of columnar and laminar dimensions of the cortical fold can dissociate thalamocortical inputs from top-down processing, and allow the investigation of their interactions without any stimulus manipulation.","de Hollander, Gilles; van der Zwaag, Wietske; Qian, Chencan; Zhang, Peng; Knapen, Tomas",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385565/,167

Pegler is abundant in active polysaccharides, but little is known about their structures and solution properties. In this study, water-extracted polysaccharides from M. albuminosa (MAWP) were purified into three fractions with structural heterogeneity, which was attributed to the diversity in molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and linkage patterns, further affecting their solution properties. Methylation and NMR analysis revealed MAWP-60p and MAWP-70 were a 3-O-methylated glucomannogalactan and a previously unreported glucomannogalactan, whereas MAWP-80 was elucidated as a branched galactoglucan. Besides, three fractions exhibited random coil conformation in aqueous solution, while MAWP-60p had the highest viscosity due to its highest molecular weight, mean square radius of gyration (Rg) and O-methyl group attached to the backbone. The molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkages might be the major contributors to the flexibility, molecular size and stereochemistry of mushroom polysaccharide chains.","Wang, Yu-Xiao; Xin, Yue; Yin, Jun-Yi; Huang, Xiao-Jun; Wang, Jun-Qiao; Hu, Jie-Lun; Geng, Fang; Nie, Shao-Ping",Food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399182/,167

Defining the prevalence of PGD will have important nosological, clinical, and therapeutic implications. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence rate of PGD in the adult bereaved population, identify possible moderators, and explore methodological quality of studies in this area. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Studies with non-psychiatric, adult populations exposed to non-violent bereavement were included and subjected to meta-analytic evaluation. RESULTS Fourteen eligible studies were identified. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled prevalence of PGD of 9.8% (95% CI 6.8-14.0). Moderation analyses showed higher mean age to be associated with higher prevalence of PGD. Study quality was characterized by low risk of internal validity bias but high risk of external validity bias. LIMITATIONS The available studies are methodologically heterogeneous. Among the limitations are that only half the studies used registry-based probability sampling methods (50.0%) and few studies analyzed non-responders (14.3%). CONCLUSIONS This first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of PGD suggests that one out of ten bereaved adults is at risk for PGD. To allocate economic and professional resources most effectively, this result underscores the importance of identifying and offer treatment to those bereaved individuals in greatest need. Due to heterogeneity and limited representativeness, the findings should be interpreted cautiously and additional high-quality epidemiological research using population-based designs is needed.","Lundorff, Marie; Holmgren, Helle; Zachariae, Robert; Farver-Vestergaard, Ingeborg; O'Connor, Maja",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2017.01.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28167398/,167

We compared the performance of phase lag entropy with the bispectral index™ in 30 patients scheduled for elective surgery. We initiated a target-controlled infusion of propofol using the Schnider model, and assessed sedation levels using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale every 30 s with each stepwise increase in the effect-site propofol concentration. Phase lag entropy and bispectral index values were recorded. The correlation coefficient and prediction probability between phase lag entropy or bispectral index and the sedation level or effect-site propofol concentration were analysed. We calculated baseline variabilities of phase lag entropy and bispectral index. In addition, we applied a non-linear mixed-effects model to obtain the pharmacodynamic relationships among the effect-site propofol concentration, phase lag entropy or bispectral index and sedation level. As sedation increased, phase lag entropy and bispectral index both decreased. The prediction probability values of phase lag entropy and bispectral index for sedation levels were 0.697 and 0.700 (p = 0.261) and for the effect-site concentration of propofol were 0.646 and 0.630 (p = 0.091), respectively. Baseline variability in phase lag entropy and bispectral index was 3.3 and 5.7, respectively. The predicted propofol concentrations, using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model, producing a 50% probability of moderate and deep sedation were 1.96 and 3.01 μg.ml-1 , respectively.

Here, we propose a sulfur, nitrogen dual-doped 2D porous graphene (SNPG) nanohybrid by adopting a facile one-step process. The resulting sandwich-like porous nanohybrid features uniform ion-gated nanopores for efficient transport of target heavy metal ions while blocking undesired ions, as well as abundant multi-binding ligands for selectively chelating permeated heavy metal ions. We show from systematic experiments that this SNPG nanohybrid exhibits outstanding selectivity and ability to separate Hg(ii) ions in mixtures with eight other metal ions. An excellent uptake capability (803 mg g-1) and high removal ability (>99%) within the entire pH range of 2-10 can be obtained. Given the specific 2D porous nanostructure and specific binding ligands, SNPG exhibits an ultrahigh separation factor towards Hg(ii) that is up to four orders of magnitude higher than those of Pb(ii), Cd(ii) and Cu(ii) ions, significantly higher than those of most reported adsorbents.

We undertook individual participant data meta-analyses to (1) quantify independent associations of systolic interarm difference with mortality and cardiovascular events; (2) develop and validate prognostic models incorporating interarm difference, and (3) determine whether interarm difference remains associated with risk after adjustment for common cardiovascular risk scores. We searched for studies recording bilateral blood pressure and outcomes, established agreements with collaborating authors, and created a single international dataset: the Inter-arm Blood Pressure Difference - Individual Participant Data (INTERPRESS-IPD) Collaboration. Data were merged from 24 studies (53 827 participants). Systolic interarm difference was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality: continuous hazard ratios 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02-1.08) and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02-1.11), respectively, per 5 mm Hg systolic interarm difference. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality increased with interarm difference magnitude from a ≥5 mm Hg threshold (hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.14]). Systolic interarm differences per 5 mm Hg were associated with cardiovascular events in people without preexisting disease, after adjustment for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00-1.08]), Framingham (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.08]), or QRISK cardiovascular disease risk algorithm version 2 (QRISK2) (hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06-1.18]) cardiovascular risk scores. Our findings confirm that systolic interarm difference is associated with increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events. Blood pressure should be measured in both arms during cardiovascular assessment. A systolic interarm difference of 10 mm Hg is proposed as the upper limit of normal.

OBJECTIVE To determine if use of prescribed opioid analgesics changes in the short and long term after bariatric surgery and to identify factors associated with continued and postsurgery initiated use. SETTING Ten U.S. hospitals. METHODS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study. Assessments were conducted presurgery, 6 months postsurgery, and annually postsurgery for up to 7 years until January 2015. Opioid use was defined as self-reported daily, weekly, or ""as needed"" use of a prescribed medication classified as an opioid analgesic. RESULTS Of 2258 participants with baseline data, 2218 completed follow-up assessment(s) (78.7% were female, median body mass index: 46; 70.6% underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Prevalence of opioid use decreased after surgery from 14.7% (95% CI: 13.3-16.2) at baseline to 12.9% (95% CI: 11.5-14.4) at month 6 but then increased to 20.3%, above baseline levels, as time progressed (95% CI: 18.2-22.5) at year 7. Among participants without baseline opioid use (n = 1892), opioid use prevalence increased from 5.8% (95% CI: 4.7-6.9) at month 6 to 14.2% (95% CI: 12.2-16.3) at year 7. Public versus private health insurance, more pain presurgery, undergoing subsequent surgeries, worsening or less improvement in pain, and starting or continuing nonopioid analgesics postsurgery were significantly associated with higher risk of postsurgery initiated opioid use. CONCLUSION After bariatric surgery, prevalence of prescribed opioid analgesic use initially decreased but then increased to surpass baseline prevalence, suggesting the need for alternative methods of pain management in this population.","King, Wendy C; Chen, Jia-Yuh; Belle, Steven H; Courcoulas, Anita P; Dakin, Gregory F; Flum, David R; Hinojosa, Marcelo W; Kalarchian, Melissa A; Mitchell, James E; Pories, Walter J; Spaniolas, Konstantinos; Wolfe, Bruce M; Yanovski, Susan Z; Engel, Scott G; Steffen, Kristine J",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2017.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579202/,167

Evidence on cost-effectiveness, which can help inform use of limited resources, is scarce in this area and therefore the purpose of this systematic review is to critically appraise and consolidate the current evidence on economic evaluations of ABI rehabilitation interventions. Methods: Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published economic evaluation studies (trial-based, non-trial based, simulation-based, decision model and trial-based model economic evaluations) of ABI treatment interventions in adults. A systematic literature search will be conducted on the following electronic databases: EMBASE, Econlit, CINAHL, Medline, Econlit, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database and PsyclNFO. This review will only include cost-effectiveness analysis studies (e.g., cost per life year gained), cost-benefit and cost minimisation analyses in which the designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCT studies, cost-utility analyses (e.g., cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained or cost per disability-adjusted life year averted), cohort studies, and modeling studies. Only studies that were published in English, associated with adults who have an ABI will be included. There will be no restrictions on perspective, sample size, country, follow-up duration or setting. The search strategy terms will include the following: acquired brain injury, brain*; cost*; or cost-benefit analysis*. Following data extraction, a narrative summary and tables will be used to summarize the characteristics and results of included studies.

METHODS We used a prospectively collected clinical registry of SCD patients 6 months to 21 years of age to determine the influenza cases per 100 patient-years, vaccination rates, and a test-negative case-control study design to estimate influenza VE against medically attended laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Influenza-positive cases were randomly matched to test-negative controls on age and influenza season in 1:1 ratio. We used adjusted logistic regression models to compare odds ratio (OR) of vaccination in cases to controls. We calculated VE as [100% × (1 - adjusted OR)] and computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimate. RESULTS There were 1037 children with SCD who were tested for influenza, 307 children (29.6%) had at least one influenza infection (338 infections, incidence rate 3.7 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.4-4.1) and 56.2% of those tested received annual influenza vaccine. Overall VE pooled over five seasons was 22.3% (95% CI, -7.3% to 43.7%). Adjusted VE estimates ranged from 39.7% (95% CI, -70.1% to 78.6%) in 2015/2016 to -5.9% (95% CI, -88.4% to 40.4%) in the 2016/17 seasons. Influenza VE varied by age and was highest in children 1-5 years of age (66.6%; 95% CI, 30.3-84.0). Adjusted VE against acute chest syndrome during influenza infection was 39.4% (95% CI, -113.0 to 82.8%). CONCLUSIONS Influenza VE in patients with SCD varies by season and age.

This COVID-19 pilot project was conducted during June and July 2020 in low-income residential neighborhoods in West Baltimore, Maryland. Quantitative data were collected and assessed cross-sectionally. Demographically, 85% of the patients identified as Black or African American (n = 265) and 58.2% as female (n = 184).

86237,The COVID-19 pandemonium pandemic.,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND Serial chest CT is the standard of care to establish treatment success in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Data are lacking how response should be defined. METHODS Digital CT images from a clinical trial on treatment of IPA were re-evaluated and compared with available biomarkers. Total volume of pneumonia was added up after manual measurement of each lesion, followed by statistical analysis. RESULTS One-hundred and ninety CT scans and 309 follow-up datasets from 40 patients were available for analysis. Thirty-one were neutropenic. Baseline galactomannan (OR 4.06, 95%CI: 1.08-15.31) and lesion volume (OR 3.14, 95%CI: 0.73-13.52) were predictive of death. Lesion volume at d7 and trend between d7 and d14 were strong predictors of death (OR 20.01, 95%CI: 1.42-282.00 and OR 15.97, 95%CI: 1.62-157.32) and treatment being rated as unsuccessful (OR 4.75, 95%CI: 0.94-24.05 and OR 40.69, 95%CI: 2.55-649.03), which was confirmed by a Cox proportional hazards model using time-dependent covariates. CONCLUSION Any increase in CT lesion volume between day 7 and day 14 was a sensitive marker of a lethal outcome (>50%), supporting a CT rescan each one and 2 weeks after initial detection of IPA. The predictive value exceeded all other biomarkers. Further CT follow-up after response at day 14 was of low additional value. KEY POINTS • CT evaluation offers good prediction of outcome for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. • Predictive capability exceeds galactomannan, blood counts, and lesion count. • Any progression between day 7 and day 14 constitutes a high-risk scenario.","Vehreschild, J J; Heussel, C P; Groll, A H; Vehreschild, M J G T; Silling, G; Würthwein, G; Brecht, M; Cornely, O A",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-016-4717-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28083695/,167
86459,Cost Differential of Chemotherapy for Solid Tumors.,2016,"3D printed microscopes are a topical emerging field in the literature. However most microscopes presented to date are quite novel re-imaginings of the microscope's mechanical design and they are either solely dependent on, or primarily geared towards, camera-based observations rather than ergonomic direct vision screening through an ocular lens. The reliance on camera, computer and monitor for observation introduces a compromise between portability, cost and the quality of an instant wide field of view. In this report I introduce the Portable Upgradeable Modular and Affordable (PUMA) microscope which is an open source 3D printed multimodality microscope that employs a traditional upright design for ease of human direct visual observations and slide screening. PUMA uses standard RMS or C-mount objectives, with a tube length 160 mm, 170 mm or infinity and wide field high eye point ocular lenses. PUMA can use simple mirror-based illumination or can be configured to a full Köhler system with Abbe condenser for high numerical aperture observations including oil immersion. PUMA also has advanced digital / optical imaging features such as a digital spatial light modulator and - unique to any 3D printed microscope to date - an augmented reality heads-up display for interactive calibrated measurements. Digital camera imaging can also be used with PUMA - in fact PUMA can take up to 3 separate digital cameras simultaneously. PUMA can also function as a direct vision multi-header microscope for teaching or discussion. The illumination system is also modular and includes transillumination, epi-illumination, fluorescence, polarisation, dark ground and also Schlieren-based phase contrast and other Fourier optics filtering modalities. All these advanced features are available through an on-board, battery operated, microprocessor so no mains supply, smartphone, network connection, PC or external monitor are required making PUMA a truly portable system suitable for remote field work.

86733,"Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with ataxia: A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study.",2015,"BACKGROUND In the drug eluting stent (DES) era, repeat in-stent restenosis (ISR) of the same coronary lesion, despite percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is a rare but challenging problem that has not been reported. We aim to describe what we propose as the occurrence of ""resistant""-ISR (R-ISR) in the DES era, including angiographic patterns and outcomes. METHODS We defined R-ISR as the recurrence of an ISR episode after successful treatment of the same lesion. We identified 276 consecutive patients with 291 lesions who had R-ISR between May 2003 and June 2012. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was performed for the first and second ISR episodes. Outcomes at one year, including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion failure (TLF), were analyzed. RESULTS Patients with R-ISR had a high frequency of diabetes (62%), chronic kidney disease (39%), bifurcation lesions (51%), and moderate to severe calcified lesions (52%). The most common pattern of R-ISR was focal (77%). R-ISR lesions were treated with DES implantation (55%) or balloon-only strategy (45%). The mortality rate and TLF at 2-years were 9.3% and 51% respectively. The overall 2-year TLF rate did not vary with the originally implanted stent, angiographic pattern (focal versus diffuse), or revascularization strategy. CONCLUSIONS R-ISR appears to consist predominantly of focal lesions and occurs in patients at high clinical and angiographic risk, conceivably owing to their unique diabetic and coronary calcification profile. Clinical outcomes are suboptimal irrespective of angiographic pattern or treatment strategy, indicating the recalcitrant nature of the disease, and need for aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and novel interventional approaches. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Theodoropoulos, Kleanthis; Mennuni, Marco G; Dangas, George D; Meelu, Omar A; Bansilal, Sameer; Baber, Usman; Sartori, Samantha; Kovacic, Jason C; Moreno, Pedro R; Sharma, Samin K; Mehran, Roxana; Kini, Annapoorna S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184223/,167

Methods Between October 2015 and November 2016, 150 patients underwent LA by three residents (in their first, second, and third year of training) under supervision. The patients were non-randomly assigned to each resident. The data were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively from prospectively collected database. The perioperative outcomes were compared between the three residents including operation time, complication, conversion, and so on. The LCs were evaluated by the moving average method and cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) for operation time and surgical completion. Results Baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes were similar except for age and location of the appendix among the three groups. Operation time was not different among the three residents (43.9, 45.3, and 48.4 min for A, B, and C, respectively). The moving average method for operation time showed a decreasing tendency for all residents. CUSUM for operation time showed that the peak points occurred at the 24th, 18th, and 31st cases for resident A, B, and C, respectively. In terms of surgical failure, residents A, B, and C reached steady states after the 35th, 11th, and 16th cases, respectively. Perforation of the appendix base was the only risk factor for surgical failure. Conclusion The LC for LA by residents was 11-35 cases according to multidimensional statistical analyses. The accumulation of surgical experience of residents might affect the LC, especially for surgical completion rather than for operation time.","Kim, Chang Woo; Jeon, Sook Young; Paik, Bomina; Bong, Jun Woo; Kim, Sang Hyun; Lee, Suk-Hwan",Annals of coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.3393/ac.2019.07.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32054238/,167

Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO(2)) is still the 'gold standard' for the determination of the systemic oxygen delivery to consumption ratio in cardiac surgery patients. Recent data suggest that regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO(2)) determined by near-infrared spectroscopy is closely related to SvO(2). The present study compares rScO(2) and SvO(2) in patients undergoing TA-TAVI. n = 20 cardiac surgery patients scheduled for TA-TAVI were enrolled in this prospective observational study. SvO(2) and rScO(2) were determined at predefined time points during the procedure. Correlation and Bland-Altman analysis of the complete data set showed a correlation coefficient of r(2 )= 0.7 between rScO(2) and SvO(2) (P < 0.0001), a mean difference (bias) of 5.8 with limits of agreement (1.96 SD) of -6.8 to 18.3% and a percentage error of 17.5%. At all predefined time points correlation was moderate (r(2 )= 0.50) to close (r = 0.84), and the percentage error was <24%. RScO(2) determined by near-infrared spectroscopy is correlated to SvO(2) during varying haemodynamic conditions in patients undergoing TA-TAVI. This suggests that rScO(2) is reflective not only of the cerebral, but also of the systemic oxygen balance.","Paarmann, Hauke; Heringlake, Matthias; Heinze, Hermann; Hanke, Thorsten; Sier, Holger; Karsten, Jan; Schön, Julika",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivr102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22159266/,167

In this report we aimed to describe the course of glycemia in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 36 SARS-CoV-2 patients (with no history of diabetes) in one intensive care unit (ICU). All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; all but four required mechanical ventilation. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64.7 (9.7) years; 27 were men; the mean (±SD) duration of ICU stay was 12.9 (8.3 days). RESULTS Twenty of 36 patients presented with hyperglycemia; brief intravenous infusions of short-acting insulin were administered in six patients. As of May 29 2020, 11 patients had died (seven with hyperglycemia). In 17 patients the Hyperglycemia Index [HGI; defined as the area under the curve of (hyper)glycemia level*time (h) divided by the total time in the ICU] was <16.21 mg/dl (0.90 mmol/l), whereas in three patients the HGI was ≥16.21 mg/dl (0.90 mol/l) and <32.25 mg/dl (1.79 mmol/l). CONCLUSION In our series of ICU patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no history of diabetes, a substantial number of patients had hyperglycemia, to a higher degree than would be expected by the stress of critical illness, lending credence to reports that speculated a tentative association between SARS-CoV-2 and hyperglycemia. This finding is important, since hyperglycemia can lead to further infectious complications.","Ilias, Ioannis; Jahaj, Edison; Kokkoris, Stylianos; Zervakis, Dimitrios; Temperikidis, Prodromos; Magira, Eleni; Pratikaki, Maria; Vassiliou, Alice G; Routsi, Christina; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871848/,167

METHODS We performed a case-control study of all patients with stage IB1 cervical carcinoma who underwent a vaginal or abdominal RT between 11/01 and 6/07. The control group consisted of patients with stage IB1 disease who underwent an RH between 11/91 and 6/07 and who would be considered candidates for fertility-sparing surgery. Information was extracted from a prospectively acquired database. Recurrence-free and disease-specific survival (RFS and DSS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared with the log-rank test where indicated. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression method. RESULTS Forty stage IB1 patients underwent an RT and 110 patients underwent an RH. There were no statistical differences between the two groups for the following prognostic variables: histology, median number of lymph nodes removed, node positive rate, lymph-vascular space involvement (LVSI), or deep stromal invasion (DSI). The median follow-up for the entire group was 44 months. The 5-year RFS rate was 96% (for the RT group compared to 86% for the RH group (P=NS). On multivariate analysis in this group of stage IB1 lesions, tumor size <2 cm was not an independent predictor of outcome, but both LVSI and DSI retained independent predictive value (P=0.033 and 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSION For selected patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer, fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy appears to have a similar oncologic outcome to radical hysterectomy. LVSI and DSI appear to be more valuable predictors of outcome than tumor diameter in this subgroup of patients.","Diaz, John P; Sonoda, Yukio; Leitao, Mario M; Zivanovic, Oliver; Brown, Carol L; Chi, Dennis S; Barakat, Richard R; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2008.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18755500/,167

Especially since COVID-19 has outbroken in Wuhan, Hubei, in December 2019, coronavirus has had a significant impact on people's health and lives. But so far, the pathological diagnosis of COVID-19 has been relatively deficient： it is still confined to the pathological findings of punctured organs, and the majority of medical workers have poor awareness of its pathological characteristics. The COVID-19, as same as SARS and MERS, is caused by coronaviruses and can cause viral pneumonia. They have certain similarities.

88534,Self-flip Technique of the TightRope RT Button for Soft-Tissue Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.,2016,"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is an evolution of laparoscopic surgery aiming at decreasing the patient's parietal trauma associated with abdominal operations. LESS has been found so far to be efficient and have the same good results as the standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. α-Defensins are antimicrobial peptides of the organism. They are the first cell components against pathogens. Cytokines are also mediators in the response to trauma. The aim of this study was to compare the inflammatory reaction in LESS and four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS Forty patients with noncomplicated cholelithiasis were randomly assigned into one of two groups. Group A included the patients who would undergo four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and group B included the patients who would undergo LESS cholecystectomy. These patients had a BMI < 30, were ASA I or II, and had no previous upper-GI surgery. Blood was taken preoperatively and 6 and 24 h postoperatively. hsCRP (with automated analyzer) and α-defensins (using ELISA) were calculated for each sample. The same postoperative protocol was followed for both groups. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the results. Pain was calculated with a visual analog scale (VAS) for shoulder and abdomen at 6 and 24 h. Hospital stay, nausea, and pain medication needed was noted. RESULTS The α-defensins value was statistically significantly higher in the 24-h samples (P < 0.001) for LESS cholecystectomy. No statistically significant difference was shown for hsCRP, even though P = 0.05 for the 24-h samples with the values of LESS higher. No LESS was converted to a classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and none of the patients of either group needed conversion to open cholecystectomy. Pain was statistically significantly less for the LESS group at the 24-h interval (P < 0.0001). Less medication was needed for LESS patients after the 6th postoperative hour (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION Higher inflammatory reaction in LESS cholecystectomy could be the result of greater tension on the tissues. More studies are needed to conclude if this has a significant clinical expression.","Tsimogiannis, Konstantinos E; Tellis, Constantinos C; Tselepis, Alexandros D; Pappas-Gogos, George; Bakola, Maria S; Tsimoyiannis, Evangelos C; Simopoulos, C E; Pitiakoudis, Michael",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1921-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993933/,167

Serological tests are acknowledged to have high sensitivity, but issues due to cross-reactions with other parasites, native parasite antigen supply and intrinsic test variability do occur. Assays based on recombinant antigens could represent an improvement. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of two novel immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgG4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on the recombinant antigens NIE/SsIR for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. METHODS This was a retrospective diagnostic accuracy study. We included serum samples collected from immigrants from strongyloidiasis endemic areas for whom there was a matched result for Strongyloides stercoralis on agar plate culture and/or PCR assay, or a positive microscopy for S. stercoralis larvae. For the included samples, results were also available from an in-house indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and a commercial (Bordier ELISA; Bordier Affinity Products SA) ELISA. We excluded: (i) samples with insufficient serum volume; (ii) samples from patients treated with ivermectin in the previous 6 months; and (iii) sera from patients for whom only routine coproparasitology was performed after formol-ether concentration, if negative for S. stercoralis larvae. The performance of the novel assays was assessed against: (i) a primary reference standard, with samples classified as negative/positive on the basis of the results of fecal tests; (ii) a composite reference standard (CRS), which also considered patients to be positive who had concordant positive results for the IFAT and Bordier ELISA or with a single ""high titer"" positive result for the IFAT or Bordier ELISA. Samples with a single positive test, either for the IFAT or Bordier ELISA, at low titer, were considered to be ""indeterminate,"" and analyses were carried out with and without their inclusion. RESULTS When assessed against the primary reference standard, the sensitivities of the IgG and IgG4 ELISAs were 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88-97%) and 81% (95% CI: 74-87%), respectively, and the specificities were 91% (95% CI: 88-95%) and 94% (95% CI: 91-97%), respectively. When tested against the CRS, the IgG ELISA performed best, with 78% sensitivity (95% CI: 72-83%) and 98% specificity (95% CI: 96-100%), when a cut-off of 0.675 was applied and the indeterminate samples were excluded from the analysis.

88860,Precision psychiatry in clinical practice.,2020-08-27,"Objective: The article focuses on exploring and comparing two top-down methods i.e., media milling and microfluidization for the fabrication of nanocrystals of rifampicin (RIF), a poorly water-soluble drug in terms of their potential for generation of stable and efficacious nanocrystals.Significance: Nanocrystals are often the system of choice for the formulation of poorly water-soluble drugs. The characteristic benefit of nanocrystals lies in their ability to boost the bioavailability of such drugs by enhancing their saturation solubility and dissolution velocity. Nanocrystals can be prepared by either bottom-up or top-down approach. The latter is often preferred due to the feasibility of scale-up and economical nature. Hence the emphasis on these methods.Methods: Stable RIF nanocrystals were developed and optimized using media milling and microfluidizer method by incorporating a suitable surfactant/stabilizer. The developed nanocrystals were evaluated for their saturation solubility, in vitro dissolution, solid-state characteristics, morphology, intrinsic dissolution rate, and short-term physical stability.Results: Both the methods were found to be equally efficient in terms of development of stable RIF nanocrystals, while in terms of processing time and efficacy, microfluidization was found to be advantageous. Amorphization and polymorphic conversion were evident based on the results of solid-state characterization. Furthermore, both formulations exhibited an enhanced solubility and faster dissolution velocity.Conclusions: Based on the characterization outcomes, it can be concluded that both the top-down technologies could be successfully applied to develop nanocrystals of poorly water-soluble drugs. However, microfluidization was found to outplay media milling in terms of processing time and drug loading.","Chogale, Manasi; Gite, Sandip; Patravale, Vandana",Drug development and industrial pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1080/03639045.2020.1821046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912040/,167

DESIGN An expert panel of 16 members was assembled. A review of the literature and evidence synthesis was undertaken and circulated to the panel We used the RAND/UCLA methodology with a multi-step process to make recommendations on the use of biologics. SETTING N/A PARTICIPANTS: N/A RESULTS: Recommendations were made, based on underlying disease severity, prior treatments and co-morbidities. A group of patients for whom biologics were considered an appropriate treatment option for CRSwNP was defined. CONCLUSIONS Although biologics are not currently available for the treatment of CRSwNP, the BRS Council have defined a group of patients who have higher rates of 'failure' with current treatment pathways, higher resource use and are more likely to suffer with uncontrolled symptoms. We would urge NICE to consider approval of biologics for such indications without applying further restrictions on use.","Hopkins, Claire; McKenzie, Jo-Lyn; Anari, Shahram; Carrie, Sean; Ramakrishnan, Yujay; Kara, Naveed; Philpott, Carl; Hobson, Jonathan; Qureishi, Ali; Stew, Ben; Bhalla, Raj; Gane, Simon; Walker, Abigail; Harries, Phil; Hathorn, Iain; Lund, Valerie",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817954/,167

90690,"Haemangioma: clinical course, complications and management.",2013,"BACKGROUND During extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the large contact surface between the blood and the extracorporeal circuit causes a continuous activation of coagulation and inflammation. Unfractionated heparin, a glycosaminoglycan that must bind to antithrombin as a cofactor, is currently the standard anticoagulant adopted during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Antithrombin, beyond being a potent natural anticoagulant, acts in the cross-talk between coagulation and inflammatory system through anticoagulation and coagulation-independent effects. OBJECTIVES In this review, we describe, in the adult setting of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the pathophysiological rationale for antithrombin use, the current practice of administration, and the effects of antithrombin on anticoagulation, bleeding, and outcomes. DATA SOURCES Studies on adults (18 years or older) on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation published from 1995 to 2018 in order to evaluate the use of antithrombin. RESULTS In adults on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, antithrombin supplementation has a highly pathophysiological rationale since coagulation factor consumption, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and endothelial activation are triggered by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Eleven articles are focused on the topic but among the authors there is no consensus on the threshold for supplementation (ranging from 70% to 80%) as well as on the dose (rarely standardized) and time of administration (bolus vs continuous infusion). Consistently, antithrombin is considered able to achieve better anticoagulation targets in or not in the presence of heparin resistance. The impact of antithrombin administration on bleeding still shows contrasting results. CONCLUSION Antithrombin use in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be investigated on the threshold for supplementation, dose, and time of administration.","Piacente, Claudia; Martucci, Gennaro; Miceli, Vitale; Pavone, Gaetano; Papeo, Anna; Occhipinti, Giovanna; Panarello, Giovanna; Lorusso, Roberto; Tanaka, Kenichi; Arcadipane, Antonio",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659120913803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228213/,167

Each VDL has its own laboratory information management system (LIMS), with processes and procedures to capture submission information, perform laboratory tests, define the boundaries of test results (i.e., positive or negative), and report results, in addition to internal business and accounting applications. Enormous quantities of data are accumulated and stored within VDL LIMSs. There is a need for platforms that allow VDLs to exchange and share portions of laboratory data using standardized, reliable, and sustainable information technology processes. Here we report concepts and applications for standardization and aggregation of data from swine submissions to multiple VDLs to detect and monitor porcine enteric coronaviruses by RT-PCR. Oral fluids, feces, and fecal swabs were the specimens submitted most frequently for enteric coronavirus testing. Statistical algorithms were used successfully to scan and monitor the overall and state-specific percentage of positive submissions. Major findings revealed a consistently recurrent seasonal pattern, with the highest percentage of positive submissions detected during December-February for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine deltacoronavirus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). After 2014, very few submissions tested positive for TGEV. Monitoring VDL data proactively has the potential to signal and alert stakeholders early of significant changes from expected detection. We demonstrate the importance of, and applications for, data organized and aggregated by using LOINC and SNOMED CTs, as well as the use of customized messaging to allow inter-VDL exchange of information.","Trevisan, Giovani; Linhares, Leticia C M; Schwartz, Kent J; Burrough, Eric R; Magalhães, Edison de S; Crim, Bret; Dubey, Poonam; Main, Rodger G; Gauger, Phillip; Thurn, Mary; Lages, Paulo T F; Corzo, Cesar A; Torrison, Jerry; Henningson, Jamie; Herrman, Eric; McGaughey, Rob; Cino, Giselle; Greseth, Jon; Clement, Travis; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Linhares, Daniel C L","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/10406387211002163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739188/,167

However, incomplete obliteration after PED treatment may lead to aneurysm regrowth and delayed rupture. Herein, we report a case of a partially thrombosed giant aneurysm of the cavernous internal carotid artery that showed progressive recanalization at 1-3 months after application of a PED. We monitored inflow volume in the aneurysm by computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and computed tomographic volumetric imaging (CTVI). Based on the imaging results, rather than applying additional PED, we decided to make the switch from a dual antiplatelet medication to low-dose aspirin alone at 3 months after the treatment; complete obliteration of the aneurysm was noted at 21 months. Similar to the findings in this unusual case, CTA and CTVI may be useful follow-up methods for optimal management of patients with giant intracranial aneurysms after PED treatment.","Lee, Woong Jae; Byun, Jun Soo; Kim, Jae Kyun; Nam, Taek Kyun",Yonsei medical journal,https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2017.58.3.668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28332378/,167

Moreover, influenza-related respiratory illnesses may increase the risk of adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, this study examines the mechanisms involved in influenza vaccination uptake. Specifically, this study investigates how health information sources are associated with perceived vaccine efficacy and safety, which, in turn, associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Analyzing cross-sectional survey data from a national U.S. adult sample (N = 19,420), mediation analyses were conducted. Results revealed that considering vaccine efficacy, health information seekers who assigned more value to medical professionals, medical journals, and newspaper articles were more likely to perceive a vaccine as effective, thus being more likely to receive the influenza vaccine. By contrast, individuals who placed more value in social media were less likely to perceive vaccine efficacy, and, in turn, were less likely to get the influenza vaccine. Turning to vaccine safety, the value ascribed to medical professionals was positively associated with vaccine safety, which, in turn, related to influenza vaccine uptake. By contrast, social media, family or friends, and promotions were negatively associated with vaccine safety, and then influenza vaccine uptake.","Hwang, Juwon",Journal of health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2020.1840675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186091/,167

Here, neural mass model-based tracking of brain states using the unscented Kalman filter applied to estimate parameters of the Jansen-Rit cortical population model is evaluated through the application of propofol-based anesthetic state monitoring. In particular, 15 subjects underwent propofol anesthesia induction from awake to anesthetised while behavioral responsiveness was monitored and frontal electroencephalographic signals were recorded. The unscented Kalman filter Jansen-Rit model approach applied to frontal electroencephalography achieved reasonable testing performance for classification of the anesthetic brain state (sensitivity: 0.51; chance sensitivity: 0.17; nearest neighbor sensitivity 0.75) when compared to approaches based on linear (autoregressive moving average) modeling (sensitivity 0.58; nearest neighbor sensitivity: 0.91) and a high performing standard depth of anesthesia monitoring measure, Higuchi Fractal Dimension (sensitivity: 0.50; nearest neighbor sensitivity: 0.88). Moreover, it was found that the unscented Kalman filter based parameter estimates of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential amplitude varied in the physiologically expected direction with increases in propofol concentration, while the estimates of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential rate constant did not. These results combined with analysis of monotonicity of parameter estimates, error analysis of parameter estimates, and observability analysis of the Jansen-Rit model, along with considerations of extensions of the Jansen-Rit model, suggests that the Jansen-Rit model combined with unscented Kalman filtering provides a valuable reference point for future real-time brain state tracking studies. This is especially true for studies of more complex, but still computationally efficient, neural models of anesthesia that can more accurately track the anesthetic brain state, while simultaneously inferring underlying physiological changes that can potentially provide useful clinical information.","Kuhlmann, Levin; Freestone, Dean R; Manton, Jonathan H; Heyse, Bjorn; Vereecke, Hugo E M; Lipping, Tarmo; Struys, Michel M R F; Liley, David T J",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.03.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018048/,167

97030,Another new application of heparin in COVID-19: more than anticoagulation and antiviral.,2021-06-10,"MERS is a life-threatening disease and MERS-CoV has the potential to cause the next pandemic. Protein acetylation is known to play a crucial role in host response to viral infection. Acetylation of viral proteins encoded by other RNA viruses have been reported to affect viral replication. It is therefore of interest to see whether MERS-CoV proteins are also acetylated. Viral proteins obtained from infected cells were trypsin-digested into peptides. Acetylated peptides were enriched by immunoprecipitation and subject to nano-LC-Orbitrap analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to assess the conservation level of identified acetylation sites and to predict the upstream regulatory factors. A total of 12 acetylation sites were identified from 7 peptides, which all belong to the replicase polyprotein pp1ab. All identified acetylation sites were found to be highly conserved across MERS-CoV sequences in NCBI database. Upstream factors, including deacetylases of the SIRT1 and HDAC families as well as acetyltransferases of the TIP60 family, were predicted to be responsible for regulating the acetylation events identified. Western blotting confirms that acetylation events indeed occur on pp1ab protein by expressing NSP4 in HEK293 cells. Acetylation events on MERS-CoV viral protein pp1ab were identified for the first time, which indicate that MERS-CoV might use the host acetylation machinery to regulate its enzyme activity and to achieve optimal replication. Upstream factors were predicted, which might facilitate further analysis of the regulatory mechanism of MERS-CoV replication.","Zhu, Lin; Fung, Sin-Yee; Xie, Guangshan; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Jin, Dong-Yan; Cai, Zongwei",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra119.001897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451505/,167

Faecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is postulated as a protocol to prevent CDI recurrence. MATERIAL AND METHODS A donor faecal sample and patient faecal samples (pre-FMT and post-FMT) were analysed. The r16S gene was amplified and sequenced by NGS, and its diversity and taxonomy composition were examined. RESULTS Microbial richness increased in post-FMT samples, and the β diversity studies grouped the samples into two clusters. One included the non-pathological samples (donor and pre-FMT samples), and the other included the pathological sample. The results obtained by Qiime2 and Bioconductor were similar. CONCLUSION The analysis showed an increase in taxonomic diversity after the FMT, which suggests its usefulness. Moreover, these results showed that standardisation of bioinformatics analysis is key.","Ventero, María Paz; Espinosa, Noelia; Jover, Rodrigo; Guillen, Yolanda; Merino, Esperanza; Rodríguez, Juan Carlos",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2020.05.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680797/,167
98733,Factors underlying the perception of effort during constant heart rate running above and below the critical heart rate.,2015,"If the worries about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are not already enough, some pregnant women have been questioning whether the hospital is a safe or safe enough place to deliver their babies and therefore whether they should deliver out-of-hospital during the pandemic. In the United States, planned out-of-hospital births are associated with significantly increased risks of neonatal morbidity and death. In addition, there are obstetric emergencies during out-of-hospital births that can lead to adverse outcomes, partly because of the delay in transporting the woman to the hospital. In other countries with well-integrated obstetric services and well-trained midwives, the differences in outcomes of planned hospital birth and planned home birth are smaller. Women are empowered to make informed decisions when the obstetrician makes ethically justified recommendations, which is known as directive counseling. Recommendations are ethically justified when the outcomes of one form of management is clinically superior to another. The outcomes of morbidity and mortality and of infection control and prevention of planned hospital birth are clinically superior to those of out-of-hospital birth. The obstetrician therefore should recommend planned hospital birth and recommend against planned out-of-hospital birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels for all patients and even more so for pregnant patients and their families. The response in this difficult time should be to mitigate this stress and empower women to make informed decisions by routinely providing counseling that is evidence-based and directive.","Grünebaum, Amos; McCullough, Laurence B; Bornstein, Eran; Klein, Risa; Dudenhausen, Joachim W; Chervenak, Frank A",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401227/,167

Many attempts have been made to identify uniform subtypes, or phenotypes, of atopic dermatitis in order to identify different aetiologies, improve diagnosis, estimate more accurate clinical prognoses, inform treatment andmanagement or predict treatment efficacy andeffectiveness. However, no consensus yet exists on exactly what defines these phenotypes or how many there are and whether they are genuine or statistical artefacts. This review aims to identify previously reported phenotypes of atopic dermatitis, the features used to define them and any characteristics or clinical outcomes significantly associated with them. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE and Web of Science from inception to the latest available date at the time of the search for studies attempting to classify atopic dermatitis in humans using any cross-sectional or longitudinal epidemiological or interventional design. Primary outcomes are atopic dermatitis phenotypes, features used to define them and characteristics associated with them in subsequent analyses. A secondary outcome is the methodological approach used to derive them. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts for inclusion, extract data and assess study quality. We will present the results of this review descriptively and with frequencies where possible. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this study as it is a systematic review.

It has been speculated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could directly affect the male reproductive system, and therefore heredity and fertility. The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV could confirm this hypothesis because both viruses use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) as the receptor to enter human cells. ACE2 is expressed by Sertoli cells and other testicular cells, therefore COVID-19 has the potential to impair fertility by destroying Sertoli cells.

METHODS PubMed and EMBASE were searched for all studies published over a 20-year time frame, prior to March 25, 2020. Original articles that reported predictors of failed enema reduction were included. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for successful enema reduction according to various features was calculated. The combined estimates were meta-analytically pooled by random-effects modeling. The risk of bias was assessed using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool. This review was registered to the PROSPERO (CRD42020190178). RESULTS A total of 38 studies, comprising 40,133 cases, were included. The shorter duration of symptoms (< 24 h; combined OR, 3.812; 95% CI, 2.150-6.759) and abdominal pain (combined OR, 2.098; 95% CI, 1.405-3.133) were associated with the success (all p < 0.001). Age < 1 year (combined OR, 0.385; 95% CI, 0.166-0.893; p = 0.026), fever (combined OR, 0.519; 95% CI, 0.371-0.725; p < 0.001), rectal bleeding (combined OR, 0.252; 95% CI, 0.165-0.387; p < 0.001), and vomiting (combined OR, 0.497; 95% CI, 0.372-0.664; p < 0.001) were associated with the failed reduction. The ascites (combined OR, 0.127; 95% CI, 0.044-0.368; p = 0.001), left-sided intussusception (combined OR, 0.121; 95% CI, 0.058-0.252; p < 0.001), and trapped fluid (combined OR, 0.179; 95% CI, 0.061-0.525; p = 0.017) on US were associated with the failed reduction. CONCLUSIONS Successful predictors for intussusception reduction have been summarized. This evidence can help identify patients who are more likely to fail non-operative reduction and could be potential surgical candidates. KEY POINTS • A shorter duration of symptoms and presence of abdominal pain were associated with increased probability of success. • Age (less than 1 year), presence of fever, rectal bleeding, vomiting, and presence of ascites, left-sided intussusception, or trapped fluid on ultrasonography were associated with decreased probability of success. • This study suggests that various clinical and ultrasonography predictors would help identify patients who are more likely to fail nonoperative reduction and identify potential preoperative candidates.","Kim, Pyeong Hwa; Hwang, Jisun; Yoon, Hee Mang; Lee, Jeong-Yong; Jung, Ah Young; Lee, Jin Seong; Cho, Young Ah",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-07935-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974147/,167
100570,For the patient: COVID-19 vaccines and the public challenges and solutions.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Surgical reconstruction of congenital heart defects is often limited by the nonresorbable material used to approximate normal anatomy. In contrast, biologic scaffold materials composed of resorbable non-cross-linked extracellular matrix (ECM) have been used for tissue reconstruction of multiple organs and are replaced by host tissue. Preparation of whole organ ECM by decellularization through vascular perfusion can maintain much of the native three-dimensional (3D) structure, strength, and tissue-specific composition. A 3D cardiac ECM (C-ECM) biologic scaffold material would logically have structural and functional advantages over materials such as Dacron™ for myocardial repair, but the in vivo remodeling characteristics of C-ECM have not been investigated to date. METHODS AND RESULTS A porcine C-ECM patch or Dacron patch was used to reconstruct a full-thickness right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) defect in a rat model with end points of structural remodeling function at 16 weeks. The Dacron patch was encapsulated by dense fibrous tissue and showed little cellular infiltration. Echocardiographic analysis showed that the right ventricle of the hearts patched with Dacron were dilated at 16 weeks compared to presurgery baseline values. The C-ECM patch remodeled into dense, cellular connective tissue with scattered small islands of cardiomyocytes. The hearts patched with C-ECM showed no difference in the size or function of the ventricles as compared to baseline values at both 4 and 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS The C-ECM patch was associated with better functional and histomorphological outcomes compared to the Dacron patch in this rat model of RVOT reconstruction.","Wainwright, John M; Hashizume, Ryotaro; Fujimoto, Kazuro L; Remlinger, Nathaniel T; Pesyna, Colin; Wagner, William R; Tobita, Kimimasa; Gilbert, Thomas W; Badylak, Stephen F","Cells, tissues, organs",https://doi.org/10.1159/000331400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22025093/,167

101557,Comparison of seven videolaryngoscopes with the Macintosh laryngoscope in manikins by experienced and novice personnel.,2016,"UNLABELLED The regulation of the interferon type I (IFN-I) response has been shown to rely on posttranslational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) to stabilize, or activate, a variety of IFN-I signaling and downstream effector proteins. Unlike Ub, which is almost perfectly conserved among eukaryotes, ISG15 is highly divergent, even among mammals. Since zoonotic viruses rely on viral proteins to recognize, or cleave, ISG15 conjugates in order to evade, or suppress, innate immunity, the impact of ISG15 biodiversity on deISGylating proteases of the ovarian tumor family (vOTU) from nairoviruses was evaluated. The enzymatic activities of vOTUs originating from the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Erve virus, and Nairobi sheep disease virus were tested against ISG15s from humans, mice, shrews, sheep, bats, and camels, which are mammalian species known to be infected by nairoviruses. This along with investigation of binding by isothermal titration calorimetry illustrated significant differences in the abilities of nairovirus deISGylases to accommodate certain species of ISG15. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of species preferences of these vOTUs, a structure was determined to 2.5 Å for a complex of Erve virus vOTU protease and a mouse ISG15 domain. This structure revealed the molecular basis of Erve virus vOTU's preference for ISG15 over Ub and the first structural insight into a nonhuman ISG15. This structure also revealed key interactions, or lack thereof, surrounding three amino acids that may drive a viral deISgylase to prefer an ISG15 from one species over that of another. IMPORTANCE Viral ovarian tumor domain proteases (vOTUs) are one of the two principal classes of viral proteases observed to reverse posttranslational modification of host proteins by ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15), subsequently facilitating downregulation of IFN-I signaling pathways. Unlike the case with ubiquitin, the amino acid sequences of ISG15s from various species are notably divergent. We illustrate that vOTUs have clear preferences for ISG15s from certain species. In addition, these observations are related to the molecular insights acquired via the first X-ray structure of the vOTU from the Erve nairovirus in complex with the first structurally resolved nonhuman ISG15. This information implicates certain amino acids that drive the preference of vOTUs for ISG15s from certain species.","Deaton, M K; Dzimianski, J V; Daczkowski, C M; Whitney, G K; Mank, N J; Parham, M M; Bergeron, E; Pegan, S D",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00975-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27412597/,167

The MAVIG X-ray protective drape (MXPD) is a commercially available light weight, lead-free shield placed over the pelvic area of patients to minimize operator radiation dose. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of the MXPD during routine cardiac catheterization, including percutaneous coronary interventions. METHODS We performed a prospective, randomized controlled study comparing operator radiation dose during cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (n=632) with or without pelvic MXPD. We measured operator radiation dose at 4 sites: left eye, chest, left ring finger, and right ring finger. The primary outcomes were the difference in first operator radiation dose (µSv) and relative dose of the first operator (radiation dose normalized for dose area product) at the level of the chest in the 2 groups. RESULTS The use of the MXPD was associated with a 50% reduction in operator radiation dose (median dose 30.5 [interquartile range, 23.0-39.7] µSv in no drape group versus 15.3 [interquartile range, 11.1-20.0] µSv in the drape group; P<0.001) and a 57% reduction in relative operator dose (P<0.001). The largest absolute reduction in dose was observed at the left finger (median left finger dose for the no drape group was 104.9 [75.7-137.4] µSv versus 41.9 [32.6-70.6] µSv in the drape group; P<0.001).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has led to a severe medical, social and economic crisis globally. Use of antivirals has given inconsistent results; thus systematic summaries of available evidence are required for any recommendations for treatment. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of antivirals for Covid-19. Methods. The databases we searched were-Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening and data abstraction were carried out in duplicate by two researchers. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method of random effects for meta-analysis. Results. Twenty studies were found eligible for inclusion: 6 randomized controlled trials, 9 cohort studies and 5 case series. Moderate-quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit from the use of remdesivir in improving the number of recoveries (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07-1.31; I2 = 0%) and time to recovery in days (median -3.02; 95% CI -4.98 to -1.07; I2 = 97%). A possibility of lower mortality is suggested by low-quality evidence with remdesivir (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37, I2 = 58%). Moderate-quality evidence suggests no certain benefit of using lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19 compared to arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with arbidol or other medications used as controls. Conclusion. Further evidence from randomized controlled trials is required for all antivirals to treat Covid-19.

Particularly, coronaviruses are mentioned among the viruses implicated in autoimmunity. Today, the world's greatest threat derives from the pandemic of a new human coronavirus, called ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the responsible agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China in December 2019 and, to date, has spread to at least 187 countries. This review focuses on autoimmune manifestations described during COVID-19, including pro-thrombothic state associated to antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), acute interstitial pneumonia, macrophage activation syndrome, lymphocytopenia, systemic vasculitis, and autoimmune skin lesions. This offers the opportunity to highlight the pathogenetic mechanisms common to COVID19 and several autoimmune diseases, in order to identify new therapeutic targets. In a supposed preliminary pathogenetic model, SARS-CoV-2 plays a direct role in triggering widespread microthrombosis and microvascular inflammation, because it is able to induce transient aPL, endothelial damage and complement activation at the same time. Hence, endothelium might represent the common pathway in which autoimmunity and infection converge. In addition, autoimmune phenomena in COVID-19 can be explained by regulatory T cells impairment and cytokines cascade.","Fatone, Maria Celeste",Current rheumatology reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573397116666201005122603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33019935/,167
103505,Resistance training prevents right ventricle hypertrophy in rats exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke.,2020,"The biggest challenge for our society, in order to foster the sustainable circular economy, is the efficient recycling of wastes from industrial, commercial, domestic and other streams. The transition to a circular economy is the goal of the European Commission's Circular Economy Action, which was first launched in 2015. In 2020 the above action plan announced initiatives along the entire life cycle of the product, with the aim to make sustainable products the norm in the EU. Therefore, it is anticipated that the above action will result in an increase in Europe's economic competitiveness, sustainability, resource efficiency and resource security. Within this context, the suitability of ferroalumina as a raw material in the blast furnace is investigated. Ferroalumina is the product of the high-pressure filter press dewatering process of the Greek red mud generated during the production of alumina by means of the Bayer cycle. Ferroalumina is a low-cost raw material and its possible charging in the blast furnace and/or steelmaking aggregates is a step towards industrial symbiosis, where the wastes, namely by-products, of an industry or an industrial process, become the raw materials for another. In the present work the effect of ferroalumina addition as a raw material was examined by smelting ferroalumina, blast furnace-slag, lime and scrap at 1550°C in a graphite crucible and a constant slag basicity. The increase of the alumina content in the slag improves the desulfurization capacity. Moreover, the silicon exchange between slag and metal was examined. The results indicate that the alkalis' capacity of the slag increases with the addition of ferroalumina. The analysis of the finally obtained slag suggests that it could be suitable for utilization in slag-cement production.","Karamoutsos, Spiros; Tzevelekou, Theofani; Christogerou, Angeliki; Grilla, Eleni; Gypakis, Antonios; Pérez Villarejo, Luis; Mantzavinos, Dionissios; Angelopoulos, George N","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x21991906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594947/,167

103666,UK charities call for emergency government funding.,2021-02-25,"Dose is the nexus between exposure and all upstream processes that determine pathogen pressure, and is thereby an important element underlying disease dynamics. Understanding the relationship between dose and disease is particularly important in the context of spillover, where nonlinearities in the dose-response could determine the likelihood of transmission. There is a need to explore dose-response models for directly transmitted and zoonotic pathogens, and how these interactions integrate within-host factors to consider, for example, heterogeneity in host susceptibility and dose-dependent antagonism. Here, we review the dose-response literature and discuss the unique role dose-response models have to play in understanding and predicting spillover events. We present a re-analysis of dose-response experiments for two important zoonotic pathogens (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Nipah virus), to exemplify potential difficulties in differentiating between appropriate models with small exposure experiment datasets. We also discuss the data requirements needed for robust selection between dose-response models. We then suggest how these processes could be modelled to gain more realistic predictions of zoonotic transmission outcomes and highlight the exciting opportunities that could arise with increased collaboration between the virology and epidemiology disciplines. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.","Lunn, Tamika J; Restif, Olivier; Peel, Alison J; Munster, Vincent J; de Wit, Emmie; Sokolow, Sanna; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Hudson, Peter; McCallum, Hamish","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

To date in higher volume centres and by experienced operators MitraClip is used for the treatment of complex anatomies and challenging cases in high risk-inoperable patients. This progressive step is superimposable to what observed in surgery for edge-to-edge surgery (Alfieri's technique). Moreover, the results of clinical studies on the treatment of patients with high surgical risk and functional mitral insufficiency have confirmed that the main goal to be achieved for improving clinical outcomes of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is the reduction of MR itself. The MitraClip should therefore be considered as a tool to achieve this goal in addition to medical therapy. Nowadays, evaluation of patient's candidacy to MitraClip procedure, discussed in local Heart Team, must take into account not only the clinical features of patients but even the experience of the operators and the volume of the centre, which are mostly related to the probability to achieve good procedural results. This 'relative feasibility' of challenges cases by experienced operators should always been taken into account in selecting patients for MitraClip. Here, we present a review of the literature available on the treatment of complex and challenging lesions.","Gavazzoni, Mara; Taramasso, Maurizio; Zuber, Michel; Russo, Giulio; Pozzoli, Alberto; Miura, Mizuki; Maisano, Francesco",European heart journal cardiovascular Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408344/,167

Because the binding modes of small molecule inhibitors of 6HB formation are largely unknown, precisely how they disrupt 6HB formation remains unclear, and structure-based design of improved inhibitors is thus seriously hampered. Here we present the high resolution crystal structure of TMC353121, a potent inhibitor of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bound at a hydrophobic pocket of the 6HB formed by amino acid residues from both HR1 and HR2 heptad-repeats. Binding of TMC353121 stabilizes the interaction of HR1 and HR2 in an alternate conformation of the 6HB, in which direct binding interactions are formed between TMC353121 and both HR1 and HR2. Rather than completely preventing 6HB formation, our data indicate that TMC353121 inhibits fusion by causing a local disturbance of the natural 6HB conformation.","Roymans, Dirk; De Bondt, Hendrik L; Arnoult, Eric; Geluykens, Peggy; Gevers, Tom; Van Ginderen, Marcia; Verheyen, Nick; Kim, Hidong; Willebrords, Rudy; Bonfanti, Jean-François; Bruinzeel, Wouter; Cummings, Maxwell D; van Vlijmen, Herman; Andries, Koen",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0910108106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19966279/,167

METHODS RapidPlan models in the Eclipse version 15.6 were used with the data of 28, 42, and 20 patients with head and neck, pancreatic, and rectal cancer, respectively. RapidPlan models of head and neck, pancreatic, and rectal cancer were created for TrueBeam STx (High Definition 120) with 6 MV, TrueBeam STx with 10-MV flattening filter-free, and Clinac iX (Millennium 120) with 15 MV, respectively. The models were used to create volumetric-modulated arc therapy plans for a 10-patient test dataset using all energy and MLC types at all disease sites. The Holm test was used to compare multiple dosimetric indices in different treatment machines and energy types. RESULTS The dosimetric indices for planning target volume and organs at risk in RapidPlan model-based plans were comparable to those in the clinical plan. Furthermore, no dose difference was observed among the RapidPlan models. The variability among RapidPlan models was consistent regardless of the treatment machines, MLC types, and energy. CONCLUSIONS Dosimetric indices of RapidPlan model-based plans appear to be comparable to the ones based on clinical plans regardless of energies, MLC types, and disease sites. The results suggest that the RapidPlan model can generate treatment plans independent of the type of treatment machine.","Hirashima, Hideaki; Nakamura, Mitsuhiro; Mukumoto, Nobutaka; Ashida, Ryo; Fujii, Kota; Nakamura, Kiyonao; Nakajima, Aya; Sakanaka, Katsuyuki; Yoshimura, Michio; Mizowaki, Takashi",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.13316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151503/,167

Objective To evaluate the impact that the use of the masseter nerve in dynamic facial reconstruction has on the electrical activity of the masseter muscle and on bite force. Materials and Methods An observational and prospective longitudinal study was performed measuring bite force and electrical activity of the masseter muscles before and 3 months after dynamic facial reconstructive surgery using the masseter nerve. An occlusal analyzer and surface electromyography were employed for measurements. Results The study included 15 patients with unilateral facial paralysis, with a mean age of 24.06 ± 23.43. Seven patients were subjected to a masseter-buccal branch nerve transfer, whereas in eight patients, the masseter nerve was used as a donor nerve for gracilis free functional muscle transfer. Electrical activity of the masseter muscle was significantly reduced after surgery in both occlusal positions: from 140.86 ± 65.94 to 109.68 ± 68.04 ( p = 0.01) in maximum intercuspation and from 123.68 ± 75.64 to 82.64 ± 66.56 ( p = 0.01) in the rest position. However, bite force did not show any reduction, changing from 22.07 ± 15.66 to 15.56 ± 7.91 ( p = 0.1) after the procedure. Conclusion Masseter nerve transfer causes a reduction in electromyographic signals of the masseter muscle; however, bite force is preserved and comparable to preoperative status.","Telich-Tarriba, Jose E; Orihuela-Rodríguez, Alejandro; Rivera-Priego, Adriana de Lourdes; Ángeles-Medina, Fernando; Morales-González, Julio; Mora-Magaña, Ignacio; Fentanes-Vera, Adriana; Palafox, Damian; Cárdenas-Mejía, Alexander",Indian journal of plastic surgery : official publication of the Association of Plastic Surgeons of India,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3400673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425369/,167

In air travel, tracing of passengers to control the further spread of a pathogen is a more or less established approach in infectious disease control in many industrialized countries; however, literature reviews on the risk of TB transmission during public ground travel do not show robust evidence. On short trips, contact tracing (CT) of passengers may be unfeasible since passenger data are generally not collected. In long-distance ground travel, passenger data may not be collected routinely; incomplete data and limited or delayed access to passenger details may be further obstacles. The logistic hurdles and limited evidence suggest that CT in public ground transportation should not be a priority of TB control.

Methods A series of radiologic signs in 11 COVID-19 patients were summarized and made morphometric analysis. Results A special sign termed as ""the arch bridge sign"" owing to its morphological mimicking an arch bridge was firstly introduced. Statistical analyze showed that the subpleural area is the priority distribution location (14/14) and the sign inclined to perform in those patients in a relatively early stage (6/8) and with moderate clinical severity (8/8). Segment VI in lower lobe involved most (6/14). In this retrospective study, other characteristic radiologic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed synchronously. A series of radiologic signs were identified in bilateral lungs with a bias towards segment VI, I + II and X. Segment VI had the largest number of each sign. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs), subpleural distribution pattern and vessels dilatation were the top three most common signs among them. Conclusions The recognition of the arch bridge sign may benefit patient care by earlier definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

AIM To study the long-term efficacy of pneumatic dilation (PD) and myotomy in achalasia at least 10 years after treatment. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of achalasia patients with >10 years follow-up after initial myotomy or pneumatic dilation. Symptom recurrence which required repeat dilation or surgery was compared between pneumatic dilation and myotomy. RESULTS One hundred and fifty patients (112 myotomy, 38 pneumatic dilation) of similar characteristics were studied. The mean duration of follow-up after initial treatment was 17.5 ± 7.2 years (10-40 years). Symptoms recurrence rate was 60.7% (100% pneumatic dilation patients vs. 47.3% myotomy), hazard ratio 0.24 demonstrating a lower need for repeat dilation or surgery with myotomy than pneumatic dilation (P = 0.008). All pneumatic dilation patients underwent myotomy in 4 ± 4 (0-16 years). Forty of 53 myotomy patients had symptom recurrence prompting further treatment: 16 pneumatic dilation, 11 myotomy and 13 both. The mean time to repeat procedure was 6.9 years (0-40). The myotomy group required fewer dilations and/or surgeries than the pneumatic dilation group (1.6 vs. 3.6, P < 0.001). 13 patients (10.1%) progressed to end-stage achalasia (five myotomy, eight pneumatic dilation) over 40 years. At last follow-up, 57/62 (92%) patients had absent or mild dysphagia, 53/62 (85%) patients had regurgitation less than once per week and 37 (60.7%) had heartburn episodes <1/week similar for pneumatic dilation and myotomy (P = 0.27). CONCLUSION Although the majority of patients treated for achalasia do well after decades of treatment, most patients may need a series of endoscopic and/or surgical procedures to maintain effective symptom control.","Sawas, T; Ravi, K; Geno, D M; Enders, F; Pierce, K; Wigle, D; Katzka, D A",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27925255/,167

Nafamostat has recently been reported as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19. However, there is a lack of information on the compatibility of nafamostat with the aforementioned drug classes. This study evaluated the physical compatibility of nafamostat with these drug classes. METHODS Nafamostat was combined with 1-3 target drugs (fentanyl, morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and rocuronium). Fifteen physical compatibility tests were conducted. Nafamostat was dissolved in 5% glucose solution; the final concentration was 10 mg/mL. All other medications were diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain clinically relevant concentrations. The power of hydrogen (pH) of all medications was measured during each test. Compatibility tests were conducted with four test solutions wherein nafamostat and the target drugs were compounded at equal volume ratios (1:1, 1:1:1, or 1:1:1:1). Visual appearance, turbidity, and pH were evaluated immediately after mixing and at 1 and 3 hours. Physical incompatibilities were defined as gross precipitation, cloudiness, appearance of the Tyndall effect, or a turbidity change of ≥0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) based on nafamostat. RESULTS The mean pH of nafamostat was 3.13 ± 0.03. The combination of nafamostat, fentanyl, and dexmedetomidine had the highest pH (3.39 ± 0.01; 3 hours after mixing). All drugs were compatible with nafamostat until 3 hours after admixture, with a mean turbidity value of <0.03 NTU. CONCLUSIONS Infusions combining nafamostat with the tested sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants could be safely administered.","Kondo, Masayoshi; Nagano, Makihiko; Yoshida, Mariko; Yoshida, Naoki; Tagui, Naoya; Yoshida, Masato; Sugaya, Kazutoshi; Takase, Hisamitsu",Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,https://doi.org/10.1272/jnms.jnms.2022_89-104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692301/,167

This yielded stabilized unicellular morphology through fuz7 deletion, reduction of by-product formation through deletion of genes responsible for itaconate oxidation and (glyco)lipid production, and the overexpression of the regulator of the itaconate cluster ria1 and the mitochondrial tricarboxylate transporter encoded by mttA from Aspergillus terreus. In this study, itaconate production was further optimized by consolidating these different optimizations into one strain. The combined modifications resulted in itaconic acid production at theoretical maximal yield, which was achieved under biotechnologically relevant fed-batch fermentations with continuous feed.","Becker, Johanna; Tehrani, Hamed Hosseinpour; Ernst, Philipp; Blank, Lars Mathias; Wierckx, Nick",Journal of fungi,https://doi.org/10.3390/jof7010020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33396473/,167
110770,Alcohol-Branded Merchandise Ownership and Drinking.,2016,"Postoperative dressing protocols after clean surgery without implant vary widely. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether early postoperative dressing removal is a valid option, as compared to untouched dressing or twice-weekly dressing change approach. A prospective randomized study was conducted on patients who underwent carpal tunnel release (CTR) or trigger finger release (TFR) between January and November 2020. Patients were randomly distributed into 3 groups: surgical dressing untouched until first follow up (SDU); surgical dressing changed twice a week in a health maintenance organization (HMO); and surgical dressing removed at first postoperative day (SDR). Data collected included patient characteristics, pre-and post-operative functional (QuickDASH) and autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living performance (IADL)) scores, Vancouver scar scale (VSS) and potential complications. Eighty-four patients were included: 28 (33.3%), 29 (34.5%) and 27 (32.1%) in the SDU, HMO and SDR groups, respectively. Deterioration in mean IADL score at 2-week follow-up was statistically significant in the HMO group (mean delta 3.35, p = 0.008). Quick DASH score improved significantly between preoperative and 2-week follow-up values only in the SDU group (mean delta 9.12, p = 0.012). Other parameters, including wound complications, did not differ significantly between groups. Early removal of postoperative dressing and immediate wound exposure was a safe option after CTR and TFR. An untouched bulky dressing correlated with early functional improvement. Finally, iterative dressing change in HMO showed no benefit and led to significant deterioration in early postoperative autonomy.

110982,Approach to the Patient: Perioperative Management of the Patient with Pheochromocytoma or Sympathetic Paraganglioma.,2020-09-01,"Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used to investigate head tumors in dogs, however little information is available for lesions of the pharyngeal area. The purpose of this multicentric, retrospective, cross-sectional study was to describe the CT findings in a sample of dogs with pathologically confirmed pharyngeal neoplasia and determine whether any CT features allowed differentiation of tumor type. Location of lesions, size and shape, margins, relationship with surrounding structures and vessels, attenuation characteristics and enhancement pattern, regional lymph node changes, and presence of metastasis were recorded by three observers (1 DECVDI). The effect of final diagnosis on each CT feature was tested. A total of 25 dogs were included: 15 with carcinomas, five sarcomas, four melanomas, and one lymphoma. The oropharynx and laryngopharynx were more frequently involved. Among tumor groups, lesions were of similar size, irregularly shaped, had ill-defined margins, and had moderate-to-marked heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Lysis of hyoid bones was recorded in two carcinomas and infiltration of the lingual artery occurred in one case. Marked medial retropharyngeal lymphoadenomegaly was recorded in 11 of 14 carcinomas, in all sarcomas and in two of four melanomas. The single lymphoma case showed ill-defined thickening of the oropharyngeal and laryngeal wall with retropharyngeal and mandibular lymphadenomegaly. Lung metastases were found in two of five sarcomas and two of four melanomas. Findings from the current study did not support the hypothesis that CT features could be used to predict pharyngeal tumor type in dogs. However, CT was helpful for determining mass extension, lymph node involvement, and distant metastatic spread.","Carozzi, Gregorio; Zotti, Alessandro; Alberti, Monica; Rossi, Federica",Veterinary radiology & ultrasound : the official journal of the American College of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/vru.12278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173553/,167
111138,Patient-oriented outcomes for atopic dermatitis.,2020-11-08,"BACKGROUND Research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is lacking. AIMS This study investigates the relationship between COVID-19 and behaviors of children with ASD living in the United States. METHODS AND PROCEDURES Parents and caregivers (n = 200) across the United States, as proxies for children 2-17 years of age with ASD, participated in an online survey querying changes in overall behavior and 15 specific behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of a moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior with household income level and food security status. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS A majority of respondents reported a moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior (74 %) due to COVID-19. Several specific behaviors were also affected. Stratifying by income level and food security status revealed disparities in the impact on overall behavior and most specific behaviors. Compared to a household income ≥$100 K, an income <$50 K was associated with an increased risk of moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior (odds ratio (OR): 4.07, 95 % CI: 1.60, 10.38). Food insecurity also significantly impacted this risk, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR: 3.31, 95 % CI: 1.13, 9.66). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings show a large proportion of caregivers reporting moderate-to-large changes post-COVID-19 in the behaviors of U.S. children with ASD, particularly in families with low income and/or food insecurity. This study highlights the effects of existing disparities on children with ASD and their families during this unprecedented time.","Panjwani, Anita A; Bailey, Regan L; Kelleher, Bridgette L",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.104002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147945/,167

Because of the limited proofreading capability in the viral encoded polymerase, they emerge genetically diverse. There has been no molecular surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of GCOVs in avian species. The present study was conducted to detect GCOVs in Tehran birds’ parks, 2015. Cloacal swabs (267 samples) from eight different bird species ((Chickens (Gallus gallus), Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Partridge (Perdix perdix), Quail (Coturnix coturnix), Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Goose (Anserini),and Guinea fowl (Numididae)) were collected, the viral RNA was extracted, the RT-PCR was performed using QIAGEN one step RT-PCR kit and the primers targeting “3'-UTR” and “Nucleocapsid” genes. The detection rate was approximately 8.99%. GCOVs were detected in the chicken, quail, pheasant, turkey, and the partridge with different prevalence rates. Phylogenetic tree based on partial nucleotide sequences of the N gene clustered the samples into two groups. It is the first report of GCOVs in non-commercial birds in Iran. According to our results, GCOVs are circulating in different avian species, and further studies are needed to isolate these viruses and evaluate their pathogenesis.","Yaghoubi, H; Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, A; Karimi, V; Ghafouri, S A; Hashemzadeh, M; Hosseini, H; Fallah Mehrabadi, M H; Sadat Mousavi, F; Najafi, H",Archives of Razi Institute,https://doi.org/10.22092/ari.2018.116786.1176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31939251/,167

Methods Total 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were allocated to either a study group (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) or a control group (BMI < 25 kg/m2). The endotracheal intubation was performed with a high-volume low-pressure cuffed oral endotracheal tube. A manometer was connected to the pilot balloon using a 3-way stopcock and the cuff was inflated. The change in Pcuff was defined as the difference between the pressure just before intra-abdominal CO2 insufflation and the pressure before CO2 desufflation. Results Pcuff increased to 5.3 ± 3.6 cmH2O in the study group and 5.7 ± 5.4 cmH2O in the control group. There was no significant difference between two groups. While BMI was not correlated with change in Pcuff (r = 0.022, p = 0.867), there was a significant correlation between change in Pcuff and the duration of pneumoperitoneum (r = 0.309, p = 0.016). Conclusion The change in Pcuff was not affected by BMI and was significantly correlated with pneumoperitoneum time. We recommend regular measurement and adjustment of Pcuff during laparoscopic surgery.","Kwon, Youngsuk; Jang, Ji Su; Hwang, Sung Mi; Lee, Jae Jun; Hong, Seok Jun; Hong, Sung Jun; Kang, Byung Yong; Lee, Ho Seok",Open medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/med-2019-0046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198857/,167

With the advent of the so-called lunch-time face-lift, suture suspension facial rejuvenation has gained prominence and much popularity largely patient driven rather than data driven. We have published a decade ago a review about this rejuvenation technique. Despite its popularity at that time, serious long-term studies and peer-reviewed data about longevity and patient satisfaction were lacking to our surprise. As 10 years have passed, we have conducted a new systematic PubMed database search limited to the last 10 years interval. METHODS The search identified 192 publications. After screening the titles and abstracts, 20 clinical and 2 experimental studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for this review. RESULTS Though thread lift facial rejuvenation is considered to be a promising modality, no new evidence has been added to the literature to support its use. CONCLUSION Until evidence-based efficacy and robust data are objectively documented, patients requesting percutaneous facial rejuvenation must be well informed about adverse events, longevity of effect, and limited available data on efficacy.

It suffers from a double burden of over- and undernutrition, making it essential to understand diet quality in the population. In this scoping review, we have collated the existing literature on Malaysian diet quality, including factors that influence it, and the association between diet quality and health outcomes across the lifespan of Malaysians. Overall, diet quality was poor in all age groups studied. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and its iterations were predominantly used in urban and clinical settings to evaluate diet-chronic disease relationships. These indices were significantly associated with cardio-metabolic and disease risks in adults. The Diet Diversity Score (DDS) and Food Variety Score (FVS) were used to gauge diet quality in maternal and child nutrition studies and were associated with appropriate growth and caloric intake. Deficiencies were found in fruit, vegetable, legumes, and dairy intake. Meat, salt, and sugar intake were found to be excessive in many studies. The findings can inform policies to improve diet quality in this population. The review also identified knowledge gaps that require further investigation.","Ramadas, Amutha; Tham, Su Ming; Lalani, Shehzeen Alnoor; Shyam, Sangeetha",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13041380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924050/,167

This study aims to examine outcomes after esophagectomy in elderly patients. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of 474 patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer during 2002 to 2011. A total of 334 (70.5%) patients were less than 70 years old (group A), 124 (26.2%) 70 to 79 years (group B), and 16 (3.4%) 80 years or greater (group C). We analyzed the effect of age on outcome variables including overall and disease specific survival. RESULTS Major morbidity was observed to occur in 115 (35.6%) patients of group A, 58 (47.9%) of group B, and 10 (62.5%) of group C (p = 0.010). Mortality, both 30-day and 90-day was observed in 2 (0.6%) and 7 (2.2%) of group A, 4 (3.2%) and 7 (6.1%) of group B, and 1 (6.3%) and 2 (14.3%) of group C, respectively (p = 0.032 and p = 0.013). Anastomotic leak was observed in 16 (4.8%) patients of group A, 6 (4.8%) of group B, and 0 (0%) of group C (p = 0.685). Anastomotic stricture (defined by the need for ≥ 2 dilations) was observed in 76 (22.8%) of group A, 13 (10.5%) of group B, and 1 (6.3%) of group C (p = 0.005). Five-year overall and disease specific survival was 64.8% and 72.4% for group A, 41.7% and 53.4% for group B, 49.2% and 49.2% for group C patients (p = 0.0006), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Esophagectomy should be carefully considered in patients 70 to 79 years old and can be justified with low mortality. Outcomes in octogenarians are worse suggesting esophagectomy be considered on a case by case basis.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, interventional case series. METHODS Twenty-one patients undergoing IXT surgery and their parents were included. Using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), children and parents were separately questioned about QOL of patients. RESULTS The mean patients' age was 8.6 ± 3.2 years (SD), with range of 5-16 years. The children responded that all PedsQL scores were significantly improved by surgery, and the highest improvement was observed in the school subscale score. When the parents rated the children's QOL, significant improvements were limited to 3 out of 7 subscales, including the emotional, psychosocial health summary, and total scores. The improvements in the PedsQL score were not correlated with age, size of deviation changes following surgery, nor the improvement in binocular vision. CONCLUSIONS The general health-related QOL significantly improved by surgery in pediatric patients with IXT, while the improvement was considerably underestimated by the parents. The children reported the greatest improvement in the school functioning subscale, whereas parents failed to discern this improvement. The discrepancy in children' and parents' views can be an important factor when considering indication of corrective surgery and evaluating surgical outcomes.","Morita, Yuka; Hiraoka, Takahiro; Oshika, Tetsuro",Japanese journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10384-020-00811-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423137/,167

112600,Effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular risk profile.,2011,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy of a self-retaining barbed suture (SRBS) in achieving a secure and haemostatic renorrhaphy during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN). To compare perioperative outcomes for LPN with SRBS with those for LPN with conventional polyglactin suture, with specific attention to warm ischaemia time, blood loss and need for postoperative bleeding interventions. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients who underwent LPN between June 2007 and October 2010 were identified through an Institutional Review Board approved registry of oncological patients. Before July 2009, parenchymal repair after tumour excision was performed using absorbable polyglactin suture (Group 1), and subsequently, using SRBS (Group 2). Demographic, clinical, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared for each group. RESULTS LPN was performed in 49 patients in Group 1 and 29 in Group 2. Baseline demographic and clinical features, estimated blood loss, and transfusion and embolization rates were statistically similar for the cohorts. Mean warm ischaemia time (±SD) was significantly shorter for the SRBS group (26.4 ± 8.3 vs 32.8 ± 7.9; P= 0.0013). Bleeding requiring intervention (open conversion or transfusion ± embolization) was more common for Group 1 (9/49, 18.4% vs 1/29, 3.4%; P= 0.06). CONCLUSIONS The use of SRBS for parenchymal repair during LPN in humans is safe and is associated with a significant reduction in warm ischaemia time. SRBS use during LPN may also reduce rates of clinically significant bleeding. Prospective, larger studies to confirm the value of SRBS use in minimally invasive partial nephrectomy are warranted.","Olweny, Ephrem O; Park, Samuel K; Seideman, Casey A; Best, Sara L; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2011.10547.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21991931/,167
112683,How a Pandemic Could Advance the Science of Early Adversity.,2020-07-27,"INTRODUCTION Despite an exponential rise in laparoscopic surgery for inguinal herniorrhaphy, overall recurrence rates have remained unchanged. Therefore, an increasing number of patients present with recurrent hernias after having failed anterior and laparoscopic repairs. This study reports our experience with single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair for these hernias. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients referred with multiply recurrent inguinal hernias underwent SIL-IPOM from November 1 2009 to October 30 2013. A 2.5-cm infraumbilical incision was made and a SIL surgical port was placed intraperitoneally. Modified dissection techniques, namely, ""chopsticks"" and ""inline"" dissection, 5.5 mm/52 cm/30° angled laparoscope and conventional straight dissecting instruments were used. The peritoneum was incised above the symphysis pubis and dissection continued laterally and proximally raising an inferior flap, below a previous extraperitoneal mesh, while reducing any direct/indirect/femoral/cord lipoma before placement of antiadhesive mesh that was fixed into the pubic ramus as well as superiorly with nonabsorbable tacks before fixing its inferior border with fibrin sealant. The inferior peritoneal flap was then tacked back onto the mesh. RESULTS There were 9 male patients who underwent SIL-IPOM. Mean age was 55 years old and mean body mass index was 26.8 kg/m2. Mean mesh size was 275 cm2. Mean operation time was 125 minutes with hospital stay of 1 day and umbilical scar length of 21 mm at 4 weeks' follow-up. There were no intraoperative/postoperative complications, port-site hernias, chronic groin pain, or recurrence with mean follow-up of 20 months. CONCLUSIONS Multiply recurrent inguinal hernias after failed conventional anterior and laparoscopic repairs can be treated safely and efficiently with SIL-IPOM.","Tran, Hanh Minh; Tran, Kim; Zajkowska, Marta; Lam, Vincent; Hawthorne, Wayne",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392643/,167

112963,Functional reservoir microcapsules generated via microfluidic fabrication for long-term cardiovascular therapeutics.,2020-07-01,"UNLABELLED Proteolytic cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein is essential for influenza A virus (IAV) to acquire infectivity. This process is mediated by a host cell protease(s) in vivo. The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is expressed in the respiratory tract and is capable of activating a variety of respiratory viruses, including low-pathogenic (LP) IAVs possessing a single arginine residue at the cleavage site. Here we show that TMPRSS2 plays an essential role in the proteolytic activation of LP IAVs, including a recently emerged H7N9 subtype, in vivo. We generated TMPRSS2 knockout (KO) mice. The TMPRSS2 KO mice showed normal reproduction, development, and growth phenotypes. In TMPRSS2 KO mice infected with LP IAVs, cleavage of HA was severely impaired, and consequently, the majority of LP IAV progeny particles failed to gain infectivity, while the viruses were fully activated proteolytically in TMPRSS2+/+ wild-type (WT) mice. Accordingly, in contrast to WT mice, TMPRSS2 KO mice were highly tolerant of challenge infection by LP IAVs (H1N1, H3N2, and H7N9) with ≥1,000 50% lethal doses (LD50) for WT mice. On the other hand, a high-pathogenic H5N1 subtype IAV possessing a multibasic cleavage site was successfully activated in the lungs of TMPRSS2 KO mice and killed these mice, as observed for WT mice. Our results demonstrate that recently emerged H7N9 as well as seasonal IAVs mainly use the specific protease TMPRSS2 for HA cleavage in vivo and, thus, that TMPRSS2 expression is essential for IAV replication in vivo. IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (IAV) is a leading pathogen that infects and kills many humans every year. We clarified that the infectivity and pathogenicity of IAVs, including a recently emerged H7N9 subtype, are determined primarily by a host protease, TMPRSS2. Our data showed that TMPRSS2 is the key host protease that activates IAVs in vivo through proteolytic cleavage of their HA proteins. Hence, TMPRSS2 is a good target for the development of anti-IAV drugs. Such drugs could also be effective for many other respiratory viruses, including the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, because they are also activated by TMPRSS2 in vitro. Consequently, the present paper could have a large impact on the battle against respiratory virus infections and contribute greatly to human health.","Sakai, Kouji; Ami, Yasushi; Tahara, Maino; Kubota, Toru; Anraku, Masaki; Abe, Masako; Nakajima, Noriko; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Shirato, Kazuya; Suzaki, Yuriko; Ainai, Akira; Nakatsu, Yuichiro; Kanou, Kazuhiko; Nakamura, Kazuya; Suzuki, Tadaki; Komase, Katsuhiro; Nobusawa, Eri; Maenaka, Katsumi; Kuroda, Makoto; Hasegawa, Hideki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Tashiro, Masato; Takeda, Makoto",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03677-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600012/,167

These systems can support risk prediction and monitoring. This perspective narrative shows the powerful methods of AI for tracking cardiovascular risks. We conclude that AI could potentially become an integral part of the COVID-19 disease management system. Countries, large and small, should join hands with the WHO in building biobanks for scientists around the world to build AI-based platforms for tracking the cardiovascular risk assessment during COVID-19 times and long-term follow-up of the survivors.","Suri, Jasjit S; Puvvula, Anudeep; Majhail, Misha; Biswas, Mainak; Jamthikar, Ankush D; Saba, Luca; Faa, Gavino; Singh, Inder M; Oberleitner, Ronald; Turk, Monika; Srivastava, Saurabh; Chadha, Paramjit S; Suri, Harman S; Johri, Amer M; Nambi, Vijay; Sanches, J Miguel; Khanna, Narendra N; Viskovic, Klaudija; Mavrogeni, Sophie; Laird, John R; Bit, Arindam; Pareek, Gyan; Miner, Martin; Balestrieri, Antonella; Sfikakis, Petros P; Tsoulfas, George; Protogerou, Athanasios; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas; Kitas, George D; Kolluri, Raghu; Teji, Jagjit; Porcu, Michele; Al-Maini, Mustafa; Agbakoba, Ann; Sockalingam, Meyypan; Sexena, Ajit; Nicolaides, Andrew; Sharma, Aditya; Rathore, Vijay; Viswanathan, Vijay; Naidu, Subbaram; Bhatt, Deepak L",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2020.04.236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33387999/,167

114710,Defining the Epidemiology of Covid-19 - Studies Needed.,2020-02-19,"Background The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) is a well-designed survey to collect national data, which many researchers have used for their studies. In KNHANES, although portable spirometry was used, its reliability has not been verified. Methods We prospectively enrolled 58 participants from four Korean institutions. The participants were classified into normal pattern, obstructive pattern, and restrictive pattern groups according to their previous spirometry results. Lung function was estimated by conventional spirometry and portable spirometry, and the results were compared. Results The intraclass correlation coefficients of forced vital capacity (FVC) (coefficient, 9.993; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.988-0.996), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (coefficient, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.995-0.998), FEV1/FVC ratio (coefficient, 0.995; 95% CI, 0.992-0.997), and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% (FEF25-75%; coefficient, 0.991; 95% CI, 0.984-0.994) were excellent (all p<0.001). In the subgroup analysis, the results of the three parameters were similar in all groups. In the overall and subgroup analyses, Pearson's correlation of all the parameters was also excellent in the total (coefficient, 0.986-0.994; p<0.001) and subgroup analyses (coefficient, 0.915-0.995; p<0.001). In the paired t-test, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75% estimated by the two instruments were statistically different. However, FEV1 was not significantly different. Conclusion Lung function estimated by portable spirometry was well-correlated with that estimated by conventional spirometry. Although the values had minimal differences between them, we suggest that the spirometry results from the KNHANES are reliable.","Park, Hye Jung; Rhee, Chin Kook; Yoo, Kwang Ha; Park, Yong Bum",Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.4046/trd.2021.0016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940672/,167

Observational case-control study in a COVID-free hospital.,2020-09-07,"Globally, the advent and rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus has created significant disruption to health professions education and practice, and consequently interprofessional education, leading to a model of learning and practicing where much is unknown. Key questions for this ongoing evolution emerge for the global context leading to reflections on future directions for the interprofessional education field and its role in shaping future practice models. Health professions programs around the world have made a dramatic shift to virtual learning platforms in response to closures of academic institutions and restrictions imposed on learners accessing practice settings. Telemedicine, slow to become established in many countries to date, has also revolutionized practice in the current environment. Within the state of disruption and rapid change is the awareness of a silver lining that provides an opportunity for future growth. Key topics explored in this commentary include reflection on the application of existing competency frameworks, consideration of typology of team structures, reconsideration of theoretical underpinnings, revisiting of core dimensions of education, adaptation of interprofessional education activities, and the role in the future pandemic planning. As an international community of educators and researchers, the authors consider current observations relevant to interprofessional education and practice contexts and suggest a response from scholarship voices across the globe. The current pandemic offers a unique opportunity for educators, practitioners, and researchers to retain what has served interprofessional education and practice well in the past, break from what has not worked as well, and begin to imagine the new.","Langlois, Sylvia; Xyrichis, Andreas; Daulton, Brittany J; Gilbert, John; Lackie, Kelly; Lising, Dean; MacMillan, Kathleen; Najjar, Ghaidaa; Pfeifle, Andrea L; Khalili, Hossein",Journal of interprofessional care,https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1800606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811213/,167

OBJECTIVE To review the available information on mode of delivery, vertical/peripartum transmission, and neonatal outcome in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. SEARCH STRATEGY Combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and pregnancy in Embase and PubMed databases. SELECTION CRITERIA Papers reporting cases of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The following was extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS In the 13 studies included, vaginal delivery was reported in 6 cases (9.4%; 95% CI, 3.5-19.3). Indication for cesarean delivery was worsening of maternal conditions in 31 cases (48.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-61.3). Two newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assay were reported. In three neonates, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels were elevated but the RT-PCR test was negative. CONCLUSIONS The rate of vertical or peripartum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low, if any, for cesarean delivery; no data are available for vaginal delivery. Low frequency of spontaneous preterm birth and general favorable immediate neonatal outcome are reassuring.","Parazzini, Fabio; Bortolus, Renata; Mauri, Paola Agnese; Favilli, Alessandro; Gerli, Sandro; Ferrazzi, Enrico",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271947/,167

116500,Rectal dose to prostate cancer patients treated with proton therapy with or without rectal spacer.,2017,"OBJECTIVE Current literature demonstrates a lack of comparative in vivo studies regarding laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF). This randomized trial aimed to compare 3 popular methods of minimizing or reducing LLF in laparoscopic surgery by heating the lens using warm saline, applying anti-fog solution to the lens, and rubbing the lens with chlorhexidine solution. METHODS Ninety-six participants underwent randomization to be allocated in control (n = 24), warm saline (n = 24), anti-fog solution (n = 24), and chlorhexidine groups (n = 24). The primary outcome measure was the severity of LLF during the first 3 min after laparoscope insertion into the abdominal cavity. The severity of LLF was rated on a 10-point visual clarity scale ranging from 0 (clearest) to 10 (foggiest). The secondary outcome measures were (1) the severity of LLF during the remaining operative time other than the first 3 min, (2) the number of lens cleansings, and (3) the total time required to clean the lens. RESULTS Lens fogging during the first 3 min and remaining operative time other than the first 3 min was significantly decreased in the warm saline group compared to that in the other 3 groups (all, P < 0.001). In post hoc analysis, the anti-fog solution group was significantly foggier than the warm saline group, but clearer than the chlorhexidine and control groups. The number of lens cleansings and total time required to clean the lens were significantly lower in the warm saline and anti-fog solution groups than in the chlorhexidine and control groups (all, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The use of warm saline leads to significantly fewer fogging events than the use of anti-fog solution or chlorhexidine solution, resulting in an improved continuity of surgery.","Song, Taejong; Lee, Dong Hee",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06852-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139989/,167

Maximum flexibility was required in planning for multiple patient populations and a novel four-box concept to plan for the requirements of the respective possible populations was developed. Key difficulties that needed to be overcome in planning COVID-19 medical care delivery in a non-traditional space included oxygen delivery, unknown future patient populations, and staffing.

116890,Impact of coronaphobia on treatment and follow-up compliance of cancer patients.,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND Nurses are the largest regulated group of healthcare professionals involved in palliative care. In 2004, a taskforce of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) launched the 'Guide for development of palliative nurse education in Europe' (hereinafter, the EAPC 2004 Guide). No systematic evaluation of its impact in the development of palliative care education was undertaken. AIMS To describe current undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education across Europe; to identify the roles that nurses with different palliative care educational levels have in palliative care; and to assess the uptake of the EAPC 2004 Guide in the development of palliative care nursing in Europe. DESIGN Descriptive research involving an online survey among nursing experts, and the consultation of national representatives. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS A total of 135 nurses (52% response rate) from 25 countries completed the online survey; representatives from 16 countries were consulted. RESULTS In 14 (56%) countries, palliative care was not identified as a mandatory subject within undergraduate nursing education. The EAPC 2004 Guide is widely known and was/is being used in many countries to promote palliative care nursing education. Large variations were found across and within country responses. CONCLUSIONS Palliative care nursing education varies largely in Europe. The wide awareness and use of the EAPC 2004 Guide show how policy measures can influence the development of palliative care education. Recommendations are built and focus on both fostering the use of this guide and implementing policy measures to ensure that palliative care nursing is recognised and certified as a specialty in all European countries.","Martins Pereira, Sandra; Hernández-Marrero, Pablo; Pasman, H Roeline; Capelas, Manuel Luís; Larkin, Philip; Francke, Anneke L",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216320956817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912033/,167
117440,Administration of recombinant human placental growth factor decreases blood pressure in obese hypertensive pregnant rats.,2020-06-25,"Excessive monocyte activation with the development of excessive or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines often results in host tissue injury and even death in patients with pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. However, the changes of cytokine profiles of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, as well as the underlying mechanisms that are involved, remain unknown. Using a cytokine array containing 174 inflammation-related cytokines, we found significantly altered cytokine profiles in severe COVID-19 patients compared with those in mild patients or healthy controls, and identified leptin, CXCL-10, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α as the top differentially expressed cytokines. Notably, leptin showed high consistency with CXCL-10 and TNF-α in predicting disease severity, and correlated with body mass index, decreased lymphocyte counts, and disease progression. Further analysis demonstrated that monocytes in severe patients with higher leptin levels were inclined toward M1 polarization. Mechanistic studies revealed that leptin synergistically up-regulated expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and surface markers with IL-6 in monocytes through STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Collectively, our results suggest that overweight COVID-19 patients were prone to have higher leptin levels, which further activated monocytes, resulting in amplified or dysregulated immune responses. Taken together, our findings argue that leptin correlates severity of COVID-19 and may indicate a possible mechanism by which overweight patients have a greater tendency to develop severe conditions.","Wang, Jingya; Xu, Yinyin; Zhang, Xiaoli; Wang, Sheng; Peng, Ziyi; Guo, Jing; Jiang, Hongmei; Liu, Jing; Xie, Ying; Wang, Jingjing; Li, Xin; Liao, Juan; Wan, Chao; Yu, Lihua; Hu, Jinsong; Liu, Beizhong; Liu, Zhiqiang",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.5hi1020-704r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404078/,167

However, 30-60% of these individuals experience cognitive impairment. Fortunately, physical activity has emerged as a management strategy for cognitive impairment. PURPOSE To map the evidence on physical activity and cognition in HIV. METHODS We searched five databases using terms related to physical activity and HIV. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts for studies that addressed physical activity/exercise and cognition in people with HIV. Authors reviewed full texts to identify articles that met our inclusion criteria. One author extracted the data, then we collated the results and summarized the characteristics of included studies. RESULTS Sixteen studies from high-income countries were included; eight were interventional (five randomized controlled trials and three pre-post single group observational studies) and eight were non-interventional studies. The interventional studies included aerobic, resistive, and Tai Chi exercise for 8 weeks to 12 months in duration. Two of eight interventional studies found exercise to benefit self-reported cognition. All eight non-interventional studies showed a positive relationship between physical activity and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS Results of this study suggest that physical activity may preserve or improve cognition in people living with HIV. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity may play a role in preserving or improving cognition in the human immunodeficiency virus population. Exercise should be prescribed for people with human immunodeficiency virus based on the stage of infection. Rehabilitation professionals should follow current exercise guidelines when prescribing exercise for people living with human immunodeficiency virus.","Quigley, Adria; O'Brien, Kelly; Parker, Robin; MacKay-Lyons, Marilyn",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2018.1432079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29376434/,167

Cranial sensory neurons develop in close proximity to blood vessels; however, whether vasculature is an integral component of their niches is yet unknown. Here, two separate roles for vasculature in cranial sensory neurogenesis in zebrafish are uncovered. The first involves precise spatiotemporal endothelial-neuroblast cytoneme contacts and Dll4-Notch signaling to restrain neuroblast proliferation. The second, instead, requires blood flow to trigger a transcriptional response that modifies neuroblast metabolic status and induces sensory neuron differentiation. In contrast, no role of sensory neurogenesis in vascular development is found, suggesting unidirectional signaling from vasculature to sensory neuroblasts. Altogether, we demonstrate that the cranial vasculature constitutes a niche component of the sensory ganglia that regulates the pace of their growth and differentiation dynamics.","Taberner, Laura; Bañón, Aitor; Alsina, Berta",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668260/,167

OBJECTIVES To examine the effects of kinesiology taping on fibularis longus latency time and postural sway in healthy subjects. METHODS Thirty participants were equally randomized into three groups, two experimental groups receiving kinesiology tape (EG1, from origin to insertion; EG2, from insertion to origin) and a control group. Before and 20-min after the intervention, postural sway was assessed on a force platform and fibularis longus latency time was recorded with surface electromyography during a sudden inversion perturbation. RESULTS At baseline, no differences were found between groups regarding age, anthropometrics variables, postural sway and fibularis longus latency time. In both experimental groups, the application of tape did not change postural sway and fibularis longus latency time (EG1: 93.7 ± 15.0 to 89.9 ± 15.6 ms; EG2, 81.24 ± 14.21 to 81.57 ± 16.64, p < 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS An online survey was sent to women whose ART cycles were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak between April and May 2020. The study population were 101 participants. The main outcome measure is to determine the levels of fear and anxiety in infertile women by using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T and STAI-S) and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S). The relationship of the COVID-19 outbreak with the willingness to go ahead with the desire for pregnancy was also assessed. RESULTS The state-anxiety levels were significantly higher in women above 35 years (45.0 ± 5.2 vs. 42.2 ± 4.5, p = 0.006). Women with diminished ovarian reserve had a higher state-anxiety compared to other causes, but were not found to be significant (44.7 ± 5.2 vs. 42.5 ± 5.0, p = 0.173). Women who thought that the possibility of not being able to get pregnant was more important than being infected with the COVID-19 had higher anxiety levels than women who thought just the opposite. The diminished ovarian reserve and high duration of infertility were found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (OR = 2.5, p < 0.05). The diminished ovarian reserve and previous ART failure significantly predicted the presence of clinical state-anxiety. CONCLUSION The state-anxiety was found to be higher in women whose cycles were postponed due to the outbreak and the presence of diminished ovarian reserve also significantly affected anxiety levels. Further research is needed to assess whether COVID-19 will have any impact on ART treatments in the next few years.","Tokgoz, Vehbi Yavuz; Kaya, Yeliz; Tekin, Ahmet Basar",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482x.2020.1806819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812477/,167

The lockdown measures during the epidemic may have an impact on the presentation of diabetes and may disturb metabolic control. OBJECTIVES In order to address the hypothesis that the COVID-19 lockdown affected the incidence rate (IR) of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the pediatric population of Lower Silesia and the patients' clinical status, the incidence of T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic was analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS Incidence estimates were obtained from the T1D pediatric registry for Lower Silesia which has been maintained since January 1, 2000. The observation was completed on April 30, 2020. RESULTS A total of 1961 cases were diagnosed (1054 boys, 53.72%). An increase in the T1D IR was observed, from 10.43/100,000/year in 2000 to 22.06/100,000/year in 2019. The seasonality of T1D incidence was also observed, with the highest IR appearing in January and February. There were half as many cases of T1D in March and April 2020 as in the same months in 2019 (p > 0.05). Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurred in 31.75% of patients in years 2000-2019, comparably (p > 0.05) to 2020 (36.67% patients), including March and April (50% of patients). The duration of hyperglycemia symptoms was 20.2 ±25.4 days, which was comparable to 2020 (13.1 ±10.96 days; p = 0.1675) and March and April of 2020 (9.67 ±5.63 days; p = 0.0831).

Participants were engaged in seven categories of internet usage: communication with friends/family, social media, information collection about health/medicine, searching for medical facilities, purchase of drugs and vitamins, shopping, and banking. We found that internet use for communication had a protective influence on the probability of developing clinical depression defined as the Geriatric Depression Scale scores ≥5 or self-reported diagnosed depression. Our findings support the role of online communication with friends/family in preventing clinical depression among older people. Online communication could be particularly useful in the COVID-19 crisis because many families are geographically dispersed and/or socially distanced.","Nakagomi, Atsushi; Shiba, Koichiro; Kondo, Katsunori; Kawachi, Ichiro",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464820982147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356760/,167

Characterizations of Pae loaded GL micelles including particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL), morphology, and drug release in vitro were carried out. The single-pass intestinal perfusion and pharmacokinetic studies of Pae loaded GL micelles were also evaluated in rats and compared with Pae solution and the mixed solution of Pae and GL. RESULTS The optimized Pae loaded GL micelles had EE of (42.21 ± 0.89)%, particle size of (58.89 ± 4.24) nm with PDI of (0.194 ± 0.010), zeta potential of (-24.40 ± 1.90) mV. Pae loaded GL micelles showed a nearly spherical shape under TEM. Drug release of micelles demonstrated a delayed drug release compared to Pae solution. The single-pass intestinal perfusion study showed a significantly higher permeability of Pae in duodenum (P < 0.05), jejunum (P < 0.05), ileum (P < 0.01) and colon (P < 0.01) intestine after perfusion of Pae loaded GL micelles as compared to Pae solution. The in vivo pharmacokinetics demonstrated that the Cmax and AUC0-t values of Pae loaded GL micelles were approximately 2.18- and 3.64-fold superior than the Pae solution. CONCLUSION These results suggested GL could be a potential carrier for the oral delivery of Pae.","Shen, Chengying; Shen, Baode; Zhu, Junjun; Wang, Jing; Yuan, Hailong; Li, Xiaofang",Drug development and industrial pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1080/03639045.2020.1862178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305640/,167

However, there are primary nonresponders (PNR) of TNF-α inhibitors without clinical response during the induction period. In addition, there are partial responders (PR), who show some efficacy, but clinical remission is not achieved by induction therapy. To date, the definition and clinical management of PNR and PR have not been established. This report summarizes the opinions of 36 Japanese experts attending the Japan Round Table Discussion on IBD Meeting regarding how to determine PNR and PR of TNF-α inhibitors and how to manage these patients in clinical practice. PNR, who do not show any initial improvement of clinical symptoms and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, require re-assessment of intestinal complications. PR can be determined either by clinical symptoms, serum CRP levels, or imaging results. PR need intensification of the treatment with TNF-α inhibitors either with or without optimization of immunomodulators. Optimization of initial TNF-α inhibitor therapy may improve long-term outcomes, but more evidence is required to improve the use of TNF-α inhibitors for the prevention and management of PNR and PR.","Iijima, Hideki; Kobayashi, Taku; Nagasaka, Mitsuo; Shinzaki, Shinichiro; Kitamura, Kazuya; Suzuki, Yasuo; Watanabe, Mamoru; Hibi, Toshifumi",Inflammatory intestinal diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000506337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596258/,167

121278,Outpatient Treatment Option for Patients With Blood Cancer.,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are treatment options for aortic stenosis in patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We assessed the major clinical outcomes of such patients enrolled in the CoreValve High Risk (CHR) study. METHODS Of the 795 CHR study patients, 226 had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery; 115 underwent TAVR and 111 underwent SAVR. The primary endpoint was a comparison of all-cause mortality at 1 year. Important secondary clinical endpoints were assessed. RESULTS At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 9.6% for TAVR versus 18.1% for SAVR (p = 0.06); cardiovascular mortality was 7.0% for TAVR versus 13.8% for SAVR (p = 0.09). A combination of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score greater than 7 and age greater than 80 years was a significant predictor of mortality, with TAVR demonstrating a survival advantage (p = 0.03). No differences were seen for stroke. The SAVR group had longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, increased incidence of acute kidney injury, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (p < 0.05). Pacemaker implantation and paravalvular regurgitation were greater with TAVR at all timepoints. CONCLUSIONS For patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery and aortic stenosis, TAVR offers a significant morbidity advantage and a strong trend toward improved survival over SAVR at 1 year.","Conte, John V; Gleason, Thomas G; Resar, Jon R; Adams, David H; Deeb, G Michael; Popma, Jeffrey J; Hughes, G Chad; Zorn, George L; Reardon, Michael J",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.06.067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26433523/,167
121696,A sobering addition to the literature on COVID-19 and the brain.,2021-03-16,"Morbidity and mortality conferences (MMCs) are a long-held legacy institution in academic medicine that enable medical providers and hospital administrators to learn from systemic and individual errors, thereby leading to improved medical care. Originally this forum had 1 major role-education. The MMC evolved and a second key role was added: quality improvement. In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, a second evolution-one that will humanize the MMC-is required. The pandemic emphasizes the need to use MMCs not only as a place to discuss errors but also as a place for medical providers to reflect on lives lost. The authors' review of the literature regarding MMCs indicates that most studies focus on enabling MMCs to become a forum for quality improvement, while none have emphasized the need to humanize MMCs to decrease medical provider burnout and improve patient satisfaction. Permitting clinicians to be human on the job requires restructuring the MMC to provide a space for reflection and, ultimately, defining a new purpose and charge for the MMC. The authors have 3 main recommendations. First, principles of humanism such as compassion, empathy, and respect, in particular, should be incorporated into traditional MMCs. Second, shorter gatherings devoted to giving clinicians the opportunity to focus on their humanity could be arranged. Third, an MMC focused entirely on the human aspects of medical care could be periodically arranged to provide an outlet for storytelling, artistic expression, and reflection. Humanizing the MMC-a core symposium in clinical medicine worldwide-could be the first step in revitalizing the spirit at the heart of medicine, one dedicated to health and healing. This spirit, which has been eroding as the field of medicine becomes increasingly corporate in structure and mission, is as essential during peaceful times in health care as during a pandemic.","Pang, Sharon; Warraich, Haider J",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369900/,167
121854,Lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19.,2020-04-09,"BACKGROUND Despite lacking scientific support, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. While serious vaccine damage as a scientific fact is real yet statistically highly uncommon, emerging social and technological forces have amplified perceptions of risk for ""probable vaccine damage"", making it a widely shared intersubjective reality. METHODS Using the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March 2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through exploratory cluster analysis. RESULTS The public beliefs in significant vaccine risks are frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider that vaccines are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe that vaccines can overload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease against which they protect, and almost one-half believe that vaccines can cause serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: hesitant, confident, and trade-off clusters. The hesitant type (approx. 11% of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the perception that vaccines are rather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59%) is defined by beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the trade-off type (approx. 29%) combines beliefs that vaccines are effective, well-tested and useful, with perceptions of probable vaccine damage. The vaccine-confident and the trade-off types have similar vaccination histories, indicating the significant role of other factors besides beliefs in inducing behavior. CONCLUSIONS The high proportion of varying public beliefs in significant vaccine risks and the presence of a trade-off type of vaccination assessment indicate the social normality of beliefs in probable vaccine damage. Communication campaigns should take into account the social normality of the perceived risk of ""probable vaccine damage"" across various social types, and patterns of concomitant trust and mistrust in vaccination.","Vulpe, Simona-Nicoleta; Rughiniş, Cosima",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.01.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573865/,167

Unfortunately, sIgA remains challenging to produce in large quantities, and easily aggregates, which prevented their use in clinical applications. To develop sIgA-like tetravalent antibodies that are stable and can be easily produced in large quantities, we designed two IgGs possessing 4 identical Fab domains, with the Fabs arranged either in serial or in the diametrically opposite orientation. As a proof-of-concept, we engineered these tetravalent IgG constructs to bind a ubiquitous sperm antigen using a Fab previously isolated from an immune infertile woman. Both constructs possess at least 4-fold greater agglutination potency and induced much more rapid sperm agglutination than the parent IgG, while exhibiting comparable production yields and identical thermostability as the parent IgG. These tetravalent IgGs offer promise for non-hormonal contraception and underscores the multimerization of IgG as a promising strategy to enhance antibody effector functions based on immune exclusion.","Shrestha, Bhawana; Schaefer, Alison; Chavez, Elizabeth C; Kopp, Alexander J; Jacobs, Timothy M; Moench, Thomas R; Lai, Samuel K",Acta biomaterialia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2020.09.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937206/,167

METHODS We identified Decipher tests ordered after radical prostatectomy for adverse pathology in men treated for prostate cancer between 1/1/14 and 8/31/18. Biochemical recurrence was defined as prostate-specific antigen > 0.02 ng/mL. Decipher score is reported as lower risk (< 0.6) and higher risk ≥ 0.60). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine the relationship between Decipher score and time to biochemical recurrence (months). Cox regression was used to analyze the relationship between Decipher score and time to biochemical recurrence while controlling for a number of clinical characteristics. Secondary analyses focused on a subset of men with prostate-specific antigen > 0.02 and < 0.20 ng/mL to determine if high-risk Decipher scores were associated with receipt of salvage treatment. RESULTS A total of 203 cases were analyzed: 37.9% and 62.1% had lower and higher risk Decipher scores respectively, and 56.2% had a biochemical recurrence. Median (inter-quartile range) follow-up was 20 (13.5, 25.3) months. Decipher score was significantly associated with time to biochemical recurrence (p = 0.027) while in the secondary analyses, high-risk Decipher scores (≥ 0.60) were associated with salvage treatment (p = 0.018). Stage category and Decipher score were significant predictors of time from elevated PSA to salvage treatment in the secondary analyses. CONCLUSION While it might not contribute statistically, Decipher score can be clinically useful in helping patients reach treatment decisions.","White, Christine; Staff, Ilene; McLaughlin, Tara; Tortora, Joseph; Pinto, Kevin; Gangakhedkar, Akshay; Champagne, Alison; Wagner, Joseph",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-021-03661-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743058/,167

The aim of this study was to illustrate an innovative technique of irrigation and passive drainage to reduce clinically relevant POPF (CR-POPF) incidence in high-risk patients undergoing DP. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve consecutive high-risk patients received irrigation and passive drainage of the pancreatic stump with a Salem sump drainage after DP. The Salem sump was irrigated with 100 ml/h of Ringer solution for 2 postoperative days (POD). In the case of low-drain amylase and lipase levels on POD 3, the irrigation was reduced to 50 ml/h. Persistence of low-drain pancreatic enzymes on POD 4 allowed for interruption of irrigation and subsequent removal of drainage from POD 7 onward in the absence of evidence of any pancreatic fistula. RESULTS Overall, 16.6% of the patients experienced a grade 3 or higher surgical complication. We experienced only one case of POPF: the fistula was classified as grade B and it was managed with radiologic drainage of the fluid collection. We did not experience any case of re-operation nor in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS Irrigation with passive drainage of the pancreatic stump after DP is an interesting approach for CR-POPF prevention in high-risk patients.","Adamenko, Olga; Ferrari, Carlo; Schmidt, Jan",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-02012-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084924/,167

124083,Diagnosing and managing postherpetic neuralgia.,2012,"BACKGROUND Surgical site infections (SSIs) cause morbidity after elective colorectal surgery, and antibiotic prophylaxis can decrease SSIs. The aim of this study was to determine compliance with an antibiotic administration protocol, including regimen, initial dose timing, and re-dosing, and determine the risk of SSI associated with each. We hypothesized that appropriate antibiotic administration reduces the risk of SSI. METHODS Retrospective review from a prospective database of a random sample of patients undergoing elective abdominal colorectal procedures with anastomosis. Antibiotic regimens, initial dose timing (IDT), and re-dosing were evaluated. Appropriate regimens covered gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. The IDT was considered proper if completed within 30 min prior to incision; re-dosing parameters were determined pharmacokinetically for each agent. The main outcome was SSI. Sequential logistic models were generated: Model 1 assessed antibiotic administration factors, whereas Model 2 controlled for patient and clinical factors, including disease process, patient characteristics, intra-operative factors, and post-operative factors. RESULTS Six hundred five patients (mean age 59.7 [standard deviation 17.8] years, 42.8% male) were included. The most common diagnoses were cancer (38.8%) and inflammatory bowel disease (22.0%). Seventy-six patients (12.6%) had superficial or deep incisional SSI, and 54 (8.9%) had organ/space SSI. Regimens included cefazolin + metronidazole for 219 patients (36.2%), cefoxitin for 214 (35.4%), and levofloxacin + metronidazole for 48 (7.9%). One hundred fourteen patients (18.8%) received other/nonstandard regimens, and ten had no documented antibiotic prophylaxis. Fifty-five patients (9.1%) received insufficient coverage, whereas 361 patients (59.7%) had proper IDT, and 401 regimens (66.3%) were re-dosed properly. In Model 1, the use of other/nonstandard regimens (odds ratio [OR] 2.069; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.078-1.868) and early administration of the initial prophylaxis dose (OR 1.725; 95% CI 1.147-2.596) were associated with greater odds of SSI. After adding clinical factors in Model 2, both of these factors remained significant (OR 2.505; 95% CI 1.066-5.886 and OR 1.733; 95% CI 1.017-2.954, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Appropriate antibiotic selection and timing of administration for prophylaxis are crucial to reduce the likelihood of SSI after elective colorectal surgery with intestinal anastomosis.","Ho, Vanessa P; Barie, Philip S; Stein, Sharon L; Trencheva, Koiana; Milsom, Jeffrey W; Lee, Sang W; Sonoda, Toyooki",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2010.073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21790479/,167

This review addresses gaps in the literature regarding posttracheostomy care, emphasizing safety of multidisciplinary teams, coordinating complex care needs, and identifying and managing late complications of prolonged intubation and tracheostomy. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, institutional guidance documents. REVIEW METHODS Literature through June 2020 on the care of patients with a tracheostomy was reviewed, including consensus statements, clinical practice guidelines, institutional guidance, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 virology and immunology. Where data were lacking, expert opinions were aggregated and adjudicated to arrive at consensus recommendations. CONCLUSIONS Best practices in caring for patients after a tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are multifaceted, encompassing precautions during aerosol-generating procedures; minimizing exposure risks to health care workers, caregivers, and patients; ensuring safe, timely tracheostomy care; and identifying and managing laryngotracheal injury, such as vocal fold injury, posterior glottic stenosis, and subglottic stenosis that may affect speech, swallowing, and airway protection. We present recommended approaches to tracheostomy care, outlining modifications to conventional algorithms, raising vigilance for heightened risks of bleeding or other complications, and offering recommendations for personal protective equipment, equipment, care protocols, and personnel. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Treatment of patients with a tracheostomy in the COVID-19 pandemic requires foresight and may rival procedural considerations in tracheostomy in their complexity. By considering patient-specific factors, mitigating transmission risks, optimizing the clinical environment, and detecting late manifestations of severe COVID-19, clinicians can ensure due vigilance and quality care.","Meister, Kara D; Pandian, Vinciya; Hillel, Alexander T; Walsh, Brian K; Brodsky, Martin B; Balakrishnan, Karthik; Best, Simon R; Chinn, Steven B; Cramer, John D; Graboyes, Evan M; McGrath, Brendan A; Rassekh, Christopher H; Bedwell, Joshua R; Brenner, Michael J",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820961990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960148/,167

Although this likely represents a greater demand on the hip abductor muscles implicated in GT, no study has investigated activation of these muscles in GT. For this purpose, fine wire electrodes were inserted into the segments of the gluteus minimus and medius muscles, and surface electrodes placed on the tensor fascia lata, upper gluteus maximus, and vastus lateralis muscles of eight individuals with, and eight without, GT. Participants underwent six walking trials. Individual muscle patterns were compared between groups using a wavelet-based linear effects model and muscle synergy analysis performed using non-negative matrix factorization to evaluate muscle activation patterns, within- and between-participant variability. Compared to controls, individuals with GT exhibited a more sustained initial burst of the posterior gluteus minimus and middle gluteus medius muscle segments. Two muscle synergies were identified; Synergy-1 activated in early-mid stance and Synergy-2 in early stance. In GT participants, posterior gluteus minimus and posterior gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata contributed more to Synergy-1 active during the period of single leg support. Participants with GT exhibited reduced within-participant variability of posterior gluteus medius and reduced between-participant variability of anterior gluteus minimus and medius and upper gluteus maximus. In conclusion, individuals with GT exhibit modified muscle activation patterns of the hip abductor muscles during walking, with potential relevance for gluteal tendon loading.","Allison, K; Salomoni, S E; Bennell, K L; Wrigley, T V; Hug, F; Vicenzino, B; Grimaldi, A; Hodges, P W",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.12942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675778/,167

125702,Characteristics and Motivating Factors of Attendees of a Regional Student-Run Wilderness Medicine Conference.,2019-12-01,"OBJECTIVE The clinical significance of increased serum pancreatic enzymes (PEs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has not yet been fully understood. We aimed to investigate the frequency and the impact on clinical outcome of PE elevation and acute pancreatitis in such patients. METHODS Clinical data, laboratory tests, and cross-sectional images were analyzed from COVID-19 patients admitted to the Tor Vergata Hospital in Rome. Variables associated with PE abnormalities, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS Pancreatic enzymes were available in 254 of 282 COVID-19 patients. Among these, 66 patients (26%) showed mild elevation of PE, and 11 patients (4.3%) had severe elevation (>3 times of the upper limit of normal). Overall, 2 patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Hepatic and renal involvements were associated with PE elevation. Multivariate analysis showed that mild and severe PE elevations were significantly associated with ICU admission (odds ratios, 5.51 [95% confidence interval, 2.36-12.89; P < 0.0001] and 26.2 [95% confidence interval, 4.82-142.39; P < 0.0001]). CONCLUSIONS Increase in serum PE, but not acute pancreatitis, is frequent in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and associates with ICU admission.","Troncone, Edoardo; Salvatori, Silvia; Sena, Giorgia; De Cristofaro, Elena; Alfieri, Norma; Marafini, Irene; Paganelli, Carla; Argirò, Renato; Giannarelli, Diana; Monteleone, Giovanni; Del Vecchio Blanco, Giovanna",Pancreas,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpa.0000000000001770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835971/,167

This intrinsic immunity plays an important role in controlling viral replication and imposes a barrier to viral cross-species transmission. Well-studied examples of such host restriction factors are TRIM5α, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds incoming retroviral capsids in the cytoplasm via its C-terminal PRY/SPRY (B30.2) domain and targets them for proteasomal degradation, and APOBEC3 proteins, cytidine deaminases that induce hypermutation and impair viral reverse transcription. Tetherin (BST-2, CD317) is an interferon-inducible transmembrane protein that potently inhibits the release of nascent retrovirus particles in single-cycle replication assays. However, whether the primary biological activity of tetherin in vivo is that of a restriction factor remains uncertain as recent studies on human tetherin suggest that it is unable to prevent spreading infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The feline tetherin homologue resembles human tetherin in amino acid sequence, protein topology and anti-viral activity. Transiently expressed feline tetherin displays potent inhibition of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and HIV-1 particle release. However, stable ectopic expression of feline tetherin in a range of feline cell lines has no inhibitory effect on the growth of either primary or cell culture-adapted strains of FIV. By comparing and contrasting the activities of the felid and primate tetherins against their respective immunodeficiency-causing lentiviruses we may gain insight into the contribution of tetherins to the control of lentiviral replication and the evolution of lentiviral virulence.","Dietrich, Isabelle; Hosie, Margaret J; Willett, Brian J",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21715020/,167

This study evaluated the usefulness of wireless stethoscopes during dental procedures requiring intravenous sedation (IVS). MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was a prospective cohort study. The study sample consisted of dental patients who received IVS by propofol or midazolam administration at the Nippon Dental University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). The predictor was respiratory rate measured using the wireless stethoscope (BrRR), and the outcome variable was respiratory rate measured during capnography (RR). Pearson correlation coefficients and paired-samples t tests were used for data analysis. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The study sample consisted of 12 patients. BrRR and RR were significantly and positively correlated (r = 0.93, P < .01). The mean ± standard deviation of BrRR was 14.16 ± 2.67 and that of RR was 14.32 ± 2.77. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .27). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that wireless stethoscopes are suitable for monitoring respiratory rate during dental procedures requiring IVS because their use is as accurate as capnography.","Morimoto, Keiko; Tsutsui, Yukako; Ogura, Shin; Sunda, Katsuhisa",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2017.08.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916326/,167

Placing hemodialysis catheters is a particular challenge in patients with extreme obesity. Here we describe the merging of two technologies to place catheters in patients who are too heavy (over 225 kg) to be placed safely on a procedure table for fluoroscopic guidance. The first technology is ECG-guided placement of catheters, well established for guidance of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and tunneled and nontunneled central venous catheters. The second is reverse-tunneling dialysis catheters, which allow precise placement of the tip of the catheter before creating the tunnel. We successfully placed catheters in three morbidly obese patients with acute kidney injury and followed them until their kidneys recovered and the catheters were removed. The catheters were placed in the patient's bed in a procedure room with subsequent confirmatory chest radiographs. Catheter performance based on blood flow rates was excellent and there were no complications. We suggest placement of ECG-guided tunneled hemodialysis catheters using a reversed-tunneling technique in those patients with extreme obesity who are too heavy to place on a fluoroscopy procedure table.","Bream, Peter R; Gu, Everett",Kidney international,https://doi.org/10.1038/ki.2015.191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26154923/,167
126664,RAAS Inhibitors and Risk of Covid-19.,2020-10-27,"Persistent infection of domestic cats with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) can lead to a highly lethal, immunopathological disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Interestingly, there are two serotypes, type I and type II FCoVs, that can cause both persistent infection and FIP, even though their main determinant of host cell tropism, the spike (S) protein, is of different phylogeny and displays limited sequence identity. In cell culture, however, there are apparent differences. Type II FCoVs can be propagated to high titers by employing feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a cellular receptor, whereas the propagation of type I FCoVs is usually difficult, and the involvement of fAPN as a receptor is controversial. In this study we have analyzed the phenotypes of recombinant FCoVs that are based on the genetic background of type I FCoV strain Black but encode the type II FCoV strain 79-1146 S protein. Our data demonstrate that recombinant FCoVs expressing a type II FCoV S protein acquire the ability to efficiently use fAPN for host cell entry and corroborate the notion that type I FCoVs use another main host cell receptor. We also observed that recombinant FCoVs display a large-plaque phenotype and, unexpectedly, accelerated growth kinetics indistinguishable from that of type II FCoV strain 79-1146. Thus, the main phenotypic differences for type I and type II FCoVs in cell culture, namely, the growth kinetics and the efficient usage of fAPN as a cellular receptor, can be attributed solely to the FCoV S protein.","Tekes, Gergely; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Bank-Wolf, Barbara; Maier, Reinhard; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen; Thiel, Volker",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01568-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19906918/,167

Although this technique is usually performed to sedated patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, it has been used in non-intubated patients frequently during the coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Favorable outcomes have been reported mainly in combining the prone positioning with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Due to limited data, a standard approach for the awake prone positioning has not yet been defined. In this manuscript, we reviewed the literature data about prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19. According to available literature data, we concluded that prone positioning in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve oxygenation and prevent the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. But the efficacy is still controversial in the early stage of the disease due to pulmonary mechanics. Further studies are needed to the defined optimal approach of awake prone positioning in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Gürün Kaya, Aslıhan; Öz, Miraç; Erol, Serhat; Çiftçi, Fatma; Çiledağ, Aydın; Kaya, Akın",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,https://doi.org/10.5578/tt.70164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33295732/,167
128830,Varicose veins.,2015,"In the arms race between plants and viruses, two frontiers have been utilized for decades to combat viral infections in agriculture. First, many pathogenic viruses are excluded from plant meristems, which allows the regeneration of virus-free plant material by tissue culture. Second, vertical transmission of viruses to the host progeny is often inefficient, thereby reducing the danger of viral transmission through seeds. Numerous reports point to the existence of tightly linked meristematic and transgenerational antiviral barriers that remain poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that exclude viruses from plant stem cells and progeny. We also discuss the evidence connecting viral invasion of meristematic cells and the ability of plants to recover from acute infections. Research spanning decades and performed on a variety of virus/host combinations has made clear that, beside morphological barriers, RNA interference (RNAi) plays a crucial role in preventing - or allowing - meristem invasion and vertical transmission. How a virus interacts with plant RNAi pathways in the meristem has profound effects on its symptomatology, persistence, replication rates, and, ultimately, entry into the host progeny.","Bradamante, Gabriele; Mittelsten Scheid, Ortrun; Incarbone, Marco",The Plant cell,https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koab140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015140/,167

Gordon's syndrome is a form of secondary hypertension that can arise due to a number of possible mutations in key genes that encode proteins in a pathway containing the With No Lysine [K] (WNK) and its downstream target kinases, SPS/Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress responsive kinase 1 (OSR1). This pathway regulates the activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC), which is responsible for NaCl reabsorption in the distal nephron. Therefore, mutations in genes encoding proteins that regulate the NCC proteins disrupt ion homeostasis and cause hypertension by increasing NaCl reabsorption. Thiazide diuretics are currently the main treatment option for Gordon's syndrome. However, they have a number of side effects, and chronic usage can lead to compensatory adaptations in the nephron that counteract their action. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing novel inhibitory molecules that inhibit components of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway, thereby reducing NaCl reabsorption and restoring normal blood pressure. In this review we provide an overview of the currently reported molecular inhibitors of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway and discuss their potential as treatment options for Gordon's syndrome.","Brown, Archie; Meor Azlan, Nur Farah; Wu, Zhijuan; Zhang, Jinwei",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-0474-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724175/,167

METHODS Ten, ASA I, adult patients, received a bolus dose of rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg during propofol based anesthesia. Train-of-four (TOF) was simultaneously monitored at the masseter and the adductor pollicis muscles until recovery. Rocuronium arterial serum concentrations were measured during 120 min. The first twitch of the TOF response was used to characterize the time-effect profile of both muscles using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis in NONMEM. A decrease in NONMEM objective function (∆OFV) of 3.84 points for an added parameter was considered significant at the 0.05 level. RESULTS Onset time at the masseter (mean ± SD, 1.5 ± 0.9 min) was faster than at the adductor pollicis (2.7 ± 1.4 min, P < 0.05). Recovery, measured as the time to TOF ratio = 0.9 was similar between muscles 29.9 ± 6.7 (adductor pollicis) vs. 29.3 ± 8.1 (masseter). (P = 0.77). The estimated pharmacodynamic parameters [mean (95% CI)] of the adductor pollicis muscle and the masseter muscle were; plasma effect-site equilibration half-time (teq) 3.25 (2.34, 3.69) min vs. 2.86 (1.83, 3.29) min, (∆OFV 383.665); Ce50 of 1.24 (1.13, 1.56) mg/l vs. 1.19 (1.00, 1.21) mg/l, (∆OFV 184.284); Hill coefficient of 3.97 (3.82, 5.62) vs. 4.68 (3.83, 5.71), (∆OFV 78.906). CONCLUSIONS We found that the masseter muscle has faster onset of blockade and similar recovery profile than adductor pollicis muscle.

130150,COVID-19 Vaccines: Preparing for Vaccination in the Context of Clinical Oncology Care.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND With the increase in cannabis use rates, cannabis use disorder is being reported as one of the most common drug use disorders globally. Cannabis use has several known physical, psychological, and social adverse events, such as altered judgement, poor educational outcomes, and respiratory symptoms. The propensity for taking cannabis and the development of a cannabis use disorder may be genetically influenced for some individuals. Heritability estimates suggest a genetic basis for cannabis use, and several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified possible regions of association, albeit with inconsistent findings. This systematic review aims to summarize the findings from GWASs investigating cannabis use and cannabis use disorder. METHODS This systematic review incorporates articles that have performed a GWAS investigating cannabis use or cannabis use disorder. MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, GWAS Catalog, GWAS Central, and NIH Database of Genotype and Phenotype were searched using a comprehensive search strategy. All studies were screened in duplicate, and the quality of evidence was assessed using the quality of genetic association studies (Q-Genie) tool. All studies underwent qualitative synthesis; however, quantitative analysis was not feasible. RESULTS Our search identified 5984 articles. Six studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in this review. All six studies reported results that met our significance threshold of p ≤ 1.0 × 10-7. In total 96 genetic variants were identified. While meta-analysis was not possible, this review identified the following genes, ANKFN1, INTS7, PI4K2B, CSMD1, CST7, ACSS1, and SCN9A, to be associated with cannabis use. These regions were previously reported in different mental health conditions, however not in relation to cannabis use. CONCLUSION This systematic review summarized GWAS findings within the field of cannabis research.

Methods Three instruments underwent a robust process of construct and reliability analysis. Inter- and intra-observer reliability was tested for the observational instrument using Cohen's k-agreement measure. Reliability values above 0.85 were considered as a good agreement between and within observers. To verify the internal consistency of the questionnaires, the correlation coefficients were considered. Results The results related to intra-observer and inter-observer reliability showed that intra-observer reliability k-agreement values ranged between 0.912 and 1 for observer 1, and 0.82 and 1 for observer 2. For inter-observer reliability, k-agreement values ranged between 0.885 and 1 between observers. Thus, values for reliability are above acceptable. The correlation coefficient values recorded for the questionnaires on instruction expectations in the competitive moment were above 0.82 and significant (p < 0.05), and for the questionnaire on instruction perception in competition above 0.88 and significant (p < 0.05). The pilot study showed some divergent results across expectations, behavior during competition, and perception about the instruction behavior. Conclusion The observational system and the expectations and perceptions questionnaires, used in a complementary way, can be considered as a mix-method approach for studies aiming to examine coaches' competitive behavior.","Rodrigues, José; Rodrigues, Filipe; Resende, Rui; Espada, Mário; Santos, Fernando",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.705557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326802/,167

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Studies directly comparing the minimally invasive surgical (arthroscopy or miniarthrotomy) and non-surgical treatment of ACL rupture with at least 10 years of follow-up in adult patients were included. RESULTS Five studies met the eligibility criteria. A meta-analysis revealed a higher risk of radiographic knee OA and a lower risk of secondary meniscal surgery for patients in the surgical group. The risk of graft rupture/secondary ACL revision and secondary ACL reconstruction was equal in the surgical and non-surgical groups. Knee laxity was lower among patients in the surgical group in four studies. No difference was found in the PROMs (ie, International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome, and Lysholm scores). CONCLUSION The risk of radiographic knee OA was higher, but the risk of secondary meniscal injury was lower 10 years after surgical treatment of ACL rupture. The risk of graft rupture/secondary ACL revision or secondary reconstruction was unrelated to treatment type. The degree of knee laxity was reduced after surgical treatment in comparison with non-surgical treatment, while PROMs were similar. However, due to the methodological challenges highlighted in this systematic review, these findings must be interpreted with caution.

Previous health economic analysis found MRgFUS thalamotomy to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with essential tremor, supporting its reimbursement. With the publication of level I evidence in support of MRgFUS thalamotomy for patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD), the authors performed a health economic comparison between MRgFUS, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and medical therapy. METHODS The authors used a decision tree model with rollback analysis and one-factor sensitivity analysis. Literature searches of MRgFUS thalamotomy and unilateral DBS of the ventrointermediate nucleus of the thalamus for TDPD were performed to determine the utility and probabilities for the model. Costs in Canadian dollars (CAD) were derived from the Schedule of Benefits and Fees in Ontario, Canada, and expert opinion on usage. RESULTS MRgFUS was associated with an expected cost of $14,831 CAD. Adding MRgFUS to continued medical therapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,078 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which remained cost-effective under various scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. Comparing DBS to MRgFUS, while DBS did not achieve the willingness-to-pay threshold ($56,503 per QALY) in the base case scenario, it did so under several scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS MRgFUS thalamotomy is a cost-effective treatment for patients with TDPD, particularly over continued medical therapy. While MRgFUS remains competitive with DBS, the cost-effectiveness advantage is less substantial. These results will help inform the integration of this technology in the healthcare system.","Meng, Ying; Pople, Christopher B; Kalia, Suneil K; Kalia, Lorraine V; Davidson, Benjamin; Bigioni, Luca; Li, Daniel Zhengze; Suppiah, Suganth; Mithani, Karim; Scantlebury, Nadia; Schwartz, Michael L; Hamani, Clement; Lipsman, Nir",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.5.jns20692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764177/,167
131111,Pediatric Forearm Fractures are Effectively Immobilized With a Sugar-Tong Splint Following Closed Reduction.,2018,": The Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center includes programs across the care continuum for people with substance use disorders (SUDs), serving both inpatients and outpatients. These programs had to innovate quickly during the COVID-19 outbreak to maintain access to care. Federal and state regulatory flexibility allowed these programs to initiate treatment for people experiencing homelessness and maximize patient safety through physical distancing practices. Programs switched to telehealth with high levels of acceptability and patient retention. Some programs also maintained some face-to-face clinic visits to see patients with complex problems and to provide injectable medications. Text-messaging proved invaluable with adolescent and young adult clients, and a mobile-health outreach program was initiated to reach mother/child dyads affected by SUDs. A 24-hour hotline was implemented to support seamless access to treatment for hundreds released from incarceration early due to the pandemic. Boston Medical Center also launched the COVID Recuperation Unit to allow patients experiencing homelessness to recover from mild to moderate COVID-19 infection in an environment that took a harm-reduction approach to SUDs and provided rapid initiation of medication treatment. Many of these innovations increased access to treatment and retention of patients during the pandemic. Maintaining the revised regulations would allow flexibility to provide telehealth, extended prescriptions, and remote access to buprenorphine initiation to support and engage more patients with SUDs.","Komaromy, Miriam; Tomanovich, Mary; Taylor, Jessica L; Ruiz-Mercado, Glorimar; Kimmel, Simeon D; Bagley, Sarah M; Saia, Kelley M; Costello, Eileen; Park, Tae Woo; LaBelle, Colleen; Weinstein, Zoe; Walley, Alexander Y",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298750/,167

We found that the catalytic subunit of the RdRp, nsp12, ligates two iron-sulfur metal cofactors in sites that were modeled as zinc centers in the available cryo-electron microscopy structures of the RdRp complex. These metal binding sites are essential for replication and for interaction with the viral helicase. Oxidation of the clusters by the stable nitroxide TEMPOL caused their disassembly, potently inhibited the RdRp, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. These iron-sulfur clusters thus serve as cofactors for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and are targets for therapy of COVID-19.","Maio, Nunziata; Lafont, Bernard A P; Sil, Debangsu; Li, Yan; Bollinger, J Martin; Krebs, Carsten; Pierson, Theodore C; Linehan, W Marston; Rouault, Tracey A",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi5224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083449/,167

It has been debated whether harvesting signals from other brain areas that encode global cognitive variables, such as the allocation of attention and eye movement goals in a variety of spatial reference frames, may improve the outcome of iBCIs. Here, we explore the ability of LFP signals, sampled from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of macaque monkeys, to encode eye-movement intention during the pre-movement fixation period of a delayed saccade task. We use spectral dimensionality reduction to examine the spatiotemporal properties of the extracted non-rhythmic broadband activity and explore its usefulness in decoding saccade goals. The dynamics of the broadband signal in low spatial dimensions across the pre-movement fixation period uncovered saccade target separation; its discriminative potential was confirmed using support vector machine classifications. These findings reveal that broadband LFP from the LPFC can be used to decode intended saccade target location during pre-movement periods. We further provide a general workflow that can be implemented in iBCIs and it is relatively robust to the loss of spikes in individual electrodes.","Johnston, Renée; Doucet, Guillaume; Boulay, Chadwick; Miller, Kai; Martinez-Trujillo, Julio; Sachs, Adam",International journal of neural systems,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0129065721500234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931006/,167

A questionnaire was sent to all HCPs from whom nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were collected. The type of work, work environment, individual characteristics, and modality of infection were analyzed. Working areas were categorized into COVID-free areas (wards and ICUs for patients without COVID-19, medical offices, and hospitality counters) and COVID+ areas (dedicated wards and the ICU for patients with COVID-19). From March 1 to 20, 2020, 302 HCPs were tested: 251 (83.1%) responded to the questionnaire, but 9 were excluded since infection occurred outside the hospital. The remaining 242 subjects included 53 (21.9%) with positive NPS and 189 (78.1%) with negative NPS, significant differences in NPS results were evident depending on the subject's role (p = 0.028). Pairwise post hoc analysis revealed that surgeons had a significantly increased rate of positive NPS (p = 0.001). Of the 189 subjects with negative NPS, 175 (92.6%) worked in COVID-free areas, and 14 (7.4%) in COVID+ areas. Of the 53 subjects with positive NPS, 44 (83.1%) worked in COVID-free areas and 9 (16.9%) worked in COVID+ areas. Medical offices featuring an open space with adjacent desks were identified as areas of higher risk. An apparent cause of infection could not be identified in 21 (39.6%) subjects with positive NPS. Among a total of 251 subjects, 80 (41.5%) of the 193 subjects with negative NPS and 16 (27.6%) of the 58 subjects with positive NPS had been vaccinated against the common flu. In conclusion, the vast majority of subjects with positive NPS came from COVID-free areas. The source of infection could not be identified in a significant portion of subjects with positive NPS. Personnel need better protection, more testing with NPS needs to be performed, and workplace layouts need to be re-thought. Vaccination against the flu seems to provide some protection.","Torzilli, Guido; Famularo, Simone; Azzolini, Elena; Vespa, Edoardo; Lleo, Ana; Aghemo, Alessio; Lagioia, Michele; Castoro, Carlo",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330813/,167

These same warnings are reverberating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the impacts of EVD on maternal and child health services from facility data can be instructive during COVID-19. We surveyed all peripheral healthcare units (PHUs) in Sierra Leone in October 2014 and March 2015 to assess closures, staffing, amenities, medicines, supplies, and service utilization during May 2014-January 2015 and October 2013-January 2014. We report PHU characteristics and service utilization changes for equivalent 4-month periods during the epidemic and the prior year. We present utilization changes by district and service type, and model excess child mortality. PHU closures (-8%) and staff attrition (-3%) were limited, but many facilities lacked amenities, medicines, and supplies. Utilization of preventive and scheduled services fell more than individualized, clinical care interventions, aside from malaria treatment which declined significantly. Ebola virus disease intensity in districts was weakly associated with utilization, aside from two districts that were severely affected. Modeling suggests utilization declines resulted in 6,782 excess under-five deaths (an increase of 21%) between 2014 and 2015. Ebola virus disease negatively affected service provision, but utilization declined relatively more, particularly for preventive and scheduled interventions. Although these findings are specific to Sierra Leone's EVD epidemic, they illustrate the magnitude of possible effects in other settings due to COVID-19-induced service disruptions, where collateral impacts on child mortality from other preventable causes may far outweigh COVID-19 mortality.","Ngo, Thi Minh; Rogers, Braeden; Patnaik, Rajesh; Jambai, Amara; Sharkey, Alyssa B",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399047/,167

As part of Ambulance Victoria's response to the outbreak, relevant emergency response plans and pandemic plans were instigated, focused efforts were aimed at encouraging the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and additional questions were included in the call-taking script for telephone triage of emergency calls to identify potential cases of H1N1 from the point of call. As a result, paramedics were alerted to all potential cases of H1N1 influenza or any patient who met the current case definition before their arrival on the scene and were advised to use appropriate PPE. During the period of May 1 to July 2, Ambulance Victoria telephone triaged 1598 calls relating to H1N1 (1228 in metropolitan areas and 243 in rural areas) and managed 127 calls via a referral service that provides specific telephone triage for potential H1N1 influenza cases based on the national call-taking script. The referral service determines whether a patient requires an emergency ambulance or can be diverted to other resources such as flu clinics. Key lessons learned during the H1N1 outbreak include a focused need for continued education and communication regarding infection control and the appropriate use of PPE. Current guidelines regarding PPE use are adequate for use during an outbreak of infectious disease. Compliance with PPE needs to be addressed through the use of intra-agency communications and regular information updates early in the progress of the outbreak.","Smith, Erin C; Burkle, Frederick M; Holman, Paul F; Dunlop, Justin M; Archer, Frank L",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1097/dmp.0b013e3181be8250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952886/,167

Professional societies have recommended insulin therapy as the cornerstone of inpatient pharmacological management. Intravenous insulin therapy is the treatment of choice in the critical care setting. In non-intensive care settings, several insulin protocols have been proposed to manage patients with hyperglycaemia; however, meta-analyses comparing different treatment regimens have not clearly endorsed the benefits of any particular strategy. Clinical guidelines recommend stopping oral antidiabetes drugs during hospitalisation; however, in some countries continuation of oral antidiabetes drugs is commonplace in some patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to hospital, and findings from clinical trials have suggested that non-insulin drugs, alone or in combination with basal insulin, can be used to achieve appropriate glycaemic control in selected populations. Advances in diabetes technology are revolutionising day-to-day diabetes care and work is ongoing to implement these technologies (ie, continuous glucose monitoring, automated insulin delivery) for inpatient care. Additionally, transformations in care have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the use of remote inpatient diabetes management-research is needed to assess the effects of such adaptations.","Pasquel, Francisco J; Lansang, M Cecilia; Dhatariya, Ketan; Umpierrez, Guillermo E",The lancet.

This presents, however, a risk to the umbilicus vascularisation with possible umbilical necrosis. To minimize this risk we associated abdominoplasty with laparoscopic UH repair. The aim of this study was to present the technique of simultaneous abdominoplasty and UH repair and the first results. MATERIALS AND METHODS Simultaneous abdominoplasty and laparoscopic mesh UH repair was analysed in the first 10 cases. The intervention was performed by a plastic surgeon and a general surgeon. It begins as a standard abdominoplasty with flap elevation, umbilicus detachment and diastasis repair, if indicated. The second stage is the UH repair via laparoscopy using an intraperitoneal mesh. The third stage consists of umbilical transposition and closure of the abdominoplasty incision. RESULTS We had no complications at the umbilicus or the hernia mesh. In all cases, umbilical vascularisation was preserved and no hernia recurrence was noted. CONCLUSIONS Our first results suggest that the simultaneous UH repair with abdominoplasty is safe, minimizing the risk to the umbilicus blood supply. These first results encourage us to recommend this approach and perform a more detailed analysis of the whole series since our first case.","Shipkov, Hristo D; Mojallal, Ali; Braye, Fabienne",Folia medica,https://doi.org/10.1515/folmed-2017-0026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704183/,167

The extent of this phenomenon and its mechanisms are unclear.Methods and Results:This study prospectively included 50 consecutive STEMI patients admitted to our center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the peak of the Italian COVID-19 outbreak. At admission, a COVID-19 test was positive in 24 patients (48%), negative in 26 (52%). The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Upon admission, COVID-19 subjects had lower PO2/FiO2 (169 [100-425] vs. 390 [302-477], P<0.01), more need for oxygen support (62.5% vs. 26.9%, P=0.02) and a higher rate of myocardial dysfunction (ejection fraction <30% in 45.8% vs. 19.2%, P=0.04). All patients underwent emergency angiography. In 12.5% of COVID-19 patients, no culprit lesions were detected, thus PCI was performed in 87.5% and 100% of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, respectively (P=0.10). Despite a higher rate of obstinate thrombosis in the COVID-19 group (47.6% vs. 11.5%, P<0.01), the PCI result was similar (TIMI 2-3 in 90.5% vs. 100%, P=0.19). In-hospital mortality was 41.7% and 3.8% in COVID-19 positive and negative patients, respectively (P<0.01). Respiratory failure was the leading cause of death (80%) in the COVID-19 group, frequently associated with severe myocardial dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS In-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with STEMI remains high despite successful PCI, mainly due to coexisting severe respiratory failure. This may be a critical factor in patient management and treatment selection.","Pellegrini, Dario; Fiocca, Luigi; Pescetelli, Irene; Canova, Paolo; Vassileva, Angelina; Faggi, Lara; Senni, Michele; Guagliumi, Giulio",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.cj-20-1166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658444/,167

We evaluated the extent to which self-isolation of mildly ill people delays the peak of outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian province. METHODS We developed a computational model and simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks within each province. Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary cases, and compared scenarios in which different proportions of mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS Without self-isolation, the peak of outbreaks would occur in the first half of June, and an average of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When 20% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by 2-4 weeks, and ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5% compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to 40% reduced ICU use by 53.6% and delayed the peak of infection by an additional 2-4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy rates above 80% and self-isolation of 40%, demand would still exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity. INTERPRETATION At the peak of COVID-19 outbreaks, the need for ICU beds will exceed the total number of ICU beds even with self-isolation at 40%. Our results show the coming challenge for the health care system in Canada and the potential role of self-isolation in reducing demand for hospital-based and ICU care.","Shoukat, Affan; Wells, Chad R; Langley, Joanne M; Singer, Burton H; Galvani, Alison P",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32269020/,167

As a result, viruses have acquired and evolved genes that antagonize the host antiviral proteins. IFNs inhibit viral infections in part through the 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. OAS proteins are pathogen recognition receptors that exist at different basal levels in different cell types and that are IFN inducible. Upon activation by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern viral double-stranded RNA, certain OAS proteins synthesize 2-5A from ATP. 2-5A binds to the antiviral enzyme RNase L causing its dimerization and activation. Recently, disparate RNA viruses, group 2a betacoronaviruses, and group A rotaviruses, have been shown to produce proteins with 2',5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities that eliminate 2-5A thereby evading the antiviral activity of the OAS/RNase L pathway. These viral proteins are members of the eukaryotic-viral LigT-like group of 2H phosphoesterases, so named for the presence of 2 conserved catalytic histidine residues. Here, we will review the biochemistry, biology, and implications of viral and cellular 2',5'-PDEs that degrade 2-5A.

The objectives were to evaluate; the rate and influences of vaccine hesitancy compared to a decade ago, vaccination patterns between Amish affiliations, vaccine practices of Amish special needs children, and the Amish's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. STUDY DESIGN In April of 2020, a survey assessing vaccination patterns and beliefs were mailed to 1000 Amish families, including ultra-conservative Amish sects and special needs families. RESULTS The response rate was 39%. Among 391 respondents, 59% did not vaccinate their children, compared to only 14% that refused all vaccinations reported by Wenger et al in the same community only a decade ago. The ultra-conservative Amish rejected vaccines more often. Amish special needs children were more likely to receive vaccines than healthy Amish children. 75% responded they would reject a COVID-19 vaccine. Fear of adverse effects was the most common reason to reject vaccines. Families that accepted vaccines were more likely to cite a healthcare worker as the primary influence to vaccinate. Wives were more likely to cite their spouse as the primary influence to vaccinate. Families that rejected vaccines were more likely to state their bishop was the most influential person on vaccination. CONCLUSION The Holmes County Amish have decreasing vaccine acceptance. Efforts to improve vaccination will require a targeted focus on the primary influences and beliefs of sub-populations within the Amish. Physician advocacy, peer mentorship, father-directed education, and close partnership with Church leadership will be needed to limit vaccine-preventable disease.

This limit of strong convection is applicable in numerous settings in geophysics and beyond, including geothermal circulation, thermohaline mixing in the subsurface and heat transport through the lithosphere. Its manifestations range from 'black smoker' chimneys at mid-ocean ridges to salt-desert patterns to astrological plumes, and it has received a great deal of recent attention because of its important role in the long-term stability of geologically sequestered CO2. In this review, the basic mathematical framework for convection in porous media governed by Darcy's Law is outlined, and its validity and limitations discussed. The main focus of the review is split between 'two-sided' and 'one-sided' systems: the former mimics the classical Rayleigh-Bénard set-up of a cell heated from below and cooled from above, allowing for detailed examination of convective dynamics and fluxes; the latter involves convection from one boundary only, which evolves in time through a series of regimes. Both set-ups are reviewed, accounting for theoretical, numerical and experimental studies in each case, and studies that incorporate additional physical effects are discussed.

AIM OF STUDY In the clinical studies, FFYH was very effective for the treatment of influenza, but the mechanism of action against influenza A virus remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza A virus in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was investigated for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS CPE inhibition assay and HA assay were used to evaluate the in vitro antiviral effects of FFYH against influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2. Mice were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of FFYH in vivo with ribavirin and lianhuaqingwen as positive controls. RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA transcription of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IP10, and IL-1β mRNA. ELISA was used to examine the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IP10, and IL-1β in sera. The blood parameters were analyzed with veterinary hematology system (exigo Vet). Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was also investigated. RESULTS FFYH showed a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity against H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 influenza A viruses. Furthermore, FFYH dose-dependently increased the survival rate, significantly prolonged the median survival time of mice, and markedly reduced lung injury caused by influenza A virus. Also, FFYH significantly improve the sick signs, food taken, weight loss, blood parameters, lung index, and lung pathological changes. Moreover, FFYH could markedly inhibit the inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IP10, IL-10, and IL-1β mRNA or protein via inhibition of the TLR7/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo. CONCLUSION FFYH not only showed a broad-spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity in vitro, but also exhibited a significant protective effect against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicated that the in vivo antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza virus may be attributed to suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines via regulating the TLR7/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings provide evidence for the clinical treatment of influenza A virus infection with FFYH.","Zhang, Yuqian; Wang, Ronghua; Shi, Weiqing; Zhihui, Zheng; Wang, Xiaoquan; Li, Cheng; Zhang, Shuofeng; Zhang, Pinghu",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.114063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813013/,167

In this study, we analyzed the correlation of thrombectomy maneuver count with a good clinical outcome and recanalization success. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and four patients with acute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or the terminal internal carotid artery who were treated with thrombectomy were included in this retrospective study. A good clinical outcome was defined as a 90-day mRS of ≤2, and successful recanalization was defined as TICI 2b-3. RESULTS The maneuver count ranged between 1-10, with a median of 2. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified an increasing number of thrombectomy maneuvers as an independent predictor of poor outcome (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.87; P = .011) and unsuccessful recanalization (adjusted OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32-0.66; P < .001). A good outcome was significantly more likely if finished within 2 maneuvers compared with 3 or 4 maneuvers, or even more than 4 maneuvers (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS An increasing maneuver count correlates strongly with a decreasing probability of both good outcome and recanalization. The probability of successful recanalization decreases below 50% if not achieved within 5 thrombectomy maneuvers. Patients who are recanalized within 2 maneuvers have the best chance of achieving a good clinical outcome.","Seker, F; Pfaff, J; Wolf, M; Ringleb, P A; Nagel, S; Schönenberger, S; Herweh, C; Möhlenbruch, M A; Bendszus, M; Pham, M",AJNR.

135828,Managing Cancer Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Agility and Collaboration Toward a Common Goal.,2020-03-20,"Health is not equally distributed across society; there are avoidable, unfair, systematic differences in health between population groups. Some of these same groups (older people, BAME communities, those with some non-communicable diseases (NCDs)) may be particularly vulnerable to risk of exposure and severe COVID-19 outcomes due to co-morbidities, structural vulnerabilities, and public-facing or health and social care jobs among other factors. Additionally, some of the restrictions designed to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread impact specifically on these same groups by limiting their activity and access to preventive or health promotion services. Greenspaces, accessed with social distancing, may mitigate some of the predicted negative health effects of COVID-19 restrictions. Maintaining or increasing publicly accessible urban greenspaces, particularly for marginalised groups, is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, and its importance amplified in the COVID-19 pandemic. Urban greenspaces should be considered a public health and social investment and a chance to rebalance our relationship with nature to protect against future pandemics. By investing in urban public greenspaces, additional benefits (job/food creation, biodiversity promotion, carbon sequestration) may coincide with health benefits. Realising these requires a shift in the balance of decision making to place weight on protecting, enhancing and providing more appropriate greenspaces designed with local communities. The current pandemic is a reminder that humanity placing too many pressures on nature has damaging consequences. COVID-19 economic recovery programs present an opportunity for sustainable transformation if they can be leveraged to simultaneously protect and restore nature and tackle climate change and health inequalities.","Geary, Rebecca; Wheeler, Benedict; Lovell, Rebecca; Jepson, Ruth; Hunter, Ruth; Rodgers, Sarah",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460630/,167

METHODS We prospectively evaluated video EEG, plethysmography, capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), and ECG for 49 patients (49 seizures) enrolled in a multicenter study of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Postictal and interictal venous blood samples were collected after a clinical seizure for measurement of serum 5-HT levels. Seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy 2017 seizure classification. We analyzed seizures with and without ICA (n = 49) and generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) with and without PCCA (n = 27). RESULTS Postictal serum 5-HT levels were increased over interictal levels for seizures without ICA (p = 0.01), compared to seizures with ICA (p = 0.21). In patients with GCS without PCCA, serum 5-HT levels were increased postictally compared to interictal levels (p < 0.001), but not in patients with seizures with PCCA (p = 0.22). Postictal minus interictal 5-HT levels also differed between the 2 groups with and without PCCA (p = 0.03). Increased heart rate was accompanied by increased serum 5-HT levels (postictal minus interictal) after seizures without PCCA (p = 0.03) compared to those with PCCA (p = 0.42). CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that significant seizure-related increases in serum 5-HT levels are associated with a lower incidence of seizure-related breathing dysfunction, and may reflect physiologic changes that confer a protective effect against deleterious phenomena leading to SUDEP. These results need to be confirmed with a larger sample size study.","Murugesan, Arun; Rani, M R Sandhya; Vilella, Laura; Lacuey, Nuria; Hampson, Johnson P; Faingold, Carl L; Friedman, Daniel; Devinsky, Orrin; Sainju, Rup K; Schuele, Stephan; Diehl, Beate; Nei, Maromi; Harper, Ronald M; Bateman, Lisa M; Richerson, George; Lhatoo, Samden D",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000008244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484709/,167

An ethnographic research design was used, including participant observation at a Chinese cancer support group over an 8-month period and key informant interviews with 7 members of the group. Food, eating, and diet were a recurrent focus of discussion at support group meetings throughout the fieldwork period. The ways in which support group participants talked about food centered on 3 distinct but interconnected themes: the prevalence of eating issues as an adverse effect of cancer and its treatment, the importance of eating ability, and questions and concerns connected with the differing and often contradictory cultural models of diet that they were exposed to. Culturally specific understandings of the relationship between food and health informed Chinese patients' experience of eating issues during cancer treatments and their ongoing concern with food and nutrition after the completion of treatment. Health professionals need to pay more attention to the meanings and attributes of food and eating beyond their physiological properties, and further research needs to be conducted with other immigrant populations with culturally distinct understandings of food.","Bell, Kirsten; Lee, Joyce; Ristovski-Slijepcevic, Svetlana",Cancer nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0b013e3181982d36; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19258826/,167

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.",,Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438898/,167

The effects of the national lockdown and the subsequent loneliness have impacted every aspect of our lives and increased mental health problems. The added social isolation of local lockdowns, such as in Leicester, will undoubtedly exacerbate some health problems due to a lack of patient willingness to attend healthcare services and the postponement of some appointments. The lack of culturally competent support is likely to add to the isolation in non-English-speaking people. Thus, we should pre-empt these issues in a culturally effective manner. To prepare for subsequent waves, GPs are risk-stratifying patients for COVID-19 and have commenced ReSPECT care-plan conversations with higher-risk patients. But with the increased risk from COVID-19 to Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients, should this and other groups of patients also have a ReSPECT care plan? Is now the time to consider community-hospice settings for our palliative COVID-19 patients?

138008,Is there really room for anti-rheumatic drugs in the treatment of COVID-19?,2020-07-28,"UNLABELLED Nanomaterials have the characteristics associated with high surface-to-volume ratios and have been explored for their antiviral activity. Despite some success, cytotoxicity has been an issue in nanomaterial-based antiviral strategies. We previously developed a novel method to fully exfoliate montmorillonite clay to generate the most fundamental units of nanoscale silicate platelet (NSP). We further modified NSP by capping with various surfactants and found that the surfactant-modified NSP (NSQ) was less cytotoxic. In this study, we tested the antiviral potentials of a series of natural-clay-derived nanomaterials. Among the derivatives, NSP modified with anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (NSQc), but not the pristine clay, unmodified NSP, a silver nanoparticle-NSP hybrid, NSP modified with cationic n-octadecanylamine hydrochloride salt, or NSP modified with nonionic Triton X-100, significantly suppressed the plaque-forming ability of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) at noncytotoxic concentrations. NSQc also blocked infection with dengue virus (DEN) and influenza A virus. Regarding the antiviral mechanism, NSQc interfered with viral binding through electrostatic interaction, since its antiviral activity can be neutralized by Polybrene, a cationic polymer. Furthermore, NSQc reduced the lethality of JEV and DEN infection in mouse challenge models. Thus, the surfactant-modified exfoliated nanoclay NSQc may be a novel nanomaterial with broad and potent antiviral activity. IMPORTANCE Nanomaterials have being investigated as antimicrobial agents, yet their antiviral potential is overshadowed by their cytotoxicity. By using a novel method, we fully exfoliated montmorillonite clay to generate the most fundamental units of nanoscale silicate platelet (NSP). Here, we show that the surfactant-modified NSP (NSQ) is less cytotoxic and that NSQc (NSP modified with sodium dodecyl sulfate) could potently block infection by dengue virus (DEN), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and influenza A virus at noncytotoxic concentrations. For the antiviral mechanism, we find that the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged NSQc and the positively charged virus particles blocks viral binding. Furthermore, we used mouse challenge models of JEV and DEN to demonstrate the in vivo antiviral potential of NSQc. Thus, NSQc may function as a potent and safe antiviral nanohybrid against several viruses, and our success in synthesizing surfactant-modified NSP with antiviral activity may shed some light on future antiviral development.","Liang, Jian-Jong; Wei, Jiun-Chiou; Lee, Yi-Ling; Hsu, Shan-hui; Lin, Jiang-Jen; Lin, Yi-Ling",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03256-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478435/,167

This method combines a linear scaling divide and conquer semiempirical algorithm with the PB equation in a QM/MM framework, allowing only a specified region's charges to be polarized by the solvent while using fixed charges from a MM force field for the remaining system. This can save time over a full QM implementation, only requiring self-consistency to be achieved in a small QM region, while giving comparable results. The solvation free energy of pentapeptides capped with an acetyl group (ACE) at the N-terminus and an N-methylamine group at the C-terminus (NME) was used to study the accuracy of this method as well as several small protein systems. The solvation free energies for the QM/MM implementation compare well with a full QM treatment of the same system, giving reasonable representations for the solvation free energy of the entire system independent of the QM region's size. In the case of the pentapeptides, the average error was only 4.9 kcal/mol with the smallest QM region. This mixed method will allow an accurate description of solvation effects in an area of interest, such as an active site, using mixed QM/MM Hamiltonians. Possible applications for this method include protein-ligand binding and reaction mechanism studies.","Hayik, Seth A; Liao, Ning; Merz, Kenneth M",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/ct700245a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26631696/,167

Their distinct pathogenic properties have established entomopathogenic nematodes as supreme biocontrol agents of insects as well as excellent models to simulate and dissect the molecular and physiological bases of conserved strategies employed by parasitic nematodes that cause infectious diseases in humans. The extreme infectivity of entomopathogenic nematodes is due in part to the presence of certain species of Gram-negative bacteria that live in mutualistic symbiosis during the infective juvenile stage, which forms the central part of the nematode life cycle. Both nematodes and their mutualistic bacteria are capable of interfering and undermining several aspects of the insect host innate immune system during the infection process. The mutualistic bacteria are also able to modulate other biological functions in their nematode host including growth, development, and reproduction. In this review, we will focus our attention on the mutualistic relationship between entomopathogenic nematodes and their associated bacteria to discuss the nature and distinct characteristics of the regulatory mechanisms, and their molecular as well as physiological components that control this specific biological partnership.","Eleftherianos, Ioannis; Heryanto, Christa",Results and problems in cell differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51849-3_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263883/,167

A novel mapping software integrating vector data and applying an algorithmic solution taking into consideration global activation pattern has been recently described (Coherent™, Biosense Webster ""Investigational""). OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the investigational algorithm to determine the mechanism of AT compared with the standard algorithm. METHODS This study included patients who underwent ablation of scar-related AT using the Carto 3 and the standard activation algorithm. The mapping data was analyzed retrospectively using the investigational algorithm, and the mechanisms were evaluated by two independent electrophysiologists. RESULTS A total of 77 scar-related AT activation maps were analyzed (89.6% left atrium, median tachycardia cycle length of 273 milliseconds). Of those, 67 cases with confirmed mechanism of the arrhythmia were used to compare the activation software. The actual mechanism of the arrhythmia was more likely to be identified with the investigational algorithm (67.2% vs 44.8%, P=0.009). In 5 patients with dual-loop circuits, 3/5 (60%) were correctly identified by the investigational algorithm compared to 0/5 (0%) with the standard software. The reduced atrial voltage was prone to lead to less capable identification of mechanism (P for trend: 0.05). The investigational algorithm showed higher inter-reviewer agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.62 vs 0.47). CONCLUSIONS In patients with scar-related ATs, activation mapping algorithms integrating vector data and ""best-fit"" propagation solution may help in identifying the mechanism and the successful site of termination.

In this study, we tested the extended TPB to predict university students' intentions to uptake COVID-19 vaccination.Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was developed to investigate students' intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine based on the components of the TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) and extended components (i.e., knowledge about COVID-19, risk perception of COVID-19, and past influenza vaccination behavior). Non-probability sampling was used to collect data from 3145 students from 43 universities in mainland China in January 2021. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to examine the proposed model. Enrolled students were relatively young (mean age = 20.80 years; SD = 2.09), half of them are female (50.2%), and most of them were studying in undergraduate programs (n = 3026; 96.2%).Results: The results showed that students' knowledge of the COVID-19 vaccine and risk perception of COVID-19 positively influenced their attitude toward the uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine. Also, students' attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination uptake and their past influenza vaccination uptake behaviors were positively associated with the intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination. Subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were not significant predictors for the intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination (R2 = 0.49).Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that the extended TPB appears to be an efficient model with the focus on attitude, knowledge, risk perception, and past influenza vaccination uptake behaviors in explaining students' intention for COVID-19 vaccination.","Fan, Chia-Wei; Chen, I-Hua; Ko, Nai-Ying; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1933687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170792/,167

STUDY DESIGN Using transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm (dEMG), we measured diaphragmatic activity from 30 minutes before (baseline) to 3 hours after administration of an intravenous caffeine-base loading dose in 30 spontaneously breathing preterm infants (mean gestational age, 29.1 ± 1.3 weeks), most of whom were on noninvasive respiratory support. Diaphragmatic activity was expressed as the percentage change in dEMG amplitude, area under the curve, respiratory rate, and inspiratory and expiratory times. Using respiratory inductive plethysmography, we measured changes in Vt and EELV from baseline. These outcome variables were calculated at 8 fixed time points after caffeine administration (5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes) and compared with baseline. RESULTS Caffeine administration resulted in rapid (within 5 minutes) increases in dEMG amplitude (median, 43%; IQR, 24%-63%; P < .001) and area under the curve (median, 28%; IQR, 14%-48%; P < .001). Vt also increased by a median of 30% (IQR, 7%-48%), and this change was significantly correlated with the change in dEMG amplitude (r = 0.67; P < .001). These effects were relatively stable until 120 minutes after caffeine administration. Caffeine did not consistently impact EELV, respiratory rate, or inspiratory and expiratory times. CONCLUSION Caffeine treatment results in a rapid and sustained increase in diaphragmatic activity and Vt in preterm infants.","Kraaijenga, Juliette V; Hutten, Gerard J; de Jongh, Frans H; van Kaam, Anton H",The Journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2015.04.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25982138/,167

Previously, microRNA (miR)-148b-3p has been found to be upregulated in bladder cancers as well as in body fluids (blood, urine) of bladder cancer patients. Here, we aimed to explore the role of CAF-derived exosome miR-148b-3p in bladder cancer progression and chemosensitivity. METHODS Transwell, MTT, flow cytometry and colony formation assays were applied to assess the effects of CAF-derived exosomes on bladder cancer cell metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemosensitivity. A dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to evaluate the targeting relationship between miR-148b-3p and PTEN. Gain- and loss- of function assays were conducted to explore the roles of miR-148b-3p and PTEN in the behavior of bladder cancer cells. The role of PTEN in the metastasis, EMT and chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells was assessed both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS We found that CAF-derived exosomes promoted the metastasis, EMT and drug resistance of bladder cancer cells. We also found that CAF-derived exosomes could directly transport miR-148b-3p into bladder cancer cells. In a xenograft mouse model we found that CAF-derived exosomes increased miR-148b-3p expression levels and promoted tumor proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance. PTEN was validated as a target of miR-148b-3p. Concordantly, we found that PTEN overexpression inhibited EMT, metastasis and chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells, reversing the tumor promoting effects of miR-148b-3p via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that miR-148b-3p downregulation in CAF-derived exosomes, thereby inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promoting PTEN expression, may offer potential opportunities for bladder cancer treatment.","Shan, Guang; Zhou, Xike; Gu, Juan; Zhou, Daoping; Cheng, Wei; Wu, Huaiguo; Wang, Yueping; Tang, Tian; Wang, Xuedong",Cellular oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13402-020-00500-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423167/,167

DATA SOURCES A PubMed search was performed in Clinical Queries using the key terms ""macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)"" and ""Kawasaki disease"". RESULTS KD patients with MAS show high intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary complications. Mortality is also as high as MAS in other diseases. Persistent fever greater than 10 days is highly associated with development of MAS in KD. Splenomegaly is observed in more than two-thirds of KD patients with MAS. Thrombocytopenia is often the earliest laboratory finding of MAS. Hyperferritinemia is highly specific and sensitive for detecting MAS in KD; so, ferritin levels should be checked if there are unexplained clinical exacerbations in KD patients. Given the under-recognition of MAS in KD, it is prudent to consider resistant KD as occult/subclinical MAS. Many KD patients with MAS have good outcomes on immune modulators. However, if KD patients fulfill the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, they may undergo longer and more intensive treatment than needed. CONCLUSIONS The possible existence of MAS should be taken into account when a KD patient shows persistent fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, or IVIG resistance. The under-diagnosis of MAS in patients with KD is an important issue to be addressed. Therapeutically, however, there is a possibility of over-treatment of MAS in patients with KD.","Han, Seung Beom; Lee, Soo-Young",World journal of pediatrics : WJP,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-020-00360-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418074/,167

However, no studies have examined the association between vitamin D status, dementia, and cranial MRI indicators of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). METHODS Cross-sectional investigation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], dementia, and MRI measures of CVD in elders receiving home care (aged 65-99 years) from 2003 to 2007. RESULTS Among 318 participants, the mean age was 73.5 +/- 8.1 years, 231 (72.6%) were women, and 109 (34.3%) were black. 25(OH)D concentrations were deficient (<10 ng/mL) in 14.5% and insufficient (10-20 ng/mL) in 44.3% of participants. There were 76 participants (23.9%) with dementia, 41 of which were classified as probable AD. Mean 25(OH)D concentrations were lower in subjects with dementia (16.8 vs 20.0 ng/mL, p < 0.01). There was a higher prevalence of dementia among participants with 25(OH)D insufficiency (< or =20 ng/mL) (30.5% vs 14.5%, p < 0.01). 25(OH)D deficiency was associated with increased white matter hyperintensity volume (4.9 vs 2.9 mL, p < 0.01), grade (3.0 vs 2.2, p = 0.04), and prevalence of large vessel infarcts (10.1% vs 6.9%, p < 0.01). After adjustment for age, race, sex, body mass index, and education, 25(OH)D insufficiency (< or =20 ng/mL) was associated with more than twice the odds of all-cause dementia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.2), Alzheimer disease (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.1), and stroke (with and without dementia symptoms) (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.0).

Whilst a speaking valve (SV) can be used on a tracheostomy tube, its use in ventilated ICU patients has been inhibited by concerns regarding potential deleterious effects to recovering lungs. The objective of this study was to assess end expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and standard bedside respiratory parameters before, during and after SV use in tracheostomised patients weaning from mechanical ventilation. METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted in a cardio-thoracic adult ICU. 20 consecutive tracheostomised patients weaning from mechanical ventilation and using a SV were recruited. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) was used to monitor patients' EELI. Changes in lung impedance and standard bedside respiratory data were analysed pre, during and post SV use. RESULTS Use of in-line SVs resulted in significant increase of EELI. This effect grew and was maintained for at least 15 minutes after removal of the SV (p < 0.001). EtCO2 showed a significant drop during SV use (p = 0.01) whilst SpO2 remained unchanged. Respiratory rate (RR (breaths per minute)) decreased whilst the SV was in situ (p <0.001), and heart rate (HR (beats per minute)) was unchanged. All results were similar regardless of the patients' respiratory requirements at time of recruitment. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of critically ill ventilated patients, SVs did not cause derecruitment of the lungs when used in the ventilator weaning period. Deflating the tracheostomy cuff and restoring the airflow via the upper airway with a one-way valve may facilitate lung recruitment during and after SV use, as indicated by increased EELI.

Although RNTD and some of its transformation products (TPs) have been studied under chlorination and photo-irradiation, the relationship between RNTD TPs and NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) remaining after those processes is still unclear. This study investigated the effects of chlorination and/or photo-irradiation on NDMA-FP derived from RNTD, simulating an urban water environment receiving treated wastewater. After chlorination and/or photo-irradiation of RNTD, ten TPs including five new ones were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTof-MS). In addition, important RNTD TPs responsible for NDMA-FP (e.g., chlorinated and hydroxylated RNTD: TP-364) were also confirmed by the relationship between detected peak area and NDMA-FP. The results showed that NDMA-FP remained due to the presence of RNTD TPs, although RNTD itself was significantly removed by chlorination and/or photo-irradiation. TP-364 was only formed by chlorination of RNTD and could not be removed by photo-irradiation. TP-314 (a stereoisomer of RNTD), -299, and -286, which were mainly formed by photo-irradiation of RNTD but not by photo-irradiation after chlorination, had strong positive correlations with NDMA-FP (R2 > 0.90; F-test, P < 0.01).","Zhao, Bo; Zhou, Jiajun; Nakada, Norihide",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385849/,167

However, the mechanism that regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that tripartite-motif protein 30 (TRIM30) negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. After stimulation with ATP, an agonist of the NLRP3 inflammasome, knockdown of TRIM30 enhanced caspase-1 activation and increased production of IL-1β in both J774 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Similarly with ATP, knockdown of TRIM30 increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production triggered by other NLRP3 inflammasome agonists, including nigericin, monosodium urate, and silica. Production of reactive oxygen species was increased in TRIM30 knockdown cells, and its increase was required for enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, because antioxidant treatment blocked excess IL-1β production. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM30 attenuated reactive oxygen species production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, in a crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis model, monosodium urate-induced neutrophil flux and IL-1β production was reduced significantly in TRIM30 transgenic mice as compared with that in their nontransgenic littermates. Taken together, our results indicate that TRIM30 is a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and provide insights into the role of TRIM30 in maintaining inflammatory responses.","Hu, Yu; Mao, Kairui; Zeng, Yan; Chen, Shuzhen; Tao, Zhiyun; Yang, Chen; Sun, Shuhui; Wu, Xiaodong; Meng, Guangxun; Sun, Bing",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1001099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21048113/,167
143199,eHealth During a Pandemic.,2020-06-01,"It remains a clinical challenge for cutaneous wound healing and skin regeneration. Endothelial cells participate in the formation of blood vessels and play an important role in the whole process of wound healing. Recent studies suggested that exosomes contribute to the intercellular communication through paracrine pathways, and sustained release of exosomes from hydrogel-based materials provide a promising strategy for curing wound defects. In this study, we isolated exosomes derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and found that HUVECs derived exosomes (HUVECs-Exos) could promote the proliferation and migration activities of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are two important effector cells for skin regeneration. Then we developed gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel as the wound dressing to incorporate HUVECs-Exos and applied it to the full-thickness cutaneous wounds. It demonstrated that GelMA scaffold could not only repair the wound defect, but also achieve sustained release of exosomes. The in vivo results showed accelerated re-epithelialization, promotion of collagen maturity and improvement of angiogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggested that HUVECs-Exos could accelerate wound healing and GelMA mediated controlled release of HUVECs-Exos might offer a new method for repairing cutaneous wound defects.","Zhao, Danyang; Yu, Zhencheng; Li, Yun; Wang, Yu; Li, Qingfeng; Han, Dong",Journal of molecular histology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10735-020-09877-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388839/,167

CLINICAL FINDINGS Physical examination of the anesthetized animal revealed tick infestation, normal mentation, and a lack of evidence of traumatic injuries. Radiography revealed no clinically relevant abnormalities. Hematologic analysis results were generally unremarkable, and serologic tests for exposure to feline coronavirus, FeLV, FIV, and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. Results of PCR assays for flea- and common tick-borne organisms other than Bartonella clarridgeiae were negative. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Ticks were manually removed, and the patient received supportive care and fipronil treatment. The bobcat made a full recovery within 72 hours after treatment for ticks, and a presumptive diagnosis of tick paralysis was made. Identified tick species included Dermacenter variabilis, Amblyomma americanum, and Ixodes scapularis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To the authors' knowledge, tick paralysis has not previously been reported in felids outside Australia. This disease should be considered a differential diagnosis in felids, including exotic cats, with signs of neuromuscular disease of unknown etiopathogenesis.","Persky, Meredith E; Jafarey, Yousuf S; Christoff, Sarah E; Maddox, Dewey D; Stowell, Stephanie A; Norton, Terry M",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.256.3.362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31961273/,167
143375,Delirium after Cardiac Surgery and Cognitive Change: Reply.,2019,"BACKGROUND Gastric cancer with extensive lymph node metastasis is commonly considered unresectable, with a poor prognosis. We previously reported the results of the use of cisplatin and S-1 as preoperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer with extensive lymph node metastasis; docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1 (DCS) have now been investigated for the same purpose. METHODS Patients received two or three 28-day cycles of DCS therapy (docetaxel at 40 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 60 mg/m2 on day 1, S-1 at 40 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks) followed by gastrectomy with D2 plus para-aortic nodal dissection. After R0 resection, S-1 chemotherapy was given for 1 year. The primary end point was the response rate (RR) to preoperative chemotherapy determined by central peer review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0. The planned sample size was 50, with one-sided alpha of 10 %, power of 80 %, expected RR of 80 %, and threshold of 65 %. RESULTS Between July 2011 and May 2013, 53 patients were enrolled, of whom 52 were eligible. The clinical RR was 57.7 % [30/52, 80 % confidence interval 47.9-67.1 %, p = 0.89], and R0 resection was achieved in 84.6 % of patients (44/52). Common grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events during DCS therapy were leukocytopenia (18.9 %), neutropenia (39.6 %), and hyponatremia (15.1 %). The common grade 3 or grade 4 surgical morbidity was abdominal infection (10.2 %). The pathological RR was 50.0 % (26/52). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DCS therapy was feasible but did not show a sufficient RR. Preoperative cisplatin and S-1 therapy is still considered the tentative standard treatment for this population until survival results are known.","Ito, Seiji; Sano, Takeshi; Mizusawa, Junki; Takahari, Daisuke; Katayama, Hiroshi; Katai, Hitoshi; Kawashima, Yoshiyuki; Kinoshita, Takahiro; Terashima, Masanori; Nashimoto, Atsushi; Nakamori, Mikihito; Onaya, Hiroaki; Sasako, Mitsuru",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-016-0619-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27299887/,167
143956,Comparison between single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions for knee with grade 2 medial collateral ligament injury.,2021-03-19,"UNLABELLED Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-based imaging tracers allow specific imaging of integrin αvβ3, a protein overexpressed during angiogenesis, leading to the possibility that it might serve as a tool to stratify patients for antiangiogenic treatment. However, these tracers have generally been characterized in xenograft models in which integrin αvβ3 was constitutively expressed by the tumor cells themselves. In the studies presented here, the use of (111)In-RGD2 as a tracer to image only integrin αvβ3 expression on blood vessels in the tumor was determined using tumor xenografts in which tumor cells were integrin αvβ3-negative. METHODS DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 was radiolabeled with (111)In ((111)In-RGD2), and biodistribution studies were performed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) xenograft mouse models to determine the optimal peptide dose to image angiogenesis. Next, biodistribution and imaging studies were performed at the optimal peptide dose in 3 HNSCC mouse models, FaDu, SCCNij3, and SCCNij202. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor vascular and cell surface expression of integrin αvβ3 and correlation analysis of vascular integrin αvβ3 and autoradiography were completed. RESULTS All 3 HNSCC xenografts expressed integrin αvβ3 on the vessels only. The optimal peptide dose of (111)In-RGD2 was 1 μg or less for specific integrin αvβ3-mediated uptake of the tracer. SPECT/CT imaging showed clear uptake of the tracer in the periphery of the tumors, corresponding with well-vascularized areas of the tumor. Within the tumor, (111)In-RGD2 autoradiography coincided with vascular integrin αvβ3 expression, as determined immunohistochemically. Integrin αvβ3-mediated uptake was also detected in nontumor tissues, which, through immunohistochemical analysis, proved positive for integrin αvβ3. CONCLUSION (111)In-RGD2 allows the visualization of integrin αvβ3 in xenograft models in which integrin αvβ3 is expressed only on the neovasculature, such as in the HNSCC tumors. Thus, (111)In-RGD2 allows specific visualization of angiogenesis in tumor models lacking constitutive tumoral integrin αvβ3 expression but may be less useful for this purpose in many tumors in which tumor cells express integrin αvβ3.","Terry, Samantha Y A; Abiraj, Keelara; Frielink, Cathelijne; van Dijk, Laura K; Bussink, Johan; Oyen, Wim J; Boerman, Otto C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.113.129668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24408894/,167

The choice of treatment is based on several factors, including patient and surgeon preference. However, there is little data to guide the decision-making. This study examines the available literature comparing operative treatment in-office versus OR. METHODS A systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Of 2,864 articles identified, 78 were reviewed full-length and 18 were included. Outcomes of interest were recurrence and complication rates, number of procedures, time interval between procedures, and cost. RESULTS Only one study compared outcomes of operative in-office to OR treatments. The weighted average complication rate for OR procedures was 0.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.32), n = 8, and for office procedures, 0.17 (95% CI 0.08-0.33), n = 6. The weighted average time interval between OR procedures was 10.59 months (5.83, 15.35) and for office procedures 5.40 months (3.26-7.54), n = 1. The weighted average cost of OR procedures was $10,105.22 ($5,622.51-14,587.83), n = 2 versus $2,081.00 ($1,987.64-$2,174.36), n = 1 for office procedures. CONCLUSION Only one study compares office to OR treatment. The overall data indicate no differences aside from cost and imply that office procedures may be more cost-effective than OR procedures. However, the heterogeneous data limits any strong comparison of outcomes between office and OR-based treatment of laryngeal papillomas. More studies to compare the two treatment settings are warranted.","Chen, Sophia; Connors, Joseph; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Binhuan; Vieira, Dorice; Shapira-Galitz, Yael; Garber, David; Amin, Milan R","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003489420949586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32781827/,167

144831,Multifaceted Pharmacist-led Interventions in the Hospital Setting: A Systematic Review.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Worldwide, an estimated 40 million people are in need of palliative care each year, but only 14% receive it. The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients receiving palliative care is higher than in the general population. This association is intended to grow as a result of the rising burden of DM worldwide, ageing populations and the improved overall survival time of several diseases over the last few decades. Recommendations for DM management in the context of palliative care are mainly based on expert opinion as there is a lack of suitable evidence base and randomised clinical trials in palliative care are scarce. The aim of our systematic review is to identify the best DM management practices in order to reduce important DM-related symptoms and acute complications in patients receiving palliative care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The authors will study the DM treatment and management literature, surveying the different approaches employed to treat adult palliative patients. Core health bibliographic databases will be searched from January 1990 to May 2019. Data sources will include Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and grey literature. Details regarding diet, oral and injectable glucose-lowering medicines, insulin regimens and blood glucose monitoring strategies will be evaluated. We defined the primary outcomes to compare between DM management approaches as the presence of symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia) and acute complications of DM (hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and diabetic ketoacidosis), and secondary outcomes as hospital admissions and deaths due to DM-related complications, health-related quality of life and glycaemic control.

In this work, we employed mesoscopic coarse-grained simulations to study ovispirin-1 and lysozyme protein coronas on bare gold nanoparticles. Our study showed that protein corona formation is governed by protein-surface and protein-protein interactions, as well as the surface hydrophobic effect. The corona structure was found to be dependent on protein types and the size of nanoparticles. Ovispirin proteins form homogeneous single-layered adsorption in comparison with the lysozyme's inhomogeneous multilayered aggregates on gold NP surfaces. The decrease in nanoparticle size leads to more angular degrees of freedom for protein adsorption orientation. Subsequent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate the loss of secondary structure of ovispirin upon adsorption and the heterogeneity of its local structure.","Jahan Sajib, Md Symon; Sarker, Pranab; Wei, Yong; Tao, Xiuping; Wei, Tao",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124831/,167

A comprehensive understanding of possible causal pathways by which racism and discrimination lead to POCI's health disadvantages is a critical step toward reducing disparities and promoting health equity. Experimental methods can help researchers delineate these causal pathways. In this manuscript, we illustrate how virtual reality (VR) can be used by researchers in experimental studies to advance discrimination science. METHOD We summarize current findings on the health effects of discrimination. We describe common methodological approaches that have been employed in discrimination science and discuss some of their limitations. Arguments for the potential benefits of using VR to advance discrimination science are provided. RESULTS VR has the potential to facilitate ecologically valid experiments that examine individuals' responses to racism and discrimination-related experiences in real-time. CONCLUSIONS VR offers scientists an innovative method that can be used in experimental studies to help delineate how racism and discrimination might lead to health problems in POCI. Still, VR is new to discrimination science; thus, research is necessary to empirically delineate the advantages and possible disadvantages of using VR in studies on discrimination.

Whereas our companion paper summarizes fundamental issues, this article focuses on more complex, task-specific aspects of presenting numeric information in patient decision aids. METHODS As part of the International Patient Decision Aids Standards third evidence update, we gathered an expert panel of 9 international experts who revised and expanded the topics covered in the 2013 review working in groups of 2 to 3 to update the evidence, based on their expertise and targeted searches of the literature. The full panel then reviewed and provided additional revisions, reaching consensus on the final version. RESULTS Five of the 10 topics addressed more complex task-specific issues. We found strong evidence for using independent event rates and/or incremental absolute risk differences for the effect size of test and screening outcomes. Simple visual formats can help to reduce common judgment biases and enhance comprehension but can be misleading if not well designed. Graph literacy can moderate the effectiveness of visual formats and hence should be considered in tool design. There is less evidence supporting the inclusion of personalized and interactive risk estimates. DISCUSSION More complex numeric information. such as the size of the benefits and harms for decision options, can be better understood by using incremental absolute risk differences alongside well-designed visual formats that consider the graph literacy of the intended audience. More research is needed into when and how to use personalized and/or interactive risk estimates because their complexity and accessibility may affect their feasibility in clinical practice.","Trevena, Lyndal J; Bonner, Carissa; Okan, Yasmina; Peters, Ellen; Gaissmaier, Wolfgang; Han, Paul K J; Ozanne, Elissa; Timmermans, Danielle; Zikmund-Fisher, Brian J",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x21996342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660535/,167
146459,Multi-layer reconstruction during endoscopic endonasal surgery: how much is necessary?,2015,"IL-27 is involved in inflammatory reactions. CXCL10 is an important chemokine contributing to airway inflammatory disease. In this study, we investigated whether IL-27 modulated the synthesis of CXCL10 in primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). HLFs were activated by IL-27 alone, or in combination with other cytokines. CXCL10 synthesis was measured by real-time PCR and ELISA. An examination of transcriptional regulation was performed via the transient transfection of promoter constructs, whereas mRNA stability was assessed by actinomycin D chase and real-time PCR. The underlying signaling pathways were studied by Western blotting and intracellular staining, using flow cytometry. Our results demonstrated that IL-27 induced and synergized with TNF-α to up-regulate CXCL10 mRNA and protein concentrations in a steroid-insensitive manner. This synergistic CXCL10 production was dependent on the transcriptional regulation of CXCL10 gene promoter activity and the enhanced stability of CXCL10 mRNA because of IL-27 and TNF-α, and this synergism was regulated by the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt dominantly, and in small part via NF-κB. Interestingly, IL-27 promoted the basal and enhanced TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Akt, but not IκBα. Moreover, enhanced CXCL10 mRNA stability occurred via a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. Finally, clinical analysis showed that IL-27 was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and increased IL-27 concentrations were correlated with increased CXCL10 concentrations in patients with COPD and PTB. Our findings suggest that IL-27 has the potential to amplify airway inflammation via the induction of CXCL10 from HLFs, in combination with TNF-α.","Dong, Shanshan; Zhang, Xuemei; He, Yujuan; Xu, Fang; Li, Dairong; Xu, WenChun; Wang, Hong; Yin, Yibing; Cao, Ju",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2012-0340oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23333920/,167

The purpose of the present study is to develop an anticancer targeted drug delivery system using synthesized lipoproteins with the integration of quality by design approach. Lipoprotein structures were designed, and quality by design approach was implemented to select variables for optimization. Further, the lipoproteins were synthesized and characterized by physicochemical properties. Physical composites of synthesized lipoproteins with the drug (tablets) were prepared and evaluated for post-compression parameters. Moreover, drug-lipoprotein chemical conjugates were synthesized and characterized for physicochemical properties, including cellular drug uptake and cytotoxicity study on HaCaT cancer cells. Synthesized lipoproteins showed good swelling capacity but poor flowability. Nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy of conjugates showed characteristic peaks. Tablets from all batches extended the drug release up to 12 h. All synthesized conjugates showed improved cellular drug uptake (up to 86.1%) and inhibition (87.39%) of HaCat cancer cells. These findings explored the possible use of synthesized lipoproteins in the development of anti-cancer drug formulation against HaCat cancer cells. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

147187,Hypothetical case replacement can be used to quantify the robustness of trial results.,2021-02-11,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a worldwide epidemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality, often due to disabling or fatal thromboembolic stroke. Oral anticoagulation is highly effective at preventing ischaemic stroke and improving all-cause survival in patients with non-valvular AF. Despite the efficacy of oral anticoagulation, many patients are not treated due to either absolute or perceived contraindications to therapy, including bleeding. Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure has emerged as a mechanical alternative to pharmacologic stroke prevention. Initial and mid-term clinical trial data suggest that LAA closure is safe, with less intracranial bleeding, and a net clinical benefit that appears to be non-inferior to oral anticoagulation. However, concern remains over the possible increased risk of ischaemic stroke in long-term follow-up. Careful patient selection for LAA closure is paramount. Patients with prior intracranial bleeding or recurrent serious bleeding who are not eligible for long-term oral anticoagulation are typical candidates for LAA closure; however, other populations may benefit as well, such as patients with end-stage renal disease. Clinical investigation and randomized trials are needed to clarify the best methods of LAA occlusion, optimal pharmacologic strategies in the short-term after LAA closure, and to identify patient populations who will derive the most benefit from LAA occlusion. In this article, we review the rationale for LAA closure, the currently available devices and their evidence base, patient selection, challenges in management, and future directions for LAA closure science.","Piccini, Jonathan P; Sievert, Horst; Patel, Manesh R",European heart journal,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehw330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27628431/,167

148192,InterOrganizational practice committee guidance/recommendation for models of care during the novel coronavirus pandemic.,2020-09-30,"PURPOSE To investigate the incidence of inguinal hernia following radical prostatectomy, we compared the incidence of inguinal hernia after open retropubic radical prostatectomy with the laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomies, and with control groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included all original articles investigating patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and reporting data on inguinal hernia incidence. PubMed and EMBASE were searched on 28 February 2018. A meta-analysis was conducted as a weighted and pooled estimate of the incidence of inguinal hernia. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for randomized clinical trials. RESULTS We included 54 studies with a total of 101,687 patients. The estimated incidence of inguinal hernia after open retropubic radical prostatectomy was 13.7% (95% CI = 12.0-15.4%), 7.5% (5.2-9.8%) after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, and 7.9% (5.0-10.9%) after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. In studies comparing incidence of inguinal hernia after open prostatectomy versus no treatment, the incidence was significantly higher in the radical prostatectomy group 11.7% (95% CI = 9.2-14.2%) vs. 3.3% (2.0-4.6%). Two out of three studies reported a significantly higher incidence after laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, when compared with a control group. Most studies exploring intraoperative inguinal hernia prevention techniques found a significantly lower inguinal hernia incidence in the experimental group. The inguinal hernias that developed after radical prostatectomy were primarily indirect 81.9% (95% CI = 75.3-88.4%). CONCLUSION We found a high incidence of inguinal hernia following radical prostatectomy, and hernias were primarily of the indirect type. The highest incidence of inguinal hernia was found after open radical prostatectomy, followed by laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. There was no significant difference between the laparoscopic and robot-assisted groups. The incidence of inguinal hernia was significantly higher after open radical prostatectomy compared with control groups, with some evidence to support the same for the laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches. Promising results have been reported in studies investigating intraoperative prophylactic surgical techniques to reduce the postoperative incidence of inguinal hernia.","Alder, Rasmus; Zetner, Dennis; Rosenberg, Jacob",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000000313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039101/,167
148475,Chronic urticaria in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis: significance of severity of thyroid gland inflammation.,2011,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on glycemic control during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). MATERIAL AND METHODS Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics were obtained from adults with T1D and compared during three periods: before lockdown (Period 1), lockdown (Period 2) and de-escalation after the end of lockdown (Period 3). In addition, patients who presented clinically meaningful glycemic improvement during Period 2 (defined by a glucose management indicator [GMI] reduction ≥ 0.5%) were compared with those who did not present it, and a logistic regression analysis was used to select predictive variables. RESULTS The study included 138 subjects. During Period 2, there was a decrease in mean glucose, GMI, time above range and an increase in time in range, compared with Period 1. During Period 3 these findings were maintained, in addition to a reduction in glycemic variability and an increase in sensor use and scans per day. Twenty-four patients (17.4%) presented clinically meaningful glycemic improvement during lockdown. No differences were detected between patients, except for the last laboratory A1c value. In the logistic regression analysis, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy and last laboratory A1c increased the probability of glycemic improvement, while duration of diabetes decreased that probability. CONCLUSIONS Most adults with T1D using CGM improved their glycemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic, not only during lockdown but also after it ended. A shorter duration of diabetes, CSII therapy and a higher last laboratory A1c value predicted glycemic improvement during lockdown.","Moreno-Domínguez, Óscar; González-Pérez de Villar, Noemí; Barquiel, Beatriz; Hillman, Natalia; Gaspar-Lafuente, Ruth; Arévalo-Gómez, Montserrat; Herranz, Lucrecia",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2020.0550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237817/,167

The femoral nerve block (FNB) is,amongst other things, indicatedfor pre- and post-operative painmanagementfor patients withfemoral fractures but its role in the prehospital setting has not beendetermined.The aim of this review was to assess the effect and safety of the FNB in comparison to other formsof analgesia (or no treatment) for managingacute lower extremity painin adult patients in the prehospital setting. METHODS A systematic review (PROSPERO registration (CRD42018114399))was conducted. The Cochrane and GRADE methods were used to assess outcomes. Two authors independently reviewed eachstudy for eligibility, extracted the data and performed risk of bias assessments. RESULTS Four studies with a total of 252 patients were included. Two RCTs (114 patients) showed thatFNB may reduce pain moreeffectively than metamizole (mean difference 32 mm on a 100 mm VAS (95% CI 24 to 40)).

148606,Intricate interplay between Covid-19 and cardiovascular diseases.,2020-10-31,"This work introduces VaxiPatch, a novel vaccination system comprised of subunit glycoprotein vaccine antigens, adjuvants and dermal delivery. For this study, rHA of influenza virus B/Colorado/06/2017 was incorporated into synthetic virosomes, and adjuvant liposomes were formed with QS-21 from Saponaria quillaja, with or without the synthetic TLR4 agonist 3D - (6-acyl) PHAD. These components were concentrated and co-formulated into trehalose with dye. Dermal delivery was achieved using an economical 37-point stainless steel microneedle array, designed for automated fill/finish by microfluidic dispensers used for mass production of immunodiagnostics. Vaccine and adjuvant are deposited to form a sugar glass in a pocket on the side of each of the tips, allowing skin penetration to be performed directly by the rigid steel structure. In this study, Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6 per group) were vaccinated by VaxiPatches containing 0.3 µg of rHA, 0.5 µg QS-21 and 0.2 µg 3D - (6-acyl) PHAD and dye, resulting in antigen-specific IgG titers 100-fold higher than 4.5 µg of FluBlok (p = 0.001) delivered intramuscularly. Similarly, hemagglutination inhibition titers in these animals were 14-fold higher than FluBlok controls (p = 0.01). Non-adjuvanted VaxiPatches were also compared with rHA virosomes injected intramuscularly. Accelerated shelf life studies further suggest that formulated virosomal antigens retain activity for at least two months at 60° C. Further, co-formulation of a dye could provide a visible verification of delivery based on the temporary pattern on the skin. A room-temperature-stable vaccination kit such as VaxiPatch has the potential to increase vaccine use and compliance globally.","Ellison, Thomas J; Talbott, George C; Henderson, Daniel R",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32741668/,167
148893,Ethical considerations.,2020-07-01,"AIMS Although cardiac involvement has prognostic significance in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with severe forms, few studies have explored the prognostic role of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). We investigated the link between TTE parameters and prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS Consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to 24 French hospitals were retrospectively included. Comprehensive data, including clinical and biological parameters, were recorded at admission. Focused TTE was performed during hospitalization, according to clinical indication. Patients were followed for a primary composite outcome of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization. Among 2878 patients, 445 (15%) underwent TTE. Most of these had cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cardiovascular disease, and were on cardiovascular treatments. Dilatation and dysfunction were observed in, respectively, 12% (48/412) and 23% (102/442) of patients for the left ventricle, and in 12% (47/407) and 16% (65/402) for the right ventricle (RV). Primary composite outcome occurred in 44% (n = 196) of patients [9% (n = 42) for death without ICU transfer and 35% (n = 154) for admission to ICU]. RV dilatation was the only TTE parameter associated with the primary outcome. After adjustment, male sex [hazard ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 - 2.25; P = 0.02], higher body mass index (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.18; P = 0.01), anticoagulation (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 - 0.86; P = 0.01), and RV dilatation (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.05 - 2.64; P = 0.03) remained independently associated with the primary outcome. CONCLUSION Echocardiographic evaluation of RV dilatation could be useful for assessing risk of severe COVID-19 developing in hospitalized patients.","Soulat-Dufour, Laurie; Fauvel, Charles; Weizman, Orianne; Barbe, Thomas; Pezel, Théo; Mika, Delphine; Cellier, Joffrey; Geneste, Laura; Panagides, Vassili; Marsou, Wassima; Deney, Antoine; Attou, Sabir; Delmotte, Thomas; Ribeyrolles, Sophie; Chemaly, Pascale; Karsenty, Clement; Giordano, Gauthier; Gautier, Alexandre; Duceau, Baptiste; Sutter, Willy; Chaumont, Corentin; Guilleminot, Pierre; Sagnard, Audrey; Pastier, Julie; Trimaille, Antonin; Bonnet, Guillaume; Canu, Marjorie; Coisne, Augustin; Cohen, Ariel",European heart journal.

148990,Anaesthesia and peri-operative medicine over the next 25 years.,2021-08-01,"The Journal of Comparative Psychology has enjoyed a century of publishing some of the best investigations of animal behavior, often with reference to human cognition and behavior. This long history has manifested many paradigm-like shifts. Researchers have fluctuated between treating animals as models of human learning to emphasizing stark differences between animal and human behavior to stressing psychological continuity across species. At this time, there appears little consensus regarding questions of psychological continuity. I argue that this is a futile debate. Rather than focusing on behavior in nonhuman animals that represent potential parallels to human psychology (or behavior), comparative psychologists should focus on questions of development, function, and mechanism of behavior to better understand the behavior of all species in biological context. A focus on understanding underlying mechanisms for behavior rather than settling on behavioral outcomes alone as diagnostic of a species' status on some imaginary scale of progress will help address anthropocentric biases in current approaches. A focus on the ""why"" and ""how"" questions espoused by Tinbergen over half a century ago will move the field in better alignment with related fields, such as ethology, and provide greater insights into both animal and human minds.

151028,A CLOSE-UP guide to capturing clinical images.,2020-05-18,"Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of acute infections in humans. However, the burden of certain respiratory viruses, such as coronaviruses, and the relevance of viral coinfections remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the distribution and seasonal occurrences of respiratory viruses detected by multiplex molecular assay in 6,014 samples from 2008 to 2011 in a French hospital. We assessed the detection frequencies of 14 respiratory viruses and their clinical impact in immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, we explored the preferential association patterns between respiratory viruses in multiple infections. Our results indicated that human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV) and coronavirus (HCoV) were frequently detected in respiratory samples (48.81% and 11.74% of infected samples, respectively), and the detection frequencies of these viruses were further increased in immunosuppressed patients. The most common subtypes of HCoV were HCoV-229E (33.80%) and HCoV-HKU1 (32.39%). A sharp increase in the detection frequencies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 over several months suggested that these subtypes were epidemic in our population. In immunosuppressed patients, HCoV contributed to upper respiratory tract infections (52%). Evidence did not support lower respiratory tract infections exclusive to a unique HCoV infection. In multiply infected individuals, determined in 6.3% of samples, HRV/EV and HCoV were detected in 33.29% and 22.90% of samples, respectively. Interestingly, nearly 50% of HCoV infections were detected in association with another virus. Since the distributions of respiratory viruses in multiply infected patients were subject to preferential association patterns between viruses, we propose complex interactions between different respiratory viruses and host factors.","Lepiller, Q; Barth, H; Lefebvre, F; Herbrecht, R; Lutz, P; Kessler, R; Fafi-Kremer, S; Stoll-Keller, F",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01078-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850954/,167

Radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma, the Munich experience.",2017,"UNLABELLED BACKGROUND/ PURPOSE: Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) is still an existing disease that occurs frequently in the 21st century despite of the wide availability of antiulcer medication and Helicobacter eradication. The current study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that its outcome might be improved by using the laparoscopy. The outcome of treatment in terms of complications, mortality and hospital stay with relevant to laparoscopy was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective descriptive study was carried on the period of 3 years from July 2009 till July 2012. All patients with acute abdominal pain that was clinically diagnosed as having perforated peptic ulcer were included. Excluded from this study were those patients with concomitant bleeding from the ulcer and evidence of gastric outlet obstructions. Also excluded were those with evidence of large perforation more than 10 mm and patients with symptoms of more than 36 h durations for fear of septic shock. RESULTS Forty seven patients were studied out of a total 53 PPU patients; they were 41 males and 6 females with the male to female ratio of 6.8:1. Their age ranged from 19 to 55 years with the mean age of 39.5 ± 8.6 years. Forty five patients were successfully treated by laparoscopy while only 2 cases that were early presented with signs of hypovolumic shock were converted into laparotomy due to severe bleeding. The mean hospital stay was 75 ± 12.6 h. Post operative complications included death of one patient in the postoperative period at the Intensive care unit (ICU) plus post operative fever in the 2 patients who underwent laparotomy and it was amenable to treatment.

151805,Vitamin D binding protein polymorphism and COVID-19.,2020-09-12,"Emerging mutations in SARS-CoV-2 cause several waves of COVID-19 pandemic. Here we investigate the infectivity and antigenicity of ten emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants-B.1.1.298, B.1.1.7(Alpha), B.1.351(Beta), P.1(Gamma), P.2(Zeta), B.1.429(Epsilon), B.1.525(Eta), B.1.526-1(Iota), B.1.526-2(Iota), B.1.1.318-and seven corresponding single amino acid mutations in the receptor-binding domain using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The results indicate that the pseudovirus of most of the SARS-CoV-2 variants (except B.1.1.298) display slightly increased infectivity in human and monkey cell lines, especially B.1.351, B.1.525 and B.1.526 in Calu-3 cells. The K417N/T, N501Y, or E484K-carrying variants exhibit significantly increased abilities to infect mouse ACE2-overexpressing cells. The activities of furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L are increased against most of the variants. RBD amino acid mutations comprising K417T/N, L452R, Y453F, S477N, E484K, and N501Y cause significant immune escape from 11 of 13 monoclonal antibodies.

However, there is an absence of knowledge on the effect of long-term operation under these conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the operational conditions of an anaerobic reactor treating food waste after long-term operation without temperature control and low-intensity mixing. For this, a demonstration-scale reactor (18.8 m3) was operated for 160 days, while stability parameters were used to control the applied organic loading rate (OLR). Stability parameters indicated that the reactor was operated at stable conditions with an OLR of 0.3 kg VS m-3 d-1, while it was overloaded at an OLR of 0.4 kg VS m-3 d-1. This was observed through high value of intermediate and partial alkalinity ratio (IA/PA ratio), 2.5, and low values of bicarbonate alkalinity and pH, 1,800 mg CaCO3 L-1 and 6.8, respectively. Moreover, there was a change in the concentration of intermediated metabolites, with a higher content of propionate and acetate, 1,080 and 3,775 mg L-1, respectively. Consequently, the methane production rate was decreased from 0.12 to 0.08 m³ CH4 m-3 d-1 and methane yield from 0.43 to 0.15 m³ CH4 kg VS-1. The reactor instability at a relatively low OLR was most probably due to hydrodynamic factors caused by the accumulation of recalcitrant material. Therefore, this material reduced the reactor performance and requires attention for a sustainable long-term operation.","Ferreira, Tiago B; Passos, Fabiana; de Souza, Cláudio L",Environmental technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2021.1970819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407731/,167

NTB is also prescribed in COVID-19 patients associated with IPF. However, it has an extremely low bioavailability of around 4.7% hence researchers are attempting to address this drawback by different approaches. AREAS COVERED The review article focuses on enlisting all the formulation attempts explored by researchers to increase the bioavailability of NTB while also providing meaningful insights into the unexplored areas in formulation development such as targeting the lymphatic system and transdermal delivery. All the patents on the formulation development of NTB have also been summarized. EXPERT OPINION NTB has the potential to act on multiple diseases that are still being discovered but, its extremely low bioavailability is a challenge that is to be dealt with for obtaining the full benefit. Few studies have been performed aiming at improving the bioavailability but there are unexplored areas that can be used, a few of which are explained in this article.

This tool allows health care providers to confidentially submit cases of anosmia and dysgeusia related to COVID-19. We analyzed the first 237 entries, which revealed that anosmia was noted in 73% of patients prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and was the initial symptom in 26.6%. Some improvement was noted in 27% of patients, with a mean time to improvement of 7.2 days in this group (85% of this group improved within 10 days). Our findings suggest that anomia can be a presenting symptom of COVID-19, consistent with other emerging international reports.

The Taiwanese experience on enterovirus 71.,2014,"A severe porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) epizootic has been affecting pigs of all ages that are characterized by high mortality among suckling piglets in China since late 2010, causing significant economic losses. Obtaining a current-circulating PEDV variant isolate that can grow efficiently in cell culture is prerequisite for the development of efficient vaccines. In this study, PEDV strain HN1303 was isolated successfully on Vero cells with supplemental trypsin, and the isolate has been serially propagated in cell culture for over 95 passages. The infectious titers of the virus during the first 10 passages ranged from 10(2.6) to 10(5.8) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml, and the titers of 20-95 passages ranged from 10(6.2) to 10(8.0)TCID50/ml. The growth curve of Vero cell-adapted HN1303 in cell culture was determined, and dynamics of virus production was confirmed by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Sequence and phylogenetic analysis based on spike gene indicate that the HN1303 strain belongs to genotype IIa. In addition, the fourth passage cell-culture HN1303 was subjected to 2-day old piglets. All piglets orally inoculated developed severe watery diarrhea and vomiting within 24 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and died within 72 hpi.

It has been demonstrated that the conformation of MHC class I (MHC I) molecules can be adjusted by the presented peptide, which impacts T cell activation. However, it is still largely unknown whether the conformational shift of MHC I influences the protective effect of virus-specific T cells. In this study, utilizing the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mouse model, we observed that through the unusual secondary anchor Ile5, a CD8+ T cell epitope drove the conformational fit of Trp73 on the α1 helix of murine MHC I H-2Kd In vitro renaturation and circular dichroism assays indicated that this shift of the structure did not influence the peptide/MHC I binding affinity. Nevertheless, the T cell recognition and the protective effect of the peptide diminished when we made an Ile to Ala mutation at position 5 of the original peptide. The molecular bases of the concordant recognition of T cell epitopes and host MHC-dependent protection were demonstrated through both crystal structure determination and tetramer staining using the peptide-MHC complex. Our results indicate a coordinated MHC I/peptide interaction mechanism and provide a beneficial reference for T cell-oriented vaccine development against emerging viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.","Liu, William J; Lan, Jiaming; Liu, Kefang; Deng, Yao; Yao, Yanfeng; Wu, Shaolian; Chen, Hong; Bao, Lingling; Zhang, Haifeng; Zhao, Min; Wang, Qihui; Han, Lingxia; Chai, Yan; Qi, Jianxun; Zhao, Jincun; Meng, Songdong; Qin, Chuan; Gao, George F; Tan, Wenjie",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1601542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903740/,167

The pathological drivers of NAFLD are complex and largely undefined. It is increasingly identified that the imbalance between renin-angiotensin system and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction associated with NAFLD. However, no known empirical research has focused on exploring the effect of the regulation of mitochondrial respiration chain activity by Ang-(1-7)/Mas on the prevention of NAFLD. Here, we evaluated the interaction and relevance of hepatic Ang-(1-7)/Mas-axis challenge with glucolipid metabolism and mitochondrial condition in vivo and in vitro. In this context, we found that Mas deletion in mice contributed to the severe glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis which accompanied by elevated levels of serum/ hepatic alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglycerides, as well as the mitochondrial dysfunction. Whereas forced upregulation of Mas or Ang-(1-7) administration could significantly attenuate these consequences by downregulating the expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins and enzymes for gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, activation of Ang-(1-7)/Mas arm could improve the IRS-1/Akt/AMPK pathway and enhance the mitochondrial energy utilization. Considered together, it is becoming extremely hopeful to provide a new perspective for Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis for the therapeutics of NAFLD.","Song, Li-Ni; Liu, Jing-Yi; Shi, Ting-Ting; Zhang, Yi-Chen; Xin, Zhong; Cao, Xi; Yang, Jin-Kui",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202001639r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078906/,167

Public health intervention, such as ensuring people living with HIV adhere to antiretroviral therapy and remain virally-suppressed, can help control the spread of the virus. However, such intervention requires utilizing limited public health resource allocations. Determining which individuals are most at risk of transmitting HIV could allow public health officials to focus their limited resources on these individuals. SETTING Molecular epidemiology can help prioritize people living with HIV by patterns of transmission inferred from their sampled viral sequences. Such prioritization has been previously suggested and performed by monitoring cluster growth. In this paper, we introduce ProACT (Prioritization using AnCesTral edge lengths), a phylogenetic approach for prioritizing individuals living with HIV. METHODS ProACT starts from a phylogeny inferred from sequence data and orders individuals according to their terminal branch length, breaking ties using ancestral branch lengths. We evaluated ProACT on a real dataset of 926 HIV-1 subtype B pol data obtained in San Diego between 2005 and 2014, and a simulation datasets modelling the same epidemic. Prioritization methods are compared by their ability to predict individuals who transmit most after the prioritization. RESULTS Across all simulation conditions and most real data sampling conditions, ProACT outperformed monitoring cluster growth for multiple metrics of prioritization efficacy. CONCLUSION The simple strategy used by ProACT improves the effectiveness of prioritization compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on monitoring the growth of transmission clusters defined based on genetic distance.","Moshiri, Niema; Smith, Davey M; Mirarab, Siavash",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394616/,167
155340,Outbreak of diarrhea among preweaning alpacas (Vicugna pacos) in the southern Peruvian highland.,2016,"BACKGROUND In patients undergoing hemipelvectomies including resection either of a portion of the pubis or the entire pubis from the symphysis to the lateral margin of the obturator foramen while sparing the hip (so-called Dunham Type III hemipelvectomies), reconstructions typically are not performed given the preserved continuity of the weightbearing axis and the potential complications associated with reconstruction. Allograft reconstruction of the pelvic ring may, however, offer benefits for soft tissue reconstruction of the pelvic floor and hip stability, but little is known about these reconstructions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) What is the postoperative functional status after allograft reconstruction of Type III pelvic defects? (2) What are the rates of hernia, infection, and hip instability? METHODS In this case series, we reviewed all patients with Type III pelvic resections (with or without anterior acetabular wall resections) who underwent allograft reconstruction between 2005 and 2013 at one center (N = 14). During the period in question, reconstruction was the general approach used in patients undergoing these resections; during that time, three other patients were treated without reconstruction as a result of either surgeon preference or the patient choosing to not have reconstruction after a discussion of the risks and benefits. Of the 14 patients treated with reconstruction, complete followup was available at a minimum of 1 year in 11 (other than those who died before the end of the first year; median, 19 months; range 16-70 months among those surviving), one was lost to followup before a year, and two others had partial telephone or email followup. Patient demographics, disease status, functional status, and complications were recorded. For a portion of the cohort (four patients) later in the series, we used a novel technique for anterior acetabular wall reconstruction using the concave cartilaginous surface of a proximal fibula allograft; the others received either a long bone (humerus or femur) or hemipelvis graft. Seven patients died of disease; two had local recurrence, and five died of metastatic disease. RESULTS All patients remained ambulatory Pain at 12 months after surgery was reported as none in five, mild in two, moderate in two, and severe in one. Operative complications included infection in two, symptomatic hernia in one, hip instability in one, dislocated total hip arthroplasty on the first postoperative day in one, and graft failure in one. CONCLUSIONS Allograft reconstruction after Type III pelvic resections can provide functional reconstruction of the pelvic ring, pelvic floor, and, in certain patients with partial anterior acetabular resections, the resected anterior acetabulum. This has implications in preventing the occurrence of hernia and hip instability in this patient population that is classically not reconstructed, although longer-term outcomes in a larger number of patients would help to better delineate this because infection, hernia, hip instability, and graft nonunion still remain concerns with this approach. The most important unanswered question remains whether, on balance, any benefits that may accrue to these patients as the result of reconstruction are offset by a relatively high likelihood of undergoing secondary or revision surgery.","Karim, S Mohammed; Colman, Matthew W; Lozano-Calderón, Santiago A; Raskin, Kevin A; Schwab, Joseph H; Hornicek, Francis J",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-014-4009-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25337979/,167

METHODS A structured questionnaire investigating different aspects of the lives and psychosocial well-being of PWE during the COVID-19 pandemic was developed. Persons with epilepsy were invited via social media to anonymously respond to a secure web-based online questionnaire (www.icpcovid.com). Responses were collected between July 26th and December 3rd, 2020. Hospital anxiety and depression scales (HADS) were used to screen respondents for depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A). RESULTS Responses of 407 PWE were included in the analysis; 304 (74.7%) respondents were female and 245 (60.2%) living in Europe, 157 (38.6%) in South America, and 5 (1.2%) in Canada. Seventy-six (18.7%) reported a decrease of income during the COVID-19 lockdown, and 122 (30.0%) experienced difficulties in obtaining anti-seizure medication (ASM), mostly (72/122, 59.0%) due to unavailability. Seizure frequency increased in 122 (30.0%); 295 (72.5%) screened positive for anxiety, and 159 (39.1%) for depression. Hundred eighty-eight (46.2%) reported reluctance to seek medical care; 27.3% believed that epilepsy was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 disease. Forty-six (74.2%) of 62 PWE who were followed up by telephone or video consult were satisfied with this consult. Fifty-five respondents, most (89.1%) of whom were from Europe, had also participated in a previous survey during the early months of the pandemic. In this subgroup, although there was no difference in prevalence of a positive screening for depression or anxiety, mean scores on HADS-A and HADS-D increased from 6.65 ± 3.99 to 7.27 ± 4.01 (p = 0.418), and from 5.84 ± 4.43 to 6.60 ± 4.45 (p = 0.371), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the psychosocial and somatic well-being of PWE. To minimize this impact, ensuring uninterrupted access to ASM is essential. Teleconsultations are valid alternatives for continued follow-up, but should include attention to psychosocial well-being. Persons with epilepsy should be more actively informed that epilepsy is not a risk factor for developing (more severe) COVID-19 disease.","Millevert, Charissa; Van Hees, Stijn; Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Wijtvliet, Veerle; Faria de Moura Villela, Edlaine; Rosso, Barbara; Gil-Nagel, Antonio; Weckhuysen, Sarah; Colebunders, Robert",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571838/,167

RESULTS A total of 112 reoperative hepatectomies were performed, of which 16 were combined with ablation. The proportion of patients treated with resection and ablation increased from 0% to 41%. Patients undergoing resection and ablation had a greater tumor burden (median, 4 vs. 1, p < 0.0001) and higher baseline clinical risk scores (median, 3 vs. 2, p = 0.065) than patients undergoing resection alone. Patients undergoing resection and ablation had lower intraoperative blood loss than patients undergoing resection alone (344 vs. 877 ml, p = 0.018). Five-year OS from the time of surgery was 48.6%.

CONCLUSION In patients with rCLM, the use of intraoperative ablation can extend the limits of surgical resection in patients with disease that might otherwise not be amenable to complete resection.","Govindarajan, Anand; Arnaoutakis, Dean; D'Angelica, Michael; Allen, Peter J; DeMatteo, Ronald P; Blumgart, Leslie H; Jarnagin, William R; Fong, Yuman",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1470-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21557021/,167
157556,Standardized 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Measurements in Parkinson's Disease Patients With COVID-19.,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE Few studies have examined the geometry of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy pathways. Here we examine the tortuosity and angulations of catheter pathways from the aortic arch to the termination of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and its association with thrombectomy performance. METHODS We included 100 consecutive anterior circulation large vessel occlusion thrombectomy patients over 12 months. Computed tomography angiograms (CTA) were used for 3D segmentation of catheter pathway from the aortic arch to ICA termination. Tortuosity index (TI) and angulations of the catheter pathway were measured in a semi-automated fashion. TI and angulation degree were compared between sides and correlated with age and procedural measures. RESULTS We analyzed 188 catheter pathways in 100 patients. Severe angulation (≤ 30°) was present in 5.8% and 39.4% of common carotid artery (CCA) and extracranial ICA segments, respectively. Five pathways (2.6%) had 360° loop. CCA and extracranial ICA tortuosity had a weak but significant correlation with age (r = 0.17, 0.21, p value = 0.05, 0.02 respectively), time from groin puncture to the site of occlusion (r = 0.29, 0.25, p values = 0.008, 0.026 respectively), and fluoroscopy time (r = 0.022, 0.31, p values = 0.016, 0.001 respectively). There was a significant difference in the pattern of angulation (p value = 0.04) and tortuosity between right and left side in CCA segment (TI = 0.20 ± 0.086 vs. 0.15 ± 0.82, p value < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS There was a significant difference in CCA angulation between right and left sides. TI of extracranial CCA and ICA correlated with age and influenced time from groin puncture to the occlusion site and total fluoroscopy time.","Mokin, Maxim; Waqas, Muhammad; Chin, Felix; Rai, Hamid; Senko, Jillian; Sparks, Adam; Ducharme, Richard W; Springer, Michael; Borlongan, Cesario V; Levy, Elad I; Ionita, Ciprian; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02525-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816090/,167

The aim of this study was to establish the safety and efficacy of barbed suture for intestinal sutures to close the gastrojejunal anastomosis in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass. STUDY DESIGN All consecutive patients undergoing gastric bypass were screened for enrollment in our study. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo knotless anastomosis with barbed suture (V-Loc™ 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) (case group) or knot-tying anastomosis with 3/0 polyglactin sutures (Polysorb(®); Covidien) (control group). The primary outcome was the time needed for the gastrojejunal anastomosis and the operative time. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of leak, bleeding, and stenosis and the evaluation of the cost of the different procedures evaluated. RESULTS Among the 60 consecutive patients enrolled in our study, 30 underwent knot-tying anastomosis, and 30 underwent knotless anastomosis. The time needed for the anastomosis was significantly less (P<.001) in the knotless group, whereas no significant differences were found between the two groups for operative time (P=.151). We recorded one leak in the control group and one leak in the case group (P=1.000). One bleeding in the case group (P=1.000) and no stenosis in either group was recorded. Finally, in our experience, the knotless anastomosis was cheaper than the knot-tying anastomosis (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS Our study appears to be encouraging to suggest the use of barbed suture for gastrointestinal anastomosis.","Milone, Marco; Di Minno, Matteo Nicola Dario; Galloro, Giuseppe; Maietta, Paola; Bianco, Paolo; Milone, Francesco; Musella, Mario",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

But how is age rationing different under outbreak circumstances than under normal circumstances, and what does this difference imply for ethical theories? This is the topic of this paper. The paper argues that outbreaks such as that of Covid-19 involve special circumstances that change how age should influence our prioritization decisions, and that while this shift in circumstances poses a problem for consequentialist views such as utilitarianism and age-weighted consequentialism, contractualism is better equipped to cope with it. The paper then offers a contractualist prudential account of age rationing under outbreak circumstances.","Nielsen, Lasse",Bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068025/,167
160234,"""Surgical Correction Of a Clivus Cerebrospinal Fluid Fistula: a technical report"".",2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND Cardiac arrhythmias in horses are diagnosed by auscultation or electrocardiogram (ECG), which results in a low sensitivity for detecting arrhythmias that occur sporadically. Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are small ECG devices placed subcutaneously, to automatically detect arrhythmias in human patients. OBJECTIVES To test ILRs ability to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in horses. Further, we hypothesised that anatomical location of the implant site might influence signal quality. Signal quality was evaluated both during exercise and over time. STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. METHODS In five Standardbred mares, eleven ILRs were implanted subcutaneously in up to three different positions (Front: pectoral region, Left-6: sixth left intercostal space, Ventral: xiphoid region) and AF induced. The R and T wave amplitudes were measured in all positions over time during AF. AF burden automatically registered by the ILRs over a 2-month period were compared with selected Holter ECG recordings. RESULTS All three positions had stable R and T wave amplitudes during the study period and were of sufficient quality to allow AF detection at rest. The position Left-6 showed significantly higher R and T wave amplitudes compared to the other positions. During submaximal exercise only the Left-6 position was able to record ECG signals of diagnostic quality. No position yielded diagnostic signals at maximum exercise due to artefacts. MAIN LIMITATIONS Few horses and ILRs included and no spontaneous AF episodes were studied. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study indicates that ILRs can be used for AF detection in horses, but the anatomical location is important for optimal ECG quality. Despite insufficient quality during exercise, ILRs were suitable for AF detection at rest. Therefore, the ILR may be a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting paroxysmal AF in horses.","Buhl, Rikke; Hesselkilde, Eva Melis; Carstensen, Helena; Fenner, Merle Frederike; Jespersen, Thomas; Tfelt-Hansen, Jacob; Sattler, Stefan Michael",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.13301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32506470/,167

The objective of this study was to describe treatment patterns and outcomes in non-transplant NDMM in four European countries. METHODS This retrospective chart review included adults with NDMM diagnosed between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013 (early cohort) or April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 (recent cohort). RESULTS Among 836 patients, molecular testing was performed in 21% and 35% patients of early vs. recent cohorts; proteasome inhibitor (PI)/alkylator combinations were the principal first-line (1L) therapy (39% vs. 43%). Use of immunomodulatory drug (IMID)/alkylator combinations declined from early to recent cohort (26% vs. 13%) but IMID (7% vs. 16%) use increased. Few patients (5%) received 1L maintenance therapy. Two-thirds of patients were treated with a fixed duration intent, with a median 7-month 1L DOT and progression-free survival (PFS) of 32.8 months in the early cohort. Both 1L DOT and PFS were longer with oral compared to injectable regimens. CONCLUSIONS Although frontline treatment patterns changed significantly, 1L DOT is short. The uptake of molecular testing and 1L maintenance is low.

It functions by adding carefully calibrated noise to data that blurs information about individuals while preserving overall statistics about the population. Theoretically, it is possible to produce robust privacy-preserving visualizations by plotting differentially private data. However, noise-induced data perturbations can alter visual patterns and impact the utility of a private visualization. We still know little about the challenges and opportunities for visual data exploration and analysis using private visualizations. As a first step towards filling this gap, we conducted a crowdsourced experiment, measuring participants' performance under three levels of privacy (high, low, non-private) for combinations of eight analysis tasks and four visualization types (bar chart, pie chart, line chart, scatter plot). Our findings show that for participants' accuracy for summary tasks (e.g., find clusters in data) was higher that value tasks (e.g., retrieve a certain value). We also found that under DP, pie chart and line chart offer similar or better accuracy than bar chart. In this work, we contribute the results of our empirical study, investigating the task-based effectiveness of basic private visualizations, a dichotomous model for defining and measuring user success in performing visual analysis tasks under DP, and a set of distribution metrics for tuning the injection to improve the utility of private visualizations.","Zhang, Dan; Sarvghad, Ali; Miklau, Gerome",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074813/,167

METHODS We analyzed data from patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical recanalization. Demographic and angiographic characteristics, initial apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) infarct volume, time-to-peak defect volume, revascularization grade, 24-48 h nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) infarct volume, symptom onset to recanalization time, diffusion-weighted imaging to recanalization time, and discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were compared between minimal and substantial infarct growth groups. Substantial infarct growth was defined as an increase of infarct volume >10 cm(3) assessed by subtracting initial ADC infarct core volume from infarct volume at 24-48 h CT. RESULTS Of 25 patients, 9 had minimal infarct growth (median 0 cm(3), interquartile range (IQR) -3 to 5 cm(3)) and 16 had substantial infarct growth (median 103 cm(3), IQR 48-132 cm(3)). Patients with minimal infarct growth had a median time from symptom onset to recanalization of 329 min (IQR 314-412 min) and a median time from imaging to recanalization of 231 min (IQR 198-309 min). On univariate analysis, minimal infarct growth was related to male gender (p = 0.04), smaller initial ADC volume (p = 0.04), higher recanalization grade (p < 0.001), and lower discharge NIHSS (p = 0.04) and mRS grades (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION There was no or minimal infarct core growth in at least one third of patients despite an exceptionally long median time from magnetic resonance imaging to recanalization of almost 4 h.","Finitsis, Stephanos; Kemmling, Andrea; Havemeister, Stephanie; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Brekenfeld, Caspar",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-014-1329-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468860/,167

Studies indicate that passwords have been subjected to various attacks, regardless of the applied protection mechanisms due to the human factor. The keystone for the adoption of more efficient authentication methods by the different markets is the trade-off between security and usability. To bridge the gap between user-friendly interfaces and advanced security features, the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) alliance defined several authentication protocols. Although FIDO's biometric-based authentication is not a novel concept, still daunts end users and developers, which may be a contributor factor obstructing FIDO's complete dominance of the digital authentication market. This paper traces the evolution of FIDO protocols, by identifying the technical characteristics and security requirements of the FIDO protocols throughout the different versions while providing a comprehensive study on the different markets (e.g., digital banking, social networks, e-government, etc.), applicability, ease of use, extensibility and future security considerations. From the analysis, we conclude that there is currently no dominant version of a FIDO protocol and more importantly, earlier FIDO protocols are still applicable to emerging vertical services.","Angelogianni, Anna; Politis, Ilias; Xenakis, Christos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00577v1.pdf,167

To comply with this constraint, governments are adopting restrictions over the minimum inter-personal distance between people. Given this actual scenario, it is crucial to massively measure the compliance to such physical constraint in our life, in order to figure out the reasons of the possible breaks of such distance limitations, and understand if this implies a potential threat. To this end, we introduce the Visual Social Distancing (VSD) problem, defined as the automatic estimation of the inter-personal distance from an image, and the characterization of related people aggregations. VSD is pivotal for a non-invasive analysis to whether people comply with the SD restriction, and to provide statistics about the level of safety of specific areas whenever this constraint is violated. We first point out that measuring VSD is not only a geometrical problem, but it also implies a deeper understanding of the social behaviour in the scene. The aim is to truly detect potentially dangerous situations while avoiding false alarms (e.g., a family with children or relatives, an elder with their caregivers), all of this by complying with current privacy policies. We then discuss how VSD relates with previous literature in Social Signal Processing and indicate a path to research new Computer Vision methods that can possibly provide a solution to such problem. We conclude with future challenges related to the effectiveness of VSD systems, ethical implications and future application scenarios.","Cristani, M.; Del Bue, A.; Murino, V.; Setti, F.; Vinciarelli, A.",Ieee Access,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3008370,167

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has recently emerged as a great health challenge. The novel corona virus may affect the kidneys mainly as acute kidney injury (AKI). Also, the outcome of COVID-19 may be different in patients with underlying kidney disease. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of COVID-19 in patients with and without underlying kidney disease. Methods. This was a retrospective study on 659 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in six centers of Iran. Patients were classified into kidney (chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or kidney transplantation) and non-kidney groups. The clinical conditions and laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Outcome was defined as death during hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge. Results. Among 659 COVID-19 patients (mean age: 60.7 +or- 16.4, 56% male), 208 were in the kidney group (86 ESKD, 35 kidney transplants, and 87 CKD patients). AKI occurred in 41.8%. Incidence of AKI was 34.7% in non-kidney, 74.7% in CKD, and 51.4% in kidney transplant patients (P < .001). Totally 178 patients (27%) died and mortality rate was significantly higher in CKD patients (50.6 vs. 23.4%, P < .001). AKI was associated with increased mortality rate (OR = 2.588, CI: 1.707 to 3.925). Initial glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 44.2 mL/min and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) had significant association with mortality. Conclusion. We showed a higher mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with AKI and CKD.

165191,"Potential nanoparticle applications for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19",2020,"Background Improvement of paediatric healthcare is hampered by inefficient processes of generating new evidence. Clinical research often requires extra encounters with patients, is costly, takes place in an artificial situation with a biased selection of patients, and entails long delays until new evidence is implemented into health care. Electronic health records (EHR) contain detailed information on real patients and cover the entirety of patients. However, the use of EHR for research is limited because they are not standardized between hospitals. This leads to disproportionate amounts of work for extracting data of interest and frequently data are incomplete and of poor quality. Aims SwissPedData aims to lay the foundation for a paediatric learning health system in Switzerland by facilitating EHR-based research. In this project, we aimed to assess the way routine clinical data are currently recorded in large paediatric clinics in Switzerland and to develop a national EHR-based common data model (CDM) that covers all processes of routine paediatric care in hospitals. Methods A taskforce of paediatricians from large Swiss children's hospitals reviewed the current status of routine data documentation in paediatric clinical care and the extent of digitalization. We then used a modified Delphi method to reach a broad consensus on a national EHR-based CDM. Results All Swiss children's hospitals use EHR to document some or all aspects of care. 119 paediatricians, representing eight hospitals and all paediatric subspecialties, participated in an extended Delphi process to create SwissPedData. The group agreed on a national CDM that comprises a main module with general paediatric data and sub-modules relevant to paediatric subspecialties. The data dictionary includes 336 common data elements (CDEs): 76 in the main module on general paediatrics and between 11 and 59 CDEs per subspecialty module. Among these, 266 were classified as mandatory, 52 as recommended and 18 as optional. Conclusion SwissPedData is a CDM for information to be collected in EHR of Swiss children's hospitals. It covers all care processes including clinical and paraclinical assessment, diagnosis, treatment, disposition and care site. All participating hospitals agreed to implement SwissPedData in their clinical routine and clinic information systems. This will pave the way for a national paediatric learning health system in Switzerland that enables fast and efficient answers to urgent clinical questions by facilitating high-quality nationwide retrospective and prospective observational studies and recruitment of patients for nested prospective studies and clinical trials.","Jaboyedoff, M.; Rakic, M.; Bachmann, S.; Berger, C.; Diezi, M.; Fuchs, O.; Frey, U.; Gervaix, A.; Glucksberg, A.

166040,Research Process Development Mitigates Effect of COVID-19 on Stroke Trial Enrollment,2021,"Background: Patients with sensory peripheral neuropathy (PN) commonly present with gait and balance problems increasing their risk of falls. The multi-site walk2Wellness trial investigates effects of long-term, home-based daily use of a wearable lower limb sensory neuroprosthesis on gait function, balance, quality of life and fall rates in a cohort of PN patients. The device (Walkasins(R), RxFunction Inc., MN, USA) is designed to replace lost nerve function related to foot pressure sensation by providing directional tactile cues around the ankle reflecting foot pressure measurements during standing and walking activities. We hypothesized that previously shown short-term in-clinic improvements in gait and balance would be sustained after 10 weeks of use. Methods: Participants had a PN diagnosis with loss of plantar sensation associated with gait and balance problems, a Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) score <23 (cut-off for high fall risk), and ability to sense Leg Unit tactile stimuli. Clinical outcomes included FGA, Gait Speed, Timed Up&Go (TUG) and Four-Stage Balance Test. Patient-reported outcomes included Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale (VADL), PROMIS participation and satisfaction scores, pain rating, and falls. Evaluations were performed at baseline visit and after 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Subjects were not made aware of any changes in outcomes and no additional balance interventions were allowed. Results: Forty-five participants of 52 enrolled across four sites completed all in-clinic assessments. FGA scores improved from 15.0 at baseline to 19.1 at 10 weeks (p<0.000001), normal and fast gait speed from 0.86m/s to 0.95m/s (p<0.00005) and 1.24m/s to 1.33m/s (p<0.002), respectively, and TUG from 13.8s to 12.5s (p<0.012). Four-Stage Balance Test did not improve significantly. Several patient-reported outcomes were in normal range at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Interestingly, while FGA scores improved similarly across the baseline range, subjects with baseline ABC scores lower than 67% (cut-off for high fall risk) showed an increase in their ABC scores (from 49.9% to 59.3%, p<0.01), whereas subjects with baseline ABC scores above 67% showed a decrease (from 76.6% to 71.8%, p<0.019). Subjects who reported falls in the prior six months (n=25) showed a decrease in the number of fall-risk factors (from 5.1 to 4.3, p<0.023) as well as a decrease in fall rate from 13.8 to 7.4 falls/1000 days (p<0.014). Four subjects in the pre-study non-faller group (n=20) fell during the 10 weeks of the study. Conclusion: A wearable sensory neuroprosthesis may provide a new way to treat gait and balance problems and manage falls in high fall-risk patients with PN.

This situational information is valuable for public authorities. Therefore, this study characterized the propagation scale of situational information types by harnessing the power of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. We observed that the length of the post has a positive correlation with type 1 information (announcements), and negative words were mostly used in type 5 information (criticizing the government), whereas anxiety-related words have a negative effect on the amount of retweeted type 0 (precautions) and type 2 (donations) information. This type of research study not only contributes to the situational information literature by comprehensively defining categories but also provides data-oriented practical insights into information so that management authorities can formulate response strategies after the pandemic. Our approach is one of its kind and combines Twitter content features, user features and LIWC linguistic features with machine learning algorithms to analyze the propagation scale of situational information, and it achieved 77% accuracy with SVM while classifying the information categories.","Wahid, Junaid Abdul Shi Lei Gao Yufei Yang Bei Tao Yongcai Wei Lin Hussain Shabir",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11146526,167

Inductions to these new placements can vary in delivery and effectiveness. High quality induction is a recommendation of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges for safe trainee changeover.To improve the induction process for Foundation Year 2 doctors (FY2s) in community placements at Epsom and St Helier Trust.A survey of 10 questions, devised from the British Medical Association guidance on adequate induction, was circulated to FY2 doctors(n=10) in community placements (GP and Psychiatry) between 4th August - 4th December 2019. Induction booklets individualised to each placement were created by outgoing FY2s, then circulated to the incoming FY2 prior to rotation.This aimed to enhance induction allowing for standardised peer to peer handover alongside local induction. Effectiveness of the intervention was assessed by repeating the initial survey during the second rotation December 2019-April 2020(n=8).Good engagement with the intervention resulted in creation of 8 individualised ‘induction booklets’ with mixed effectiveness. An improvement in preparedness was demonstrated for psychiatry placements but limited improvement in preparedness in GP placements. For psychiatry placements, improvements were demonstrated in trainees’ awareness of supervisor contact details, timetables and annual leave arrangements. In all placements, gaps remained in confidence in IT and referral processes.Induction booklets were effective in improving induction in community placements. However, its dependence on successful delivery of face to face local induction is significantly variable between placements. Limitations included small sample size, pause of rotation due to COVID-19 preventing a third cycle of audit and trainees engagement with induction booklets. Further improvements to include standardisation of local induction by developing a checklist of induction information.","Perera, H.

169182,A Time for Clinical Transformation: Emerging Implications From COVID-19 for Athlete Transition Research and Clinical Practice,2021,A key step in the cellular adaptive immune response is the presentation of antigen to T cells. During this process short peptides processed from self or foreign proteins may be presented on the surface bound to MHC molecules for binding to T cell receptors. Those that bind and activate an immune response are called epitopes. Computational prediction of T cell epitopes has many applications in vaccine design and immuno-diagnostics. This is the basis of immunoinformatics which allows in silico screening of peptides before experiments are performed. The most effective approach is to estimate the binding affinity of a given peptide fragment to MHC class I or II molecules. With the availability of whole genomes for many microbial species it is now feasible to computationally screen whole proteomes for candidate peptides. epitopepredict is a programmatic framework and command line tool designed to aid this process. It provides access to multiple binding prediction algorithms under a single interface and scales for whole genomes using multiple target MHC alleles.

170592,Beyond electives: Rethinking training in global neurology,2021,"Ihe ubiquity ofBlack death—specifically, the intense decade-long viral stream of trigger- happy police—confirms that, whether the 1930s Or the 2000s, it's always hunting season. The spring of 2020 started just like its summer, with a lynching. First was the lynching of William Green in January, then Ahmaud Arbery's in February, then Breonna Taylor's in March. From March on, those of us blessed enough to shelter without harm sat seized by video after image after report of contemporary lynching. Trauma has a way of disturbing normative notions of time, but I trust my difficulty in distinguishing the last ten years from a past supposedly passed has more to do with the repetition of spectacular displays of antiblackness than with my survival of a murderous inheritance. Watts' remembrance of a time not unlike now, a time composed of the same accumulating weight of Black death, affirms that my difficulty to register a difference between then and now is a con- sequence of a ""monstrous genre"" and its twenty-first-century intensification. In his review of Lynching, Eric King Watts warns that the seductive power of Amer- ica's postracial mythos is the belief that leveraging race for progressive purposes results in something Other than more of the same. His contention that postraciality doesn't signal the transcendence or termination of race, but rather its intensification and revision, is one that I share. Projects like The Guardian's ""The Counted"" and the Washington Post's ""Fatal Force,"" which produce records of antiblack violence similar to those pro- duced by 1930s Black periodicals like the Chicago Defender and Crisis offer one example of this refinement. The assertion of justice by an administration that takes sat- isfaction in cruelties such as family separation and the detention of children, weaponizing COVID-19, prohibiting equity programing and training, and marking the adminis- tration's final days with a killing spree are additional examples of what Watts describes as a refined intensification. His meditation On the dual relation of ""enjoyment and [racist] terror"" resonates with Kiese Laymon's warnings about ""the worst of white folks"" 2, namely, those who take satisfaction in domination while simultaneously ""harboring a warped innocence"" that absolves them of responsibility. We saw this in the case of Chris- tian Cooper, the birdwatcher and Amy Cooper, the woman virally knowing as ""Central Park Karen."" Amy's conscious choice to issue not one but two false reports against Chris- tian in retaliation for his request that she observe the law and curb her dog while in the park, suggests that what would have satisfied her most was to remind Christian Cooper that she, at any moment she pleased, was entitled to his life. Weaponizing white woman- hood for the sheer satisfaction of revenge and for the gratification that racialized terror induces observes Watt's contention that the excess of Black death is steeped in pleasure.","Ore, Ersula J.",The Quarterly Journal of Speech,https://doi.org/10.1080/00335630.2021.1915458,167
170594,"An open-label, exploratory documentation of proving-symptoms of CVN01 (Coronavirus nosode from the clinical sample) in healthy volunteers",2021,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) pandemic is a global health problem. Beside the specific pathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, a deleterious aberrant non-effective host immune response plays an important role especially in severe forms of COVID-19. There is intense investigation to explore the utility of immunomodulatory drugs commonly used in the Rheumatology arena as agents that may mitigate against COVID-19 to improve disease prognosis. Rheumatologists are used to the utilization of these immune targeted therapies. Objectives: To summarize the available information on the use of immunomodulatory agents in severe COVID-19. Methods: As part of a EULAR taskforce, a systematic literature search was conducted from January 2019 up to December 11, 2020. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the PICO framework P (population): patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection;I (intervention): any immunomodulator agent/strategy;C (comparator): any comparator;O (outcome) any clinical outcome including but not limited to mortality, admission to intensive care unit and clinical improvement. Data on efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory agents utilized therapeutically in SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage were extracted. The risk of bias was assessed using validated tools. Results: Of 60372 records, 401 articles were eligible for inclusion. Studies were at variable risk of bias. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were available for the following drugs: hydroxychloroquine (N=12), glucocorticoids (N=6), tocilizumab (N= 4), convalescent plasma (N=4), interferon beta (N=2), IVIg (N=2) and N=1 each for anakinra, baricitinib, colchicine, leflunomide, ruxolitinib, interferon kappa, and vilobelimab. For glucocorticoids, dexamethasone reduced mortality only in patients requiring respiratory support;while methylprednisolone reduced mortality in patients aged 60 years or over. Data from RCTs on tocilizumab are conflicting and definite conclusions cannot be drawn at this point in time, but recent studies suggest possible benefit in patients requiring respiratory support. Hydroxychloroquine was not beneficial at any disease stage, one RCT with anakinra was negative, one RCT with baricitinib+remdesivir was positive, and individual trials testing some other compounds provided interesting, albeit preliminary, results. Conclusion: Although there is emerging evidence about immunomodulatory therapies for the management of COVID-19, conclusive data is scarce with some conflicting data. Since glucocorticoids seem to improve survival in some subsets of patients, RCTs comparing glucocorticoids alone versus glucocorticoids plus anti-cytokine/immunomodulatory treatment are warranted. This SLR informed the initiative to formulate EULAR points to consider on pathophysiology and use of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.","Alunno, A.; Najm, A.; Mariette, X.; Emmel, J.; Mason, L.; De Marco, G.; McGonagle, D.; Machado, P.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3367,167

Vaccine candidates relying on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been the focus of our development program. In this paper, we report on the generation of the RBD203-N1 yeast expression construct, which produces a recombinant protein that when formulated with alum and the TLR-9 agonist, CpG1826 elicits a robust immune response and protection in mice. Method The RBD203-N1 antigen was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris X33. After fermentation at the 5 L scale, the protein was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was characterized biophysically and biochemically, and after its formulation, the immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated in mice. Results, Conclusions, and Significance The RBD203-N1 production process yielded 492.9 ± 3.0 mg/L of protein in the fermentation supernatant. A two-step purification process produced a >96% pure protein with a recovery rate of 55 ± 3% (total yield of purified protein: 270.5 ± 13.2 mg/L fermentation supernatant). The protein was characterized as a homogeneous monomer with well-defined secondary structure, thermally stable, antigenic, and when adjuvanted on alum and CpG, it was immunogenic and induced robust levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These characteristics show that this vaccine candidate is well suited for technology transfer with feasibility of its transition into the clinic to evaluate its immunogenicity and safety in humans.","Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Pollet, Jeroen; Strych, Ulrich; Lee, Jungsoon; Liu, Zhuyun; Kundu, Rakhi Tyagi; Versteeg, Leroy; Villar, Maria Jose; Adhikari, Rakesh; Wei, Junfei; Poveda, Cristina; Keegan, Brian; Bailey, Aaron Oakley; Chen, Yi-Lin; Gillespie, Portia M.; Kimata, Jason T.; Zhan, Bin; Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.24.457518,167

Objectives We sought to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lung microvascular regeneration in acute lung injury induced by lung endothelial cell ablation. Methods Transgenic mice were created expressing endothelial-targeted human diphtheria toxin receptor. Changes in lung cell populations and gene expression profiles were determined using single-cell RNA sequencing of dissociated lung cells (10x Genomics) at baseline (day 0) and days 3, 5 and 7 days after lung endothelial cell ablation. Measurements and Main Results Intratracheal instillation of diphtheria toxin resulted in ablation of ∼70% of lung endothelial cells, producing severe acute lung injury, with complete resolution by 7 days. Single cell analysis revealed 8 distinct endothelial cell clusters, including type-A capillary endothelial cells which were characterized by the unique expression of apelin at baseline. Diphtheria toxin-induced ablation resulted in the emergence of novel stem-like endothelial cells in the transitional ‘general’ capillary type-B endothelial population at day 3, characterized by the de novo expression of apelin. This was followed by the appearance of proliferative endothelial cells at day 5 expressing apelin receptor and Forkhead box M1 which were responsible for replenishment of all depleted endothelial cell populations. Treatment with an apelin receptor antagonist prevented recovery post DT resulting in excessive mortality. Conclusions Targeted endothelial cell ablation revealed a remarkable regenerative capacity of the lung microvasculature orchestrated by newly emergent apelin-expressing endothelial stem-like cells primed for endothelial repair.","Godoy, Rafael Soares; Cook, David P; Cober, Nicholas D; Deng, Yupu; Wang, Liyuan; Chakravarti, Ananya; Rowe, Katelynn; Stewart, Duncan J",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452061,167

Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19. Results Out of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and lower red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p<0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed that CRP remained robust accuracy in adverse outcome prediction in patients with different disease severity (AUC 0.832, z=10.23, p<0.001; AUC 0.989, z=44.04, p<0.001). CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p<0.001). Conclusions In patients with COVID-19, admission CRP correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","Luo, Xiaomin; Zhou, Wei; Yan, Xiaojie; Guo, Tangxi; Wang, Benchao; Xia, Hongxia; Ye, Lu; Xiong, Jun; Jiang, Zongping; Liu, Yu; Zhang, Bicheng; Yang, Weize",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040360,167

The need for reliable pro-arrhythmic predictors became relevant during early phases of the SarsCoV2 pandemic, when it was uncertain whether the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) could be more harmful than beneficial due to their reported pro-arrhythmic effects. In this work we describe a computational framework that employs a gender-specific, in-silico cardiac population to assess cardiac drug-induced QT-prolongation after the administration of a single or a combination of potentially cardiotoxic drugs as HCQ and AZM. This novel computational methodology is capable of reproducing the complex behavior of the clinical electrocardiographic response to drug-induced arrhythmic risk, in-silico. Using high performance computing, the computational framework allows the estimation of the arrhythmic risk in a population, given a variety of doses of one or more drugs in a timely manner and providing markers that can be directly related to the clinical scenario. The pro-arrhythmic behavior observed in subjects within the in-silico trial, was also compared to supplemental in-vitro experiments on a reanimated swine hearts. Evidence of transmurally heterogeneous action potential prolongation after the administration of a large dose of HCQ was an observed mechanism of arrhythmia, both in the in-vitro and the in-silico model. The virtual clinical trial also provided remarkably similar results to recent published clinical data. In conclusion, the in-silico clinical trial on the cardiac population is capable of reproducing and providing evidence of the normal phenotype variants that produce distinct arrhythmogenic outcomes after the administration of one or various drugs.","Aguado-Sierra, J.; Butakoff, C.; Brigham, R.; Baron, A.; Houzeaux, G.; Guerra, J.

We consider those narratives as community resilience builders, accounting for municipalities? educational strategies that enhanced locally anchored responses. If those actions represent an opportunity for local-governing new protagonism, they also generate a footprint for encouraging transformative resilience grounded in situated literacies and new educational audiences.

Characterising the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying which individuals and regions might be most at risk. As data from detailed contact tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we combined age, location, genotype, and onset date of cases in order to probabilistically reconstruct the importation status and transmission clusters within a newly developed R package called o2geosocial. We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through detailed contact-tracing in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation status before running the model. Spatial heterogeneity in vaccine coverage is difficult to measure directly. Our approach was able to highlight areas with potential for local transmission using a minimal number of variables and could be applied to assess the intensity of ongoing transmission in a region.","Robert, Alexis; Kucharski, Adam J; Gastañaduy, Paul A; Paul, Prabasaj; Funk, Sebastian",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20020891,167

Our objective is to develop and validate quantitative survey instruments to measure women's empowerment in relation to sanitation in urban areas of low- and middle-income countries. Methods and analysis: We are developing the Agency, Resources, and Institutional Structures for Sanitation-related Empowerment (ARISE) scales through a process that involves three phases: item development; scale development and initial validation; and scale evaluation and further validation. The first phase includes domain specification, item generation, face validity and content validity assessment, and item refinement. The second phase involves a second round of face validity and content validity assessment, followed by survey implementation in two cities (Tiruchirappalli, India and Kampala, Uganda) and data analysis involving factor analysis and item response theory approaches, as well as reliability and validity testing. The third phase involves a final round of face validity and content validity assessment, followed by survey implementation in three additional cities (Narsapur and Warangal, India; and Lusaka, Zambia) and statistical analysis using similar approaches as in Phase 2 for further validation.

Although the pre-trained model can conduct sentiment analysis since the beginning of a pandemic or a global emergency, this model is not optimized for a specific topic. Furthermore, the way people express opinions on the topic may quickly change during the emergency. Therefore, the early-trained model may not work consistently well during the emergency. Unfortunately, the late-trained model will not be available until months after the emergency begins. In this paper, we propose an ensemble method to combine the pre-trained model and early-trained model for achieving better analysis performance on COVID-19-related tweets.

We first conduct an event study to measure the global stock markets’ reaction to government announcements of lockdown and reopening, which is measured by each stock market's cumulative abnormal return. We then employ regression analysis to investigate the relationship between generalised social trust and the stock markets’ reaction to government announcements of lockdown and reopening. The results show that government announcement of lockdown had a significant negative influence on most of the stock markets, whereas the magnitude of the stock markets’ reaction to government announcement of reopening is relatively marginal, indicating a possible negative bias. Moreover, we find that generalised social trust is positively related to the stock markets’ reaction to government announcement of lockdown and negatively related to the stock markets’ reaction to government announcement of reopening.","Xie, Lijuan Wang Mei Huynh Toan Luu Duc",Finance Research Letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102361,167

Some of these new variants have been of health public concern due to their higher infectiousness. We propose a theoretical mathematical model based on differential equations to study the effect of introducing a new, more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population. The mathematical model is formulated in such a way that it takes into account the higher transmission rate of the new SARS-CoV-2 strain and the subpopulation of asymptomatic carriers. We find the basic reproduction number R0 using the method of the next generation matrix. This threshold parameter is crucial since it indicates what parameters play an important role in the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic. We study the local stability of the infection-free and endemic equilibrium states, which are potential outcomes of a pandemic. Moreover, by using a suitable Lyapunov functional and the LaSalle invariant principle, it is proved that if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Our study shows that the new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant will prevail and the prevalence of the preexistent variant would decrease and eventually disappear. We perform numerical simulations to support the analytic results and to show some effects of a new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population.","Gonzalez-Parra, Gilberto Arenas Abraham J.",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9131564,167

One main category of 4D printing research is 4D printed thermal Shape Memory Polymer (SMP). Its morphing process has large time delay, is nonlinear time variant, and susceptible to unpredictable disturbances. Reaching an arbitrary position with high precision is an active research question. This paper applies the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to develop an optimal control method to perform closed loop control of the SMP actuation. Precise and prompt shape morphing is achieved compared with previous control methods using a PI controller. The training efforts of RL are further reduced by simplifying the optimal control policy using the structural property of the prior trained results.

Our COVID-19 cohort (n=9531), retrieved from a single representative cross-sectional virology test center in Lebanon, revealed that low daily mean Ct values are followed by an increase in the number of national positive COVID-19 cases. A subset of the data was used to develop a deep neural network model, tune its hyperparameters, and optimize the weights for minimal mean square error of prediction. The final model s accuracy is reported by comparing its predictions with an unseen dataset. Our model was the first to capture the interaction of the previously reported Ct values with the upcoming number of COVID-19 cases and any temporal effects that arise from population dynamics. Our model was deployed as a publicly available and easy-to-use estimator to facilitate prospective validation. Our model has potential application in predicting COVID-19 incidences in other countries and in assessing post-vaccination policies.

Nowadays, this also includes digital innovations from complex epidemiological models, AI, to open data platforms for prevention, diagnostic and treatment. Amongst the many challenges during a pandemic, innovation and manufacturing stakeholders find themselves engaged in new relationships, and are likely to face intellectual property (IP) related challenges. This paper adopts an IP perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic to identify pandemic related IP considerations and IP challenges. The focus is on challenges related to research, development and urgent upscaling of capacity to manufacture CC-Products in the huge volumes suddenly in demand. Its purpose is to provide a structure for steering clear of IP challenges to avoid delays in fighting a pandemic. We identify 4 stakeholder groups concerned with IP challenges: (i) governments, (ii) organisations owning existing Crisis-Critical IP, described as incumbents in Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), (iii) manufacturing firms from other sectors normally not producing CC-Products suddenly rushing into CC-Sectors to support the manufacturing of CC-Products (new entrants), and (iv) voluntary grassroot initiatives that are formed during a pandemic. This paper discusses IP challenges related to the development and manufacturing of technologies and products for (i) prevention (of spread), (ii) diagnosis of infected patients and (iii) the development of treatments.

The investigation is carried out by secondary data collection and a systematic review of the literature. For the legislative factor, different government statutes, policies, and programs are critically reviewed. For the geographical and climatic factor, the conditions of New Zealand are compared with those of Italy and Japan. For the energy efficiency technological factor, the existing top-rated Green Buildings in the country are analyzed, and the most recurring energy efficient features are discussed. For the renewable energy generation and distribution technological factor, various potential options for on-site and off-site building power sources are discussed, as well as energy storage systems and load matching and grid interaction. For the economic factor, the cost and payoffs of NZEBs are investigated, including the different investment schemes available for potential NZEB developers and how constructing NZEBs can still be feasible post-COVID-19. The study found that New Zealand's climate is suitable for NZEBs and the required technology and economic resources are available. However, more focused and intentional legislations and policies are required to both encourage and incentivize the wider adoption of the NZEB concept in the country.","Cielo, Daryl Subiantoro Alison",Journal of Building Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102970,167

By inoculation from the apical or basolateral side both TGEV and MHV-A59 were found to enter the polarized cells only through the apical membrane. The release of newly synthesized TGEV from LLC-PK1 cells occurred preferentially from the apical plasma membrane domain, as evidenced by the accumulation of viral proteins and infectivity in the apical culture fluid. In contrast, MHV was released preferentially from the basolateral membrane of mTAL cells. The apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV may explain the in vivo establishment of a local and systemic infection, respectively.","Rossen, J W; Bekker, C P; Voorhout, W F; Horzinek, M C; Van der Ende, A; Strous, G J; Rottier, P J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830469/,167

In their calves, BHV-1 was the least seroprevalent, independent of the vaccination status. The serological status and antibody titers in calves were generally associated with those of the dam. The occurrence of respiratory diseases in the calves was associated with cow and calf serological profiles (BHV-1, BRSV and BCV in the nonvaccinated group, BHV-1, BVDV and BCV in the vaccinated group). The occurrence of diarrhea was not associated with cow and calf serological profiles but was negatively associated with high level calf serum IgG in the nonvaccinated group (odds ratio = 0.73). Bovine coronavirus and BRV were shed by 1.4% and 4.9% of calves in the nonvaccinated group, and by 0% and 9.9% of calves in the vaccinated group, respectively. Bovine rotavirus shedding was associated with fecal diarrheic consistency at the moment of fecal sampling but not with previous occurrence of diarrhea.","Ganaba, R; Bélanger, D; Dea, S; Bigras-Poulin, M",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7704839/,167
189231,"Environmental factors and seasonal influenza onset in Okayama city, Japan: case-crossover study.",2011,"Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is responsible for enteric disease in pups. Infected dogs generally have a rapid recovery, so the virus is highly contagious and the spread of infection is difficult to control. Chemical disinfectants have been widely used in human disease-control programmes to prevent viral infectious diseases from spreading, but to date, there are no studies in the literature on the sensitivity of CCoV to chemical biocides. The present study investigated the sensitivity of CCoV to disinfectants currently used for prophylaxis in kennel and dog breeding locations. The effects of three agents: alkyl-dimethyl-benzyl-ammonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride and didecyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride, on the infectivity titre of CCoV in A72 cell lines, were studied at different concentrations. Although they may regard a small number of agents, the findings showed that the sensitivity of CCoV to disinfectants varies and the differences are dose correlated. In general, virus inactivation implies a permanent loss of infectivity which can be evaluated in suspensions and hand disinfection tests.","Pratelli, A",Zoonoses and public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18035977/,167
189586,Bibliography. Current world literature.,1999,"This review article is a continuation of the paper ""Hepatitis B core particles as a universal display model: a structure-function basis for development"" written by Pumpens P. and Grens E., ordered by Professor Lev Kisselev and published in FEBS Letters, 1999, 442, 1-6. The past 17 years have strengthened the paper's finding that the human hepatitis B virus core protein, along with other Hepadnaviridae family member core proteins, is a mysterious, multifunctional protein. The core gene of the Hepadnaviridae genome encodes five partially collinear proteins. The most important of these is the HBV core protein p21, or HBc. It can self-assemble by forming viral HBc particles, but also plays a crucial role in the regulation of viral replication. Since 1986, the HBc protein has been one of the first and the most successful tools of the virus-like particle (VLP) technology. Later, the woodchuck hepatitis virus core protein (WHc) was also used as a VLP carrier. The Hepadnaviridae core proteins remain favourite VLP candidates for the knowledge-based design of future vaccines, gene therapy vectors, specifically targeted nanocontainers, and other modern nanotechnological tools for prospective medical use.","Pumpens, P; Grens, E",Molekuliarnaia biologiia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27668597/,167

METHODS This single center retrospective descriptive study was done at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad from January 1994 to January 2003. All patients who presented with diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss and anemia and who proved to have partial villous atrophy on intestinal biopsy and had responded to treatment with antibiotic and folic acid,were included in this review. RESULTS A total of 42 patients were encountered during these years. There were 31 (74.0%) males and 11 (26%) females. The age ranged from 17-66 years. All patients presented with diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia and had megaloblastic anemia. In all patients, a distal duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy. All were treated with tetracycline 1 g per day and folic acid 5 mg per day and responded to treatment within 4 weeks. Total treatment lasted 3 months and resulted in complete resolution of symptoms and gain of weight. The follow up lasted for a mean of 5 years and no relapses were noted. CONCLUSION Tropical sprue presents with diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, and megaloblastic anemia. The partial villous atrophy has been a constant finding.

We studied pancreatic injury (serum amylase and serum lipase levels) in COVID-19 patients. Methods A retrospective study involving 42 COVID-19 patients (diagnosed by real-time PCR) admitted to a tertiary care hospital was conducted. Serum amylase and serum lipase levels were analysed in relation to severity of COVID-19 and mortality. Results Mean age of patients was 50 ± 16 years, with male to female ratio of 3.7:1. Serum amylase was elevated in 14 patients (33%). Serum lipase was elevated in 7 out of 29 patients (24.1%). Mortality was seen in 18 patients (42.8%). Serum amylase or lipase did not correlate with severity of COVID-19 or its mortality. However, both patients who had high lipase (>3times) died. Conclusion The prevalence of hyperamylasemia in patients of COVID-19 was 33%, while that of elevated lipase was 24.1%.

192797,Chimeric antigen receptor macrophages for breast cancer: An emerging treatment modality.,2020,"Diagnostic approaches to COVID-19 include clinical history, PCR tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and detection of antibodies. By combining these three approaches, the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be examined in healthcare teams. The aim of the study was to examine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population of healthcare professionals 6 - 8 weeks after the first COVID-19 case was detected in the Czech Republic. A total of 269 subjects were enrolled in the study (187 women, 82 men) with a median age of 45.9 years (21 - 71 years). We used a questionnaire to ascertain travel history and clinical signs of any respiratory tract infection. Blood samples were collected, and IgG levels were analysed in all samples. The level of IgA antibodies was analysed in those positive for IgG. PCR testing was performed in cases testing positive for presence of antibodies. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test system for SARS-CoV-2 from Euroimmun (Germany) was used to analyse immunoglobulin levels. 17 % of the tested cohort reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and 35.8 % reported history of international travel. There were 5 subjects positive IgG cases (of 269; 1.85 %), and one IgA positive and IgG borderline positive subject (0.37 %). There was only one PCR positive subject. Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were thus detected in 2.22% of participating health professionals. This article shows the pitfalls of the testing methods and highlights the necessity of using a correct testing algorithm, considering the character of the tested population and the expected low prevalence.","Krátká, Zuzana; Luxová, Štěpánka; Malíčková, Karin; Fürst, Tomáš; Šimková, Halina",Casopis lekaru ceskych,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434339/,167

193516,The Role of Synovial Cytokines in the Diagnosis of Periprosthetic Joint Infections: Current Concepts.,2017,"BACKGROUND Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired cardiac disease and acute vasculitis in children, targets the coronary arteries, and can occasionally be fatal. The pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. After injection of Lactobacillus casei cell-wall extract (LCCWE), mice develop a focal coronary arteritis that histopathologically resembles Kawasaki disease, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) through their key downstream adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is required for the cellular activation and coronary arteritis produced by LCCWE. METHODS AND RESULTS Bone marrow-derived macrophages from TLR2- or MyD88-deficient mice were unresponsive to LCCWE-induced stimulation. In contrast, macrophages obtained from TLR4-deficient mice produced the same amount of interleukin-6 as macrophages from wild-type mice after stimulation with LCCWE. Intraperitoneal injection of LCCWE produced severe focal coronary arteritis in TLR4(-/-) and C57BL/6 control mice but not in TLR2(-/-) or MyD88(-/-) mice. Collectively, these results indicate that LCCWE is a potent inducer of nuclear factor-kappaB via TLR2 but not TLR4 and that this activation proceeds via the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. In vivo studies suggest that TLR2(-/-) mice are protected from LCCWE-induced coronary arteritis and that this protection is mediated through the adaptor molecule MyD88. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide important insights into the molecular signaling in this mouse model of coronary arteritis. We show here that LCCWE-induced coronary arteritis is dependent on intact TLR2 and MyD88 signaling.","Rosenkranz, Margalit E; Schulte, Danica J; Agle, Lucila M A; Wong, Michelle H; Zhang, Wenxuan; Ivashkiv, Lionel; Doherty, Terence M; Fishbein, Michael C; Lehman, Thomas J A; Michelsen, Kathrin S; Arditi, Moshe",Circulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16275884/,167

This resulted in the creation of the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI), a comprehensive framework of applications and resources designed to fill critical gaps in Canada's national public health infostructure. Over the past four years, the CNPHI has evolved into Canada's only pan-Canadian public health information management system. With over 2000 registered users, the current CNPHI environment consists of more than 30 integrated applications and systems that can be loosely categorized into four functional groups: data exchange; data analysis and integration; communication, collaboration and coordination; and knowledge management. Despite poor data repositories, legacy information management systems, and the lack of standards and agreements, the CNPHI has demonstrated that much can be accomplished in these areas. Over the next decade, significant barriers impeding additional advances will be bridged through the implementation of the Electronic Health Record, and through ongoing efforts to address gaps in standards, and data- and information-sharing agreements. Together with new technologies coming on-line, opportunities to further enhance public health surveillance and response will be limited only by one's imagination.","Mukhi, Shamir; Aramini, Jeff; Kabani, Amin",The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18978985/,167

194776,COVID-19 pandemic and some observations about management of breast cancer at private practice.,2020,"Centrifugal pumps are considered to be less destructive to blood elements (1) when compared to roller pumps. However, their large prime volumes render them unsuitable as arterial pumps in heart lung machine (HLM) circuitry for children. In November of 2014, the circuit at Arnold Palmer Hospital, a Biomedicus BP-50 with kinetic assist venous drainage (KAVD) and 1/4″ tubing was converted to a roller pump in the arterial position with gravity drainage. Vacuum-assisted venous drainage (VAVD) was mounted on the HLM as a backup, but not used. Tubing was changed to 3/16″ in the arterial line in patients <13 kg. A retrospective study with a total of 140 patients compared patients placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with Biomedicus centrifugal pumps and KAVD (Centrifugal Group, n = 40) to those placed on CPB with roller pumps and gravity drainage (Roller Group, n = 100). Patients requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)/cardio-pulmonary support (CPS) or undergoing a hybrid procedure were excluded. Re-operation or circulatory arrest patients were not excluded. Prime volumes decreased by 57% from 456 ± 34 mL in the Centrifugal Group to 197 ± 34 mL in the Roller Group (p < .001). There was a corresponding increase in hematocrit (HCT) of blood primes and also on CPB. Intraoperative homologous blood transfusions also decreased 55% from 422 mL in the Centrifugal Group to 231 mL in the Roller Group (p < .001). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons--European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (STAT) categorized intubation times and hospital length of stay (LOS) for all infants showed a trend toward reduction, but was not statistically significant. Overall mortality was 5% utilizing the centrifugal configuration and 0% in the roller pump cohort. We demonstrated that the transition to roller pumps in the arterial position of the HLM considerably reduced our priming volume and formed a basis for a comprehensive blood conservation program. By maintaining higher HCTs on CPB, we were able to reduce intraoperative homologous blood transfusions.","Datt, Bharat; Nguyen, Moui B; Plancher, Gary; Ruzmetov, Mark; O'Brien, Michael; Kube, Alicia; Munro, Hamish M; Pourmoghadam, Kamal K; DeCampli, William M",The journal of extra-corporeal technology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298664/,167

During this period, all major anthropogenic transport activities, which contribute to atmospheric pollution, were restricted. The current study examines the impact of the transport restrictions on ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and hospital admissions for asthma across Ireland. Methods This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. National ambient air quality monitoring network data were analysed to investigation variations in NO2 concentrations. Asthma hospital admissions data were collected from the HSE Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) for Cork, Dublin, and Meath. Results During the period of transport restrictions, there were reductions in the annual mean NO2 for Cork, Dublin and Meath (i.e. 12µg/m3 to 11µg/m3 (p = 1); 25µg/m3 to 17µg/m3 (p < 0.001); and 23µg/m3 to 21µg/m3 (p = 1)). Reductions in asthma hospital admissions were also observed. Among the 8,471 patient episodes included in this study, the mean [SD] age at admission was 47.2[22.9] years; 61% were female (n=5,134); mean [SD] length of stay was 4.9[10.9] days. Conclusion The findings of this study provide an opportunity to explore the impact of NO2 emissions for Cork, Dublin and Meath on asthma hospital admissions, in order to improve air quality modelling and policy development of management of asthma.","Quintyne, K I; Kelly, C; Sheridan, A; Kenny, P; O'Dwyer, M",Irish medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520648/,167

Previous observations in our laboratory showed that some stocks of T. cruzi can be contaminated with mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV-3). Literature has shown that MHV-3 infection induces immunologic disorders characterized by thymic involution with marked cell depletion. However, the effects of interactions between MHV-3 and the parasite on the immune system are not well understood. In the present study specific-pathogen-free CBA mice were inoculated with MHV-3, alone or associated with different stocks of T. cruzi. Concurrent murine virus infection resulted in increased pathogenicity of T. cruzi infection shown by profound thymic atrophy; loss of cortical thymocytes; depletion of Thy1.2+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells; enhancement of in situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation; and eventually, death of the animals. Such lines of evidence show that the mechanism underlying this thymic atrophy is associated with apoptosis. These results also suggest that MHV-3 can account for the increased immunosuppression observed during experimental infection with the parasite.","Verinaud, L; Da Cruz-Höfling, M A; Sakurada, J K; Rangel, H A; Vassallo, J; Wakelin, D; Sewell, H F; Camargo, I J",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9521141/,167

For example, the sequences Cbz-Pro-Phe-CH=CH-CO-OEt (I) which fulfils the known primary and secondary specificity requirements of the serine protease chymotrypsin, and Cbz-Phe-Ala-CH=CH-CO-OEt (II) which represents a general recognition sequence for cysteine proteases such as cathepsins B, L and S, have been tested as putative irreversible inactivators of their respective target proteases. It was found that, whereas II, for example, functioned as a time-dependent, irreversible inactivator of each of the cysteine proteases, I behaved only as a modest competitive reversible inhibitor of chymotrypsin. Within the simple ester sequences Cbz-Phe-Ala-CH=CH-CO-R, the rank order of inhibitor effectiveness decreases in the order R = -OMe > -OEt >> -OBut. It was also found that the presence of both an unsaturated double bond and an ester (or alpha-keto ester) moiety were indispensable for obtaining irreversible inactivators. Of the irreversible inactivators synthesized, Cbz-Phe-Ala-CH=CH-CO-CO-OEt (which contains a highly electrophilic alpha-keto ester grouping) was found to be the most effective exhibiting, for example, second-order rate constants of approximately 1.7 x 10(6)M(-1)min(-1) and approximately 4.9 x 10(4)M(-1)min(-1) against recombinant human cathepsin S and human spleenic cathepsin B, respectively. This initial study thus holds out the promise that this class of inactivator may well be specific for the cysteine protease subclass.","Darkins, Paul; Gilmore, Brendan F; Hawthorne, Susan J; Healy, Adrienne; Moncrieff, Hazel; McCarthy, Noreen; McKervey, M Anthony; Brömme, Dieter; Pagano, Maurice; Walker, Brian",Chemical biology & drug design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17441903/,167

We did a prospective study to estimate HIV incidence rates during pregnancy and lactation. METHODS We assessed 2188 HIV-negative sexually active women with 2625 exposure intervals during pregnancy and 2887 intervals during breastfeeding, and 8473 non-pregnant and non-lactating women with 24,258 exposure intervals. Outcomes were HIV incidence rates per 100 person years and incidence rate ratios estimated by Poisson multivariate regression, with the non-pregnant or non-lactating women as the reference group. We also assessed the husbands of the married women to study male risk behaviours. FINDINGS HIV incidence rates were 2.3 per 100 person years during pregnancy, 1.3 per 100 person years during breastfeeding, and 1.1 per 100 person years in the non-pregnant and non-lactating women. The adjusted incidence rate ratios were 2.16 (95% CI 1.39-3.37) during pregnancy and 1.16 (0.82-1.63) during breastfeeding. Pregnant women and their male partners reported significantly fewer external sexual partners than did the other groups. In married pregnant women who had a sexual relationship with their male spouses, the HIV incidence rate ratio was 1.36 (0.63-2.93). In married pregnant women in HIV-discordant relationships (ie, with HIV-positive men) the incidence rate ratio was 1.76 (0.62-4.03). INTERPRETATION The risk of HIV acquisition rises during pregnancy. This change is unlikely to be due to sexual risk behaviours, but might be attributable to hormonal changes affecting the genital tract mucosa or immune responses.

The study aimed to compare, using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis, the incidence of postoperative complications between CH and EH for centrally located liver tumors (CLLT). METHODS All consecutive CH and EH procedures for CLLT performed from 1980 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Independent predictors of postoperative complications were identified. CH was compared to EH after PSM. RESULTS The study population consisted of 373 patients, 44 (11.8 %) of whom underwent CH and 329 (88.2 %) of whom underwent EH. Before PSM, the overall 90-day mortality was 7.2 % (27 patients) without a group difference (2 (4.5 %) for CH vs. 25 (7.6 %) for EH, p = 0.756). The CH and EH groups had similar postoperative morbidity rates (43.2 vs. 55.3 %; p = 0.108). Blood transfusion was the only independent predictor of postoperative complications (Hazard Ratio: 1.73; 95 % confidence interval: 1.11-2.68; p = 0.014). After PSM, 43 CH patients were matched with 43 EH patients. No group difference was observed for the postoperative mortality, morbidity, or duration of hospital stay. A higher number of EH patients (30.2 vs. 9.3 %, p = 0.028) presented with more than one postoperative complication. CONCLUSIONS CH and EH yield similar mortality and morbidity. For CLLT, CH may be an attractive procedure with the advantage of sparing the liver parenchyma compared with EH.","de'Angelis, Nicola; Pascal, Gérard; Salloum, Chady; Lahat, Eylon; Ichai, Philippe; Saliba, Faouzi; Adam, René; Castaing, Denis; Azoulay, Daniel",World journal of surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27272270/,167
199981,[Progress in the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome and lung injury in COVID-19],2021,"Background Incidence of viral pneumonia has been reported in several patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The infection has also been linked to the development of inflammatory syndromes and related clinical manifestations. Result The present study discusses four cases of COVID infection showing varying clinical features. The post-COVID inflammation syndrome was associated with non-specific inflammation and post viral arthritis in three cases. One other subject had vasculitis leading to central retinal artery occlusion. Conclusion As the number of cases of COVID-19 cases has been increasing globally, it is advisable that physicians consider the possibility of post-COVID manifestations while examining patients with non-specific inflammation. A short course of NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine regimen has been found to be beneficial for alleviating symptoms, and in rare cases with organ threatening inflammation, steroids may be required.","Chandrashekara, S; Jaladhar, Prakruthi; Paramshetti, Shruti; Ramachandran, Veena; Nizar, Sayid Fahad; Kori, Devaraj",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33247640/,167
200895,"Kindergartens Reopening in the Period of Regular Epidemic Prevention and Control, Benefitial or Harmful?",2020,"AIMS In acute ischaemic stroke, endovascular therapy with the Solitaire FR stent retriever has been shown to double recanalisation rates and the numbers of patients who recover to be functionally independent, when compared to standard therapy. We present the Auckland City Hospital experience of clot retrieval. METHODS Previously independent ischaemic stroke patients with contraindications to, or no response following, i.v. alteplase, were treated with clot retrieval. All patients had proximal large artery occlusions on CT angiography and many also had CT perfusion scans showing salvageable ischaemic tissue. RESULTS Clot retrieval was performed in 33 patients (10 women, mean (SD) age of 54 (17) years) since 2011. Twenty-two (67%) patients were first treated with alteplase. Patients fell into three groups: 17 (52%) had anterior circulation occlusion, similar to those in recent clot retrieval studies; 10 (30%) had posterior circulation occlusion; and six (18%) had 'Rescue' clot retrieval, usually with stroke that followed a procedure. Patients with anterior circulation occlusion had a median time from symptom onset to groin puncture of 225 (range 95-450) minutes, full recanalisation occurred in 76%, and by day 90, all 17 were alive and living at home, with 63% functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2). At day 90, eight of 10 posterior circulation occlusion group patients were alive and living at home, four with a mRS of 0-2. In contrast, four of six 'Rescue' patients had died, and another was functionally dependent with a mRS of 4. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular clot retrieval can be safely and effectively performed in a New Zealand setting with similar results to recent trials in anterior circulation occlusion patients. We suggest that District Health Boards develop clot retrieval services as part of regional hyperacute stroke treatment pathways.","Barber, Peter Alan; Liu, Qiliang; Brew, Stefan; McGuinness, Ben; Hope, Ayton; Moriarty, Maurice; Campbell, Doug; Tse, Dominic",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26922449/,167
201002,The Early Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Education and Cancer Control,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) struck Hong Kong bitterly in the spring of 2003, infecting 1755 persons and claiming nearly 300 lives. The epidemic was introduced by travellers from southern China, where the disease had originated. It started in late February and lasted until early June. Two notable 'super-spreading' events were reported, one inside a teaching hospital and the other in a private housing estate. Other than in the super-spreading events, the infectivity in the community appeared to be low, and there were few, if any, asymptomatic or subclinical infections. Health-care workers were at particular risk and accounted for 22 % of all probable cases. The main modes of transmission were through droplet spread and close/direct contacts, but situations conducive to aerosol generation appeared to be associated with higher risk. Our review suggests that there are still many unknown factors concerning the mode of transmission and environmental risk that need to be clarified.","Yu, I T S; Sung, J J Y",Epidemiology and infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15473139/,167
201104,Impact of COVID-19 on polio vaccination in Pakistan: a concise overview,2020,"Ultraviolet (UV) germicidal air disinfection is an engineering method used to control the airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in high-risk settings. Despite the recent emergence of respiratory viral pathogens such as SARS and avian influenza viruses, UV disinfection of pathogenic viral aerosols has not been examined. Hence, we characterized the UV disinfection of viral aerosols using the bacteriophage MS2, adenovirus, and coronavirus. Our objectives were to characterize the effect of nebulization and air sampling on the survival of important viral pathogens, quantitatively characterize and estimate the UV susceptibility of pathogenic viral aerosols, and evaluate the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the susceptibility of viral aerosols, to 254 nm UV-C. The viruses were aerosolized into an experimental chamber using a six-jet Collison nebulizer, exposed to 254 nm UV, and sampled using an AGI-30 liquid impinger. Both the MS2 and adenovirus aerosols were very resistant to UV air disinfection, with a reduction of less than 1 logarithm in viable viral aerosols at a UV dose of 2608 microW s/cm2. The susceptibility of coronavirus aerosols was 7-10 times that of the MS2 and adenovirus aerosols. Unlike bacterial aerosols, there was no significant protective effect of high RH on UV susceptibility of the tested viral aerosols. We confirmed that the UV disinfection rate differs greatly between viral aerosols and viruses suspended in liquid.","Walker, Christopher M; Ko, Gwangpyo",Environmental science & technology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17822117/,167
201259,Overlapping B cell pathways in severe COVID-19 and lupus,2020,"Introduction Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a high risk of acquiring SARSCoV- 2 infection, due to repeated occupational exposure, long working hours, stress and fatigue. In India, there is lack of data regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 amongst HCWs due to absence of routine screening programme within the hospital premises. We have designed this study in order to improve our understanding of the incidence of SARS-CoV2 within the health care workers working in a level 4 COVID hospital in Kolkata. Materials and Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology, ID and BG Hospital, Kolkata upon health care workers who presented with symptoms suggestive of Covid 19 and their direct contacts. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the participants were subjected to Real time RT-PCR for detection of E, RDRP and ORF1B N gene for Covid 19 detection. Result Out of the 274 HCW tested, 75 (27%) of total HCWs were found to be positive. Among them 33(44%) were frontline workers and rest of them 42 (56%) were non-frontline workers. Predominance of SARS- CoV2 infection was found in male HCWs (57%) than female HCWs (43%). HCWs younger than 45 years (68%) were more infected.52 (69%) HCWs presented with symptoms like fever, sore throat, bodyache, loss of sensation of smell, coughs etc. 23(31%) were asymptomatic with history of direct contact with Covid-19 positive cases. Conclusion Heath care workers are at higher risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV2 and could potentially has a role in transmission in and out of the hospital. Hence, routine screening of both symptomatic as well as asymptomatic hospital staff is essential for early diagnosis to prevent transmission of COVID 19 infection.","Banerjee, Abhra; Mukherjee, Kheya; Bhattacharjee, Debojyoti; Garai, Debanjan; Chakraborty, Roopsa",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33247643/,167

201891,"Overlapping epidemics-A lesson in the chapter called ""Vaccination""",2020,"The first event after infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) is presumed to be the synthesis of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the input genomic RNA. The synthesis and processing of this putative polymerase protein was studied in a cell-free translation system utilizing 60S RNA from MHV-A59 virions. The polypeptide products of this reaction included two major species of 220 and 28 kilodaltons. Kinetics experiments indicated that both p220 and p28 appeared after 60 min of incubation and that protein p28 was synthesized initially as the N-terminal portion of a larger precursor protein. When the cell-free translation products were labeled with N-formyl[35S]methionyl-tRNAi, p28 was the predominant radioactive product, confirming its N-terminal location within a precursor protein. Translation in the presence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and ZnCl2 resulted in the disappearance of p28 and p220 and the appearance of a new protein, p250. This product, which approached the maximal size predicted for a protein synthesized from genomic RNA, was not routinely detected in the absence of inhibitors even under conditions which optimized the translation reaction for elongation of proteins. Subsequent chelation of ZnCl2 resulted in the partial cleavage of the precursor protein and the reappearance of p28. One-dimensional peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease confirmed the precursor-product relationship of p250 and p28. The results show that MHV virion RNA, like many other viral RNAs, is translated into a large polyprotein, which is cleaved soon after synthesis into smaller, presumably functional proteins. This is in marked contrast to the synthesis of other MHV proteins, in which minimal proteolytic processing occurs.","Denison, M R; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3018279/,167

The patient was extubated after five days of intermittent PPV and supine-position ventilation and was discharged 20 days after admission. Also, assessments revealed that the fetus was unharmed by the intervention.

201973,"Away Rotations, Interviews, and Rank Lists: Radiation Oncology Residency Applicant Perspectives on the 2020 Match Process",2021,"Tribromomethane, a chemical intermediate and solvent, has been identified as a drinking water contaminant resulting from water chlorination. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering tribromomethane (95%-97% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex once or for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Single-Administration, Fourteen-Day, and Thirteen-Week Studies: All rats that received 2,000 mg/kg and 3/5 males and 3/5 females that received 1,000 mg/kg tribromomethane died before the end of the single-administration studies. All mice that received 2,000 mg/kg, 4/5 males and 2/5 females that received 1,000 mg/kg, and 1/5 males that received 500 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Shallow breathing was observed for rats and male mice that received 1,000 or 2,000 mg/kg tribromomethane. In the 14-day studies, all rats that received 600 or 800 mg/kg and 1/5 males that received 400 mg/kg tribromomethane died before the end of the studies. The final mean body weight of male rats that received 400 mg/kg was 14% lower than that of vehicle controls. One of five male mice that received 600 mg/kg and 1/5 female mice that received 800 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control mice were comparable. None of the rats died before the end of the 13-week studies (doses ranged from 12 to 200 mg/kg). Final mean body weights were comparable for dosed and vehicle control rats. All male rats that received 100 or 200 mg/kg tribromomethane and all female rats that received 200 mg/kg were lethargic. The incidences of cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes in dosed male rats were slightly increased compared with that in vehicle controls. The severity of this lesion was increased in the 200 mg/kg group. One of 10 female mice that received 100 mg/kg tribromomethane died before the end of the 13-week studies. The final mean body weight of mice that received 400 mg/kg was 8% lower than that of vehicle controls for males and was comparable to that of vehicle controls for females. Cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes was observed in the liver of 5/10 male mice that received 200 mg/kg and in 8/10 male mice that received 400 mg/kg tribromomethane. Based on these results, 2-year studies of tribromomethane were conducted by administering 0, 100, or 200 mg/kg tribromomethane in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 F344/N rats of each sex and 50 female B6C3F1 mice. Male B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg tribromomethane on the same schedule. Body Weights and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male and female rats were 10%-28% lower than those of vehicle controls throughout the second year of the studies. Survival of the high dose group of male rats was significantly lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 91; no significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of female rats (male: vehicle control, 34/50; low dose, 30/50; high dose, 11/50; female: 34/50; 28/50; 28/50). Reduced survival for male rats given 200 mg/kg tribromomethane lowered the sensitivity of this group to detect a carcinogenic response. Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control male mice were comparable throughout the study. Mean body weights of dosed female mice were 5%-16% lower than those of vehicle controls from week 28 to the end of the study. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of male mice; the survival of both dosed groups of female mice was significantly lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 77 (male: 41/50; 37/50; 36/50; female: 25/49; 15/50; 20/50). Reduced survival in all groups of female mice was partly due to a utero-ovarian infection; nonetheless, survival of all groups of female mice was at least 50% by week 92. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Uncommon adenomatous polyps or adenocarcinomas (combined) of the large intestine (colon or rectum) were induced in three male ratarge intestine (colon or rectum) were induced in three male rats (vehicle control, 0/50; low dose, 0/50; high dose, 3/50) and in nine female rats (0/50; 1/50; 8/50); the historical incidence of neoplasms of the large intestine is less than 0.2% in approximately 2,000 corn oil vehicle control male F344/N rats, and none has been observed in approximately 2,000 corn oil vehicle control female F344/N rats. Three of the neoplasms of the large intestine (one in the high dose male rats and two in the high dose female rats) were adenocarcinomas. Focal or diffuse fatty change of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 23/50; 49/50; 50/50; female: 19/50; 39/49; 46/50). Active chronic inflammation was observed at increased incidences in dosed male and high dose female rats (male: 0/50; 29/50; 23/50; female: 9/50; 8/49; 27/50). The incidence of necrosis of the liver was increased in high dose male rats (7/50; 3/50; 20/50) and decreased in dosed females (11/50; 3/49; 2/50). Mixed cell focus was observed at increased incidences in dosed female rats (8/50; 25/49; 28/50). Other nonneoplastic lesions observed at increased incidences in dosed rats included chronic active inflammation and squamous metaplasia of the ducts of the salivary gland (squamous metaplasia-- male: 0/50; 15/50; 31/48; female: 0/49; 10/49; 16/50; chronic active inflammation--male: 0/50; 16/50; 25/48; female: 0/49; 9/49; 18/50), squamous metaplasia of the prostate gland (2/49; 6/46; 12/50), ulcers of the forestomach (male: 1/49; 5/50; 10/50), and chronic active inflammation of the lung (male: 1/50; 7/50; 15/50). Pigmentation of the spleen was also observed at an increased incidence in high dose female rats. The salivary gland and lung lesions were characteristic of infection by rat coronavirus, a virus to which a positive serologic reaction was observed early in the studies. The incidence of follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was increased in high dose female mice (5/49; 4/49; 19/47), and fatty change of the liver was increased in both dosed groups of female mice (1/49; 9/50; 24/50). No chemically related adverse effects were observed in male mice. Neoplastic lesions that occurred at lower incidences in dosed animals compared with those in vehicle controls included preputial gland neoplasms in male rats (10/41; 5/38; 1/34), uterine stromal polyps in female rats (10/49; 9/50; 2/50), anterior pituitary gland adenomas in male and female rats (male: 12/50; 12/48; 2/45; female: 29/48; 12/46; 16/48), mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats (22/50; 17/50; 6/50), and alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms in male mice (11/50; 7/50; 2/49). Other than concomitant decreases in body weights, no other reasons are obvious to correlate these decreases with chemical administration. Genetic Toxicology: Tribromomethane exhibited equivocal mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation and in strains TA97 and TA98 when exposure occurred in the presence of hamster S9; tribromomethane produced no increases in revertant colonies in TA1535 or TA1537 with or without exogenous metabolic activation. Tribromomethane induced trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in mouse L5178Y cells with and without metabolic activation. When tested incultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for cytogenetic effects, tribromomethane produced an increase in both sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations in the absence, but not in the presence, of exogenous metabolic activation. Tribromomethane caused sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila when administered to adult males by feeding; no induction of mutations was observed when tribromomethane was administered by abdominal injection. Results of tests for reciprocal translocations in adult male Drosophila exposed to tribromomethane by feeding were negative. In vivo tests for cytogenetic effects in bone marrow cells of male B6C3F1 mice demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of tribromomethane induced an increase in SCEs but no increase in chromosomal aberrations. Intraperitoneal injection of tribromomethane also induced an increase in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of B6C3F1 mice. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of tribromomethane have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of tribromomethane for male F344/N rats and clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, based on increased incidences of uncommon neoplasms of the large intestine. Reduced survival for male rats given 200 mg/kg tribromomethane lowered the sensitivity of this group to detect a carcinogenic response. Chemically related nonneoplastic lesions included fatty change and active chronic inflammation of the liver in male and female rats, minimal necrosis of the liver in male rats, and mixed cell foci of the liver in female rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice given 50 or 100 mg/kg tribromomethane or for female B6C3F1 mice given 100 or 200 mg/kg; male mice might have been able to tolerate a higher dose. Survival of female mice was reduced, partly due to a utero-ovarian infection.

202253,COVID-19 and Transfusion Blood,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although first responders (FRs) represent a high-risk group for exposure, little information is available regarding their risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The purpose of the current study was to determine the serological prevalence of past COVID-19 infection in a cohort of municipal law enforcement (LE) and firefighters (FFs). METHODS: Descriptive analysis of a de-identified data reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG), or COR2G, serology results for municipal FRs. As part of the serology process, FRs were surveyed for COVID-19-like symptoms since February 2020 and asked to report any prior COVID-19 nasal swab testing. Descriptive statistics and two-sided Chi Square tests with Yates correction were used to compare groups. RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.","McGuire, Sarayna S; Klassen, Aaron B; Heywood, John; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D",Prehosp Disaster Med,,167

203727,"Obesity, abdominal organ size and COVID-19 severity",2020,"Background: A key challenge in estimating epidemiological parameters for a pandemic such as the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number of infections A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from the originating city to infer the true number This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before city lockdown because there are almost no exported cases thereafter Methods: We propose a Bayesian estimation method that dynamically estimates the epidemiological parameters by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers To illustrate the use of this method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the COVID-19 had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020 Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 4,794–22,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526–265,113], respectively Results: The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3 42 [95% CI 3 34–3 50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0 76 [95% CI 0 65–0 92]) We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan Conclusions: This case study by our proposed method affirms the believed importance and effectiveness of imposing tight non-essential travel restrictions and affirm the importance and effectiveness of government interventions (e g , transportation suspension and large scale hospitalization) for effective mitigation of COVID-19 community spread","Zhang, Hongzhe Zhao Xiaohang Yin Kexin Yan Yiren Qian Wei Chen Bintong Fang Xiao",Journal of Public Health Research,,167
204078,COVID-19 infection data encode a dynamic reproduction number in response to policy decisions with secondary wave implications,2021,"On 3 April 2020, the Director-General of the WHO stated: ""[COVID-19] is much more than a health crisis. We are all aware of the profound social and economic consequences of the pandemic (WHO, 2020)"". Such consequences are the result of counter-measures such as lockdowns, and world-wide reductions in production and consumption, amplified by cascading impacts through international supply chains. Using a global multi-regional macro-economic model, we capture direct and indirect spill-over effects in terms of social and economic losses, as well as environmental effects of the pandemic. Based on information as of May 2020, we show that global consumption losses amount to 3.8$tr, triggering significant job (147 million full-time equivalent) and income (2.1$tr) losses. Global atmospheric emissions are reduced by 2.5Gt of greenhouse gases, 0.6Mt of PM2.5, and 5.1Mt of SO2 and NOx. While Asia, Europe and the USA have been the most directly impacted regions, and transport and tourism the immediately hit sectors, the indirect effects transmitted along international supply chains are being felt across the entire world economy. These ripple effects highlight the intrinsic link between socio-economic and environmental dimensions, and emphasise the challenge of addressing unsustainable global patterns. How humanity reacts to this crisis will define the post-pandemic world.","Lenzen, Manfred; Li, Mengyu; Malik, Arunima; Pomponi, Francesco; Sun, Ya-Yen; Wiedmann, Thomas; Faturay, Futu; Fry, Jacob; Gallego, Blanca; Geschke, Arne; Gómez-Paredes, Jorge; Kanemoto, Keiichiro; Kenway, Steven; Nansai, Keisuke; Prokopenko, Mikhail; Wakiyama, Takako; Wang, Yafei; Yousefzadeh, Moslem",PLoS One,,167

Despite gaining 61% support from the public, dissenters criticised that the participants violated professional ethics and abandoned their accountabilities, which led to moral distress. However, the participants were guided by the four fundamental medical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice) for public interest and health equity. Their concerns for occupational safety should not be ignored to maintain an effective health care system. In short, the strike adopted a bottom-up initiative and adhered to a public-centered perspective and community-driven ethical behaviors, through which the participants deliberated over professionalism, humanism and the imminence of public health, and the balance between them. Strikers showed care and concern for the safety of the community, sustainability of the health care system, and well-being of all people in Hong Kong.","Cheng, Fung Kei",Public health nurs,,167

205333,Covid-19 vaccine and autoimmunity: Awakening the sleeping dragon,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. The disease, typically characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and profound elevation of inflammatory markers, can range in severity from mild or asymptomatic illness to a lethal cytokine storm and respiratory failure. A number of recognized complications of COVID-19 infection are described in the literature. Common neurological complications include headache and anosmia. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon complication described in isolated case reports. However, a causal relationship has yet to be established. This case report adds to the growing body of evidence that GBS is a potential COVID-19 complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Caucasian woman with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection presented to the emergency department with 4 days of gradually worsening ascending lower extremity weakness. Exam revealed bilateral lower extremity weakness, mute reflexes, and sensory loss. Soon after starting intravenous administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG), the patient developed respiratory distress, eventually requiring intubation. She remained intubated for the duration of her IVIG treatment. After five rounds of treatment, the patient was successfully extubated and transferred to acute rehab. Following 4 weeks of intense physical therapy, she was able to walk with assistance on room air. CONCLUSION: At the present time, this is one of the few reports of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) or GBS associated with COVID-19 in the United States. It is unclear whether a causal relationship exists given the nature of the syndrome. However, in light of the growing number of reported cases, physicians should be aware of this possible complication when evaluating COVID-19 patients.","Gagarkin, Dmitriy A; Dombrowski, Keith E; Thakar, Keyur B; DePetrillo, John C",J Med Case Rep,,167

206057,"Virtual Clinical Trials in Oncology-Overview, Challenges, Policy Considerations, and Future Directions",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and nationally mandated restrictions to control the virus have been associated with increased mental health issues. However, the differential impact of the pandemic and lockdown on groups of individuals, and the personal characteristics associated with poorer outcomes are unknown. METHOD: Data from 21 938 adults in England who participated in a stratified cohort study were analysed. Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling. Multinomial and logistic regression models were constructed to identify sociodemographic and personality-related risk factors associated with trajectory class membership. RESULTS: Four trajectories of depression and five for anxiety were identified. The most common group presented with low symptom severity throughout, other classes were identified that showed: severe levels of symptoms which increased; moderate symptoms throughout; worsening mental health during lockdown but improvements after lockdown ended; and for anxiety only, severe initial anxiety that decreased quickly during lockdown. Age, gender, ethnicity, income, previous diagnoses, living situation, personality factors and sociability were associated with different trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 30% of participants experienced trajectories with symptoms in the clinical range during lockdown, and did not follow the average curve or majority group, highlighting the importance of differential trajectories. Young, female, outgoing and sociable people and essential workers experienced severe anxiety around the announcement of lockdown which rapidly decreased. Younger individuals with lower incomes and previous mental health diagnoses experienced higher and increasing levels of symptoms. Recognising the likely symptom trajectories for such groups may allow for targeted care or interventions.","Saunders, Rob; Buckman, Joshua E J; Fonagy, Peter; Fancourt, Daisy",Psychol Med,,167

Now, although a few drugs and vaccines have been proved for its treatment and prevention, little systematic comments are made to explain its susceptibility to humans. A few scattered studies used bioinformatics methods to explore the role of microRNA (miRNA) in COVID-19 infection. Combining these timely reports and previous studies about virus and miRNA, we comb through the available clues and seemingly make the perspective reasonable that the COVID-19 cleverly exploits the interplay between the small miRNA and other biomolecules to avoid being effectively recognized and attacked from host immune protection as well to deactivate functional genes that are crucial for immune system. In detail, SARS-CoV-2 can be regarded as a sponge to adsorb host immune-related miRNA, which forces host fall into dysfunction status of immune system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 encodes its own miRNAs, which can enter host cell and are not perceived by the host's immune system, subsequently targeting host function genes to cause illnesses. Therefore, this article presents a reasonable viewpoint that the miRNA-based interplays between the host and SARS-CoV-2 may be the primary cause that SARS-CoV-2 accesses and attacks the host cells.","Zhang, Song; Amahong, Kuerbannisha; Sun, Xiuna; Lian, Xichen; Liu, Jin; Sun, Huaicheng; Lou, Yan; Zhu, Feng; Qiu, Yunqing",Brief Bioinform,,167

This aspect is of great concern for wildlife conservation and human health, because the list of highly susceptible animal groups that have contracted SARS-CoV-2 (bats, mustelids, and primates) is large and, once infected, these groups can act as vectors and reservoirs, becoming a substrate for viral mutations and recombinations and boosting the risk of new strains emerging, which can return to humans as new diseases. Little is known about the inducing factors facilitating coronavirus spillover from one species to another, but it can be argued that interface zones between wild fauna and humans, which are narrow edges between anthropic (cities, roads, parks, ecotourism sites, and agricultural frontiers) and sylvatic habitat, are zones of increased interaction between humans and wild animals, and thus have a higher probability of viral spillover events than other areas. In a similar context, the habitat compression by forest fragmentation also brings species and infected beings closer, reducing their home ranges and intensifying the risk of spillover among wild populations. Therefore, on the basis of the premise for zoonosis—the greater human–animal interaction, the greater risk of viral spillover—we aimed to identify the most and least susceptible areas to viral spillover in Brazil. Methods: We developed an approach combining ecological modelling (Biomod2: modelling habitat suitability for 158 bat and 49 primate species) and geographical information systems (by using demographic indicators, roads, and related variables) to map the most and least susceptible areas to spillover in Brazil. This map indicates priority areas for serological surveillance of fauna for monitoring the spillover and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 strains and variants in Brazilian biodiversity. Findings: Among our most relevant preliminary results, we found that forested areas surrounding the São Paulo Metropolitan Area are among the most susceptible areas for spillover. This resulted from the combination of high contaminated human density and high density of non-human primates interacting with humans in these transitional areas. Interpretation: Because of the high resolution of the results, the map can be useful for action planning and decision making in conservation and health, since susceptible areas denote not only a greater risk of virus jumping from humans to animals, but also of coronaviruses returning from fauna to humans in new viral strains.

METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out during January and February 2020 amongst the general population of Karachi, Pakistan. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used among 399 young adult participants. The questionnaire was developed keeping in view of the already published study on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the available literature on COVID-19. It included sociodemographic information, assessment of knowledge, beliefs regarding coronavirus and the perception of precautionary measures taken by an individual. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p<0.05 was used as statistically significant. RESULTS: There were more females 299 (75%) than male participants 100 (25%). The mean age was 20.9 ±2.30 years and 232 (58%) had graduate degrees. There is lack of knowledge and awareness about coronavirus as 226 (56.6%) participants claimed that coronavirus is actually the most dangerous virus in the world, and 171 (43%) did know that the common flu virus is potentially more lethal than coronavirus. Although a large majority of participants correctly identified sources of transmission, measures and precautions to be taken for coronavirus, their knowledge for symptom identification was deficient. The most pursued platform for information for coronavirus was found to be social media, followed by television and print media. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the level of awareness of coronavirus among young adults in Karachi, Pakistan. The study further pointed out the public knowledge gaps for the authorities concerned to help them develop more effective and successful awareness campaigns using preferred channels.","Mubeen, Syed Muhammad; Kamal, Shaheera; Kamal, Sufiyan; Balkhi, Fizra",J Pak Med Assoc,,167

212226,COVID-19 and the Emerging Regulatory Guidance for Ongoing Clinical Trials in the European Union,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients on chronic immunosuppressive treatments at baseline are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. These patients are at especially increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease. SUMMARY: Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population.","Manansala, Michael; Baughman, Robert; Novak, Richard; Judson, Marc; Sweiss, Nadera",Curr Opin Pulm Med,,167

212668,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Colorectal Cancer Screening Program,2020,"The current trend of infections from COVID-19 outbreak in Central Visayas (CV) is posing higher risk of continued spreading. When uncontrolled, swarming of infected individuals to hospitals puts a greater challenge to the health care systems in the region and may breakdown. It is imperative in this situation that data-driven decisions and policies are required the most. In response, this study provided estimates of the epidemiologically important parameters namely, reproduction metric (R-o) and infection (alpha), recovery (beta) and mortality (gamma) rates, by using a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model. This modified model incorporated control parameters, sigma and omega, associated with enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) implementation and observance of social distancing (SD), respectively. For the covered months from 27 March 2020-10 May 2020, results of the simulation estimated these parameters at: R-o=3.12, alpha=0.18, beta= 0.029, and gamma=0.029 with 90% confidence. Moreover, the reproduction metric can be effectively reduced with the combined effect of the control parameters at sigma, omega &gt;= 0.5 resulting to an effective R-o below unity. Similarly, this lowered the peak value of infection to 23% (or 7% of the total number of susceptible population) compared to when these measures are not observed and moved the peak time farther as well. While these estimates reflected the timely implementation of ECQ keeping its current level comparable with the country's estimates and the world, reducing the reproduction metric effectively requires strict observance to both ECQ and SD control measures. Lastly, the temporal dynamics of this metric may not be necessarily true in any given area, and hence geographically induced.","Corcino, R. B.; Elnar, A. R. B.; Maglasang, G. T.; Casas, K. P.

METHODS: The semester-long pipeline program, Saturday Academy at New York University College of Dentistry, was conducted remotely through Zoom, and materials for hands-on, pre-clinical activities, were mailed to participants. Saturday Academy aims to educate underrepresented minority and low-income high school students about the college application process and the dental profession. After the program's completion, program applications and engagement data were analyzed. An anonymous online survey was administered to the high school student participants. The survey questions included topics about their interest in the profession of dentistry, satisfaction with the Saturday Academy programming, and program engagement. RESULTS: In its remote format, Saturday Academy had an average attendance of 87.8% at each session. All (60/60, 100%) of the high school student participants responded to the anonymous program satisfaction survey. Sixty-seven percent reported an interest in the profession of dentistry before participating in the program and 82% after participating in the program. Ninety-eight percent agreed with the statement ""I enjoyed my experience participating in Saturday Academy."" Additionally, 97% agreed with the statement ""Saturday Academy's virtual programming was effective."" There were no statistically significant differences in program satisfaction when data from the virtual program were compared to 2 years of in-person program satisfaction data. CONCLUSION: Challenges to fulfilling the missions of dental institutions in response to the coronavirus pandemic impact service and recruitment efforts, in addition to formal dental education. Transitioning pipeline programming efforts, with hands-on components, to a remote format is possible and was met with favorable engagement and responses from program participants.","Burns, Lorel E; Pezzullo, Cheryline; Dief, Sandy; Conde, Giannina; Mejia, Eugenia E",J. dent. educ,,167

METHODS: The authors performed a cross-sectional household survey of 348 families in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from June 25 through July 2, 2020. Unmet need for child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss were assessed using caregiver self-report. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that the greatest unmet child health care need during the COVID-19 pandemic was dental care (16%), followed by medical care for a well visit or vaccination (5%). Approximately 40% of caregivers reported job loss or a decrease in household income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors found a significant association between the probability of unmet child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss (P = .022). Losing a job or experiencing a decrease in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with unmet child dental care (relative risk, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, 3 times as many households reported unmet dental care for a child compared with unmet medical care. Unmet child dental care was more common in households where pandemic-related job or income loss occurred. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: If unmet dental care continues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, nontraditional strategies for delivering dental care can be considered to improve access to dental care for children, such as teledentistry and oral health prevention services in primary care settings.","Burgette, Jacqueline M; Weyant, Robert J; Ettinger, Anna K; Miller, Elizabeth; Ray, Kristin N",,,167

Antivirals that have shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV2 or the closely related SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV, are compared on the enzymatic level and by potency in cells. For treatment of the CSS we discuss medications that reduce the effects, or expression of cytokines involved in the CSS with an emphasis on those that reduce IL-6 because of its central role in the development of the CSS. We show that some of the medications covered influence the activity or expression of enzymes involved in epigenetic processes and specifically those that add or remove modifications to histones or DNA. Where available, the latest clinical data showing the efficacy of the medications is presented. With respect to their mechanisms, we explain why some medications are successful, why others have failed, and why some untested medications may yet prove useful.","Luo, Wenxia; Ige, Olufola O; Beacon, Tasnim H; Su, Ruey-Chyi; Huang, Shujun; Davie, James R; Lakowski, Ted M",Genome,,167

DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 Social Monitor is a population-based online survey which informs the public, health authorities, and the scientific community about relevant aspects and potential changes in social and health behavior during the COVID-19 emergency and beyond. Future research will follow up on the described study population focusing on COVID-19 relevant topics such as subgroup differences in the impact of the pandemic on well-being and quality of life or different dynamics of perceived psychological distress.","Moser, André; Carlander, Maria; Wieser, Simon; Hämmig, Oliver; Puhan, Milo A; Höglinger, Marc",PLoS One,,167
217221,Urgent Cardiac Surgery and COVID-19 infection: Uncharted Territory,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5'UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine 'Achille heel' of the virus.","Tidu, Antonin; Janvier, Aurelie; Schaeffer, Laure; Sosnowski, Piotr; Kuhn, Lauriane; Hammann, Philippe; Westhof, Eric; Eriani, Gilbert; Martin, Franck",RNA,,167

Given the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy and anticancer treatments, patients with advanced lung cancer may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. During epidemic of COVID-19, a guideline for the optimal management of patients with advanced lung cancer urgently needs to be proposed to distinguish the symptoms of COVID-19 and the side effects of antitumor drugs. This network questionnaire survey was conducted on the lung cancer group of the Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medical Association; the lung cancer group of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Youth Committee; and the Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration. 321 valid questionnaires were received. Based on the guidelines on lung cancer and the results of the questionnaires, a consensus was reached. During the epidemic of COVID-19, We recommended that patients with advanced NSCLC should be treated as outpatients as possible at the nearest medical center; Patients who need to be hospitalized for antitumor treatment should be excluded from COVID-19 infection; More intensive attention should be paid to identification of COVID-19-related symptoms and adverse reactions caused by the malignancy or antitumor treatments. Stronger personal protection should be made for advanced NSCLC patients; An intentional postponing of antitumor treatment should be considered according to patient performance status.

218459,Care without a compass: Including patients with cancer in COVID-19 studies,2021,"Pharmacists have a role in educating patients on the self-management of their medications, using accurate medicines lists. Thus, pharmacy students need to be adequately trained and assessed in health-literacy skills to be competent for future patient-education consultations using medicines lists. Performance-based assessments using patient simulation are often utilized to examine students' competence in clinical knowledge and communication skills. Due to COVID-19, education systems changed to remote online delivery utilizing video conferencing platforms (i.e., ZoomTM), which proved challenging for performance-based assessments. These challenges include difficulty in observing non-verbal cues over ZoomTM and not having adequate internet access. Adaptations to reduce reliance on internet access were made where students submitted a video-recording task wherein they educated a simulated patient on a medicines list, under lockdown restrictions during the pandemic. A total of 304 submissions were received where students performed the role-play with a simulated patient, such as their family members, housemates or peers either at home in person or via ZoomTM. Although it was not an original goal of the task, the collaborative effort between pharmacy instructors, students and the public helped increase awareness of medicines lists through this task.","Mak, Vivienne; Sandhu, Anisha Kaur; Krishnan, Sunanthiny",,,167

218578,Sacred Places and Planetary Stresses: Sanctuaries as Laboratories of Religious and Ecological Change,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of prone positioning therapy on intubation rate in awake patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a two-center parallel group, superiority, randomized (1:1 allocation ratio) controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara and Hospital General de Occidente in Mexico for COVID-19 associated acute respiratory failure and in need of supplementary oxygen through high-flow nasal cannula are screened for eligibility. INCLUSION CRITERIA: all adult patients admitted to the COVID-19 unit who test positive for COVID-19 by PCR-test and in need for oxygen are eligible for inclusion. Randomization starts upon identification of requirement of a fraction of inspired oxygen &#8805;30% for an oxygen capillary saturation of &#8805;90% Exclusion criteria: less than 18 years-old, pregnancy, patients with immediate need of invasive mechanical ventilation (altered mental status, fatigue), vasopressor requirement to maintain median arterial pressure >65 mmHg, contraindications for prone positioning therapy (recent abdominal or thoracic surgery or trauma, facial, pelvic or spine fracture, untreated pneumothorax, do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate order, refusal or inability of the patient to enroll in the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients of the intervention group will be asked to remain in a prone position throughout the day as long as possible, with breaks according to tolerance. Pillows will be offered for maximizing comfort at chest, pelvis and knees. Monitoring of vital signs will not be suspended. Inspired fraction of oxygen will be titrated to maintain a capillary saturation of 92%-95%. For patients in the control group, prone positioning will be allowed as a rescue therapy. Staff intensivists will monitor the patient's status in both groups on a 24/7 basis. All other treatment will be unchanged and left to the attending physicians. MAIN OUTCOMES: Endotracheal intubation rate for mechanical ventilation at 28 days. RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomly allocated to either prone positioning or control group at 1:1 ratio. Such randomization will be computer generated and stratified by center with permuted blocks and length of 4. BLINDING (MASKING): Due to logistical reasons, only principal investigators and the data analyst will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): With an intubation rate of 60% according to recent reports from some American centers, and assuming a decrease to 40% to be clinically relevant, we calculated a total of 96 patients per group, for a beta error of 0.2, and alpha of 0.5. Therefore, we plan to recruit 200 patients, accounting for minimal losses to follow up, with 100 non-intubated patients in the prone position group and a 100 in the control group.

219388,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Variants and Expression as Candidates to Sex and Country Differences in COVID-19 Severity in Italy,2020,"Machine learning methods have greatly changed science, engineering, finance, business, and other fields. Despite the tremendous accomplishments of machine learning and deep learning methods, many challenges still remain. In particular, the performance of machine learning methods is often severely affected in case of diverse data, usually associated with smaller data sets or data related to areas of study where the size of the data sets is constrained by the complexity and/or high cost of experiments. Moreover, data with limited labeled samples is a challenge to most learning approaches. In this paper, the aforementioned challenges are addressed by integrating graph-based frameworks, multiscale structure, modified and adapted optimization procedures and semi-supervised techniques. This results in two innovative multiscale Laplacian learning (MLL) approaches for machine learning tasks, such as data classification, and for tackling diverse data, data with limited samples and smaller data sets. The first approach, called multikernel manifold learning (MML), integrates manifold learning with multikernel information and solves a regularization problem consisting of a loss function and a warped kernel regularizer using multiscale graph Laplacians. The second approach, called the multiscale MBO (MMBO) method, introduces multiscale Laplacians to a modification of the famous classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, and makes use of fast solvers for finding the approximations to the extremal eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the performance of our methods experimentally on a variety of data sets, such as biological, text and image data, and compare them favorably to existing approaches.","Merkurjev, Ekaterina; Nguyen, Duc DUy; Wei, Guo-Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03718v1.pdf,167

221086,CT Findings in Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the magnitude and associated factors of poor medication adherence among diabetic and hypertensive patients visiting public health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A multi-site cross-sectional design was conducted from 1st through 30th of August 2020 at public health facilities of the study area. Adult outpatients with T2DM and hypertension visiting hospitals and health centers were included in the study. A proportion to size allocation method was used to determine the required sample size per facility. Data was collected using the 8-item Morisky medication adherence scale. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze data. A 95% confidence interval and p&#8804;0.05 statistical significance was considered to determine factors associated with poor medication adherence. RESULTS: A total of 409 patients were included in the present study. About 57% of the patients reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed negative impacts on either of their follow-up visits, availability of medications, or affordability of prices. And, 21% have reported that they have been affected in all aspects. The overall magnitude of poor medication adherence was 72%. Patients with extreme poverty were more likely to have good medication adherence (AOR: 0.59; 95%C.I: 0.36-0.97), whereas attendance to a health center (AOR: 1.71; 95%C.I: 1.02-2.85), presence of comorbidity (AOR: 2.05; 95%C.I: 1.13-3.71), and current substance use history (AOR: 11.57; 95%C.I: 1.52-88.05) predicted high odds of poor adherence. CONCLUSION: Over a three-fourth of the patients, in the study setting, have poor adherence to their anti-diabetic and antihypertensive medications. Health facility type, income level, comorbidity, and current substance use history showed a statistically significant association with poor adherence to medication. Stakeholders should set alternative strategies as perceived impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on medication adherence are high in the study area.","Shimels, Tariku; Asrat Kassu, Rodas; Bogale, Gelila; Bekele, Mahteme; Getnet, Melsew; Getachew, Abrham; Shewamene, Zewdneh; Abraha, Mebratu",PLoS One,,167

In an incentivized study, we show that a large majority of people are very reluctant to put others at risk for their personal benefit. Moreover, this experimental measure of prosociality predicts health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, measured in a separate and ostensibly unrelated study with the same people. Prosocial individuals are more likely to follow physical distancing guidelines, stay home when sick, and buy face masks. We also find that prosociality measured two years before the pandemic predicts health behaviors during the pandemic. Our findings indicate that prosociality is a stable, long-term predictor of policy-relevant behaviors, suggesting that the impact of policies on a population may depend on the degree of prosociality.","Campos-Mercade, Pol; Meier, Armando N; Schneider, Florian H; Wengström, Erik",J Public Econ,,167
222694,Internal carotid artery thrombosis in COVID 19,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has induced unprecedented reductions in human mobility and social contacts throughout the world. Because dengue virus (DENV) transmission is strongly driven by human mobility, behavioral changes associated with the pandemic have been hypothesized to impact dengue incidence. By discouraging human contact, COVID-19 control measures have also disrupted dengue vector control interventions, the most effective of which require entry into homes. We sought to investigate how and why dengue incidence could differ under a lockdown scenario with a proportion of the population sheltered at home. Methodology & principal findings: We used an agent-based model with a realistic treatment of human mobility and vector control. We found that a lockdown in which 70% of the population sheltered at home and which occurred in a season when a new serotype invaded could lead to a small average increase in cumulative DENV infections of up to 10%, depending on the time of year lockdown occurred. Lockdown had a more pronounced effect on the spatial distribution of DENV infections, with higher incidence under lockdown in regions with higher mosquito abundance. Transmission was also more focused in homes following lockdown. The proportion of people infected in their own home rose from 54% under normal conditions to 66% under lockdown, and the household secondary attack rate rose from 0.109 to 0.128, a 17% increase. When we considered that lockdown measures could disrupt regular, city-wide vector control campaigns, the increase in incidence was more pronounced than with lockdown alone, especially if lockdown occurred at the optimal time for vector control. Conclusions & significance: Our results indicate that an unintended outcome of lockdown measures may be to adversely alter the epidemiology of dengue. This observation has important implications for an improved understanding of dengue epidemiology and effective application of dengue vector control. When coordinating public health responses during a syndemic, it is important to monitor multiple infections and understand that an intervention against one disease may exacerbate another.","Cavany, S.

This study explored the perception of the adult population about the need for-and access to-psychological support from health care professionals (HCP) in response to concerns about the psychological needs during lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This online cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the adult general population of mainland France (N = 2,003) took place during the last four days of the French lockdown (May 7-10, 2020). RESULTS: One in eight respondents (12.2%) perceived a need for psychological support from an HCP during the lockdown; most had symptoms of depression and/or anxiety of at least moderate intensity. Only a third (29.8%, 3.6% of the entire sample) actually obtained this support. Factors associated with this perceived need included: age under 35, economic difficulties due to lockdown, pre-lockdown use of psychological support, infection with COVID-19, serious worries about becoming infected, and heavy media use to obtain information about the disease. Among those who perceived a need for psychological support, the elderly were the most likely not to consult an HCP. People aged 35-64, those with high income, and those seriously worried about developing COVID-19 were the most likely to forgo seeking access to care because of their fear of infection by the coronavirus-2019. CONCLUSION: The perceived need for psychological support from an HCP and access to it appeared to be strongly associated with COVID-19 exposure factor. More research about this association is needed to improve the health authorities' understanding of the population's psychological needs in this situation and to enhance HCPs' abilities to meet them. In particular, further research of its specific impact on youth is necessary.","Alleaume, Caroline; Verger, Pierre; Peretti-Watel, Patrick",PLoS One,,167

Hibiscus noldeae Baker f. has been widely reported to be traditionally used in the treatment of different ailments, some of which are of inflammatory background such as asthma, wounds, headache, etc. However, the claims have not been supported by evidence at the molecular and functional levels. Here, we report on the bio-guided fractionation of H. noldeae and assessment of the inhibitory properties of some fractions and purified compounds on NLRP3 inflammasome and Interleukin 6 (IL-6). The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was determined by detecting the activity of caspase-1 and the production of Interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß) in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP-stimulated Tamm-Horsfall Protein 1 (THP-1) macrophages, while the production of IL-6 was studied in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. It was observed that hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the crude extract of the aerial parts of H. noldeae, as well as caffeic acid, isoquercetin, and ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions revealed significant inhibitory effects on Caspase-1 activities, and on IL-1ß and IL-6 production. The ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions downregulated the production of IL-1ß and IL-6, in a similar range as the caspase-1 inhibitor AC-YVAD-CHO and the drug Dexamethasone, both used as controls, respectively.

226184,"Prostate cancer survivorship, deaths, and health care management",2021,"Background: School closures have been a recommended non-pharmaceutical intervention in pandemic response owing to the potential to reduce transmission of infection between children, school staff and those that they contact. However, given the many roles that schools play in society, closure for any extended period is likely to have additional impacts. Literature reviews of research exploring school closure to date have focused upon epidemiological effects; there is an unmet need for research that considers the multiplicity of potential impacts of school closures. Methods: We used systematic searching, coding and synthesis techniques to develop a systems-based logic model. We included literature related to school closure planned in response to epidemics large and small, spanning the 1918-19 'flu pandemic through to the emerging literature on the 2019 novel coronavirus. We used over 170 research studies and a number of policy documents to inform our model. Results: The model organises the concepts used by authors into seven higher level domains: children's health and wellbeing, children's education, impacts on teachers and other school staff, the school organisation, considerations for parents and families, public health considerations, and broader economic impacts. The model also collates ideas about potential moderating factors and ethical considerations. While dependent upon the nature of epidemics experienced to date, we aim for the model to provide a starting point for theorising about school closures in general, and as part of a wider system that is influenced by contextual and population factors. Conclusions: The model highlights that the impacts of school closures are much broader than those related solely to health, and demonstrates that there is a need for further concerted work in this area. The publication of this logic model should help to frame future research in this area and aid decision-makers when considering future school closure policy and possible mitigation strategies.","Kneale, Dylan; O039,; Mara-Eves, Alison; Rees, Rebecca; Thomas, James",F1000Res,,167

227479,"Perspective and Costing in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, 1974-2018",2020,"PURPOSE: Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the use of intensive care unit telemedicine (tele-ICUs) may be one mechanism to provide patient care, particularly in rural parts of the United States. The purpose of this research was to inform hospital decision makers considering tele-ICUs, policy makers weighing immediate and longer-term funding and reimbursement decisions relative to tele-ICU care, and researchers conducting future work evaluating tele-ICUs. METHODS: We compared hospitals that reported providing teleintensive care to hospitals that reported not providing teleintensive care in the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHAAS). Differences between groups were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and t-tests (continuous variables) using 0.05 as the probability of Type 1 error. The study sample included all US short-term, acute care hospitals that responded to the AHAAS in 2018. Our key variable of interest was whether a hospital reported having any tele-ICU capabilities in the 2018 AHAAS. Other factors evaluated were ownership, region, beds, ICU beds, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, full-time employees, and whether a hospital was rural, a critical access hospital, a major teaching hospital, or part of a health system. FINDINGS: Larger, not-for-profit, nonrural, noncritical access, teaching hospitals that were part of a health system, particularly in the Midwest, were more likely to have tele-ICUs. Over one-third of hospital referral regions (HRRs) had zero hospitals with tele-ICUs, 4 had all hospitals with tele-ICU, and the median percent of hospitals with tele-ICU by HRR, weighted by outpatient visits, was 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found wide variation in the prevalence of tele-ICUs across HRRs and states. Future work should continue the evaluation of tele-ICU effectiveness and, if favorable, explore the variation we identified for improved access to teleintensive care.","Williams, Dunc; Lawrence, John; Hong, Young-Rock; Winn, Aaron",J Rural Health,,167

This is among recent observations and has attracted more focus following an acute controversy over the role of the Church in Brazil vis-à-vis government policies on the Covid-19 pandemic and the fact that a number of churches in Nigeria were allegedly initially reluctant to respond to the government lockdown declaration and the resultant ban on congregational worship. Simultaneously, the agenda of financial and material assistance to the poor by the large Christian denominations in South Africa as one means of sustaining the lockdown rather attracted criticism, as they were unable to sustain the project. Furthermore, the role of religious bodies came to the fore as global surveys demonstrated that, on average, the masses in these two continents are among the most religiously observant people in the world.

In fact, this systematic review-meta-analysis was directly pertained to estimation at the efficient value of some clinical managements to confront the COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Scholar databases were searched from inception to July 1, 2020, to identify studies reporting the current treatment process and medications (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, and immunomodulatory agents) for COVID-19. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to calculate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The outcomes of this study were the frequency of negative conversion cases, clinical improvements, mechanical ventilation demand, intensive care unit (ICU) entry, and mortality. The standard treatment refers to the published guidelines and specialist experience which varies in different articles, and the proposed treatment refers to the kind of interest suggested in the included studies. RESULTS: A number of 45 articles met the eligibility criteria (out of 6793 articles). Among them, 26 articles involving 3263 patients were included in quantitative analysis. Anti-COVID-19 interventions could significantly increase clinical improvement (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.27; I2 = 49.8%) and reduce the mortality rate (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.95; I2 = 74.8%). Although in terms of negative conversion, ICU entry, and mechanical ventilation demand, clinical intervention had no beneficial effect. The clinical effect of immunomodulatory agents (especially tocilizumab and anakinra) was noticeable compared to other medications with RR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.09-0.53; I2 = 40.9%) for mortality and 1.25 (95% CI 1.07-1.46; I2 = 45.4%) for clinical improvement. Moreover, Antivirals (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26; I2 = 47.0%) and convalescent plasma therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.98; I2 = 66.6%) had significant beneficial effects on clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, all the included interventions significantly declined the mortality and enhanced clinical improvements with no effect on negative conversion and mechanical ventilation demand. Especially, immunomodulators and plasma therapy showed favorable outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa. We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV, tuberculosis and COVID-19 death from 1 March-9 June 2020 among (i) public sector ""active patients"" (&#8805;1 visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs. negative adults using modelled population estimates. RESULTS: Among 3,460,932 patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died. COVID-19 death was associated with male sex, increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. HIV was associated with COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-2.70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression. Current and previous tuberculosis were associated with COVID-19 death (aHR [95%CI] 2.70 [1.81-4.04] and 1.51 [1.18-1.93] respectively). The SMR for COVID-19 death associated with HIV was 2.39 (95%CI 1.96-2.86); population attributable fraction 8.5% (95%CI 6.1-11.1). CONCLUSION: While our findings may over-estimate HIV- and tuberculosis-associated COVID-19 mortality risks due to residual confounding, both HIV and current tuberculosis were independently associated with increased COVID-19 mortality.

235467,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in cancer diagnosis in the first and second waves in one of the most affected cancer areas in the city of Madrid (Spain),2021,"BACKGROUND: Allocation of adequate healthcare facilities is one of the most important factors that public health policymakers consider when preparing for infectious disease outbreaks. Negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) are one of the critical resources for control of infectious respiratory diseases, such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. However, there is insufficient attention to efficient allocation of NPIR-equipped hospitals. METHODS: We aim to explore any insufficiency and spatial disparity of NPIRs in South Korea in response to infectious disease outbreaks based on a simple analytic approach. We examined the history of installing NPIRs in South Korea between the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) in 2015 to evaluate the allocation process and spatial distribution of NPIRs across the country. Then, for two types of infectious diseases (a highly contagious disease like COVID-19 vs. a hospital-based transmission like MERS-Cov), we estimated the level of disparity between NPIR capacity and demand at the sub-regional level in South Korea by applying the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. RESULTS: Geospatial information system (GIS) mapping reveals a substantial shortage and misallocation of NPIRs, indicating that the Korean government should consider a simple but evidence-based spatial method to identify the areas that need NPIRs most and allocate funds wisely. The 2SFCA method suggests that, despite the recent addition of NPIRs across the country, there should still be more NPIRs regardless of the spread pattern of the disease. It also illustrates high levels of regional disparity in allocation of those facilities in preparation for an infectious disease, due to the lack of evidence-based approach. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of evidence-based decision-making processes in allocating public health facilities, as misallocation of facilities could impede the responsiveness of the public health system during an epidemic. This study provides some evidence to be used to allocate the resources for NPIRs, the urgency of which is heightened in the face of rapidly evolving threats from the novel COVID-19 outbreak.","Kim, Hyoungah; Kim, Dohyeong; Paul, Christopher; Lee, Chang Kil",Int. j. health policy manag,,167

It is a bane of the \""uber connected world that we live in that this virus has affected almost all countries and caused mortality and economic upheaval at a scale whose effects are going to be felt for generations to come. While we can all be buoyed at the pace at which vaccines have been developed and brought to market, there are still challenges ahead for all countries to get their populations vaccinated equitably and effectively. This paper provides an overview of ongoing immunization efforts in various countries. In this early draft, we have identified a few key factors that we use to review different countries' current COVID-19 immunization strategies and their strengths and draw conclusions so that policymakers worldwide can learn from them. Our paper focuses on processes related to vaccine approval, allocation and prioritization, distribution strategies, population to vaccine ratio, vaccination governance, accessibility and use of digital solutions, and government policies.

Here, we investigated the clinical features of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients with and without diabetes and identified risk factors for death of these patients. Methods: The medical records including epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 49 critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients were collected and analyzed in Huanggang City and Xiaogan City, Hubei Province, outside Wuhan. Results: Sixty-seven percent (33) of patients survived and 33% (16) of patients died in 49 critically ill patients (32 men, 17 women), with a median age of 63 years (IQR 53-73). Univariate analyses indicated that the deceased patients were more often associated with two or more comorbidities, one or more gastrointestinal symptoms, high neutrophil percentage, low lymphocytes and lymphocyte percentage, high C-reactive protein, high procalcitonin, high fasting blood glucose (FBG), and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with the survivors; moreover, the patients with T2DM had the higher neutrophil percentage, the lower lymphocyte percentage, and the higher levels of FBG and LDH compared with the patients without T2DM. Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that gastrointestinal symptoms (&#8805; 1 symptoms), decreased lymphocytes (< 1.1 × 109/L), and increased FBG (&#8805; 7.0 mmol/L) were the independent risk factors for death of critically ill patients. Conclusions: Critically ill COVID patients with T2DM had more severe damages of the lymphocytes, islet cells, and heart function, and gastrointestinal symptoms, lymphopenia, and increased FBG may be early predictors for poor prognosis.

236176,The Effective Management of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Delivered by In-person and Virtual Group Consultations: Results and Reflections from a Phase One Service Delivery,2021,"Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) is an enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology that supports long-range, low-power, and low-cost connectivity to numerous devices. To avoid the crowd in the limited ISM band (where most LPWANs operate) and cost of licensed band, the recently proposed SNOW (Sensor Network over White Spaces) is a promising LPWAN platform that operates over the TV white spaces. As it is a very recent technology and is still in its infancy, the current SNOW implementation uses the USRP devices as LPWAN nodes, which has high costs (~$750 USD per device) and large form-factors, hindering its applicability in practical deployment. In this paper, we implement SNOW using low-cost, low form-factor, low-power, and widely available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices to enable its practical and large-scale deployment. Our choice of the COTS device (TI CC13x0: CC1310 or CC1350) consequently brings down the cost and form-factor of a SNOW node by 25x and 10x, respectively. Such implementation of SNOW on the CC13x0 devices, however, faces a number of challenges to enable link reliability and communication range. Our implementation addresses these challenges by handling peak-to-average power ratio problem, channel state information estimation, carrier frequency offset estimation, and near-far power problem. Our deployment in the city of Detroit, Michigan demonstrates that CC13x0-based SNOW can achieve uplink and downlink throughputs of 11.2kbps and 4.8kbps per node, respectively, over a distance of 1km. Also, the overall throughput in the uplink increases linearly with the increase in the number of SNOW nodes.","Rahman, Mahbubur; Ismail, Dali; Modekurthy, Venkata P; Saifullah, Abusayeed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00302v1.pdf,167

Focusing on native and foreign-born racial/ethnic minorities, this article discusses how entrenched health inequities and structural discrimination have led to COVID-19 morbidities and mortalities. Considering that ""essential"" frontline workers are disproportionately native and foreign-born racial/ethnic minorities, this work evaluates the impact(s) of social exclusion and the lack of support systems for these workers.

People with diabetes who contract COVID-19 are likely to experience more serious symptoms than patients without diabetes. This article presents new research about the epidemiology of COVID-19 in a group of patients with diabetes. It details the mortality and prognosis in such patients, as well as the relationship between COVID-19 and the diseases most often coexisting with diabetes: obesity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and increased risk for infection. It also details how the virus infects and affects patients with hyperglycemia. The context of glycation and receptors for advanced glycation products (RAGE) seems to be of particular importance here. We also present a hypothesis related to the cause-and-effect axis-it turns out that diabetes can be both the cause of the more difficult course of COVID-19 and the result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The last part of this article discusses the impact of antihyperglycemic drugs on the development of COVID-19 and other pharmacological implications, including which non-classical antihyperglycemic drugs seem to be effective in both the treatment of coronavirus infection and glucose homeostasis, and what strategies related to RAGE and glycation should be considered.","Abramczyk, Urszula; Kuzan, Aleksandra",,,167

Initial clinical data imply that cancer patients are particularly at risk for a severe course of SARS-CoV-2. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), infections are a main contributor to morbidity and mortality driven by an impaired immune system. Treatment initiation is likely to induce immune modulation that further increases the risk for severe infections.

239188,"Don't panic, it is only an emergency",2020,"There are no approved vaccines against the life-threatening Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Attenuated vaccines have proven their potential to induce strong and long-lasting immune responses. We have previously described that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) protein is a virulence factor. Based on this knowledge, a collection of mutants carrying partial deletions spanning the C-terminal domain of the E protein (rMERS-CoV-E*) has been generated using a reverse genetics system. One of these mutants, MERS-CoV-E*&#916;2in, was attenuated and provided full protection in a challenge with virulent MERS-CoV after a single immunization dose. The MERS-CoV-E*&#916;2in mutant was stable as it maintained its attenuation after 16 passages in cell cultures and has been selected as a promising vaccine candidate.IMPORTANCE The emergence of the new highly pathogenic human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has already infected more than 80 million persons, killing nearly two million of them, clearly indicates the need to design efficient and safe vaccines protecting from these coronaviruses. Modern vaccines can be derived from virus-host interaction research directed to the identification of signaling pathways essential for virus replication and for virus-induced pathogenesis, in order to learn how to attenuate these viruses and design vaccines. Using a reverse genetics system developed in our laboratory, an infectious cDNA clone of MERS-CoV was engineered. Using this cDNA, we sequentially deleted several predicted and conserved motifs within the envelope (E) protein of MERS-CoV, previously associated with the presence of virulence factors. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation of these deletion mutants highlighted the relevance of predicted linear motifs in viral pathogenesis. Two of them, an Atg8 protein binding motif (Atg8-BM), and a forkhead-associated binding motif (FHA-BM), when deleted, rendered an attenuated virus that was evaluated as a vaccine candidate, leading to full protection against challenge with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. This approach can be extended to the engineering of vaccines protecting against the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2.","Gutiérrez-Álvarez, Javier; Honrubia, José M; Fernández-Delgado, Raúl; Wang, Li; Castaño-Rodríguez, Carlos; Zúñiga, Sonia; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis",mBio (Online),,167

METHODS: A cohort study was conducted that included patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the Tunisian national containment center. Follow-up consisted of a weekly RT-PCR test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors associated with negative RNA conversion. RESULTS: Among the 264 patients included, the median duration of viral clearance was 20 days (interquartile range (IQR) 17-32 days). The shortest duration was 9 days and the longest was 58 days. Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA were symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and shortness of breath (hazard ratio (HR) 0.600, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.401-0.897) and face mask use when exposed to COVID-19 cases (HR 2.006, 95% CI 1.247-3.228). The median time to RNA viral conversion was 18 days (IQR 16-21 days) when using masks versus 23 days (IQR 17-36 days) without wearing masks, and 24 days (IQR 18-36 days) for symptomatic patients versus 20 days (IQR 16-30 days) for asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, having symptoms delayed viral clearance, while wearing masks accelerated this conversion. These factors should be taken into consideration for the strategy of isolating infected patients.","Bennasrallah, Cyrine; Zemni, Imen; Dhouib, Wafa; Sriha, Haythem; Mezhoud, Nourhene; Bouslama, Samar; Taboubi, Wael; Beji, Meriem Oumaima; Kacem, Meriem; Abroug, Hela; Fredj, Manel Ben; Loussaief, Chawki; Belguith, Asma Sriha",Int J Infect Dis,,167

Whether this represented a transient ""lockdown and fear"" phenomenon, or a more persisting trend, is unknown. We divided acute from post-wave changes in ED flows, diagnoses, and hospital admissions, in an Italian city experiencing a FW peak followed by nadir. This multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study involved five general EDs of a large Italian city (January-August 2020). Percent changes were calculated versus 2019, using four 14-day periods (FW peak, early/mid/late post-wave). ED visits were 147,446 in 2020, versus 214,868 in 2019. During the FW peak, visits were reduced by 66.4% (P < 0.001). The drop was maximum during daytime (69.8%) and for pediatric patients (89.4%). Critical triage codes were unchanged. Reductions were found for all non-COVID-19 diagnoses. Non-COVID-19 hospital admissions were reduced by 39.5% (P < 0.001), involving all conditions except hematologic, metabolic/endocrine, respiratory diseases, and traumas. In the early, mid, and late post-wave periods, visits were reduced by 25.4%, 25.3% and 23.5% (all P < 0.001) respectively. In the late period, reduction was greater for female (27.9%) and pediatric patients (44.6%). Most critical triage codes were unchanged. Oncological, metabolic/endocrine, and hematological diagnoses were unchanged, while other diagnoses had persistent reductions. Non-COVID-19 hospital admissions were reduced by 12.8% (P = 0.001), 6.3% (P = 0.1) and 12.2% (P = 0.001), respectively.

Here, we report the case of a patient who developed simultaneous bilateral retinal artery occlusion following COVID-19 infection.Case Report: A 42-year-old male with no systemic co-morbidities presented with sudden, painless loss of vision in both eyes. Fundoscopy showed retinal edema and cherry-red spots in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography showed reperfusion, absence of choroidal ischemia, and Optical Coherence Tomography showed thickened inner retinal layers suggestive of retinal edema and the outer retinal layers appeared intact. Blood investigations for vasculitis, coagulation profile, lipids, and homocysteine level were within normal limits.Conclusion: COVID-19 patients may develop a systemic coagulopathy and acquired thrombophilia characterized by a tendency for venous, arterial, and microvascular thrombosis. This hypercoagulable state is believed to be a hyperinflammatory response; physicians and ophthalmologists, alike, should be aware of these possible long-term sequelae.","Bapaye, Maneesh M; Nair, Akshay Gopinathan; Bapaye, Charuta M; Bapaye, Meena M; Shukla, Juilee J",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,,167

243283,Dealing with lung cancer in the COVID-19 scenario (A review),2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the disease-causing pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pregnant women are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 disease and are at higher risk for preterm birth compared to uninfected pregnant women. Despite this evidence, the immunological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 among pregnant and non-pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and non-pregnant (n=17) women who had either tested positive (pregnant n=22; non-pregnant n=17) or negative for SARS-CoV-2 (pregnant n=11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine mRNAs, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. Additionally, we evaluated anti-spike (S) IgG, anti-S-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma collected from non-pregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 positive pregnant women expressed more IL1ß, but not IL6, in blood samples collected within 14 days versus > 14 days after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test. Pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection also had reduced anti-S-RBD IgG titers and were less likely to have detectable nAb as compared with non-pregnant women. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection did not disrupt FcRn expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of SARS-CoV-2 nAb was inhibited by infection during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of COVID-19 therapeutics in pregnancy. The long-term implications of placental inflammation for neonatal health also requires greater consideration.","Sherer, Morgan L; Lei, Jun; Creisher, Patrick; Jang, Minyoung; Reddy, Ramya; Voegtline, Kristin; Olson, Sarah; Littlefield, Kirsten; Park, Han-Sol; Ursin, Rebecca L; Ganesan, Abhinaya; Boyer, Theresa; Elsayed, Nada; Brown, Diane M; Walch, Samantha N; Antar, Annukka A R; Manabe, Yukari C; Jones-Beatty, Kimberly; Christopher Golden, William; Satin, Andrew J; Sheffield, Jeanne S; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L; Burd, Irina",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,167
243564,Estimating the Efficiency Gain of Covariate-Adjusted Analyses in Future Clinical Trials Using External Data,2021,"There is currently increasing interest internationally in deploying robotic applications for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing, as these can help to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to health care staff and patients. We provide an overview of key recent developments in this area. We argue that, although there is some potential for deploying robots to help with SARS-CoV-2 testing, the potential of patient-facing applications is likely to be limited. This is due to the high costs associated with patient-facing functionality, and risks of potentially adverse impacts on health care staff work practices and patient interactions. In contrast, back-end laboratory-based robots dealing with sample extraction and amplification, that effectively integrate with established processes, software, and interfaces to process samples, are much more likely to result in safety and efficiency gains. Consideration should therefore be given to deploying these at scale.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Ramalingam, Sandeep; Sheikh, Aziz",J Med Internet Res,,167

245904,Vitamin D3 as Potential Treatment Adjuncts for COVID-19,2020,"Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection (IFI) due to several species of saprophytic fungi, occurring in patients with underlying co-morbidities (including organ transplantation). During the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been increasing reports of bacterial and fungal co-infections occurring in COVID-19 patients, including COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We describe a case of mucormycosis occurring after COVID-19, in an individual who received a recent heart transplant for severe heart failure. Two months after heart transplant, our patient developed upper respiratory and systemic symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19. He was managed with convalescent plasma therapy and supportive care. Approximately three months after COVID-19 diagnosis, he developed cutaneous mucormycosis at an old intravascular device site. He underwent extensive surgical interventions, combined with broad-spectrum antifungal therapy. Despite the aggressive therapeutic measures, he died after a prolonged hospital stay. In this case report, we also review the prior well-reported cases of mucormycosis occurring in COVID-19 patients and discuss potential mechanisms by which COVID-19 may predispose to IFIs. Similar to CAPA, mucormycosis with COVID-19 may need to be evaluated as an emerging disease association. Clinicians should be vigilant to evaluate for invasive fungal infections such as mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Khatri, Akshay; Chang, Kai-Ming; Berlinrut, Ilan; Wallach, Frances",J Mycol Med,,167
246582,Similarities in Risk for COVID-19 and Cancer Disparities,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), build an early warning model for severe/critical type, and aim at providing reference for the prediction of severe/critical COVID-19. METHODS: The clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated in the Second People' Hospital of Fuyang City from January 20th to February 18th in 2020 were retrospective analyzed, including the demographic and epidemiological date, vital signs and hematology indexes, etc. on admission. Patients were divided into the normal type (set as normal group) and severe/critical type (set as severe group) according to the COVID-19 treatment plan classification standard published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The differences between two groups were compared, and the variables with statistical significance were incorporated in the multivariate binary unconditional Logistic regression analysis to screen the risk factors of severe/critical type. Risk factors were summarized to establish an early warning model, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was carried out to evaluate the significance of the early warning model in the screening of critically COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients with COVID-19 were admitted, including 125 patients of normal type and 30 patients of severe/critical type. (1) Compared with normal group, patients in severe group were older, and with higher proportion of basic diseases, higher body mass index (BMI), higher incidence of tachypnea, persistent high fever, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 0.95, while the white blood cell count (WBC), CD4+T lymphocyte, CD8+T lymphocyte, lymphocyte count (LYM) were decreased obviously, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid a protein (SAA), and CT showed higher incidence of multi-pulmonary lobe lesions. There were no significant differences of gender, travel history from Wuhan, smoking history, shock index (SI) and CD4+/CD8+ ratio between the two groups. (2) Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age &#8805; 60 years old [odds ratio (OR) = 1.620, P = 0.031], combined with underlying diseases (OR = 1.521, P = 0.044), persistent high fever (OR = 2.469, P = 0.014), WBC < 2.0×109/L and/or LYM < 0.4×109/L (OR = 3.079, P = 0.006), pulmonary multilobar lesions (OR = 1.367, P = 0.047), and IL-6 &#8805; 30 ng/L (OR = 2.426, P = 0.010) were the risk factors of severe/critical COVID-19. (3) The OR value corresponding to each risk factors were scored by rounding. Two points were scored for age &#8805; 60 years old, with underlying diseases, persistent high fever and IL-6 &#8805; 30 ng/L, 3 points for WBC < 2.0×109/L and/or LYM < 0.4×109/L, 1 point for pulmonary multilobar lesions, and totally calculated as early warning model scores. The early warning model score of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the normal group (9.33±2.79 vs. 5.04±2.38, t = 9.010, P = 0.001). (4) The ROC curve analysis showed the area under ROC curve (AUC) of early warning model on the early screening of severe/critical patients in COVID-19 was 0.944, and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.903-0.985; and the sensitivity and specificity were 93.3% and 72.0% respectively while the cut-off was 6.5. CONCLUSIONS: There are many differences between severe/critical and mild COVID-19 patients. The establishment of early warning model could help to screen severe/critical patients at an early stage, with certain significance for guiding treatment.","Xu, Jing; Zhao, Fengde; Han, Mingfeng; Ma, Lei; Zhang, Ting",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,167

246663,Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Rapid antigen tests hold much promise for use in the school environment. However, the performance of these tests in non-clinical settings and among one of the main target populations in schools-asymptomatic children-is unclear. To address this gap, we examined the positive and negative concordance between the BinaxNOW&#8482; rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay and an RT-PCR test among children at a community-based Covid-19 testing site. METHODS: We conducted rapid antigen (BinaxNOW&#8482;) and oral fluid RT-PCR (Curative Labs) tests on children presenting at a walk-up testing site in Los Angeles County from November 25, 2020 to December 9, 2020. Positive concordance was determined as the fraction of RT-PCR positive participants that were also antigen positive. Negative concordance was determined as the fraction of RT-PCR negative participants that were also antigen negative. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between positive or negative concordance and participant age, race-ethnicity, sex at birth, symptoms and Ct values. RESULTS: 226 children tested positive on RT-PCR; 127 children or 56.2% (95% CI: 49.5% to 62.8%) of these also tested positive on the rapid antigen test. Positive concordance was higher among symptomatic children (64.4%; 95% CI: 53.4% to 74.4%) compared to asymptomatic children (51.1%; 95% CI: 42.5% to 59.7%). Positive concordance was negatively associated with Ct values and was 93.8% (95% CI: 69.8% to 99.8%) for children with Ct values less than or equal to 25. 548 children tested negative on RT-PCR; 539 or 98.4% (95% CI: 96.9% to 99.2%) of these also tested negative on the rapid antigen test. Negative concordance was higher among asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid antigen testing can successfully identify most COVID infections in children with viral load levels likely to be infectious. Serial rapid testing may help compensate for limited sensitivity in early infection.","Sood, Neeraj; Shetgiri, Rashmi; Rodriguez, Anna; Jimenez, Dianna; Treminino, Sonia; Daflos, Amanda; Simon, Paul",PLoS One,,167

AIM To see the association of mesenteric ischemia with COVID-19. METHODS After initial screening and filtering of the titles on PubMed and Google Scholar, 124 articles were selected. Articles were read in full, and the references were skimmed for relevance. Twenty-six articles (case reports and case series) were found to eligible for inclusion. References of these 26 articles were checked for any additional cases. Two more publications were found, and a total of 28 articles (22 case reports and 6 case series) have been included for review in this manuscript. RESULTS A total of 41 cases of acute mesenteric ischemia in COVID-19 patients have been reported in the literature since the outbreak of this pandemic. Most of them include patients with comorbidities. CONCLUSION In conclusion, based on this literature review and precise published knowledge regarding acute mesenteric ischemia in patients with COVID-19, it is essential to understand its relevance in all patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. The threshold for the diagnostic investigations should also be kept low for the timely diagnosis and management of this disorder. ©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

252901,The pathophysiology of 'happy' hypoxemia in COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens to overwhelm our medical infrastructure at the regional level causing spikes in mortality rates because of shortages of critical equipment, like ventilators. Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.","Pearce, Joshua M",F1000Res,,167

254317,Can existing routine clinical data be used to predict hypoxaemia for mnd patients undertaking commercial flight?,2021,"DNA-encoded chemical libraries are collections of compounds individually coupled to unique DNA tags serving as amplifiable identification barcodes. By bridging split-and-pool combinatorial synthesis with the ligation of unique encoding DNA oligomers, million- to billion-member libraries can be synthesized for use in hundreds of healthcare target screens. Although structural diversity and desirable molecular property ranges generally guide DNA-encoded chemical library design, recent reports have highlighted the utility of focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries that are structurally biased for a class of protein targets. Herein, a protease-focused DNA-encoded chemical library was designed that utilizes chemotypes known to engage conserved catalytic protease residues. The three-cycle library features functional moieties such as guanidine, which interacts strongly with aspartate of the protease catalytic triad, as well as mild electrophiles such as sulfonamide, urea, and carbamate. We developed a DNA-compatible method for guanidinylation of amines and reduction of nitriles. Employing these optimized reactions, we constructed a 9.8-million-membered DNA-encoded chemical library. Affinity selection of the library with thrombin, a common protease, revealed a number of enriched features which ultimately led to the discovery of a 1 nM inhibitor of thrombin. Thus, structurally focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries have tremendous potential to find clinically useful high-affinity hits for the rapid discovery of drugs for targets (e.g., proteases) with essential functions in infectious diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and relevant healthcare conditions (e.g., male contraception).","Dawadi, Surendra; Simmons, Nicholas; Miklossy, Gabriella; Bohren, Kurt M; Faver, John C; Ucisik, Melek Nihan; Nyshadham, Pranavanand; Yu, Zhifeng; Matzuk, Martin M",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,167

To avoid the virus transmission, healthcare workers (HCWs) must wear adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE is associated with several side events, including skin reactions. The objective of this study is to summarize the prevalence, type and risk factors for cutaneous adverse events related to PPE and prevention measures to avoid them. A systematic review and metanalysis was conducted using Medline, Scopus and Embase databases from conception to 21st January 2021. All types of epidemiological studies regarding skin adverse events related to PPE were included. The literature search identified 1,007 references, 35 of them met the eligible criteria and were included for analysis, representing 31,453 participants. The media of skin side events related to PPE was 75.13%. The rate of cutaneous adverse events related to mask was 57.71% and those associated with gloves and hand hygiene products was 49.16%. Most common skin adverse events were contact dermatitis, acne and itching. The most damaged anatomical regions were the nasal bridge, the cheeks and the hands. The duration of PPE wearing was the most common risk factor. Frequent hand washing, gloves and masks were the agents most frequently related to skin reactions. N95 respirators were the most harmful mask type for the skin. Hydrocolloid use prevented from developing skin adverse events related to masks. In conclusion, the rate of cutaneous adverse events related to PPE use is high. A longer duration of PPE wearing was the most common risk factor. Using hydrocolloid could prevent from skin injuries related to mask use.","Montero-Vilchez, Trinidad; Cuenca-Barrales, Carlos; Martinez-Lopez, Antonio; Molina-Leyva, Alejandro; Arias-Santiago, Salvador",J.

However, little is known about the role of Coronin 3 in glioma tumorigenesis. Here, we aimed to explore the biological function and regulatory mechanism of Coronin 3 in glioblastoma (GBM). Materials and Methods: Coronin 3 level in human GBM clinical samples and cell lines was investigated. The shRNA knockdown strategy was used to assess the tumor characteristics of GBM cell lines. The role of ß-catenin in Coronin 3-mediated oncogenic phenotypes was evaluated. Results: Coronin 3 was found to be highly upregulated in glioma cell lines. Furthermore, knockdown of Coronin 3 significantly inhibited the growth of glioma cells both in vivo and in vitro and suppressed the expression of Wnt/ß-catenin pathway genes, including ß-catenin, Cyclin D1, and c-Myc. Moreover, we demonstrated that Coronin 3 regulates the expression of ß-catenin in glioma. Our results revealed that Coronin 3-stimulated tumor growth was ß-catenin-dependent. Conclusion: Our study reveals a new molecular mechanism of Coronin 3 in promoting glioma growth and development through regulating the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway.","Wang, Min; Li, Qi; Yu, Shengyuan; Zhang, Zexiang; Qiu, Peng; Zhang, Yubao; Yang, Wei; Xu, Guangming; Xu, Tongjiang",Onco Targets Ther,,167
258707,"Clinical Audit on Current Practice of Anesthesia Machine Check and Equipment Preparedness Before Use in Debre Berhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, North Shewa, Ethiopia, 2020",2021,"BACKGROUND: The first national severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serosurvey in India, done in May-June, 2020, among adults aged 18 years or older from 21 states, found a SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seroprevalence of 0·73% (95% CI 0·34-1·13). We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India. METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3-5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys. FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29â082 individuals from 15â613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 6·6% (95% CI 5·8-7·4). Among 15â084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 7·1% (6·2-8·2). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations. Seroprevalence was highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas. We estimated a cumulative 74·3 million infections in the country by Aug 18, 2020, with 26-32 infections for every reported COVID-19 case. INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older in India had SARS-CoV-2 infection by Aug 18, 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased approximately tenfold between May and August, 2020. Lower infection-to-case ratio in August than in May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country.

The pivotal targets of puerarin to treat COVID-19 were identified and included the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), tumour protein p53 (TP53), caspase 3 (CASP3), RELA proto-oncogene (RELA), Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), caspase 8 (CASP8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), interleukin 2 (IL2), protein kinase CB (PRKCB), B cell lymphoma/leukaemia gene-2 (BCL2), protein kinase CA (PRKCA), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). Functionally, the anti-COVID-19 action of puerarin was associated with the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades, and cell apoptosis. The signalling pathways of puerarin to treat COVID-19 included modulation of the pathways of apoptosis, IL-17 signalling, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and TNF signalling. Molecular docking data illustrated the binding capacity of puerarin with COVID-19 and the effective anti-COVID-19 activity of puerarin. Taken together, our current network pharmacology-based findings revealed the pharmacological role of puerarin in the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, the bioinformatic findings elucidated that some of these pivotal targets might serve as potential molecular markers for detecting COVID-19.","Qin, Xingyue; Huang, Chen; Wu, Ka; Li, Yu; Liang, Xiao; Su, Min; Li, Rong",J. cell. mol. med,,167

261383,Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the level of distress in patients with breast cancer,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although generally known as a human commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause nosocomial infections related to foreign body materials and immunocompromized patients. Infections are often caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineages that are difficult and costly to treat, and can have a major adverse impact on patients' quality of life. Heterogeneity is a common phenomenon in both carriage and infection, but present methodology for detection of this is laborious or expensive. In this study, we present a culture-independent method, labelled Epidome, based on an amplicon sequencing-approach to deliver information beyond species level on primary samples and to elucidate clonality, population structure and temporal stability or niche selection of S. epidermidis communities. RESULTS: Based on an assessment of > 800 genes from the S. epidermidis core genome, we identified genes with variable regions, which in combination facilitated the differentiation of phylogenetic clusters observed in silico, and allowed classification down to lineage level. A duplex PCR, combined with an amplicon sequencing protocol, and a downstream analysis pipeline were designed to provide subspecies information from primary samples. Additionally, a probe-based qPCR was designed to provide valuable absolute abundance quantification of S. epidermidis. The approach was validated on isolates representing skin commensals and on genomic mock communities with a sensitivity of < 10 copies/µL. The method was furthermore applied to a sample set of primary skin and nasal samples, revealing a high degree of heterogeneity in the S. epidermidis populations. Additionally, the qPCR showed a high degree of variation in absolute abundance of S. epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The Epidome method is designed for use on primary samples to obtain important information on S. epidermidis abundance and diversity beyond species-level to answer questions regarding the emergence and dissemination of nosocomial lineages, investigating clonality of S. epidermidis communities, population dynamics, and niche selection. Our targeted-sequencing method allows rapid differentiation and identification of clinically important nosocomial lineages in low-biomass samples such as skin samples.","Rendboe, Amalie Katrine; Johannesen, Thor Bech; Ingham, Anna Cäcilia; Månsson, Emeli; Iversen, Søren; Baig, Sharmin; Edslev, Sofie; Jensen, Jørgen Skov; Söderquist, Bo; Andersen, Paal Skytt; Stegger, Marc",BMC Microbiol,,167

263955,How Can Alternative Exercise Traditions Help Against the Background of the COVID-19 in Cancer Care? An Overview of Systematic Reviews,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: COVID-19, considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization, overwhelmed hospitals in the USA. In parallel to the growing pandemic, alcohol sales grew in the USA, with people stockpiling alcohol. Alcohol-induced blackouts are one particularly concerning consequence of heavy drinking, and the extent to which blackout prevalence may change in the context of a pandemic is unknown. The purpose of the current study is to describe the prevalence of publicly available tweets in the USA referencing alcohol-induced blackouts prior to and during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Crimson Hexagon's ForSight tool to access all original English tweets written in the USA that referenced alcohol-related blackouts in 2019 and 2020. Using infoveillance methods, we tracked changes in the number and proportion of tweets about blackouts. RESULTS: More alcohol-related blackout tweets were written between 13 March and 24 April in 2020 than 2019. In addition, a greater proportion of all tweets referenced blackouts in 2020 than in 2019. In the period prior to the 'stay at home' orders (January to mid-March), the proportion of blackout tweets were higher in 2020 than 2019. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that references to high-risk drinking persist during the pandemic despite restrictions on large social gatherings. Given that the internet is a common source of information for COVID-19, the frequent posting about blackouts during this period might normalise the behaviour. This is concerning because alcohol use increases susceptibility to COVID-19, and alcohol-related mortality can further tax hospital resources.","Ward, Rose Marie; Riordan, Benjamin C; Merrill, Jennifer E; Raubenheimer, Jacques",Drug alcohol rev,,167
264133,Extracellular HMGB1: a therapeutic target in severe pulmonary inflammation including COVID-19?,2020,"[ABSTRACT]. Objective. To assess the association between drinking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine, anxiety symptoms, and sociodemographic characteristics in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Method. Data was collected through a cross‐sectional online survey (non-probabilistic sample) conducted by the Pan American Health Organization between May 22 and June 30, 2020, in 33 countries and two territories of LAC. Participants were 18 years of age or older and must not have traveled outside of their country since March 15, 2020 (n= 12 328, M age= 38.1 years, 65% female). Four drinking behaviors (online socializing drinking [OSD], drinking with child present [DCP], drinking before 5 p.m. [DB5]), heavy episodic drinking [HED]) were response variables, and quarantining, anxiety symptoms and sociodemographic covariables were explanatory variables. Results. Quarantine was positively associated with a higher frequency of OSD and with DCP, but negatively associated with a higher frequency of HED. Anxiety symptoms were associated with a higher frequency of HED, more OSD, and DB5. Higher incomes seemed to be more associated with all the studied drinking behaviors. Women tended to report less DB5 and less HED during the pandemic. Conclusions. Quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to affect drinking behavior and mental health indicators like anxiety symptoms. This study is the first effort to measure the consequences of the quarantine on alcohol consumption and mental health in LAC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the associations found, screenings and brief interventions targeting alcohol consumption and mental health are recommended.","Garcia-Cerde, Rodrigo; Valente, Juliana Y.; Sohi, Ivneet; Falade, Rachael; Sanchez, Zila M.; Monteiro, Maristela G.",Rev. panam. salud pública,,167

266166,Experience With Barrier Enclosure Device During Flexible Bronchoscopy,2021,"The promise of genetic therapies has turned into reality in recent years, with new first-line treatments for fatal diseases now available to patients. The development and testing of genetic therapies for respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) has also progressed. The addition of gene editing to the genetic agent toolbox, and its early success in other organ systems, suggests we will see rapid expansion of gene correction options for CF in the future. Although substantial progress has been made in creating techniques and genetic agents that can be highly effective for CF correction in vitro, physiologically relevant functional in vivo changes have been largely prevented by poor delivery efficiency within the lungs. Somewhat hidden from view, however, is the absence of reliable, accurate, detailed, and noninvasive outcome measures that can detect subtle disease and treatment effects in the lungs of humans or animal models. The ability to measure the fundamental function of the lung-ventilation, the effective transport of air throughout the lung-has been constrained by the available measurement technologies. Without sensitive measurement methods, it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of genetic therapies for CF. The mainstays of lung health assessment are spirometry, which cannot provide adequate disease localization and is not sensitive enough to detect small early changes in disease; and computed tomography, which provides structural rather than functional information. Magnetic resonance imaging using hyperpolarized gases is increasingly useful for lung ventilation assessment, and it removes the radiation risk that accompanies X-ray methods. A new lung imaging technique, X-ray velocimetry, can now offer highly detailed regional lung ventilation information well suited to the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring needs of CF lung disease, particularly after the application of genetic therapies. In this review, we discuss the options now available for imaging-based lung function measurement in the generation and use of genetic and other therapies for treating CF lung disease.","Parsons, David; Donnelley, Martin",Hum. gene ther,,167

269051,"The cytokine storms of COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, CRS and MAS compared. Can one sized treatment fit all?",2021,"This study attempts an integrated analysis of the health and economic aspects of COVID-19 that is based on publicly available data from a wide range of data sources. The analysis is done keeping in mind the close interaction between the health and economic shocks of COVID-19. The study combines descriptive and qualitative approaches using figures and graphs with quantitative methods that estimate the plotted relationships and econometric estimation that attempts to explain cross-country variation in COVID-19 incidence, deaths and 'case fatality rates'. The study seeks to answer a set of questions on COVID-19 such as: what are the economic effects of COVID-19, focussing on international inequality and global poverty? How effective was lockdown in curbing COVID-19? What was the effect of lockdown on economic growth? Did the stimulus packages work in delinking the health shocks from the economic ones? Did 'better governed countries' with greater public trust and those with superior health care fare better than others? Did countries that have experienced previous outbreaks such as SARS fare better than those who have not? The study provides mixed messages on the effectiveness of lockdowns in controlling COVID-19. While several countries, especially in the East Asia and Pacific region, have used it quite effectively recording low infection rates going into lockdown and staying low after the lockdown, the two spectacular failures are Brazil and India. In contrast to lockdown, the evidence on the effectiveness of stimulus programs in avoiding recession and promoting growth is unequivocal. The effectiveness is much greater in the case of emerging/developing economies than in the advanced economies. Multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF need to work out a coordinated strategy to declare immediate debt relief and provide additional liquidity to the poorer economies to help them announce effective stimulus measures. COVID-19 will lead to a large increase in the global pool of those living in 'extreme poverty'. A poignant feature of our results is that while a significant share of health shocks from COVID-19 is borne by the advanced economies, the burden of 'COVID-19 poverty' will almost exclusively fall on two of the poorest regions, namely, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.","Ray, Ranjan; Kumar, Sanjesh",Indian Econ Rev,,167

Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively. A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak. Students from Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences & Law showed higher scores related to anxiety, depression, stress and impact of event with respect to students from Engineering & Architecture. University staff presented lower scores in all measures compared to students, who seem to have suffered an important psychological impact during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. In order to provide timely crisis-oriented psychological services and to take preventive measures in future pandemic situations, mental health in university students should be carefully monitored.","Odriozola-González, Paula; Planchuelo-Gómez, Álvaro; Irurtia, María Jesús; de Luis-García, Rodrigo",Psychiatry Res,,167
269666,Impact of COVID-19 on breast imaging case volumes in South Florida: A multicenter study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only changed the private lives of millions of people but has significantly affected the collaboration of medical specialists throughout health care systems worldwide. Hospitals are making changes to their regular operations to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while ensuring the treatment of emergency patients. These substantial changes affect the typical work setting of clinicians and require the implementation of organizational arrangements. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to increase our understanding of how digital transformation drives virtual collaboration among clinicians in hospitals in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We present the lessons learned from an exploratory case study in which we observed the introduction of an information technology (IT) system for enhancing collaboration among clinicians in a German hospital. The results are based on 16 semistructured interviews with physicians from various departments and disciplines; the interviews were generalized to better understand and interpret the meaning of the statements. RESULTS: Three key lessons and recommendations explain how digital transformation ensures goal-driven collaboration among clinicians. First, we found that implementing a disruptive change requires alignment of the mindsets of the stakeholders. Second, IT-enabled collaboration presupposes behavioral rules that must be followed. Third, transforming antiquated processes demands a suitable technological infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: Digital transformation is being driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rapid introduction of IT-enabled collaboration reveals grievances concerning the digital dissemination of medical information along the patient treatment path. To avoid being caught unprepared by future crises, digital transformation must be further driven to ensure collaboration, and the diagnostic and therapeutic process must be opened to disruptive strategies.","Frick, Nicholas R J; Möllmann, Henriette L; Mirbabaie, Milad; Stieglitz, Stefan",JMIR Med Inform,,167

Four samples display a Ct < 22.0 for the E and RdRp genes while the N gene was not detected, suggesting a variability of the viral sequence. There was no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. The Allplex 2019-nCoV appears as a reliable method, but additional evaluations using more samples are needed.

It prompted a mobilization around the globe to study the underlying pathogen, a close relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Numerous genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are now available and in-depth analyses are advancing. These will allow detailed characterization of sequence and protein functions, including comparative studies. Care should be taken when inferring function from sequence information alone, and reverse genetics systems can be used to unequivocally identify key features. For example, the molecular markers of virulence, host range and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 can be compared to those of related viruses in order to shed light on the biology of this emerging pathogen. Here, we summarize some recent insights from genomic studies and strategies for reverse genetics systems to generate recombinant viruses, which will be useful to investigate viral genome properties and evolution.","Silva, Severino Jefferson Ribeiro da; Germano Mendes, Renata Pessôa; Alves da Silva, Caroline Targino; Lorusso, Alessio; Kohl, Alain; Pena, Lindomar",J Gen Virol,,167

274555,COVID-19 and breast cancer: may the microbiome be the issue?,2020,"ABSTRACT: The Food Safety Modernization Act, specifically the Produce Safety Rule, requires growers to clean and sanitize food contact surfaces to protect against produce contamination. An ATP monitoring device is a potential sanitation tool to monitor the efficacy of an on-farm cleaning and sanitation program that could help growers meet regulatory expectations mandated by the Produce Safety Rule. This ATP monitoring device uses bioluminescence to detect all ATP (found in bacteria and produce matter cells) from a swabbed surface. Because little work has been done to test the efficacy of these tools under postharvest conditions, the present study evaluated ATP measurement for postharvest food contact surface cleanliness evaluation. Concentrations of leafy greens (spinach, romaine, and red cabbage, with or without Listeria innocua) were used as organic matter applied to stainless steel, high-density polyethylene plastic, and bamboo wood coupons to represent postharvest food contact surfaces. The ATP levels on the coupons were then measured by using swabs and an ATP monitoring device. Results showed that the concentration of L. innocua and leafy greens on a food contact surface had a highly significant effect on the ATP monitoring device reading (P < 0.0001). The ATP monitoring device had a lower limit of detection for L. innocua at 4.5 log CFU per coupon. The type of leafy green on a food contact surface did not affect the ATP reading (P = 0.88). Leafy greens with added L. innocua had a higher ATP reading when compared with saline and L. innocua, demonstrating the presence of leafy green matter contributes to ATP reading when combined with L. innocua. The different food contact surfaces had different ATP response readings (P = 0.03), resulting in no detectable levels of bacteria and/or leafy green material from bamboo wood surfaces (P = 0.16). On the basis of our results, the ATP measurement is an appropriate tool to measure produce or bacterial contamination on stainless steel or high-density polyethylene plastic surfaces; however, it is not recommended for wood surfaces.","Lane, Kristin; McLANDSBOROUGH, Lynne A; Autio, Wesley R; Kinchla, Amanda J",J Food Prot,,167

276896,"COVID-19, prevention and treatment with herbal medicine in the herbal markets of Sal & eacute;Prefecture, North-Western Morocco",2021,"In this work, we prepare a PDMS-SiO2-PDA@fabric with high water contact angle (WCA = 155°). Combining dopamine self-polymerization and a sol-gel method, SiO2 is in situ grown on a PDA-modified fabric surface to synergistically construct micro-nano rough structures. Finally, a superhydrophobic fabric is successfully obtained after coating the fabric with a layer of PDMS. The prepared fabric can maintain superhydrophobicity after immersion in various solvents (pH = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, DMF, ethanol, THF, n-hexane) for 24 h and strong ultraviolet irradiation for 60 min. Thanks to the highly reactive PDA clusters, the stronger interfacial bond between the fabric and SiO2 enables it to withstand 180 min of washing and 159.22 N tensile stress, showing strong adhesion strength. In addition, the modified fabric has excellent self-cleaning properties and is resistant to contamination such as milk, coffee and tea. More importantly, the prepared fabric can selectively repel water and adsorb oil, achieving above 90% oil-water separation efficiency even after 8 cycles.","Zhang, Jixi; Zhang, Ligui; Gong, Xiao",Soft matter (Online),,167
277071,EZH2 regulates the correlation between skin regeneration and the duration of mechanical stretch,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a global challenge due to its ability to spread much faster than the SARS-CoV, which was attributed to the mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations enhanced the electrostatic interactions. Recently, a new strain is reported in the UK that includes a mutation (N501Y) in the RBD, that is possibly increasing the infection rate. Here, using Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, we show that the N501 mutation enhanced the electrostatic interactions due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between SARS-CoV-2-T500 and ACE2-D355 near the mutation site. In addition, we observed that the electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the wild type and the mutant are dominated by salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoV-2-K417 and ACE2-D30, SARS-CoV-2-K458, ACE2-E23, and SARS-CoV-2-R403 and ACE2-E37. These interactions contributed more than 40% of the total binding energies.","Ali, Fedaa; Kasry, Amal; Amin, Muhamed",Med Drug Discov,,167
277901,Cover Image,2021,"Protecting foods from contamination applying peptides produced by lactic acid bacteria is a promising strategy to increase the food quality and safety. Interacting with the pathogen membranes might produce visible changes in shape or cell wall damage. Previously, we showed that the peptides produced by Lactobacillus plantarum UTNGt2, Lactobacillus plantarum UTNCys5-4, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis UTNGt28 exhibit a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens in vitro. In this study, their possible mode of action against the commensal microorganism Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ATCC51741 was investigated. The target membrane permeability was determined by detection of beta-galactosidase release from ONPG (o-nitro-phenyl-L-D-galactoside) substrate and changes in the whole protein profile indicating that the peptide extracts destroy the membrane integrity and may induce breaks in membrane proteins to some extent. The release of aromatic molecules such as DNA/RNA was detected after the interaction of Salmonella with the peptide extract. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) micrographs depicted at least four simultaneous secondary events after the peptide extract treatment underlying their antimicrobial actions, including morphological alterations of the membrane. Spheroplast and filament formation, vacuolation, and DNA relaxation were identified as the principal events from the Gt2 and Cys5-4 peptide extracts, while Gt28 induced the formation of ghost cells by release of cytoplasmic content, filaments, and separation of cell envelope layers. Gel retarding assays indicate that the Gt2 and Gt28 peptide extracts are clearly binding the Salmonella DNA, while Cys5-4 partially interacted with Salmonella genomic DNA. These results increased our knowledge about the inhibitory mechanism employed by several peptide extracts from native lactic acid bacteria against Salmonella. Further, we shall develop peptide-based formulation and evaluate their biocontrol effect in the food chains.","Tenea, Gabriela N",Biomed Res Int,,167

Lung ultrasound can provide an early glimpse into the disease process and its severity. The addition of focused echocardiography can be particularly helpful in the haemodynamically compromised patient to detect myocardial involvement and alternative diagnoses. Case: We discuss here a 53-year-old patient who presented to the Emergency Department with hypoxia and hypotension. Bedside focused ultrasound revealed signs of COVID-19 pneumonia with evidence of right ventricular strain, initially thought to be due to massive pulmonary embolism. A computed tomography scan confirmed the findings on ultrasonography, but surprisingly did not demonstrate a pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: Point-of-care ultrasound in COVID-19 aided the diagnosis of affected organs and helped categorise the type of shock in this patient; however, right ventricular dysfunction should be interpreted with caution and may not be due to a pulmonary embolism, as in this case.","Cherian, Nishant; Reynard, Charles; Body, Richard",Ultrasound,,167

Preliminary calculations have been carried out, which have shown the effectiveness of the reimbursement of rental space to enterprises. The basis for such calculations was the concept of increasing tax profits obtained from deductions from enterprises to the regional and federal budgets. The conditions that the company must accept as obligations in case of a positive decision regarding the reimbursement of rent payments from the regional budget are given. Eight indicators have been identified that give a definite economic effect to the regional budget.

281060,Repurposing of histone deacetylase inhibitors: A promising strategy to combat pulmonary fibrosis promoted by TGF-ß signalling in COVID-19 survivors,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patient selection and cannulation arguably represent the key steps for the successful implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Cannulation is traditionally performed in the operating room or the catheterization laboratory for a number of reasons, including physician preference and access to real-time imaging, with the goal of minimizing complications and ensuring appropriate cannula positioning. Nonetheless, the patients' critical and unstable conditions often require emergent initiation of ECMO and preclude the safe transport of the patient to a procedural suite. AIMS: Therefore, with the objective of avoiding delay with the initiation of therapy and reducing the hazard of transport, we implemented a protocol for bedside ECMO cannulation. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 89 patients required ECMO support at Hennepin County Medical Center between March 2015 and December 2019. Twenty-eight (31%) required veno-venous support and were all cannulated at the bedside. Overall survival was 71% with no morbidity or mortality related to the cannulation procedure. CONCLUSION: In the current pandemic, the strategy of veno-venous bedside cannulation may have additional benefits for the care of patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus-disease-2019, decreasing the risk of exposure of health care worker or other patients to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 occurring during patient transport, preparation, or during disinfection of the procedural suite and the transportation pathway after ECMO cannulation.","Calcaterra, Domenico; Heather, Beth; Kohl, Louis P; Erickson, Heidi L; Prekker, Matthew E",J Card Surg,,167

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 11 consecutive patients treated with scanning CIRT for localized prostate cancer in our hospital between December 2015 and January 2016. In-room CT images were taken under treatment conditions in every treatment session. The dose distribution on each in-room CT image was recalculated, while retaining the pencil beam arrangement of the initial treatment plan. Then, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters including the percentage of the clinical target volume (CTV) with 95% and 90% of the prescribed dose area (V95% of CTV, V90% of CTV) and V80% of rectum were calculated. The acceptance criteria for the CTV and rectum were set at V95% of CTV &#8805;95%, V90% of CTV &#8805;98%, and V80% of rectum < 10 ml. RESULTS: V95% of CTV, V90% of CTV, and V80% of rectum for the reproduced plans were 98.8 ± 3.49%, 99.5 ± 2.15%, and 4.39 ± 3.96 ml, respectively.

Leur identification à l’admission faciliterait la prise en charge immédiate. Le « National Early Warning Score 2 » (NEWS2) est un score de stratification des risques chez les patients atteints de septicémie et de pneumonie. L’OMS et le Royal College of Physicians of London (RCP) recommandent l’utilisation du score NEWS2 dans le cadre de la COVID-19 pour la stratification du risque chez les patients. L’objectif de cette étude était d’identifier les patients ayant une forme grave à l’admission aux urgences à l’aide du score NEWS2 au Maroc. Méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude transversale réalisée à l’Hôpital universitaire Cheikh Khalifa de Casablanca, Maroc du 15 avril au 15 juin 2020. Seuls les patients âgés de 18 ans ou plus, avec COVID-19 confirmé par RT-PCR ont été inclus dans cette étude. Les données sociodémographiques et les manifestations cliniques à l’admission ont été collectées et le score NEWS2 a été calculé pour chaque patient. Les patients ayant une forme grave ont été définis comme étant ceux qui sont admis à l’unité de soins intensifs. La régression logistique a été utilisée pour explorer la prédiction de la gravité de la COVID-19 par le Score NEWS2. Résultats Au total, 134 patients ont été retenus dans notre étude avec une moyenne d’âge de 50,8±17,9 dont 54,5 % étaient des hommes, 30,8 % présentaient un état grave. La moyenne d’âge dans le groupe des patients graves était significativement plus élevée que celle dans le groupe non grave (64,20±12,13 versus 44,03±16,66 ans ;p&lt;0,001). La comorbidité était significative chez le groupe des patients graves (75,6 % versus 28,1 % ;p&lt;0,001). La moyenne du score NEWS2 était élevée chez les patients graves comparativement aux non graves (5,9±2,4 versus 1,2±1,5 ;p&lt;0,001). Après ajustement sur les facteurs de confusion, OR ajusté=3,03 (1,85-4,94), p&lt;0,001. Conclusion Nos résultats montrent que le score NEWS2 réalisé à l’admission permet d’identifier les patients présentant des états graves. Il pourrait fournir aux équipes d’urgence un outil complémentaire efficace de stratification des risques pour les patients gravement atteints de la COVID-19.

283191,Nervous System Involvement in COVID-19: a Review of the Current Knowledge,2021,"Our aim was to develop practical models built with simple clinical and radiological features to help diagnosing Coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] in a real-life emergency cohort. To do so, 513 consecutive adult patients suspected of having COVID-19 from 15 emergency departments from 2020-03-13 to 2020-04-14 were included as long as chest CT-scans and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were available (244 [47.6%] with a positive RT-PCR). Immediately after their acquisition, the chest CTs were prospectively interpreted by on-call teleradiologists (OCTRs) and systematically reviewed within one week by another senior teleradiologist. Each OCTR reading was concluded using a 5-point scale: normal, non-infectious, infectious non-COVID-19, indeterminate and highly suspicious of COVID-19. The senior reading reported the lesions' semiology, distribution, extent and differential diagnoses. After pre-filtering clinical and radiological features through univariate Chi-2, Fisher or Student t-tests (as appropriate), multivariate stepwise logistic regression (Step-LR) and classification tree (CART) models to predict a positive RT-PCR were trained on 412 patients, validated on an independent cohort of 101 patients and compared with the OCTR performances (295 and 71 with available clinical data, respectively) through area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC). Regarding models elaborated on radiological variables alone, best performances were reached with the CART model (i.e., AUC = 0.92 [versus 0.88 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.77, specificity = 0.94) while step-LR provided the highest AUC with clinical-radiological variables (AUC = 0.93 [versus 0.86 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.91). Hence, these two simple models, depending on the availability of clinical data, provided high performances to diagnose positive RT-PCR and could be used by any radiologist to support, modulate and communicate their conclusion in case of COVID-19 suspicion. Practically, using clinical and radiological variables (GGO, fever, presence of fibrotic bands, presence of diffuse lesions, predominant peripheral distribution) can accurately predict RT-PCR status.","Schuster, Paul; Crombé, Amandine; Nivet, Hubert; Berger, Alice; Pourriol, Laurent; Favard, Nicolas; Chazot, Alban; Alonzo-Lacroix, Florian; Youssof, Emile; Cheikh, Alexandre Ben; Balique, Julien; Porta, Basile; Petitpierre, François; Bouquet, Grégoire; Mastier, Charles; Bratan, Flavie; Bergerot, Jean-François; Thomson, Vivien; Banaste, Nathan; Gorincour, Guillaume",Sci Rep,,167

283262,Why not to use colchicine in COVID-19? An oldanti-inflammatory drug for a novel auto-inflammatory disease,2020,"Differentiable programming has recently received much interest as a paradigm that facilitates taking gradients of computer programs. While the corresponding flexible gradient-based optimization approaches so far have been used predominantly for deep learning or enriching the latter with modeling components, we want to demonstrate that they can also be useful for statistical modeling per se, e.g., for quick prototyping when classical maximum likelihood approaches are challenging or not feasible. In an application from a COVID-19 setting, we utilize differentiable programming to quickly build and optimize a flexible prediction model adapted to the data quality challenges at hand. Specifically, we develop a regression model, inspired by delay differential equations, that can bridge temporal gaps of observations in the central German registry of COVID-19 intensive care cases for predicting future demand. With this exemplary modeling challenge, we illustrate how differentiable programming can enable simple gradient-based optimization of the model by automatic differentiation. This allowed us to quickly prototype a model under time pressure that outperforms simpler benchmark models. We thus exemplify the potential of differentiable programming also outside deep learning applications, to provide more options for flexible applied statistical modeling.","Hackenberg, Maren; Grodd, Marlon; Kreutz, Clemens; Fischer, Martina; Esins, Janina; Grabenhenrich, Linus; Karagiannidis, Christian; Binder, Harald",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05722v2.pdf,167
283708,Screening key genes and signaling pathways in COVID-19 infection and its associated complications by integrated bioinformatics analysis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting health systems globally. Maternity care disruptions have been surveyed, but not those related to vulnerable small newborns. We aimed to survey reported disruptions to small and sick newborn care worldwide and undertake thematic analysis of healthcare providers' experiences and proposed mitigation strategies. METHODS: Using a widely disseminated online survey in three languages, we reached out to neonatal healthcare providers. We collected data on COVID-19 preparedness, effects on health personnel and on newborn care services, including kangaroo mother care (KMC), as well as disruptors and solutions. RESULTS: We analysed 1120 responses from 62 countries, mainly low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Preparedness for COVID-19 was suboptimal in terms of guidelines and availability of personal protective equipment. One-third reported routine testing of all pregnant women, but 13% had no testing capacity at all. More than 85% of health personnel feared for their own health and 89% had increased stress. Newborn care practices were disrupted both due to reduced care-seeking and a compromised workforce. More than half reported that evidence-based interventions such as KMC were discontinued or discouraged. Separation of the mother-baby dyad was reported for both COVID-positive mothers (50%) and those with unknown status (16%). Follow-up care was disrupted primarily due to families' fear of visiting hospitals (~73%). CONCLUSION: Newborn care providers are stressed and there is lack clarity and guidelines regarding care of small newborns during the pandemic. There is an urgent need to protect life-saving interventions, such as KMC, threatened by the pandemic, and to be ready to recover and build back better.","Rao, Suman P N; Minckas, Nicole; Medvedev, Melissa M; Gathara, David; Y N, Prashantha; Seifu Estifanos, Abiy; Silitonga, Alfrida Camelia; Jadaun, Arun Singh; Adejuyigbe, Ebunoluwa A; Brotherton, Helen; Arya, Sugandha; Gera, Rani; Ezeaka, Chinyere V; Gai, Abdou; Gobezayehu, Abebe Gebremariam; Dube, Queen; Kumar, Aarti; Naburi, Helga; Chiume, Msandeni; Tumukunde, Victor; Medhanyie, Araya Abrha; Plange-Rhule, Gyikua; Shabini, Josephine; Ohuma, Eric O; Tadele, Henok; WGebriel, Fitsum; Hadgu, Amanuel; Alamineh, Lamesgin; Mehta, Rajesh; Molyneux, Elizabeth; Lawn, Joy E",,,167

DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Embase from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to October 20, 2020, for studies that discussed the chest CT findings in infants younger than 1 year with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 70 COVID-19 (58.5% boys) confirmed infants were included. The mean age of the included patients was 4.1 months with a range of 1 day to 12 months. Chest CT scans showed bilateral abnormalities in 34 patients, and unilateral lung involvement in 25 patients. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (71.43%) were found to be the most prevalent chest CT manifestation, followed by peribronchial thickening (60%), linear or band-shaped opacities (32.8%), consolidation (28.57%), nodule (18.57%), effusion (7.14%) and focal lucency (7.14%). CONCLUSIONS: GGO and peribronchial thickening were the most prevalent findings in the infants' chest CT scans. Linear or band-shaped opacities, consolidation, and pulmonary nodules are more common in infants than in adults. These findings suggest that the disease is more likely to be presented as an atypical pneumonia (peribronchial thickening and linear or band-shaped opacities) in this age group. Other chest CT scan manifestations can be classified as typical COVID-19 infection (peripheral GGO), lobar pneumonia (consolidation) and opportunistic infections (pulmonary nodules).","Ghodsi, Alireza; Bijari, Moniba; Alamdaran, Seyed Ali; Saberi, Amin; Mahmoudabadi, Elnaz; Balali, Mohammad Reza; Ghahremani, Sara",World J Pediatr,,167

The objective of this systematic review is to identify the facilitators and barriers affecting the delivery of routine health care services during the pandemic to provide a framework for future research. In total, 32 articles were identified for common themes surrounding facilitators of routine care during COVID-19. Identified constructed in the literature include enhanced education initiatives for parents/patients regarding routine vaccinations, an importance of routine vaccinations as compared to the risk of COVID-19 infection, an enhanced use of telehealth resources (including diagnostic imagery) and identified patient throughput/PPE initiatives. Reviewers identified the following barriers to the delivery of routine care: conservation of medical providers and PPE for non-routine (acute) care delivery needs, specific routine care services incongruent the telehealth care delivery methods, and job-loss/food insecurity.

285259,A potential therapeutic combination for treatment of COVID-19: Synergistic effect of DPP4 and RAAS suppression,2020,"Objective: As of January 2020, there were 2,519 confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases with 866 deaths across 27 countries. Most of these cases (2,121) were reported in KSA. Since the initial identification of MERS, few studies have investigated the role of comorbidities that could potentially lead to mortality in cases of the infectious disease. This study aimed to examine the association between comorbidities and MERS mortality in KSA. Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study. We retrieved the data published by the World Health Organization (WHO) between January 2017 and November 2019, and analysed the association between comorbidities and mortality. Results: We found 572 MERS-CoV cases reported by WHO in KSA during the defined period. Of these, 387 (68%) had a history of chronic illness. The overall mortality rate was found to be 25%. Diabetes mellitus was the most prevalent comorbidity-the mortality rate in the diabetics was 32% as opposed to 12% in the non-diabetics (p-value <0.01). Hypertension was second, with a mortality rate of 35%, as opposed to 15% in the non-hypertensive patients (p-value <0.001). The mortality rate in cases with cardiovascular disease was 39% as opposed to 21% in those without cardiovascular disease (p-value <0.05). Conclusion: Our study shows that MERS-CoV had a significant case fatality rate in patients with comorbidities. Thus, it will be beneficial if future clinical trials for MERS-CoV examine the impact of improved societal infection control measures such as social distancing and masks, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, on the prevalence and incidence of MERS and its clinical outcomes.","Alotaibi, Mohammad H; Bahammam, Salman A",,,167

285464,Strategies for breast cancer surgery during & after COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Abstract Introduction The main prevention strategy for reducing the dispersion of the SARS-CoV-2 has been social distancing. Several investigations began to explore its psychological impact since it began, but there are no data about its effect on social and family behavior. Objectives Were: First, to analyze the reliability of an ad-hoc designed questionnaire to measure sociofamily behavior changes in a sample of parents of children from one to twelve years old. Second, to characterize effects of voluntary social isolation by COVID-19 over sociofamily behavior at a personal level and over children's activities at home. Third, to determine vulnerability predictors for a negative experience by isolation itself. Method An online Questionnaire for Perceptions of Changes in Sociofamily Behavior was applied to 365 Mexican participants. Results Factor analysis showed a reliability of the ad-hoc designed questionnaire for this study. Correlations were found between voluntary social isolation and self-perceived experiences, such as sleep quality, irritability, emotional control, hope about the future, motivation, attention span, and problem solving. Discussion and conclusion The results of this study suggest that family well-being during voluntary social isolation is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon, which addresses specific effects in different domains, especially in sociofamily behavior.","Torres González, Cynthia; Galindo-Aldana, Gilberto; García León, Ibza America; Padilla-López, Luis Alfredo; Alvarez Núñez, Daniel Nikolaus; Espinoza Gutiérrez, Yojana Irlanda",Salud ment,,167

Various researches have shown the bioactivity, physiological activity and potential health benefits of the two components. In this study, a simultaneous and rapid method for determination of sesamin and sesamolin in sesame oils was proposed. The excitation-emission fluorescence spectra of the oils were obtained after a simple pretreatment method, then the self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition were adopted to extract the quantitative information from the highly overlapped spectra. RESULTS: It was found that reasonable quantification results can be obtained with the limits of detection for the two lignans were 0.05 mg/g and 0.24 mg/g, while limits of quantitation were 0.14 mg/g and 0.74 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the average recoveries for sesamin and sesamolin were 99.05% and 94.97%. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that with simple sample pretreatment, the application for combining excitation-emission fluorescence spectra and self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition can be a useful and sensitive tool for the determination of lignans in sesame oil.

286772,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Cancer Research,2020,"Diagnosing pre-existing heart diseases early in life is important as it helps prevent complications such as pulmonary hypertension, heart rhythm problems, blood clots, heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest. To identify such diseases, phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms convey important information. Therefore, effectively using these two modalities of data has the potential to improve the disease screening process. We evaluate this hypothesis on a subset of the PhysioNet Challenge 2016 Dataset which contains simultaneously acquired PCG and ECG recordings. Our novel Dual-Convolutional Neural Network based approach uses transfer learning to tackle the problem of having limited amounts of simultaneous PCG and ECG data that is publicly available, while having the potential to adapt to larger datasets. In addition, we introduce two main evaluation frameworks named record-wise and sample-wise evaluation which leads to a rich performance evaluation for the transfer learning approach. Comparisons with methods which used single or dual modality data show that our method can lead to better performance. Furthermore, our results show that individually collected ECG or PCG waveforms are able to provide transferable features which could effectively help to make use of a limited number of synchronized PCG and ECG waveforms and still achieve significant classification performance.","Hettiarachchi, Ramith; Haputhanthri, Udith; Herath, Kithmini; Kariyawasam, Hasindu; Munasinghe, Shehan; Wickramasinghe, Kithmin; Samarasinghe, Duminda; Silva, Anjula De; Edussooriya, Chamira U.

Subsequently, a severe and novel pediatric disorder termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged. We report on unique hematologic and immunologic parameters that distinguish between COVID-19 and MIS-C and provide insight into pathophysiology.METHODSWe prospectively enrolled hospitalized patients with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and classified them as having MIS-C or COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were classified as having either minimal or severe disease. Cytokine profiles, viral cycle thresholds (Cts), blood smears, and soluble C5b-9 values were analyzed with clinical data.RESULTSTwenty patients were enrolled (9 severe COVID-19, 5 minimal COVID-19, and 6 MIS-C). Five cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#945;) contributed to the analysis. TNF-&#945; and IL-10 discriminated between patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19. The presence of burr cells on blood smears, as well as Cts, differentiated between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with MIS-C.CONCLUSIONPediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for critical illness with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C.

OCT can be synthesized by using unsubstituted benzophenone (BP), a possible human carcinogen. OBJECTIVES: To verify if, and to what extent, BP residues are present in OCT-containing consumer products. METHODS: The raw material of OCT and 39 skincare products, of which 28 containing OCT, were chemically analyzed for the presence of BP by means of Liquid Chromatography (LC). RESULTS: In the OCT raw material and in all 28 OCT-containing products the presence of BP could be demonstrated, mostly in concentrations above 10 ppm (0.001%), whereas a majority of OCT-free products (8/11; 73%) did not contain BP. Moreover, BP concentrations significantly increased, in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, likely due to the additional degradation of OCT. CONCLUSIONS: Photo-allergic contact dermatitis from OCT in patients photo-sensitized to KP might rely on residual BP impurities. Toxicological and ecological studies that evaluate the safety of OCT might also need to consider the concomitant presence of BP. This article is protected by copyright.

The obtained results indicate that &#954;-carrageenan, laminarin, eckol, trifucol and ß-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and MIV-150. Further, molecular dynamic simulation, ADMET and density functional theory calculations were evaluated to substantiate the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on in silico analysis of aforesaid algal metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 targets. This study concludes that these metabolites can be curative for COVID-19 in the hour of need after further validations in in vitro and in vivo testings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

290316,The Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Care in the Post Pandemic World: Five Major Lessons Learnt from Challenges and Countermeasures of Major Asian Cancer Centres,2021,"Social distancing was planned as a preventive measure to control the extensive spread of COVID-19. COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil were analyzed during the period of social distancing measures. Mortality data for COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Deaths were estimated up to the 31st day after the occurrence of the 5th COVID-19-related death in Brazil. Social distance was measured using Google's community mobility reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). The Brazilian epidemic curves were interconnected, and mathematical models were evaluated to fit the mortality estimation curves. The optimistic model was defined in the opening period of social distancing and, therefore, in the lower mobility (40-60%). The realistic model was calculated according to relaxed social distance measures (<40%) and the pessimistic model was calculated based on the transmission rate between 2-3. Thus, the equations of the mathematical models provided the outcomes for the date of June 9, 2020, as follows: realistic model with 40,623 deaths, pessimistic model with 64,310 deaths and the optimistic model with a projection of 31,384 deaths. As a result of these analyzes, on May 24, 2020, there were a total of 22,965 deaths related to COVID-19, and those deaths included within the proposed mathematical models were 17,452 for the optimistic model, 22,623 for the realistic model and 32,825 for the pessimistic model. Thus, it is concluded that social distancing measures promoted by the Brazilian public managers contributes to the reduction in approximately ten thousand deaths related to COVID-19 in the current pandemic scenario.","Valenti, Vitor E; Menezes, Pedro de Lemos; Abreu, Ana Carolina Gonçalves de; Vieira, Gustavo Nakamura Alves; Garner, David M",J.

On the one hand, this exceptional situation created unprecedented learning opportunities for nursing students. Yet, on the other hand, this situation can jeopardise nursing students learning trajectory. OBJECTIVES: To study nursing students' experiences during clinical placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey design. SETTINGS: Clinical placements during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing students from nine Belgian nursing schools. METHODS: All students enrolled in nursing education are eligible to participate. The survey consists of five dimensions: demographics, risk perception, self-efficacy, support and communication, and resilience. RESULTS: The gaps that were identified by students focused on the need for more psychosocial support, establishing (regular) contact with their clinical placement supervisor, recognition of the difficult work situation, and the need for more space to unwind. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students expressed a strong need to be heard, prepared, and supported. Most students felt supported by their nursing schools. Because of COVID-19, the role of the preceptor became more important. However, due to several reasons, the perceptor did not always meet the student's expectations. Preparing students for specific competencies is needed. In spite of the efforts of nursing schools and clinical sites, students often got lost in the chaos of the pandemic. This resulted in practical worries, fewer learning opportunities, and even fundamental doubts about their choice to become a nurse. Finally, it crucial that nursing schools and clinical sites communicate about matters such as the responsibility for testing nursing students, the provisions of uniforms and personal protective equipment, and structurally sharing guidelines with students to provide safe patient care.","Ulenaers, Dorien; Grosemans, Joep; Schrooten, Ward; Bergs, Jochen",Nurse Educ Today,,167

291478,Alzheimer's Disease Patients in the Crosshairs of COVID-19,2020,"ABSTRACT: Healthcare-associated infections are a major public health concern for both patients and medical personnel. This has taken on greater urgency during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Radiation Personal Protective Equipment (RPPE) may contribute to risks of microbial contamination. This possibility was tested in 61 personal or shared-use lead aprons and thyroid collars at Columbia Presbyterian Irving Medical Center. Fifty percent tested positive for either bacterial or fungal contamination, mostly around the neckline of lead vests and thyroid collars. Repeated testing of garments some weeks to months later confirmed continued presence of microbial contamination. The possibility that hospital-approved disinfection agents could degrade the radio-protective features of these garments was also examined. Samples of identical construction to garments in regular use were subjected to either daily or weekly wipes with hypochlorite or alcohol-based hospital-approved cleaning agents for 6 mo. A third group of samples was maintained in contact with the cleaning agents for 6 mo. All samples were fluoroscoped four times during the study. None demonstrated any degradation in radioprotection. All samples were photographed monthly. Physical degradation of the outer plastic covering by concentrated hypochlorite and limited mechanical damage around stitched seams of the samples cleaned daily with alcohol was noted. Based on the high prevalence of microbial contamination, regular cleaning and disinfection protocols should be implemented. Regular cleaning with medical-facility-approved cleaning and disinfecting agents is likely to be effective at reducing the microbial load and unlikely to result in significant reduction in radioprotective properties of these garments.","Balter, Stephen; Rodriguez, Michelle A; Pike, Janett A; Kleiman, Norman J",Health Phys,,167

It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, quickly spreading worldwide. COVID-19 is a disease with symptoms that range from fever and breathing difficulty to acute respiratory distress and death, critically affecting older patients and people with previous comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract, which it then uses to reach several organs. The immune system of infected patients has been demonstrated to suffer important alterations, such as lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, excessive amounts of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, especially in the lungs, and cytokine storms, which may contribute to its severity and difficulty of establishing an effective treatment. Even though no specific treatment is currently available, several studies have been investigating potential therapeutic strategies, including the use of previously approved drugs and immunotherapy. In this context, this review addresses the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the patient's host immune system during infection, in addition to discussing the main immunopathological mechanisms involved in the development of the disease and potential new therapeutic approaches.","Silva, Taylon Felipe; Tomiotto-Pellissier, Fernanda; Sanfelice, Raquel Arruda; Gonçalves, Manoela Daiele; da Silva Bortoleti, Bruna Taciane; Detoni, Mariana Barbosa; Rodrigues, Ana Carolina Jacob; Carloto, Amanda Cristina Machado; Concato, Virgínia Márcia; Siqueira, Elaine da Silva; Costa, Idessania Nazareth; Pavanelli, Wander Rogério; Conchon-Costa, Ivete; Miranda-Sapla, Milena Menegazzo",Front Immunol,,167

This article focuses on a sequence of personal narratives told by New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, in one of his daily press briefings during the early days of the COVID-19 crisis. I show how Cuomo enacted authentic leadership by mobilizing relational identities in a narrative segment. By telling three interconnected family stories, Cuomo provided evidence for his stay-at-home policy for New Yorkers during the pandemic. The performance of various relational identities in this narrative sequence helped construct Andrew Cuomo and his family members as ordinary citizens, making them relatable to viewers;at the same time, through the telling of these particular stories, Cuomo positioned himself as a trustworthy, effective leader and a prescient, reliable decision-maker. The study demonstrates how affective, relational discourse can be exploited by political leaders in the service of advancing their more transactional goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Vásquez, C.","Discourse, Context and Media",,167

The diagnosis and treatment protocols of COVID-19 published by national and regional health authorities were searched, and information was extracted in regard to disease stages, type of syndromes, and prescriptions, etc. Frequency statistics and relative analysis were used to analyze the rule of syndrome differentiation and prescription with TCM, and further discussion on the pathogenesis and progress of the disease. A total of 26 diagnosis and treatment protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were retrieved after screening(including 1 national scheme and 25 regional ones), among which 16 contained aspects of both prevention and treatment, 7 only involved treatment contents and 3 were prevention schemes. The courses of COVID-19 can be divided into early stage, middle stage, severe stage and recovery stage. The pathogeny of COVID-19 in TCM is damp-toxin, with the core pathogenesis of damp-toxin retention in lung and Qi repression. Its pathological features can be summarized as &quot;damp, toxin, obstruction, deficiency&quot;. The location of the disease is lung, always involving spleen and stomach, and may further affect heart and kidney in severe cases. The major treatments for each course are Fanghua Shizuo, Xuanfei Touxie(early stage); Qingre Jiedu, Xuanxie Feire(middle stage); Kaibi Gutuo, Huiyang Jiuni(severe stage); Qingjie Yure, Yiqi Yangyin(recovery stage). There were many diagnosis and treatment protocols for COVID-19 have been published, which generally followed the national edition, through with certain personalities in different regional protocols. There were common features with respect to the disease stage, syndrome differentiation, therapeutic principles and methods, as well as prescriptions; the treatment were generally carried out against the core pathogenesis and progress of the disease. Along with the deepening recognition of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment protocols are still need further concretization and standardization.

Research on 3D models of proteins and the search for active molecular sites are important tools to assist in the discovery of effective antiviral drugs to combat COVID-19. To address this problem, the 3D protein structures of SARS-CoV 2 were analyzed and submitted to cavities research, evaluation of their druggabillity and liganbility, and applied to molecular docking studies with potential ligand candidates actually assayed against COVID-19. Eight druggable potential cavity sites were determined in model structures' PDB code, 6W4B, 6VWW, 6W01, 6M3M, and 6VYO, and these are the good alternatives to be characterized as targets for antiviral compounds. The good cavity model of the protease 3D structure was used in molecular docking, and this allowed verifying the theoric interactions of this protein and lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs. These results may assist in the use of 3D protein models in drug design studies aiming to develop drugs against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fernandes, Mariana S; da Silva, Francielly S; Freitas, Ana Carolina S G; de Melo, Eduardo B; Trossini, Gustavo H G; Paula, Fávero R",Mol. inform.

METHODS: An updated national search was conducted. Of those identified, 74 persistent pain services provided detailed responses between July 2016 and February 2018 (64 adult, seven pediatric, two pelvic pain, and one cancer pain). A similar structure to the original Waiting in Pain (WIP) survey was used, and participants chose online or telephone completion. RESULTS: Pediatric pain services had more than doubled but remained limited. Adult services had also increased, with a concurrent decrease in median wait times and an increase in the number of new referrals seen each year. Despite this, some lengthy wait times (&#8805;3 years) persisted. Wait times were longest at clinics using public or combined funding models and offering pain management group programs (PMGPs). Although clinical activity had increased, medical staffing had not, suggesting that clinics were operating differently. Privately funded clinics performed more procedures than publicly funded services. Use of PMGPs had increased, but program structure remained diverse. CONCLUSIONS: Specialist pain services have expanded since the original WIP survey, facilitating treatment access for many. However, wait time range suggested that the most disadvantaged individuals still experienced the longest wait times, often far exceeding the recommended 6-month maximum wait. More needs to be done. Numerous developments (e.g., National Strategic Action Plan for Pain Management, health system changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) will continue to influence the delivery of pain services in Australia, and repeated analysis of service structures and wait times will optimize our health system response to the management of this condition.","Hogg, Malcolm N; Kavanagh, Anthony; Farrell, Michael J; Burke, Anne L J",Pain med,,167

People write happier words during park visits when compared with non-park user tweets collected around the same time. While the words people write are happier in parks on average and in most cities, we find considerable variation across cities. Tweets are happier in parks at all times of the day, week, and year, not just during the weekend or summer vacation. Across all cities, we find that the happiness benefit is highest in parks larger than 100 acres. Overall, our study suggests the happiness benefit associated with park visitation is on par with US holidays such as Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.","Schwartz, A. J.; Dodds, P. S.; O'Neil-Dunne, J.

For many people, this involves the necessity of adapting to new conditions, uncertainty about the future and a tremendous mental burden. It was investigated whether there were any differences between the 2 measures (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic) in the levels of perceived stress, anxiety, life satisfaction and experienced emotions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study, conducted in Poland and the Netherlands, involved 168 people. The metric, the Positive and Negative Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, the and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were used. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-immigrants living in Poland (N = 50), Dutch citizens (N = 56), and Polish immigrants living in the Netherlands (N = 62). RESULTS: The level of stress and negative emotions was higher in the groups of Poles living in Poland and Poles living in the Netherlands than in the group of Dutch citizens. Therefore, access to psychological care should be improved during the pandemic, especially for immigrants, due to the increased risk of developing stress-induced mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In the groups of Poles, there was an increase in perceived stress and trait anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group of Dutch citizens experienced a reduction in the anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. RESULTS: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1-3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5-16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1-18.6] than uninfected ones. Intra-uterine fetal demises were more common in infected mothers compared to controls (5.1 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.7 [95 % CI 1.4-45.9). Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth, none tested positive (0/108).

CONCLUSION: Pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with a SARS-COV-2 infection through an universal screening were symptomatic in only a quarter of cases. Their risks of post-partum hemorrhage, transfusion and admission to ICU were higher than those of uninfected patients. They also presented a higher risk of intra-uterine fetal demise. There were no other differences in maternal, obstetrical or neonatal outcomes.","Hcini, Najeh; Maamri, Fatma; Picone, Olivier; Carod, Jean-Francois; Lambert, Véronique; Mathieu, Meredith; Carles, Gabriel; Pomar, Léo",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,167

In this paper we present a study and a concrete tool based on machine learning to predict the prognosis of hospitalised patients with Covid-19. In particular we address the task of predicting the risk of death of a patient at different times of the hospitalisation, on the base of some demographic information, chest X-ray scores and several laboratory findings. Our machine learning models use ensembles of decision trees trained and tested using data from more than 2000 patients. An experimental evaluation of the models shows good performance in solving the addressed task.","Gerevini, Alfonso Emilio; Maroldi, Roberto; Olivato, Matteo; Putelli, Luca; Serina, Ivan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04420v1.pdf,167
300302,A review of COVID-19 vaccines strategies and anti-vaxxers theories,2021,"Purpose: Owing to its worldwide spread, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the outer surface protein of the cell membrane that is abundantly distributed in the heart, lungs, and kidneys and plays an important role in molecular docking of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we aimed to analyze the difference in the survival rate according to ACE2 expressions in pan-cancer. Materials and Methods: We downloaded clinical and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We used Kaplan-Meier with a log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze prognostic significance. Results: In the Kaplan-Meier curve, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), uveal melanoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma showed statistical significance. In the Cox regression, thyroid carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme and ccRCC showed significant results. Only ccRCC had statistical significance, and high ACE2 expression is related to good prognosis. It is known that the ACE inhibitor, a primary antihypertensive agent, increases ACE2 expression. Conclusion: Based on these results, we believe that the ACE inhibitor will be important to increase the lifespan of ccRCC patients. This study is the first research to offer a recommendation on the use of anti-hypertensive drugs to ccRCC patients.","Kim, Kihun; Ko, Yeji; Ko, Dai Sik; Kim, Yun Hak",Biomed Res Int,,167

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: On March 15, 2020, the Veterans Affairs (VA) issued a nationwide order to temporarily pause elective cases due to COVID-19. The effects of this disruption on patient outcomes are not yet known. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Surgical procedures cancelled due to COVID-19 in 2020 (n = 3,326) were matched to similar completed procedures in 2018 (n = 151,863) and 2019 (n = 146,582). Outcome measures included 30- and 90-day VA ED use and mortality in the period following the completed or cancelled procedure. We used exact matching on surgical procedure category and nearest neighbor matching on patient characteristics, procedure year, and facility. RESULTS: Patients with elective surgical procedures cancelled due to COVID-19 were no more likely to have an ED visit in the 30- (Difference: -4.3% pts; 95% CI: -0.078, -0.007) and 90âdays (-0.9% pts; 95% CI: -0.068, 0.05) following the expected case date. Patients with cancellations had no difference in 30- (Difference: 0.1% pts; 95% CI: -0.008, 0.01) and 90-day (Difference: -0.4% pts; 95% CI: -0.016, 0.009) mortality rates when compared to similar patients with similar procedures that were completed in previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The pause in elective surgical cases was not associated with short-term adverse outcomes in VA hospitals, suggesting appropriate surgical case triage and management. Further study will be essential to determine if the delayed cases were associated with longer-term effects.","Tran, Linda Diem; Rose, Liam; Urech, Tracy; Dalton, Aaron; Wu, Siqi; Vashi, Anita A",Ann. surg,,167
301462,COVID19-CT-dataset: an open-access chest CT image repository of 1000+ patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis,2021,"KEY MESSAGE: Quantitation of leaf surface wax on a population of switchgrass identified three significant QTL present across six environments that contribute to leaf glaucousness and wax composition and that show complex genetic × environmental (G × E) interactions. The C4 perennial grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) is a native species of the North American tallgrass prairie. This adaptable plant can be grown on marginal lands and is useful for soil and water conservation, biomass production, and as a forage. Two major switchgrass ecotypes, lowland and upland, differ in a range of desirable traits, and the responsible underlying loci can be localized efficiently in a pseudotestcross design. An outbred four-way cross (4WCR) mapping population of 750 F2 lines was used to examine the genetic basis of differences in leaf surface wax load between two lowland (AP13 and WBC) and two upland (DAC and VS16) tetraploid cultivars. The objective of our experiments was to identify wax compositional variation among the population founders and to map underlying loci responsible for surface wax variation across environments. GCMS analyses of surface wax extracted from 4WCR F0 founders and F1 hybrids reveal higher levels of wax in lowland genotypes and show quantitative differences of ß-diketones, primary alcohols, and other wax constituents. The full mapping population was sampled over two seasons from four field sites with latitudes ranging from 30 to 42 °N, and leaf surface wax was measured. We identified three high-confidence QTL, of which two displayed significant G × E effects. Over 50 candidate genes underlying the QTL regions showed similarity to genes in either Arabidopsis or barley known to function in wax synthesis, modification, regulation, and transport.","Bragg, Jennifer; Tomasi, Pernell; Zhang, Li; Williams, Tina; Wood, Delilah; Lovell, John T; Healey, Adam; Schmutz, Jeremy; Bonnette, Jason E; Cheng, Prisca; Chanbusarakum, Lisa; Juenger, Thomas; Tobias, Christian M",Theor. appl. genet,,167

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study, codesigned with mental health service users and carers. METHODS: We conducted semistructured, telephone or online interviews with a purposively constructed sample; a lived experience researcher conducted and analysed interviews with service users. Analysis was based on the constant comparison method. SETTING: National Health Service (NHS) secondary mental health services in England between June and August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Of 65 participants, 20 had either accessed or needed to access English secondary mental healthcare during the pandemic; 10 were carers of people with mental health difficulties; 35 were members of staff working in NHS secondary mental health services during the pandemic. RESULTS: Experiences of remote care were mixed. Some service users valued the convenience of remote methods in the context of maintaining contact with familiar clinicians. Most participants commented that a lack of non-verbal cues and the loss of a therapeutic 'safe space' challenged therapeutic relationship building, assessments and identification of deteriorating mental well-being. Some carers felt excluded from remote meetings and concerned that assessments were incomplete without their input. Like service users, remote methods posed challenges for clinicians who reported uncertainty about technical options and a lack of training. All groups expressed concern about intersectionality exacerbating inequalities and the exclusion of some service user groups if alternatives to remote care are lost. CONCLUSIONS: Though remote mental healthcare is likely to become increasingly widespread in secondary mental health services, our findings highlight the continued importance of a tailored, personal approach to decision making in this area.

303889,Consequences of a great crisis on chronic diseases: How childhood exposures may shape future health,2020,"BACKGROUND: A high percentage of patients with cancer experience cognitive impairment after cancer treatment, resulting in a decreased health-related quality of life and difficulty returning to work. Consequently, there is a need for effective treatment options to improve cognitive functioning in these patients. In a healthy aging population, multidomain web-based lifestyle interventions have been found to be effective in preventing cognitive decline and improving cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the web-based lifestyle intervention Mijn Fitte Brein (My Fit Brain [MFB]) on cognitive functioning in patients with cancer returning to work. METHODS: The study consists of a feasibility study (N=10), followed by a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=220). Patients will be recruited by their occupational physicians after their return to work following cancer treatment. Mijn Fitte Brein is organized into 4-week cycles in which patients set a lifestyle goal using the Goal Attainment Scale, receive weekly tips and support, and finally evaluate whether they succeeded in achieving this goal. Lifestyle goals are based on 6 domains: physical exercise, diet, sleep, stress, alcohol use, and smoking. In the feasibility study, data on user experience (structured interview) and usability, assessed with the Post-Study System Usability Scale, will be collected and used to optimize Mijn Fitte Brein. In the RCT, patients will be randomized 1:1 between an intervention group and a control group. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is subjective cognitive functioning, assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog). Secondary outcome measures are lifestyle, objective cognitive functioning, and work and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Recruitment for the feasibility study has started in February 2020. As of July 2020, however, no patients have been enrolled (due to COVID-19 restrictions). The findings of the feasibility study will be used to optimize the Mijn Fitte Brein intervention. Enrollment for the RCT will continue when possible. The feasibility study will take 6 months (including making adjustments to the intervention), and the RCT will take 2 years. The final results are expected in 2024. The results of the feasibility study and the RCT will be published in peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time the feasibility and efficacy of a multidomain web-based lifestyle intervention will be studied in patients with cancer. If Mijn Fitte Brein is found to be effective in decreasing cognitive complaints in these patients returning to work, it will be a promising treatment option because of being both affordable and accessible.

To estimate the length of time the COVID-19 vaccine spent in research and development as compared to other novel vaccines, we apply previously-established methods for estimating medical product development times, using the earliest associated patent filings cited by the manufacturer as the marker of when commercial development activity began. Applying these methods to a cohort of recently approved innovative vaccines and comparing them to the development time of the first-approved COVID-19 vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer), we found patent filings for the technology in this COVID-19 vaccine occurred 10.0 years prior to regulatory authorization. Furthermore, the development timelines for innovative vaccines have been shortening since the 1980s and the COVID-19 vaccine comfortably fits within this pattern. Vaccine development timelines have now even drawn to parity with many of the most commonly-used drugs.","Beall, Reed F; Kesselheim, Aaron S; Hollis, Aidan",Clin. infect. dis,,167

306744,The Development of Pharmacological Treatment for COVID-19,2020,"Introduction Despite social media's profound role in building connections over the past two decades, its value as an educational tool in health professional education remains unclear. While few studies have investigated the use of social media to engage students outside the classroom (i.e. COVID-19 remote learning) in dental education, there are no reports to date of students? and faculty perspectives of the use of Instagram in supplementing anatomical education in the dental curriculum. The aim of this study is the evaluate student perspective of social media in education and their respective anatomy professor's Instagram page as a supplemental resource. Materials and Methods This study was deemed exempt from the IRB at University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry (620-20-EX) and the CPHS at University of Texas Health Science Center (HSC-DB-20-0877). Anatomy faculty from UNMC and UTSD conducted this research during the fall of 2020 evaluating @yoachimanatomy and @theanatomydoctor. Subjects voluntarily participated on a Qualtrics survey;responses remained anonymous with no associated risks Results Of the 170 respondents, 60 (35.5%) identified as male and 108 (63.9%) identified as female (2 students did not identify).. Students were classified as Generation Y if born between 1980-1994;Generation Z if born 1995 or later. The majority of respondents (85.1%) had seven or more years of experience using social media;Facebook (96.3%), Instagram (94.4%), and GroupMe (91.9%) emerged as the three most-frequently used platforms. UTSD students self-reported more hours per day spent on social media than UNMC students, with 64% of students spending more than 2 hours per day compared to 33% of UNMC students (p=0.0003). 96.9% of students reported using social media as a source of information with 92.5% using it for educational purposes. All students agreed that their respective professor's page had been helpful for anatomy study and review, added to their understanding of anatomy, is convenient, engaging, and professional. UNMC students had a higher level of agreement regarding their page's added relevance to learning in the class and clinic (p=0.0016), while UTSD students reported feeling more comfortable asking their professor questions through Instagram (p=0.015). Among all variables, female students and Generation Z students responded more favorably than their male or Generation Y counterparts. Conclusion The unique platform features of Instagram create an ideal platform to supplement the visually-focused anatomy content. Our study provides evidence of students? desires to have social media incorporated into their dental school curriculum, and the data reveal consistent themes in students? perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks of Instagram as a tool to supplement anatomical education. Significance Our study reveals crucial data supporting the inclusion of social media, and particularly Instagram, as a supplemental tool to anatomy education. Our collaboration between two unique programs, faculty, and Instagram pages sheds light on consistent benefits, drawbacks, and perspectives of students and faculty alike.","Yoachim, Shayla Nguyen Vuvi",The FASEB Journal,,167

DESIGN: A descriptive, retrospective report from a single-center PICU. SETTING: Twenty-three bed, quaternary PICU, within an 862-bed hospital. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults, with coronavirus disease 2019-related disease. INTERVENTIONS: ICU care provided by pediatric intensivists with training and support from medical intensivists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Within the context of the institution's comprehensive effort to centralize and systematize care for adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019 disease, the PICU was transitioned to an adult coronavirus disease 2019 critical care unit. Nurses and physicians underwent just-in-time training over 3 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Medical ICU physicians and nurses provided oversight for care and designated hospital-based teams were available for procedures and common adult emergencies. Over a 7-week period, the PICU cared for 60 adults with coronavirus disease 2019-related critical illness. Fifty-three required intubation and mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days. Eighteen required renal replacement therapy and 17 died. CONCLUSIONS: During the current and potentially in future pandemics, where critical care resources are limited, pediatric intensivists and staff can be readily utilized to meaningfully contribute to the care of critically ill adults.","Wasserman, Emily; Toal, Megan; Nellis, Marianne E; Traube, Chani; Joyce, Christine; Finkelstein, Robert; Killinger, James S; Joashi, Umesh; Harrington, John S; Torres, Lisa K; Greenwald, Bruce M; Howell, Joy",Pediatr Crit Care Med,,167

Little is known about the role of the 2D:4D ratio in relation to serum and urinary androgens for physical performance in female athletes. We aimed to compare the 2D:4D ratio in female Olympic athletes with sedentary controls, and to investigate the 2D:4D ratio in relation to serum and urinary androgens and physical performance in the athletes. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 104 Swedish female Olympic athletes participating in power, endurance and technical sports and 117 sedentary controls. The 2D:4D ratio was calculated using direct digit measurements. Serum androgens and urinary androgen metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The athletes performed standardized physical performance tests and body composition was established by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: The 2D:4D ratio was significantly lower in the athletes compared with controls although serum testosterone levels were comparable between groups and within normal reference values. The 2D:4D ratio correlated negatively with urinary levels of testosterone glucuronide and 5&#945;- and 5ßAdiol-17G, whereas there were no correlations to serum androgen levels. Furthermore, the 2D:4D ratio correlated negatively with strength tests and positively with 3,000-meter running in the athletes. Conclusion: Female Olympic athletes had a lower 2D:4D ratio, possibly reflecting a higher prenatal androgen exposure, than sedentary controls. Furthermore, the 2D:4D ratio was related to urinary levels of androgen metabolites and physical performance in the athletes but not to serum androgen levels.

Traditional surveys in the area of public health can be expensive and time-consuming, and they can rapidly become outdated. The analysis of big data sets (such as electronic patient records and surveillance systems) is very complex. Google Trends is an alternative approach that has been used in the past to analyze health behaviors; however, most existing studies on COVID-19 using these data examine a single issue or a limited geographic area. This paper explores Google Trends as a proxy for what people are thinking, needing, and planning in real time across the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use Google Trends to provide both insights into and potential indicators of important changes in information-seeking patterns during pandemics such as COVID-19. We asked four questions: (1) How has information seeking changed over time? (2) How does information seeking vary between regions and states? (3) Do states have particular and distinct patterns in information seeking? (4) Do search data correlate with-or precede-real-life events? METHODS: We analyzed searches on 38 terms related to COVID-19, falling into six themes: social and travel; care seeking; government programs; health programs; news and influence; and outlook and concerns. We generated data sets at the national level (covering January 1, 2016, to April 15, 2020) and state level (covering January 1 to April 15, 2020). Methods used include trend analysis of US search data; geographic analyses of the differences in search popularity across US states from March 1 to April 15, 2020; and principal component analysis to extract search patterns across states. RESULTS: The data showed high demand for information, corresponding with increasing searches for coronavirus linked to news sources regardless of the ideological leaning of the news source. Changes in information seeking often occurred well in advance of action by the federal government. The popularity of searches for unemployment claims predicted the actual spike in weekly claims. The increase in searches for information on COVID-19 care was paralleled by a decrease in searches related to other health behaviors, such as urgent care, doctor's appointments, health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Finally, concerns varied across the country; some search terms were more popular in some regions than in others. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic faced by the United States. Our research holds important lessons for both state and federal governments in a fast-evolving situation that requires a finger on the pulse of public sentiment. We suggest strategic shifts for policy makers to improve the precision and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and recommend the development of a real-time dashboard as a decision-making tool.","Mangono, Tichakunda; Smittenaar, Peter; Caplan, Yael; Huang, Vincent S; Sutermaster, Staci; Kemp, Hannah; Sgaier, Sema K",J Med Internet Res,,167

We sent an adapted version of our previously published MERS-CoV questionnaire to the same cohort of HCWs at a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of our sample had previous experience with confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV patients, and those had a significantly higher knowledge score (13.16 ± 2.02 vs. 12.58 ± 2.27, P = 0.002) and higher adherence to protective hygienic practices (2.95 ± 0.80 vs. 2.74 ± 0.92, P = 0.003). The knowledge scores on COVID-19 were higher in the current cohort than the previous MERS-CoV outbreak cohort (68% vs. 79.7%, P < 0.001). HCWs from the current cohort who felt greater anxiety from COVID-19 compared to MERS-CoV were less likely to have been exposed to MERS-CoV infected/suspected cases (odds ratio (OR) = 0.646, P = 0.042) and were less likely to have attended the hospital awareness campaign on COVID-19 (OR = 0.654, P = 0.035). We concluded that previous experience with MERS-CoV was associated with increased knowledge and adherence to protective hygienic practices, and reduction of anxiety towards COVID-19.","Temsah, M H; Alhuzaimi, A N; Alamro, N; Alrabiaah, A; Al-Sohime, F; Alhasan, K; Kari, J A; Almaghlouth, I; Aljamaan, F; Al-Eyadhy, A; Jamal, A; Al Amri, M; Barry, M; Al-Subaie, S; Somily, A M; Al-Zamil, F",Epidemiol Infect,,167

However, modern, busy lives leave limiting time for relaxation. Virtual reality (VR) experiences of pleasant and calming virtual environments, accessed with a head-mounted display (HMD), appear to promote relaxation. This study aimed to provide a systematic review of feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of studies that use VR to promote relaxation in the general population (PROSPERO 195,804). METHODS: Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched until 29th June 2020. Studies were included in the review if they used HMD technology to present virtual environments that aimed to promote or measure relaxation, or relaxation-related variables. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool was used to assess methodological quality of studies. RESULTS: 6403 articles were identified through database searching. Nineteen studies published between 2007 and 2020, with 1278 participants, were included in the review. Of these, thirteen were controlled studies. Studies predominantly used natural audio-visual stimuli to promote relaxation. Findings indicate feasibility, acceptability, and short-term effectiveness of VR to increase relaxation and reduce stress. Six studies received an EPHPP rating of 'strong', seven were 'moderate', and six were 'weak'. CONCLUSIONS: VR may be a useful tool to promote relaxation in the general population, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when stress is increasing worldwide. However, methodological limitations, such as limited randomised controlled trials and longer-term evidence, mean that these conclusions should be drawn with caution. More robust studies are needed to support this promising area of VR relaxation.","Riches, Simon; Azevedo, Lisa; Bird, Leanne; Pisani, Sara; Valmaggia, Lucia",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,,167
309422,How to face cancer treatment in the COVID-19 era,2020,"In order to propose better mental health interventions under the pandemic threat, the present study aimed to investigate whether depression and anxiety are associated to Chinese adults' perceptions of government's pandemic responses and the personal lifestyle changes imposed by those responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a telephone survey with random sampling and obtained a probability community sample of 616 adults (39.1% men; M age = 41.7, SD age = 16.3) in Macao, China in April 2020. The prevalence of 8.8% probable depression and 12.0% probable anxiety was observed in this sample. Positive perceptions toward government's pandemic responses were found to be negatively associated with probable depression and probable anxiety (ORu = .36 and .41, p < .05). Three lifestyle-changing stressors (i.e., increased family conflict, friendship deterioration, and weight gain), were commonly reported (29.9, 27.5, and 43.0% respectively), and displayed positive associations with probable depression (ORu = 1.67 to 1.87, p < .05) and probable anxiety (ORu = 1.54 to 2.10, p < .05). Our findings suggest protective effects of perceived trust and satisfaction regarding government's pandemic responses against mental distress and the potential mental health threats from three pandemic-specific lifestyle-changing stressors. These findings can inform clinicians and policymakers to better prepare for the mental health impacts of the current and future pandemics.","Chen, Juliet Honglei; Yu, Eilo Wing-Yat; Su, Xiaoyu; Tong, Kwok Kit; Wu, Anise M S",Curr Psychol,,167

310398,Linezolid a Potential treatment for COVID-19 Co-Infections,2021,"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, urology was one of the specialties with the lowest rates of telemedicine and videoconferencing use. Common barriers to the implementation of telemedicine included a lack of technological literacy, concerns with reimbursement, and resistance to changes in the workplace. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the delivery of urological services globally has quickly shifted to telemedicine to account for the mass clinical, procedural, and operative cancellations, inadequate personal protective equipment, and shortage of personnel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate current telemedicine usage by urologists, urologists' perceptions on the necessity of in-person clinic appointments, the usability of telemedicine, and the current barriers to its implementation. METHODS: We conducted a global, cross-sectional, web-based survey to investigate the use of telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists' perceived usability of telemedicine was assessed using a modified Delphi approach to create questions based on a modified version of the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). For the purposes of this study, telemedicine was defined as video calls only. RESULTS: A total of 620 urologists from 58 different countries and 6 continents participated in the survey. Prior to COVID-19, 15.8% (n=98) of urologists surveyed were using telemedicine in their clinical practices; during the pandemic, that proportion increased to 46.1% (n=283). Of the urologists without telemedicine experience, interest in telemedicine usage increased from 43.7% (n=139) to 80.8% (n=257) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among urologists that used telemedicine during the pandemic, 80.9% (n=244) were interested in continuing to use it in their practice. The three most commonly used platforms were Zoom, Doxy.me, and Epic, and the top three barriers to implementing telemedicine were patients' lack of technological comprehension, patients' lack of access to the required technology, and reimbursement concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to quantify the use, usability, and pervading interest in telemedicine among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of this pandemic, urologists' usage of telemedicine nearly tripled, demonstrating their ability to adopt and adapt telemedicine into their practices, but barriers involving the technology itself are still preventing many from utilizing it despite increasing interest.","Dubin, Justin M; Wyant, W Austin; Balaji, Navin C; Ong, William Lk; Kettache, Reda H; Haffaf, Malik; Zouari, Skander; Santillan, Diego; Autrán Gómez, Ana Maria; Sadeghi-Nejad, Hossein; Loeb, Stacy; Borin, James F; Gomez Rivas, Juan; Grummet, Jeremy; Ramasamy, Ranjith; Teoh, Jeremy Y C",J Med Internet Res,,167

We show that the observed tunability is a consequence of light-induced rearrangement of CDW stacking across the layers of 1T-TaS$_2$. Our model, based on this hypothesis, agrees reasonably well with experiments suggesting that the interdomain CDW interaction is a vital knob to control the phase of strongly correlated materials.","Li, Weijian; Naik, Gururaj V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02365v1.pdf,167

The results show evidence of an asymmetric multifractal nature for all markets. Moreover, the multifractality is stronger in the upward movement of the market returns, except in China. The degree of efficiency of the stock markets is shown to be time-varying and experienced a decrease during the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), but an upside trend occurred during the recent oil price crash followed a significant decline during COVID-19. The stock markets have an anti-persistent feature during GFC and COVID-19, whereas they exhibit a long-term persistent feature during oil price crash. More interestingly, the efficiency of the stock markets of crude oil producers is lower in general than that of oil consumers. Furthermore, the efficiency of the stock market is lower in the downward movement of the market returns than in the upward movement. Asymmetry and oil price uncertainty index are the key driver of the stock markets and can serve as predictor of the stock market dynamics of top oil producers and top oil consumers particularly during COVID-19 and oil price crash. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Mensi, W.; Lee, Y.

314980,Role of advanced imaging in COVID-19 cardiovascular complications,2021,"Introduction: The “obesity paradox” has been reported in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Obese patients with ARDS were shown to have more ventilator free days and lower mortality compared to non-obese patients. One proposed explanation was increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines creating a protective environment from acute inflammation. In COVID-19, BMI ≥ 30 increases risk of illness severity, need for critical care, respiratory failure requiring use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. It is unknown if the “obesity paradox” applies to patients with SARS-CoV2 who require IMV. We examined a cohort of patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 who required IMV and compared outcomes between obese and non-obese patients. Methods: Data was collected from patients treated in the COVID Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from March to June 2020. A total of 85 patients were identified. All patients were COVID nasopharyngeal swab positive. Results: There were 38 (44.7%) patients with BMI &lt; 30, and 47 (55.3%) with BMI ≥ 30. The median BMI was 25.5 in the BMI &lt; 30 group, and 37.5 in the BMI ≥ 30 group. In the BMI &lt; 30 group, median age was 67 years, majority male (65.8%) and African American (50%). The BMI ≥ 30 group had a median age of 63.5, majority male (53.2%) and African American (63.8%). Median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on admission was higher in the BMI ≥ 30 group at 3 (1.5-4.5) vs. 2 (1.0-4.0). There was elevated creatinine on admission with higher percentage of diabetes, heart failure, and renal disease in the BMI ≥ 30 group. Inflammatory markers, such as CRP and IL-6 were lower in the higher BMI group at presentation. There was higher in-hospital mortality in the BMI ≥ 30 group at 57.5%, with longer ICU length of stay (12.35 vs. 7.6 days), longer days on ventilator (10.2 vs. 4 days), and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio after intubation (146 vs 348). The higher BMI group had higher rates of prone ventilation, paralytic use, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Discussion: From our data, obesity did not appear to have better outcomes in ARDS due to COVID-19 infection. Higher BMI was associated with higher disease severity, severe respiratory failure, longer ventilator days, longer ICU length of stay, and higher mortality. Interestingly, inflammatory markers were initially lower in obese patients, suggesting a possible adaptive physiologic response to inflammation, but without effect on overall outcomes.","Sacher, D.; Sehgal, S.; Pandya, A.; Kaur, N.; O039,; Corragain, O.

316302,Can Hyperbaric Oxygen safely serve as an anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions to cervical cancer screening in the United States, stratified by step in the screening process and primary test modality, on cervical cancer burden. METHODS: We conducted a comparative model-based analysis using three independent NCI Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network cervical models to quantify the impact of eight alternative COVID-19-related screening disruption scenarios compared to a scenario of no disruptions. Scenarios varied by the duration of the disruption (6 or 24 months), steps in the screening process being disrupted (primary screening, surveillance, colposcopy, excisional treatment), and primary screening modality (cytology alone or cytology plus human papillomavirus ""cotesting""). RESULTS: The models consistently showed that COVID-19-related disruptions yield small net increases in cervical cancer cases by 2027, which are greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with cotesting. When disruptions affected all four steps in the screening process under cytology-based screening, there were an additional 5-7 and 38-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. In contrast, under cotesting, there were additional 4-5 and 35-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. The majority (58-79%) of the projected increases in cases under cotesting were due to disruptions to surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, rather than to primary screening. CONCLUSIONS: Women in need of surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, or whose last primary screen did not involve human papillomavirus testing, may comprise priority groups for reintroductions.","Burger, Emily A; Jansen, Erik El; Killen, James; Kok, Inge McM de; Smith, Megan A; Sy, Stephen; Dunnewind, Niels; G Campos, Nicole; Haas, Jennifer S; Kobrin, Sarah; Kamineni, Aruna; Canfell, Karen; Kim, Jane J",J Med Screen,,167
316577,Secondary Hlh Presenting as Ards,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We compared COVID-19 risk management, fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection among frontline employees working within eldercare, hospital/rehabilitation, psychiatry, childcare and ambulance service and explored if group differences in fear of infection and transmission could be explained by differences in risk management. We also investigated the association of risk management with fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection among eldercare personnel. METHODS: We used cross-sectional questionnaire data collected by the Danish labour union, FOA . Data were collected 5½ weeks after the first case of COVID-19 was registered in Denmark. Data for the first aim included 2623 participants. Data for the second aim included 1680 participants. All independent variables were mutually adjusted and also adjusted for sex, age, job title and region. RESULTS: Fear of infection (49%) and fear of transmitting infection from work to the private sphere (68%) was most frequent in ambulance service. Fear of transmitting infection during work was most frequent in the eldercare (55%). Not all differences in fear of infection and transmission between the five areas of work were explained by differences in risk management. Among eldercare personnel, self-reported exposure to infection and lack of access to test was most consistently associated with fear of infection and fear of transmission, whereas lack of access to personal protective equipment was solely associated with fear of transmission. CONCLUSION: We have illustrated differences and similarities in COVID-19 risk management within five areas of work and provide new insights into factors associated with eldercare workers' fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection.","Nabe-Nielsen, Kirsten; Nilsson, Charlotte Juul; Juul-Madsen, Maria; Bredal, Charlotte; Hansen, Lars Ole Preisler; Hansen, Åse Marie",Occup. environ. med,,167
317078,Feasibility of lung imaging with a large field-of-view spectral photon-counting CT system,2021,"COVID-19 is associated with a wide range of extrarespiratory complications, of which the pathogenesis is currently not fully understood. However, both systemic spread and systemic inflammatory responses are thought to contribute to the systemic pathogenesis. In this study, we determined the temporal kinetics of viral RNA in serum (RNAemia) and the associated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the course of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. We show that RNAemia can be detected in 90% of the patients who develop critical disease, compared to 50% of the patients who develop moderate or severe disease. Furthermore, RNAemia lasts longer in patients who develop critical disease. Elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and MCP-1-but not IL-6-are associated with viral load in serum, whereas higher levels of IL-6 in serum were associated with the development of critical disease. In conclusion, RNAemia is common in hospitalized patients, with the highest frequency and duration in patients who develop critical disease. The fact that several cytokines or chemokines are directly associated with the presence of viral RNA in the circulation suggests that the development of RNAemia is an important factor in the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Severe COVID-19 can be considered a systemic disease as many extrarespiratory complications occur. However, the systemic pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that the presence of viral RNA in the blood (RNAemia) occurs more frequently in patients who develop critical disease, compared to patients with moderate or severe disease. In addition, RNAemia is associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, like MCP-1 and IL-10, in serum during the course of disease. This suggests that extrarespiratory spread of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to systemic inflammatory responses, which are an important factor in the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19.","van Riel, Debby; Embregts, Carmen W E; Sips, Gregorius J; van den Akker, Johannes P C; Endeman, Henrik; van Nood, Els; Raadsen, Mathijs; Bauer, Lisa; van Kampen, Jeroen; Molenkamp, Richard; Koopmans, Marion; van de Vijver, David; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine H",mSphere,,167

Since this pandemic began, extraordinary efforts have been made by scientists to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and to fight the infection by providing various preventive, diagnostic and treatment opportunities based on either novel hypotheses or past experiences. Despite all the achievements, COVID-19 continues to be an accelerating health threat with no specifically approved vaccine or therapy. This review highlights the recent advances in COVID-19 infection, with a particular emphasis on nanomedicine applications that can help in the development of effective vaccines or therapeutics against COVID-19.

318523,Role of serum amylase and salivary cytokines in oral complications during chemoradiotherapy,2020,"Serological tests are essential for the control and management of COVID-19 pandemic, not only for current and historical diagnostics but especially for surveillance, epidemiological, and acquired immunity studies. Clinical COVID-19 serology is routinely performed by enzymatic or chemiluminescence immunoassays (i.e., ELISA or CLIA), which provide good sensitivities at the expense of relatively long turnaround times and specialized laboratory settings. Rapid serological tests, based on lateral flow assays, have also been developed and widely commercialized, but they suffer from limited reliability due to relatively low sensitivity and specificity. We have developed and validated a direct serological biosensor assay employing proprietary technology based on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The biosensor offers a rapid -less than 15 min- identification and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directly in clinical samples, without the need of any signal amplification. The portable plasmonic biosensor device employs a custom-designed multi-antigen sensor biochip, combining the two main viral antigens (RBD peptide and N protein), for simultaneous detection of human antibodies targeting both antigens. The SPR serology assay reaches detection limits in the low ng mL-1 range employing polyclonal antibodies as standard, which are well below the commonly detected antibody levels in COVID-19 patients. The assay has also been implemented employing the first WHO approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin standard. We have carried out a clinical validation with COVID-19 positive and negative samples (n=120) that demonstrates the excellent diagnostic sensitivity (99%) and specificity (100%). This positions our biosensor device as an accurate, robust, and easy-to-use diagnostics tool for rapid and reliable COVID-19 serology to be employed both at laboratory and decentralized settings for the management of COVID-19 patients and for the evaluation of immunological status during vaccination, treatment or in front of emerging variants.&lt;br&gt;","Olalla, Calvo-Lozano MIquel Sierra Maria Soler M.-Carmen Estevez luis Chiscano-camon Adolfo Ruiz-Sanmartín Juan Carlos Ruiz-Rodriguez Ricard Ferrer Juan José González-López Juliana Esperalba Candela fernandez-naval leticia Bueno Rubén López-Aladid Antoni Torres Laia Fernández-Barat Sarah Attoumani Remi Charrel Bruno Coutard Laura M.; Lechuga,",,,167

320176,Role of adjunctive treatment strategies in COVID-19 and a review of international and national clinical guidelines,2020,"BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, the coexistence of multiple chronic conditions in an individual, is a growing public health challenge. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing remains an indispensable measure to limit the spread of the virus. This pertains especially to those belonging to high-risk groups, namely older adults with multimorbidity. In-person visits are discouraged for this cohort; hence, there is a need for an alternative form of consultation such as video consultations to continue the provision of care. OBJECTIVE: The potential of video consultations has been explored in several studies. However, the emergence of COVID-19 presents us with an unprecedented opportunity to explore the use of this technological innovation in a time when physical distancing is imperative. This study will evaluate the sustainability of video consultations on a micro-, meso-, and macro-level by assessing the views of patients, physicians, and organizational and national policymakers, respectively. METHODS: The NASSS (nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability) framework was designed as a guide for the development of health care technologies. In this study, the implementation of and experiences related to video consultations will be studied using the NASSS framework. Individual in-depth interviews or focus group discussions will be conducted with participants using the Zoom platform. Data will be analyzed by at least two investigators trained in qualitative methodology, organized thematically, and coded in two phases-an initial phase and a focused selective phase. All disagreements will be resolved by consulting the larger research team until consensus is reached. RESULTS: This study was approved for funding from the Geriatric Education and Research Institute. Ethics approval was obtained from the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board (reference #2020/00760). Study recruitment commenced in July 2020. The results of the data analysis are expected to be available by the end of the year. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to evaluate the adoption and sustainability of video consultations for older adults with multimorbidity during the pandemic as well as post COVID-19. The study will yield knowledge that will challenge the current paradigm on how care is being delivered for community-dwelling older adults with multimorbidity. Findings will be shared with administrators in the health care sector in order to enhance the safety and quality of these video consultations to improve patient care for this group of population.

321872,Relevance of the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) as a target for COVID-19 therapy,2020,"The current study addresses several concerns regarding World Heritage Sites (WHSs) in developing countries. Using a novel super-efficiency parallel framework, this research firstly elucidates how WHS designation impacts the tourism sector in the 21 developing nations with the greatest number of WHSs from 2000 through 2016. The proposed parallel model assesses the tourism industry at both the macro level in the context of resource-oriented efficiency and the micro level in facility-oriented efficiency. The results demonstrate that the WHS brand positively impacts the tourism demand in developing countries and can be used as a promotional tool. Secondly, this work draws attention to the socio-ecological concerns related to WHSs in developing countries. It sets out a critical and factual discussion based on the current designation and conservation status of WHSs. The analysis highlights an unfair distribution of WHSs between developing and advanced economies and reveals negligence in their preservation, since around 94% of sites labeled In Danger are located in developing nations. The study concludes that the conservation of WHSs is a complex societal problem and offers policy implications for handling heritage inscription and preservation issues in developing countries. Finally, it explores pathways toward sustainable conservation of WHSs, based on United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) for safeguarding heritage and sustainable communities (SDG 11), for more effective institutions (SDG 16), and for fair and nonhegemonic partnership between advanced economies and developing countries (SDG 17).

This has widened an already large gap between patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) who need treatment and those who have actually received treatment. For a disorder where group therapy has been the mainstay treatment option for decades, social distancing, shelter in place, and treatment discontinuation have created an urgent need for alternative approaches to addiction treatment. In an attempt to continue some care for patients in need, many medical institutions have transitioned to a virtual environment to promote safe social distancing. Although there is ample evidence to support telemedical interventions, these can be difficult to implement, especially in the SUD population. This article reviews current literature for the use of telehealth interventions in the treatment of SUDs and offers recommendations on safe and effective implementation strategies based on the current literature.","Oesterle, Tyler S; Kolla, Bhanuprakash; Risma, Cameron J; Breitinger, Scott A; Rakocevic, Daniela B; Loukianova, Larissa L; Hall-Flavin, Daniel K; Gentry, Melanie T; Rummans, Teresa A; Chauhan, Mohit; Gold, Mark S",Mayo Clin Proc,,167

Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1ß and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1ß or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in immunopathology modelled by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1ß and IL-6 response modules, but not the cytokine transcripts themselves, is a feature of infection in the nasopharynx and blood, but is not associated with severity of COVID-19 disease, length of stay or mortality. We propose that IL-1ß and IL-6 transcriptional response modules provide a dynamic readout of functional cytokine activity in vivo, aiding quantification of the biological effects of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.","Bell, Lucy Ck; Meydan, Cem; Kim, Jacob; Foox, Jonathan; Butler, Daniel; Mason, Christopher E; Shapira, Sagi D; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Pollara, Gabriele",iScience,,167

Indoor air pollution is a problem of global environmental concern as well. Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a reactive oxygen species that plays important role in bacteria/virus inactivation and pollutant degradation. In this study, we found that commercially available filters typically deployed in air purifier and air conditioning units, when impregnated with Rose Bengal (RB) as a 1O2 sensitizer, can be used for heterogeneous gas-phase generation of 1O2. It was confirmed that irradiation of the RB filter under oxygen gas stream produced 1O2, which was measured using furfuryl alcohol trapping method followed by HPLC analysis. It was also observed that the amount of 1O2 generated increases as the light intensity increased. Similarly, the sensitizer loading also positively influenced the 1O2 generation. The heterogeneous gas-phase generation of 1O2 can find potential applications in air purifier and air conditioning units for the purpose of bacteria/virus inactivation and/or pollutant degradation thereby improving indoor air quality.","Sunday, Michael Oluwatoyin; Sakugawa, Hiroshi",Sci Total Environ,,167

However, in developing countries such as Algeria, where a significant stock of frying oil is unused, the use of diesel engines powered with waste-oil-derived biofuels must be explored. In this work, the variables related to the transesterification reaction from this frying oil with ethanol are analyzed using response surface methodology. From this analysis, only the reaction time and temperature have been determined as relevant parameters. In addition, FT-IR analysis has proven a useful tool to analyse the conversion in the transesterification reaction of waste frying oil with ethanol and is cheaper and quicker than GC-FID. This sustainable biofuel (FAEE), mixed with a diesel and pure fuel, has been physically characterized. The mixture of FAEE at 30% by volume with diesel meets the requirements demanded in standard EN 590 and can be classified as winter diesel class D. As a pure biofuel, only its high cold flow temperatures could constitute a drawback for exporting to temperate climates but not for internal consumption.","Ortega, Marcelo F; Donoso, David; Bousbaa, Hamza; Bolonio, David; Ballesteros, Rosario; García-Martínez, María-Jesús; Lapuerta, Magín; Canoira, Laureano",Waste Biomass Valorization,,167

METHODS: Patients followed up at 2 rheumatology referral centers in Lombardy from February 25, 2020 to April 10, 2020 were invited to participate in a survey designed to identify patients who had confirmed COVID-19, close contact with others with confirmed COVID-19, or symptoms of the infection, and to detect changes in work, behavior, and disease management made in an attempt to prevent infection. The incidence of COVID-19 in the Lombardy population was obtained from the National Institute of Statistics. COVID-19 cases were confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The survey was given to 955 patients (531 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 203 patients with psoriatic arthritis, 181 patients with spondyloarthritis, and 40 patients with connective tissue diseases, vasculitides, or autoinflammatory diseases). These patients had a mean age of 53.7 years, and 67.4% were women. The rate of response to the survey was 98.05%, and the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases was consistent with that in the general population (0.62% versus 0.66%; P = 0.92). None of the patients had severe complications or required intensive care treatment, and all of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 temporarily discontinued ongoing targeted synthetic drug or biologic DMARD therapy. Almost all patients took precautions to prevent the COVID-19 infection (90.6%), and almost all continued treatment with targeted synthetic drugs or biologic DMARDs (93.2%). Disease activity remained stable in 89.5% of patients. CONCLUSION: Our results reflected the attitude of patients with rheumatic diseases regarding the prevention of the infection while maintaining their long-term treatment regimens. The incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients treated with targeted synthetic drugs or biologic DMARDs was not significantly different from that in the general population in the same region.","Favalli, Ennio Giulio; Monti, Sara; Ingegnoli, Francesca; Balduzzi, Silvia; Caporali, Roberto; Montecucco, Carlomaurizio",Arthritis rheumatol.

Moreover, 82.51% (184 of 223) of these patients experienced negative results from three consecutive nucleic acid tests, the median time from the onset of COVID-19 to the occurrence of three consecutive negative nucleic acid tests was 23 days (range: 3-56 days), and 38 of which were further tested after three consecutive negative nucleic acid tests, while about 5.26% (2 of 38) patients showed positive nucleic acid test results. Thus, we suggested that the patient should be negative for at least 3 consecutive nucleic acid tests before discharge, and the test time should be no earlier than the 23rd day since the onset of the disease.","Lu, Rui; Huang, Tianhui; Hu, Haiqing; Liu, Xiao-Ping",PLoS One,,167
325270,"Hypertension Phenotypes, Target Organ Damage and Stiff Arteries and Severity of Covid-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a serious health concern. Repurposing of existing drugs indicated for other conditions seems to be the first choice for immediate therapeutic management. The quality of early evidence favoring the different treatment options needs to be apprised for informed decision-making. METHODS: In this systematic literature review, we apprised the quality of available evidence for different therapeutic options and also the basis for different treatment guidelines. To include all studies that are in different stages of publication, we also included studies from the preprint servers BioRxiv and MedRxiv and published studies from PubMed. RESULTS: We retrieved 5621 articles and included 22 studies for the systematic review. Based on our study, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, remdesivir, corticosteroids, convalescent sera, ritonavir/lopinavir, tocilizumab and arbidol were evaluated as therapeutic options. The data from different study designs reveal contradictory findings except for convalescent sera for which the evidence available is only from case series. Based on this early evidence, various national guidelines recommend remdesivir, convalescent sera, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine in different subsets of patients. CONCLUSION: Establishing consensus with respect to the end points to be assessed for respiratory viruses may enhance the quality of evidence in case of future pandemics. The systematic review highlighted the lacuna and methodologic deficiency in early clinical evidence and included an update on different therapeutic management guidelines. Further clinical evidence from the ongoing trials may lead to evolution of treatment guidelines with the addition of more therapeutic options.","Subramanian, Kaushik; Nalli, Anuradha; Senthil, Vinitha; Jain, Saurabh; Nayak, Aravind; Bhat, Amit",Adv Ther,,167

325800,Does Living in Previously Exposed Malaria or Warm Areas is Associated with a Lower Risk of Severe COVID-19 Infection in Italy?,,"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most centers performing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have switched to the use of cryopreserved grafts. Previous investigators have suggested that cryopreserved allografts may heighten risk of nonengraftment. To date, no study has investigated the effect of cryopreservation of CD34-selected hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+ HPCs) used as the sole graft source. In this study, we sought to evaluate outcomes after unrelated donor or matched sibling allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34+ HPCs. This was a single-center analysis of adult patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34-selected allo-HCT grafts between January 2010 and June 2017. All patients received ablative conditioning and antirejection prophylaxis with rabbit antithymocyte globulin. G-CSF-mobilized leukapheresis products underwent CD34 selection using the CliniMACS Reagent System. Cells were then cryopreserved in DMSO (final concentration 7.5%) to -90 °C using a controlled-rate freezing system before being transferred to vapor-phase liquid nitrogen storage. In internal validation, this method has shown 92% mean CD34+ cell viability and 99.7% mean CD34+ cell recovery. Engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days of an absolute neutrophil count of &#8805;0.5. Platelet recovery was recorded as the first of 7 consecutive days with a platelet count &#8805;20 K/µL without transfusion. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), and cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate rates of relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). A total of 64 patients received a cryopreserved CD34-selected graft. The median CD34+ cell count before cryopreservation was 6.6 × 106/kg (range, 1.4 to 16.1 × 106/kg), and the median CD3+ cell count was 2.0 × 103/kg (range, 0 to 21.1 × 106/kg). All patients were engrafted, at a median of 11 days post-HCT (range, 8 to 14 days). One patient had poor graft function in the setting of cytomegalovirus viremia, necessitating a CD34-selected boost on day +57. The median time to platelet recovery was 16 days (range, 13 to 99 days). The estimated 2-year OS was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58% to 83%) with cryopreserved grafts versus 62% (95% CI, 57% to 67%) with fresh grafts (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.35; P = .5). The estimated 2-year RFS in the 2 groups was 59% (95% CI, 48% to 74%) versus 56% (95% CI, 51% to 61%; HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.51; P > .9). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 29% (95% CI, 17% to 41%) versus 23% (95% CI, 19% to 27%; P = .16), and the cumulative incidence of NRM at 2 years was 17% (95% CI, 9% to 28%) versus 23% (95% CI, 19% to 28%; P = .24). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD by day +100 was 16% with cryopreserved grafts (95% CI, 8% to 26%) and 16% (95% CI, 13% to 20%; P = .97) with fresh grafts. Moderate to severe chronic GVHD by day +365 occurred in only 1 recipient of a cryopreserved graft (2%). Our data show that in patients with hematologic malignancies who received cryopreserved allogeneic CD34+ HPCs, engraftment, GVHD, and survival outcomes were consistent with those seen in recipients of fresh allogeneic CD34+ HPC grafts at our center. Our laboratory validation and clinical experience demonstrate the safety of our cryopreservation procedure for CD34-selected allografts.","Jacob, Reuben P; Flynn, Jessica; Devlin, Sean M; Maloy, Molly; Giralt, Sergio A; Maslak, Peter; O039,; Reilly, Richard J; Tonon, Jo-Ann; Perales, Miguel Angel; Avecilla, Scott T; Cho, Christina",Transplant Cell Ther,,167
326180,Usability of detecting delivery errors during treatment of prostate VMAT with a gantry-mounted transmission detector,2021,"This study examines the impact of air quality in selected Indian metropolitan cities during the COVID19 pandemic lockdown period. Concentrations of air quality parameters such as PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO during the transition to lockdown and the actual lockdown period were compared with business as usual periods (a period prior to COVID19 lockdown and a corresponding period in 2019) to estimate the reduction in emission in four major IT hubs in India namely Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. A 40-45% reduction in PM2.5 concentration was observed, in these cities, during the lockdown compared to the corresponding period in 2019 and a 20-45% reduction was observed compared to business as usual period in 2020. A vehicle kilometer traveled (VKT)-related questionnaire survey-based study in Hyderabad revealed that, with 48% of population utilizing work-from-home during the transition to lockdown period, vehicular PM2.5 emission in Hyderabad reduced by 54% compared to usual traffic emissions prior to COVID19 lockdown. Furthermore, it was estimated that emission of up to 3243, 777, 113, and 54 tons/year of CO, NOx, PM2.5, and SO2, respectively, could be avoided in Hyderabad alone, if work-from-home is implemented on a 2 days/week basis. The experience from this study can be used to develop policies favoring reduced use of private vehicles or implementation of work-from-home to combat air pollution and reduce carbon emissions.","Eregowda, Tejaswini; Chatterjee, Pritha; Pawar, Digvijay S",Environ Syst Decis,,167

METHODS: We analyzed spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images of 35 retinitis pigmentosa patients and 40 healthy individuals. We measured macular and ganglion cell complex thicknesses. We took choroidal thickness measurements in the subfoveal region and 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mm from the foveal center. RESULTS: Patients with retinitis pigmentosa had significantly thinner macular thicknesses and choroidal thicknesses in all measurements, and their individual ganglion cell complex thickness measurements were lower than those in healthy individuals. The mean ganglion cell complex thickness was significantly lower in patients with retinitis pigmentosa than that in controls. The mean macular thickness was significantly correlated with the mean choroidal and mean ganglion cell complex thicknesses. (We found no correlation between the mean choroidal thickness and the mean ganglion cell complex thickness). CONCLUSIONS: The choroid was mildly affected in our patients with early retinitis pigmentosa. The tendency toward significance in the inner retina was possibly caused by a good visual acuity.","Akay, Fahrettin; Akmaz, Berkay; Güven, Yusuf Ziya",Arq Bras Oftalmol,,167

Herein, twenty-one novel dantrolene-like hydrazide and hydrazone analogues were synthesized with the aim of exploring structure-activity relationships (SARs) for the inhibition of human monoamine oxidases (MAOs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), two well-established target enzymes for anti-AD drugs. With few exceptions, the newly synthesized compounds exhibited selectivity toward MAO B over either MAO A and AChE, with the secondary aldimine 9 and phenylhydrazone 20 attaining IC50 values of 0.68 and 0.81 µM, respectively. While no general SAR trend was observed with lipophilicity descriptors, a molecular simplification strategy allowed the main pharmacophore features to be identified, which are responsible for the inhibitory activity toward MAO B. Finally, further in vitro investigations revealed cell protection from oxidative insult and activation of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier as concomitant biological activities responsible for neuroprotection by hits 9 and 20 and other promising compounds in the examined series.","Bolognino, Isabella; Giangregorio, Nicola; Tonazzi, Annamaria; Martínez, Antón L; Altomare, Cosimo D; Loza, María I; Sablone, Sara; Cellamare, Saverio; Catto, Marco",ChemMedChem (Internet),,167

METHODS: Key questions were formulated in order to perform a literature review on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with inflammatory neuropathies. Based on the best evidence and expert opinion, a list of recommendations was formulated to inform decision on vaccination for COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory neuropathies and increase adherence to vaccination programmes. RESULTS: Recommendations addressing safety and efficacy of vaccination in patients with inflammatory neuropathies were formulated. No data are currently available on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with inflammatory neuropathies or other immune-mediated conditions. There is only sparse data on the safety of previous available vaccines in patients with inflammatory neuropathies, but studies on other autoimmune disorders indicate that these are safe and mostly efficacious. Patients with inflammatory neuropathies might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Patients with inflammatory neuropathies should be encouraged to adhere to the vaccination campaign for COVID-19. These recommendations provide guidance on the management of vaccinations for COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory neuropathies. More research is needed regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccination in patients with inflammatory neuropathies and other immune conditions.","Doneddu, Pietro E; Spina, Emanuele; Briani, Chiara; Fabrizi, Gian Maria; Manganelli, Fiore; Nobile-Orazio, Eduardo",J. peripher. nerv. syst,,167

Inspired by this success, this paper applied DL to predict flight demand and delays, which have been a concern for airlines and the other stakeholders in the National Airspace System (NAS). Demand and delay prediction can be formulated as a supervised learning problem, where, given an understanding of past historical demand and delays, a deep learning network can examine sequences of historic data to predict current and future sequences. With that in mind, we applied a well-known DL method, sequence to sequence (seq2seq), to solve the problem. Our results show that the seq2seq method can reduce demand prediction mean squared error (MSE) by 50%, compared to two classical baseline algorithms.","Wang, Liya; Mykityshyn, Amy; Johnson, Craig; Marple, Benjamin D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04476v2.pdf,167

Given the drastic changes to resident roles, expectations, and responsibilities, many valuable lessons regarding resident concerns and wellness can be garnered from this unique experience. METHODS: A voluntary survey was sent to 179 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic surgery residency program directors to distribute to their residents. Questions focused on issues that may have occurred, program's responses, and expectations of programs during the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 507 residents completed the survey, and 10% reported being deployed to do nonorthopaedic-related care, with junior classes being more likely to receive this assignment (P < 0.001). The greatest concern for respondents was the possibility of getting family members sick (mean = 3.89, on scale of 1-5), followed by personally contracting the illness (mean = 3.38). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous changes and novel sources of adversity for the orthopaedic surgery resident. Contrary to popular opinion, most residents are comfortable with the proposition of providing nonorthopaedic care. The possibility of bringing a pathogen to the home environment and infecting family members seems to be an overarching concern, and efforts to ensure resident and family safety are key.","Nolte, Michael T; Tornetta, Paul; Mehta, Samir; Ponce, Brent A; Grabowski, Gregory; Turner, Norman S; Spitnale, Michael J; Kogan, Monica",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,,167

However, specific molecular information about immune response in critical patients with COVID-19 is poorly understood. A total of 54 patients were enrolled and divided into three groups, among which 34 were common, 14 were severe, and 6 were critical. The constitution of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients was analyzed by CyTOF. The profile of cytokines was examined in plasma of patients using luminex. The IL-2 signaling pathway was investigated in the PBMC of patients by qRT-PCR. The count and percentage of lymphocytes were significantly decreased in critical patients compared to common and severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The count of T cells, B cells, and NK cells was remarkably decreased in critical patients compared to normal controls. The percentage of CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in critical patients than that in common and severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The expression of IL-2R, JAK1, and STAT5 decreased in PBMC of common, severe, and critical patients, but IL-2 level was elevated in severe patients and decreased in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The decrease of CD8+ T cells in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may be related to the IL-2 signaling pathway. The inhibition of IL-2/IL-2R gives rise to CD8+ T cell and lymphocyte decrease through JAK1-STAT5 in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Shi, Hongbo; Wang, Wenjing; Yin, Jiming; Ouyang, Yabo; Pang, Lijun; Feng, Yingmei; Qiao, Luxin; Guo, Xianghua; Shi, Honglin; Jin, Ronghua; Chen, Dexi",Cell Death Dis,,167
329466,Intraperitoneal hyperthermia chemotherapy under New Coronavirus Pneumonia COVID-19: prevention and control guidelines (first edition),2020,"A novel concept in DNA vaccine design is the creation of an inhaled DNA plasmid construct containing a portion of the coronavirus spike protein for treatment and vaccination. The secretion of a spike protein portion will function as a competitive antagonist by interfering with the binding of coronavirus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The secreted protein binding to the ACE2 receptor provides a unique mechanism of action for treatment to all strains of coronavirus in naïve patients, by blocking the ACE2 receptor site. An inhaled plasmid DNA vaccine replicates the route of lung infection taken by coronavirus with transfected cells secreting spike protein portions to induce immunity. Unlike most DNA vaccines with intracellular antigen presentation through MHC I, the current vaccine relies on the secreted proteins presentation through MHC II as well as MHC I to induce immunity. Lung specific production of vaccine particles by inhaled plasmid DNA is appealing since it may have limited systemic side effects, and may induce both humoral and cytotoxic immunity. Finally, the ease and ability to rapidly produce this plasmid construct makes this an ideal solution for managing the emerging threat of coronavirus.","Tatlow, Dean; Tatlow, Corinne; Tatlow, Scarlet; Tatlow, Savanah",Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,,167

Although studies investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the organizational structure, job design, and employee well-being have been on the rise, fewer studies examined the role of leadership and what it takes to be an effective leader during such times. This study integrates social cognitive theory and conservation of resources theory to argue for the importance of adaptive personality in the emergence of effective leaders during crisis times, utilizing the crisis of COVID-19 as the context for the study. We argue that managers with an adaptive personality tend to have increased self-efficacy levels to lead during a crisis, resulting in increased motivation to lead during the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, managers with increased motivation to lead during the COVID-19 crisis are argued to have enhanced adaptive performance, thereby suggesting a serial mediation model where crisis leader self-efficacy and motivation to lead during the COVID-19 crisis act as explanatory mechanisms of the relationship between the adaptive personality and performance of the manager. In order to test our hypotheses, we collected data from 116 full-time managers in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 crisis and used hierarchical linear regression as the method of analysis. The findings support all of the hypotheses.

This article provides clinicians with a distilled understanding of the diagnoses and their epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management. RECENT FINDINGS: Cough-induced headache requires neuroimaging to exclude posterior fossa pathology and recently has been reported as a common symptom in patients with CSF-venous fistula. Clinical overlap is observed between patients with primary exercise headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity. Patients with recurrent thunderclap headache associated with sexual activity should be presumed to have reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome until proven otherwise. De novo external-pressure headache is a common sequela among health care workers using personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily persistent headache is an important mimicker of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache and is distinguished by a daily-from-onset progression of persistent headache; a treatment-refractory course is often observed, and early involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including a psychotherapist, is advised.

331024,Viral respiratory infections and psychosis: A review of the literature and the implications of COVID-19,2021,"The purpose of this study was to empirically test the proposition that contagion of emotions triggers moral disengagement and subsequent increases in work-related injuries Using emotional contagion and social cognitive theories, we tested the proposition that higher contagion of anger (i e , a negative emotion that interferes with mental functioning and enables inappropriate behavior) would trigger moral justifications for safety violations, whereas higher contagion of joy (i e , a positive emotion accompanied by an optimal operating condition and constructive activity) would prevent safety-related moral disengagement In turn, moral disengagement was predicted to be related to higher rates of subsequent workplace injuries Using a cross-country and multi-method (i e , cross-lagged, cross-sectional) design, data from 503 employees in the U S (two-wave) and 538 employees in Italy (cross-sectional) supported the hypothesized mediation model Specifically, both in the U S and Italy, emotional contagion of anger positively predicted moral disengagement, whereas emotional contagion of joy negatively predicted moral disengagement Furthermore, moral disengagement positively predicted experienced injuries and partially mediated the relationship between contagion of joy/anger and injuries These findings suggest that moral justifications of safety violations, and related injuries, may be prevented by exchanges of positive emotions (and triggered by exchanges of negative emotions) that employees absorb during social interactions at work Theoretical and practical implications for organizational ethics are discussed in light of the globally increasing emotional pressure and concerns for a safe and psychologically healthy environment in today’s workplace, particularly given the recent pandemic spread of Coronavirus disease (CoVid-19)","Petitta, Laura Probst Tahira M.; Ghezzi, Valerio Barbaranelli Claudio",Safety Science,,167

Subject to country-specific variability, it is projected that with current mitigation measures in place, the peak incidence of active COVID-19 infections may be delayed by over 6 months. Although this aims to prevent the overburdening of healthcare systems, prolonged deferral of elective endoscopy will become unsustainable. Herein, we propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments, a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible. Our algorithm not only focuses on the safety of patients and healthcare workers, but also assists in rationalizing the use of invaluable resources such as personal protective equipment.","Gupta, Sunil; Shahidi, Neal; Gilroy, Nicole; Rex, Douglas K; Burgess, Nicholas G; Bourke, Michael J",Gastrointest Endosc,,167
331306,Next steps for efficacy evaluation in clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"In recent years, emerging technologies have gained popularity and being implemented in different fields. Thus, critical leading-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and other related technologies (blockchain, simulation, 3d printing, etc.) are transforming the operations and other traditional fields and proving their value in fighting against unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks. However, due to this relation's novelty, little is known about the interplay between emerging technologies and COVID-19 and its implications to operations-related fields. In this vein, we mapped the extant literature on this integration by a structured literature review approach and found essential outcomes. In addition to the literature mapping, this paper's main contributions were identifying literature scarcity on this hot topic by operations-related fields; consequently, our paper emphasizes an urgent call to action. Also, we present a novel framework considering the primary emerging technologies and the operations processes concerning this pandemic outbreak. Also, we provided an exciting research agenda and four propositions derived from the framework, which are collated to operations processes angle. Thus, scholars and practitioners have the opportunity to adapt and advance the framework and empirically investigate and validate the propositions for this and other highly disruptive crisis.","Queiroz, Maciel M; Fosso Wamba, Samuel",Ann Oper Res,,167

Given the novelty of the disease, risk factors of mortality and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients remain to be elucidated. We present the results of a retrospective cohort study including patients admitted to a large tertiary-care, academic university hospital with COVID-19. Patients were admitted with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 March and 15 April 2020. Baseline clinical characteristics and admission laboratory variables were retrospectively collected. Patients were grouped based on mortality, need for ICU care, and mechanical ventilation. Prevalence of clinical co-morbidities and laboratory abnormalities were compared between groups using descriptive statistics. Univariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of mortality, ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Predictors significant at P &#8804; .10 were included in multivariate analysis. Five hundred and sixty patients were included in the analysis. Age and myocardial injury were only independent predictors of mortality, in patients with/without baseline co-morbidities. Body mass index, elevated ferritin, elevated d-dimer, and elevated procalcitonin predicted need for ICU care, and these along with vascular disease at baseline predicted need for mechanical ventilation. Hence, inflammatory markers (ferritin and d-dimer) predicted severe disease, but not death.","Harmouch, Farah; Shah, Kashyap; Hippen, John T; Kumar, Ashish; Goel, Harsh",J. med. virol,,167
332853,COVID-19 and iron dysregulation: distant sequence similarity between hepcidin and the novel coronavirus spike glycoprotein,2020,"According to the World Health Organisation, one of the main concerns of COVID-19 virus is its tenacity to spread from droplets that either land directly on a surface or are transmitted to a surface by an infected person. In this study, we report the potential of using superhydrophobic surfaces to combat the transmission and spread of fomites infected by COVID-19 virus strand. Fomites include clothes, utensils, furniture, regularly touched objects and personal protective equipment used by Health Care Workers to act as barriers against fluid transmission and/or fluid penetration. In this effort, we propose three strategies to combat the transmission and the spread of the virus: encapsulation, contamination suppression, and elimination. We believe that this can be achieved by the use of our recently developed superhydrophobic coating and regenerative monolith to encapsulate and suppress the virus. The newly developed superhydrophobic coating and monolith are scalable, economical, and facile with the monolith capable of regeneration. The elimination of the virus will be through the use of antiviral and antibacterial copper nanoparticles or dedicated copper surfaces.","Meguid, S. A.; Elzaabalawy, Assem",Int. J. Mech. Mater.

Utilizing Canadian survey data, this study assessed household- and employment-related risk factors for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 1005 English-speaking Canadian adults aged 18+ years completed a web-based survey after physical distancing measures were implemented across Canada. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of depressive symptoms with household- (household size, presence of children, residence locale) and employment-related (job with high risk of COVID-19 exposure, working from home, laid off/not working, financial worry) risk factors, controlling for demographic factors (gender, age, education, income). RESULTS: About 20.4% of the sample reported depressive symptoms at least 3 days per week. The odds of experiencing depressive symptoms 3+ days in the past week were higher among women (AOR = 1.67, p = 0.002) and younger adults (18-29 years AOR = 2.62, p < 0.001). After adjusting for demographic variables, the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms were higher in households with 4+ persons (AOR = 1.88, p = 0.01), in households with children aged 6 to 12 years (AOR = 1.98, p = 0.02), among those with a job at high risk for exposure to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.82, p = 0.01), and those experiencing financial worry due to COVID-19 ('very worried' AOR = 8.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pandemic responses must include resources for mental health interventions. Additionally, further research is needed to track mental health trajectories and inform the development, targeting, and implementation of appropriate mental health prevention and treatment interventions.","Wickens, Christine M; Hamilton, Hayley A; Elton-Marshall, Tara; Nigatu, Yeshambel T; Jankowicz, Damian; Wells, Samantha",Can J Public Health,,167

Abnormal activation of RAS upregulates angiotensin II (Ang-II) and contributes to severe manifestations of COVID-19. Although RAS inhibitors (RASi) are a mainstay of antihypertensive therapy, they have been associated (in some animal studies) with an increase in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nonetheless, current medical practice does not recommend curtailing RASi to protect hypertensive patients from COVID. On the contrary, there is clinical evidence to support a beneficial effect of RASi for hypertensive patients in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, although the precise mechanism for this is unclear. In this paper, we hypothesize that RASi reduces the severity of COVID-19 by promoting ACE2-AT1R complex formation at the cell surface, where AT1R mediates the major vasopressor effects of Ang-II. Furthermore, we propose that the interaction between ACE2 and AT1R impedes binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, thereby allowing ACE2 to convert Ang-II to the more beneficial Ang(1-7), that has vasodilator and anti-inflammatory activity. Evidence for ACE2-AT1R complex formation during reduced Ang-II comes from receptor colocalization studies in isolated HEK293 cells, but this has not been confirmed in cells having endogenous expression of ACE2 and AT1R. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus attacks the kidney, as well as the heart and lung, our hypothesis for the effect of RASi on COVID-19 could be tested in vitro using human proximal tubule cells (HK-2), having ACE2 and AT1 receptors. Specifically, colocalization of fluorescent labelled: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, ACE2, and AT1R in HK-2 cells can be used to clarify the mechanism of RASi action in renal and lung epithelia, which could lead to protocols for reducing the severity of COVID-19 in both hypertensive and normotensive patients.","Sackin, Henry",Med Hypotheses,,167
335940,Monitoring COVID-19 RNA methyltransferases activities for developing therapeutic drugs,2021,"Policy Points Equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine in all countries remains a key policy objective, but experience of previous pandemics suggests access will be limited in developing countries, despite the rapid development of three successful vaccine candidates. The COVAX Facility seeks to address this important issue, but the prevalence of vaccine nationalism threatens to limit the ability of the facility to meet both its funding targets and its ambitious goals for vaccine procurement. A failure to adequately address the underlying lack of infrastructure in developing countries threatens to further limit the success of the COVAX Facility. CONTEXT: Significant effort has been directed toward developing a COVID-19 vaccine, which is viewed as the route out of the pandemic. Much of this effort has coalesced around COVAX, the multilateral initiative aimed at accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and ensuring they are equitably available in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper represents the first significant analysis of COVAX, and the extent to which it can be said to have successfully met these aims. METHODS: This paper draws on the publicly available policy documents made available by the COVAX initiatives, as well as position papers and public statements from governments around the world with respect to COVID-19 vaccines and equitable access. We analyze the academic literature regarding access to vaccines during the H1N1 pandemic. Finally, we consider the WHO Global Allocation System, and its principles, which are intended to guide COVAX vaccine deployment. FINDINGS: We argue that the funding mechanism deployed by the COVAX Pillar appears to be effective at fostering at-risk investments in research and development and the production of doses in advance of confirmation of clinical efficacy, but caution that this represents a win-win situation for vaccine manufacturers, providing them with opportunity to benefit regardless of whether their vaccine candidate ever goes on to gain regulatory approval. We also argue that the success of the COVAX Facility with respect to equitable access to vaccine is likely to be limited, primarily as a result of the prevalence of vaccine nationalism, whereby countries adopt policies which heavily prioritize their own public health needs at the expense of others. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts through COVAX have greatly accelerated the development of vaccines against COVID-19, but these benefits are unlikely to flow to LMICs, largely due to the threat of vaccine nationalism.","Eccleston-Turner, Mark; Upton, Harry",Milbank Q,,167

Based on 17,123 and 8693 emergency attendance for stroke and AMI, an interrupted time-series (ITS) study was conducted. Since 01/24/2020, the top two levels of regulations on major public health have been implemented in Beijing. This study covered from 03/01/2018 to 06/03/2020, including 19 weeks of lockdown period and 99 weeks before. A segmented Poisson regression model was used to estimate the immediate change and the monthly change in the secular trend of the emergency attendance rates. The emergency attendance rates of stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the lockdown period, with 52.1% (95% CI 45.8% to 57.7%) and 63.1% (95% CI 56.1% to 63.1%) immediate decreases for stroke and AMI, respectively. Then during the lockdown period, 7.0% (95% CI 2.5%, 11.6%) and 16.1% (95% CI 9.5, 23.1) increases per month in the secular trends of emergency attendance rates were shown for stroke and AMI, respectively. Though the accelerated increasing rates, there were estimated 1335 and 747 patients with stroke and AMI without seeking emergency medical aid during the lockdown, respectively. The emergency attendance for stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the pandemic then had gradual restoration thereafter. The results hint the need for more engagement and communications with all stakeholders to reduce the negative impact on CVD emergency medical services during the crisis.","Wu, Yiqun; Chen, Fei; Sun, Zhaobin; Zhang, Yingxian; Song, Yafang; Feng, Wuwei; Wang, Yuping; Liu, Ying; Song, Haiqing",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,167

In this review, recent trends in the synthesis and application of heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for the abatement of organic pollutants and disinfection of microorganisms are discussed. It is noted that as the complexity of cell wall increases, the resistance level towards various disinfectants increases and it requires either harsh conditions or longer exposure time for the complete disinfection. In case of viruses, enveloped viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) are found to be more susceptible to disinfectants than the non-enveloped viruses. The introduction of plasmonic materials with the Fenton catalysts broadens the visible light absorption efficiency of the hybrid material, and incorporation of semiconductor material improves the rate of regeneration of Fe(II) from Fe(III). A special emphasis is given to the use of Fenton catalysts for antibacterial applications. Composite materials of magnetite and ferrites remain a champion in this area because of their easy separation and reuse, owing to their magnetic properties. Iron minerals supported on clay materials, perovskites, carbon materials, zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) dramatically increase the catalytic degradation rate of contaminants by providing high surface area, good mechanical stability, and improved electron transfer. Moreover, insights to the zero-valent iron and its capacity to remove a wide range of organic pollutants, heavy metals and bacterial contamination are also discussed. Real world applications and the role of natural organic matter are summarised. Parameter optimisation (e.g. light source, dosage of catalyst, concentration of H2O2 etc.), sustainable models for the reusability or recyclability of the catalyst and the theoretical understanding and mechanistic aspects of the photo-Fenton process are also explained.

338504,Radiation Treatment of Protective Overalls and Selection of Personal Protection Equipment for the Personnel Exposed to Coronavirus Infection,2020,"AIM: To examine changes in smoking, drinking and quitting/reduction behaviour following the COVID-19 lockdown in England. DESIGN/SETTING: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019-February 2020) versus after (April 2020) lockdown. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 558 adults (&#8805; 16 years). MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown (before versus after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking, past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers), past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers) and use of evidence-based (e.g. prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support [telephone support/websites/applications (apps)] for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). FINDINGS: The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence [17.0% (after) versus 15.9% (before), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24], but was associated with increases in quit attempts [39.6 versus 29.1%, adjusted odds ratio (ORadj ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23-1.98], quit success (21.3 versus 13.9%, ORadj = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.33) and cessation (8.8 versus 4.1%, ORadj = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.69-4.09) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0 versus 51.5%, ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.72-1.68) but use of remote support increased (10.9 versus 2.7%, ORadj = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.56-8.23). Lockdown was associated with increases in high-risk drinking (38.3 versus 25.1%, OR = 1.85, CI = 1.67-2.06), but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5 versus 15.3%, ORadj = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.77-2.64). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2 versus 4.0%, ORadj = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.05-0.97) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9 versus 6.1%, ORadj = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.64-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: Following the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, smokers and high-risk drinkers in England were more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce alcohol consumption and rates of smoking cessation and use of remote cessation support were higher. However, high-risk drinking prevalence increased post-lockdown and use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers decreased with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","Jackson, Sarah E; Garnett, Claire; Shahab, Lion; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie",Addiction,,167

343115,Immune thrombocytopenia in a 22-year-old post Covid-19 vaccine,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the agent that causes COVID-19, invades epithelial cells, including those of the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa, using angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor. Subsequent inflammation can promote rapid virus clearance, but severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by an inefficient immune response that fails to clear the infection. Using primary epithelial organoids from human colon, we explored how the central antiviral mediator IFN-Î³, which is elevated in COVID-19, affects epithelial cell differentiation, ACE2 expression, and susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2. In mouse and human colon, ACE2 is mainly expressed by surface enterocytes. Inducing enterocyte differentiation in organoid culture resulted in increased ACE2 production. IFN-Î³ treatment promoted differentiation into mature KRT20+ enterocytes expressing high levels of ACE2, increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and resulted in enhanced virus production in infected cells. Similarly, infection-induced epithelial interferon signaling promoted enterocyte maturation and enhanced ACE2 expression. We here reveal a mechanism by which IFN-Î³-driven inflammatory responses induce a vulnerable epithelial state with robust replication of SARS-CoV-2, which may have an impact on disease outcome and virus transmission.","Heuberger, Julian; Trimpert, Jakob; Vladimirova, Daria; Goosmann, Christian; Lin, Manqiang; Schmuck, Rosa; Mollenkopf, Hans-Joachim; Brinkmann, Volker; Tacke, Frank; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Sigal, Michael",EMBO Mol Med,,167

Methods: We surveyed national ethics committees between 30 January and 21 February 2018. Findings: In total, representatives of 87 of 146 national ethics committees (59.6%) participated. The 84 countries covered were in all World Bank income categories and all World Health Organization regions. Many national ethics committees lack resources and face challenges in several domains, like independence, funding or efficacy. Only 40.2% (35/87) of committees expressed no concerns about independence. Almost a quarter (21/87) of committees did not make any ethics recommendations to their governments in 2017, and the median number of reports, opinions or recommendations issued was only two per committee Seventy-two (82.7%) national ethics committees included a philosopher or a bioethicist. Conclusion: National ethics (or bioethics) committees provide recommendations and guidance to governments and the public, thereby ensuring that public policies are informed by ethical concerns. Although the task is seemingly straightforward, implementation reveals numerous difficulties. Particularly in times of great uncertainty, such as during the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, governments would be well advised to base their actions not only on technical considerations but also on the ethical guidance provided by a national ethics committee. We found that, if the advice of national ethics committees is to matter, they must be legally mandated, independent, diverse in membership, transparent and sufficiently funded to be effective and visible.","Köhler, Johannes; Reis, Andreas Alois; Saxena, Abha",Bull World Health Organ,,167
344116,Off-Label Therapies for COVID-19-Are We All In This Together?,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the stratified anatomy of the traditional acupuncture point Jingbi and the neuroanatomical relationship between Jingbi and the brachial plexus, and investigated neural pathways that could be affected by acupuncture stimulation at Jingbi. METHODS: Twelve dissected specimens were used to study the pathway of an acupuncture needle inserted at Jingbi. The stratified anatomy and the neuroanatomical relationship between Jingbi and the brachial plexus were studied. Our samples were grouped by gender and cause of death for comparative analysis. RESULTS: All needles (n = 24, on both sides of a total of 12 cadavers) punctured the anterior scalene muscle medial to the brachial plexus and external jugular vein, lateral to the phrenic nerve and internal jugular vein, and superior to the clavicle and subclavian artery/vein. The depth of needle insertion at Jingbi on the right side of male samples was 28.0 (interquartile range (IQR), 22.5-30.8) mm, which was approximately 8 mm deeper than for female subjects (p < 0.05). The needle was 3.0 (IQR, 2.0-5.0) mm and 7.0 (IQR, 5.5-8.0) mm medial to the brachial plexus on the left and right sides, respectively. CONCLUSION: Deep needle insertion at Jingbi can puncture the anterior scalene muscle. The mechanism of action of acupuncture stimulation at Jingbi might be related to its close relationship with the brachial plexus. Significant differences in needling depth were observed when our samples were grouped by gender. More studies are needed.","Chia, Kwan Leung; Teoh, Jian Hung; Haberberger, Rainer Viktor",Acupunct Med,,167

345089,Determinants of Vaccination Uptake in Risk Populations: A Comprehensive Literature Review,2020,"Due to the lack of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies on inflammation and cardiovascular involvement, the exact mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 still remains uncertain. It was demonstrated that there is a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. Cardiac injury and inflammation is a relatively common association among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In our literature search, we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity to the virus Spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. Strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 are steadily needed. The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel SARS-CoV2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease. Emerging as an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination. Therefore, we should be ready for the reemergence of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses.","Centurión, Osmar Antonio; Scavenius, Karina E; García, Laura B; Torales, Judith M; Miño, Luís M",Crit Pathw Cardiol,,167

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between the severity of COVID-19 and oxidative stress parameters. Clinical data of 77 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital were analyzed and divided into moderate (n = 44) and severe (n = 33) groups based on their clinical condition. Production of oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and defense antioxidants (total antioxidant capacity, reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione s-transferase), and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde, carbonyl, and sulfhydryl) were assessed using the serum samples. The results revealed that severe patients who presented high serum leukocyte count and CRP level stayed for a longer period in the hospital. However, there was no correlation observed between the oxidative stress parameters and degree of COVID-19 severity in the present study. In conclusion, these results indicate that the disease severity may not be a detrimental factor contributing to the changes in the redox profile of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Gadotti, Ana C; Lipinski, Anna L; Vasconcellos, Franciane Tf; Marqueze, Luis F; Cunha, Eduardo Bb; Campos, Amanda C; Oliveira, Camila F; Amaral, Andréa Nm; Baena, Cristina P; Telles, João P; Tuon, Felipe F; Pinho, Ricardo A",Free Radic Biol Med,,167

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the level of learning engagement and its relationship with students' perceived learning satisfaction in an online clinical nursing elective course. DESIGN: A prospective interventional study. SETTINGS: A nursing course was converted to an online format because of the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Part-time post-registration nursing undergraduates enrolled in an elective online clinical course. METHODS: Related teaching and learning strategies were deployed in the course using the Community of Inquiry framework. All students who completed the course were invited to complete an online survey that included a validated Online Student Engagement questionnaire (OSE). Pearson's correlations were used to determine the association between perceived learning satisfaction and learning engagement. A logistic regression model was used to explore the associations of gender, age, working experience and perceived learning satisfaction with higher learning engagement. RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 56 of 68 students (82%). The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the mean perceived learning satisfaction and OSE scores was 0.75 (p < .001). Twenty-five students (45%) were identified as highly engaged, using a cut-off of &#8805;3.5 for the mean OSE score. The mean perceived learning satisfaction (SD) score differed significantly between highly engaged and not highly engaged students [4.02 (0.49) vs. 3.27 (0.62), p < .001]. The logistic regression model showed that a greater perceived learning satisfaction [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 17.2, 95% C.I.: 3.46-86.0, p = .001] was associated with an increased likelihood of higher learning engagement, and >1 year of working experience (adjusted OR: 0.11, 95% C.I.: 0.01-0.89, p = .0039) was associated with a decreased likelihood of higher learning engagement.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated ovarian cancer patients who underwent HIPEC following complete cytoreductive surgery performed during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in three different centers specializing in gynecological oncology. All patients who underwent cytoreduction plus HIPEC for a primary, interval, and recurrent surgery were evaluated. Primary outcomes was postoperative 30-day morbidity and mortality. The secondary outcome was infection of patient and/or related staff with COVID-19 during the perioperative or early postoperative period. RESULTS: We performed a total of 35 HIPEC procedures during the pandemic: 15 (42.9%) patients underwent primary/interval surgery, while 20 (57.1%) patients had recurrent disease. Grade 3-4 complications occurred in one patient (2.9%) (chronic renal failure), while mortality did not occur in any patient. Neither the patients nor related staff were infected with the coronavirus during the perioperative or early postoperative period. One patient, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia on postoperative day 80 died from the infection. Another patient died on postoperative day 85 due to progressive ovarian cancer, a disorder in vital functions, and organ failure. CONCLUSION: HIPEC during the COVID-19 pandemic seems a safe and feasible procedure, with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Careful selection of patients is important and precautions should be taken before the procedure.","Ayhan, Ali; Yilmaz Baran, Safak; Vatansever, Dogan; Dogan Durdag, Gulsen; Akilli, Huseyin; Celik, Husnu; Taskiran, Cagatay",Int. j. gynecol. cancer,,167

347749,Vaccines for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e. coronavirus-associated disease 2019 (COVID-2019), may occasionally lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring in the most severe cases extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Yet, limited data, if any, are currently available on the role of ECMO in critically ill patients with COVID-19. We aimed at providing a snapshot analysis of ECMO for COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: Freely available data on ECMO in COVID-19 patients reported by the European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (EuroELSO) were extracted and analyzed after conversion into long format. The primary outcome was the incidence of death during ECMO. Bootstrapping and logistic regression were used for inferential estimates. RESULTS: Details from a total of 333 patients treated in 90 institutions spanning 17 countries were obtained, with 22% women and mean age of 52 years. Death rate was 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.1% to 21.1%), even if significant between-center differences were found, with some institutions reporting 100% case fatality. Exploratory inferential analysis showed no nominally statistically significant association between death and gender (P=0.788), but a significant association was found with age, mainly due to increased case fatality in subjects >60 years (odds ratio: 4.80 [95% confidence interval 1.64 to 14.04], P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO may play an important role in critically ill patients with COVID-19 refractory to less invasive treatments. The increased risk of early death in older patients may be used to prioritize ECMO indication in resource-conscious settings, if confirmed externally.","Marullo, Antonino G; Cavarretta, Elena; Biondi Zoccai, Giuseppe; Mancone, Massimo; Peruzzi, Mariangela; Piscioneri, Fernando; Sartini, Patrizio; Versaci, Francesco; Morelli, Andrea; Miraldi, Fabio; Frati, Giacomo",Minerva Cardioangiol,,167

The problem has been solved in three stages viz. detecting, identifying, and tracking the object in a particular zone, i.e., but it is observed that something more could be done in this field, mostly the MOT-A score was not up to the mark;hence the proposed research work utilized Kalman filters for obtaining enhanced results and compared the obtained MOT-A metric with previous works, and the results were good. Object detection and recognition occur via the YOLO algorithm, which enables us to classify the objects into 80 classes. Then, Motion Prediction and feature generation occur in which an estimation model is created, and Kalman filters are used to model these states for capturing moving objects in the frame. Finally, tracking takes place with Kalman filters in the previous frame, and newly detected objects are placed in the current frame, after which an association is made for new detection. All this is done via the DeepSORT algorithm, which is essentially a Deep association metric with the SORT algorithm. Here, Kalman filters are used as they improved the accuracy of the proposed model and yielded better results. On the same lines, YOLO is used to perform object detection and recognition at the same time. It is also a detector, which by applying a single neural network, it can predict the bounding boxes and perform multi-class classification. This problem can have various applications, especially in traffic management. It can also prevent people from gathering during COVID times and raising an alert for all the authorities. Hence, this is a multidisciplinary approach wherein the work of object detection is being used in various fields like crowd assembling, Surveillance, Animal management in Zoo/Biodiversity parks as well as in the case of traffic systems as well. The real motivation behind this work was using the state-of-the-art technology to solve the modern-day problems. Manually human vigilance in large areas is a utopian task and especially when surveillance and security is big threat out there. Adding to it is the COVID Pandemic which has claimed millions of lives and yet vaccination is a still a dream yet to be realized. Hence, cluster identification problem is considered and also the ways to solve this challenge using the state-of-the-art technology. Once it has been achieved, it is initiated further to find more applications of this technology in various other domains and found out how it is applied in various use cases in case of crowd gathering at a single point and how this is a similar problem in case of animal gathering at a point and how forest rangers can solve the problem in a more efficient way. © 2021 IEEE.","Kumar, S.; Vishal, Sharma P.; Pal, N.","Proc. - Int.

351617,Barriers to telehealth: The patient perspective,2020,"The overwhelming spatio-temporal nature of the spread of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic demands urgent attention of data analysts and model developers. Modelling results obtained from analytical tool development are essential to understand the ongoing pandemic dynamics with a view to helping the public and policy makers. The pandemic has generated data on a huge number of interesting statistics such as the number of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths in many spatio-temporal resolutions for the analysts to investigate. The multivariate nature of these data sets, along with the inherent spatio-temporal dependencies, poses new challenges for modellers. This article proposes a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model as a joint bivariate model for the number of cases and deaths observed weekly for the different local authority administrative regions in England. An adaptive model is proposed for the weekly Covid-19 death rates as part of the joint bivariate model. The adaptive model is able to detect possible step changes in death rates in neighbouring areas. The joint model is also used to evaluate the effects of several socio-economic and environmental covariates on the rates of cases and deaths. Inclusion of these covariates points to the presence of a north-south divide in both the case and death rates. Nitrogen dioxide, the only air pollution measure used in the model, is seen to be significantly positively associated with the number cases, even in the presence of the spatio-temporal random effects taking care of spatio-temporal dependencies present in the data. The proposed models provide excellent fits to the observed data and are seen to perform well for predicting the location specific number of deaths a week in advance. The structure of the models is very general and the same framework can be used for modelling other areally aggregated temporal statistics of the pandemics, e.g. the rate of hospitalisation.","Sahu, Sujit K; Böhning, Dankmar",Spat Stat,,167

Using the SCT framework and assessing the pandemic as an environmental set, this study strives to fill the gaps in the underexplored impacts of the personal processes of consumer vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability on the behavioral processes of purchase satisfaction and repurchase. The research results show that consumers are self-efficacious to a degree when it comes to purchase decision making in the context of pandemics. Vulnerability and resilience directly influence the purchase satisfaction and indirectly influence the repurchase intention via satisfaction. Furthermore, purchase satisfaction positively affects the repurchase intention. In addition, research results show that consumer adaptability to online shopping moderates the relationship between consumer resilience and purchase satisfaction. These findings have practical implications in terms of marketers' communication strategy development.","Kursan Milakovic, Ivana",International journal of consumer studies,,167

We present an investigation of individual differences in facial expression of emotion using observational techniques. Given descriptions of highly psychopathic persons as successful liars and manipulators, we investigate the ability to intentionally pose emotional expressions when no emotion is elicited. A mixed sample of adult men (N = 316 community volunteers, prison inmates, and forensic-psychiatric patients) ranging along the psychopathy continuum were asked to facially express a nonfelt emotion, specifically anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise, through either written instructions or through imitation of a target's facial expression. Through structural equation modeling, we evaluate relations between this emotion expression ability and general mental ability, interpersonal abilities, and psychopathy. We find that psychopathy is moderately associated with poorer emotion expression ability, meaning highly psychopathic individuals are poorer at imitating the expressions of others and poorer at expressing all emotions. However, this deficit is largely attributable to deficits in general mental ability. These results challenge the view that highly psychopathic individuals have the cognitive skills to support a superior ability to deceive or manipulate others.

353762,Humility and Acceptance: Working Within Our Limits With Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,2021,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a life-threatening complication induced by systemic inflammatory responses to infections, including bacteria and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. There are currently no immunotherapies with proven clinical efficacy and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CRS pathogenesis is limited. Here, we found that patients diagnosed with CRS from sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or burns showed common manifestations: strikingly elevated levels of the four proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and IL-10 and the coagulation cascade activator plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Our in vitro data indicate that endothelial IL-6 trans-signaling formed an inflammation circuit for robust IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 production and promoted PAI-1 production; additionally, an IL-6 signaling blockade by the human monoclonal antibody tocilizumab blunted endothelial cell activation. Plasma from severe COVID-19 patients similarly exhibited increased IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 levels, but these levels were not as high as those in patients with CRS from other causes. In contrast, the PAI-1 levels in COVID-19 patients were as highly elevated as those in patients with bacterial sepsis or ARDS. Tocilizumab treatment decreased the PAI-1 levels and alleviated critical illness in severe COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest that distinct levels of cytokine production are associated with CRS induced by bacterial infection and COVID-19, but both CRS types are accompanied by endotheliopathy through IL-6 trans-signaling. Thus, the present study highlights the crucial role of IL-6 signaling in endothelial dysfunction during bacterial infection and COVID-19.","Kang, Sujin; Tanaka, Toshio; Inoue, Hitomi; Ono, Chikako; Hashimoto, Shoji; Kioi, Yoshiyuki; Matsumoto, Hisatake; Matsuura, Hiroshi; Matsubara, Tsunehiro; Shimizu, Kentaro; Ogura, Hiroshi; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Kishimoto, Tadamitsu",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,167

Our aim is to provide guidance for urologists to help prioritize urological cancer surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed published literature on bladder cancer, upper tract urothelial carcinoma, penile cancer, testis cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer and adrenal cancer. RESULTS: For muscle invasive bladder cancer delays should be less than roughly 10 weeks and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered. Patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer should be counseled appropriately based on risk and intravesical therapies can continue. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma should also be treated with minimal delays for high risk patients, especially with ureteral tumors. Surgery for T1 renal cancers when indicated can be delayed until adequate resources are available. Patients with T2 renal cancer should be considered for early surgery if there are unfavorable preoperative characteristics. Higher stage renal tumors should be considered for early surgery. An early multidisciplinary approach is recommended for metastatic renal cancers. High risk prostate cancer may need preferential treatment and consideration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Penile cancer can have worse sexual or oncologic outcomes with prolonged surgical delay. Likewise, adrenal cancer is aggressive and needs early surgical treatment. Testicular cancer should be treated in a timely manner with surgery or chemotherapy, as indicated. CONCLUSIONS: This review should further assist urologists in recognizing patients with potentially aggressive tumor biology that warrants early treatment.","Tachibana, Isamu; Ferguson, Ethan L; Mahenthiran, Ashorne; Natarajan, Jay P; Masterson, Timothy A; Bahler, Clinton D; Sundaram, Chandru P",J Urol,,167

Pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages are known to have an important role in regulating the healing response to biomaterials. Materials with defined structural and topographical features have recently been found to favourably modulate the innate immune response, leading to improved healing outcomes. Calcium phosphate bone grafts with submicron-sized needle-shaped surface features have been shown to trigger a pro-healing response through upregulation of M2 polarised macrophages, leading to accelerated and enhanced bone regeneration. The present review describes the recent research on these and other materials, all the way from benchtop to the clinic, including in vitro and in vivo fundamental studies, evaluation in clinically relevant spinal fusion models and clinical validation in a case series of 77 patients with posterolateral and/or interbody fusion in the lumbar and cervical spine.

However, its role in acute lung injury has not been elucidated. Acute lung injury is associated with disruption of the alveolo-capillary barrier leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, however, high positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and aggravate lung injury. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate the p53/p21 pathway to maintain homeostasis and avoid massive cell apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of specific p53- and p21-dependent gene signatures and a validated senescence profile. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed changes in the nuclear envelope and the underlying chromatin, DNA damage and activation of the Tp53/p21 pathway. Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury due to increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, treatment with lopinavir and/or ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury. The activation of these mechanisms was associated with early markers of senescence, including expression of senescence-related genes and increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells. Autopsy samples from lungs of patients with ARDS revealed increased senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Collectively, these results suggest that acute lung injury activates p53/p21 as an antiapoptotic mechanism to ameliorate damage, but with the side effect of induction of senescence.","Blázquez-Prieto, Jorge; Huidobro, Covadonga; López-Alonso, Inés; Amado-Rodriguez, Laura; Martín-Vicente, Paula; López-Martínez, Cecilia; Crespo, Irene; Pantoja, Cristina; Fernandez-Marcos, Pablo J; Serrano, Manuel; Sznajder, Jacob I; Albaiceta, Guillermo M",Transl Res,,167

Manifold researches have been published in recent times for effective monitoring and management of social distancing in public/private places. Motivated by this notion, integrating embedded hardware kit like Jetson Nano with deep learning algorithms for automating the entire process is indispensable. Further, to improve the performance of deep learning-based object identifiers, YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm utilizes a single-step locator methodology by computing pairwise distance to detect the objects. Using bounding boxes, YOLO algorithm identifies the presence of multiple objects, and thereby multiple bounding boxes are formed and update the shade of the jumping box to red.

METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for all patients who underwent surgery for midshaft clavicle nonunion at a Level I trauma center. Visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and Quick-DASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) score were assessed. Bone union rate, change in length of affected clavicle, complications, and reoperation were determined. Risk factors were identified to determine the effect on the healing. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were included for analysis. All patients achieved solid bone union at mean 16 weeks (range 8-36) after surgery. The mean shortening of affected clavicle decreased significantly postoperatively (P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in both pain VAS and Quick-DASH score (P < 0.001). There was no wound complication, infection, or major neurovascular injury. Ten patients (29%) complained of plate irritation and underwent removal of implant without any subsequent adverse event. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that high-energy trauma and previous surgery were the independent risk factors that significantly delayed time to union (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Osteosynthesis with autologous dual bone graft for nonunion of midshaft clavicle produced an excellent union rate with good clinical outcome and minimal complications.","Lim, Sungjoon; Cho, Euihwan; Chun, Jae-Myeung; Jeon, In-Ho",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,,167

However, little is known on the impact of undiagnosed diabetes in the COVID-19 population. We investigated whether diabetes, particularly undiagnosed diabetes, was associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study identified adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Diabetes was determined using patients' past history (diagnosed) or was newly defined if the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at admission was &#8805;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (undiagnosed). The in-hospital mortality rate and survival probability were compared between the non-diabetes and diabetes (overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes) groups. Risk factors of mortality were explored using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 373 patients, 233 were included in the final analysis, among whom 80 (34.3%) had diabetes: 44 (55.0%) reported a diabetes history, and 36 (45.0%) were newly defined as having undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c testing at admission. Compared with the non-diabetes group, the overall diabetes group had a significantly increased mortality rate (22.5% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). Moreover, the overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes groups displayed lower survival probability in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (all p < 0.01). Using multivariate Cox regression, diabetes, age, quick sequential organ failure assessment score, and D-dimer &#8805;1.0 µg/mL were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes among patients with COVID-19 is high in China. Diabetes, even newly defined by HbA1c testing at admission, is associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c measurement should be considered in adult Chinese inpatients with COVID-19.","Liu, Ye; Lu, Ran; Wang, Junhong; Cheng, Qin; Zhang, Ruitao; Zhang, Shuisheng; Le, Yunyi; Wang, Haining; Xiao, Wenhua; Gao, Hongwei; Zeng, Lin; Hong, Tianpei",BMC Endocr Disord,,167

Common ancillary findings included pulmonary vascular enlargement (64%), intralobular septal thickening (60%), adjacent pleural thickening (41.7%), air bronchograms (41.2%), subpleural lines, crazy paving, bronchus distortion, bronchiectasis, and interlobular septal thickening. CT in early follow-up period generally showed an increase in size, number, and density of GGOs, with progression into mixed areas of GGOs plus consolidations and crazy paving, peaking at 10-11 days, before gradually resolving or persisting as patchy fibrosis. While younger adults more commonly had GGOs, extensive/multilobar involvement with consolidations was prevalent in the older population and those with severe disease. CONCLUSION: This review describes the imaging features for diagnosis, stratification, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The most common CT manifestations are bilateral, peripheral/subpleural, posterior GGOs with or without consolidations with a lower lobe predominance. It is pertinent to be familiar with the various imaging findings to positively impact the management of these patients. KEY POINTS: â¢ Ground glass opacities (GGOs), whether isolated or coexisting with consolidations, in bilateral and subpleural distribution, are the most prevalent chest CT findings in adult COVID-19 patients. â¢ Follow-up CT shows a progression of GGOs into a mixed pattern, reaching a peak at 10-11 days, before gradually resolving or persisting as patchy fibrosis. â¢ Younger people tend to have more GGOs. Older or sicker people tend to have more extensive involvement with consolidations.","Ojha, Vineeta; Mani, Avinash; Pandey, Niraj Nirmal; Sharma, Sanjiv; Kumar, Sanjeev",Eur Radiol,,167
359095,COVID-19 and risk of inflammatory periodontal disease initiation/progression: A hypothesis for future,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Chloroquine and its analogues are currently being investigated for the treatment and post exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 due to its antiviral activity and immunomodulatory activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients were supposed to receive chloroquine (CQ) 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Due to a change in institutional protocol, initial patients received chloroquine and subsequent patients who did not receive chloroquine served as negative controls. Clinical effectiveness was determined in terms of timing of symptom resolution and conversion rate of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on day 14 and day 15 of admission. RESULTS: Twelve COVID-19 patients formed the treatment arm and 17 patients were included in the control arm. The duration of symptoms among the CQ treated group (6.3 ± 2.7 days) was significantly (p-value = 0.009) lower than that of the control group (8.9 ± 2.2 days). There was no significant difference in the rate of RT-PCR negativity in both groups. 2 patients out of 12 developed diarrhea in the CQ therapy arm. CONCLUSION: The duration of symptoms among the treated group (with chloroquine) was significantly lower than that of the control group. RT-PCR conversion was not significantly different between the 2 groups.","Niwas, Ram; S, Aneesa Shahul; Garg, M K; Nag, Vijaya Lakshmi; Bhatia, Pradeep Kumar; Dutt, Naveen; Chauhan, Nishant; Charan, Jaykaran; Asfahan, Shahir; Sharma, Praveen; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Banerjee, Mithu; Garg, Pawan; Sureka, Binit; Bohra, Gopal Krishna; Gopalakrishnan, Maya; Misra, Sanjeev",Adv Respir Med,,167
359106,Leukoencephalopathy and cerebral edema as the presenting manifestations of SLE in an ANA-negative adolescent female: a case report and review of literature,2020,"The Covid- 19 pandemic has brought immense challenges to almost every country as it spreads throughout their populations. Foremost among these challenges is the heightened awareness of inequalities in society and the immense toll that the virus has on the most vulnerable. Globally, older people are the most at risk of getting the virus and dying from the it. Yet, although age is a significant contributor, it is its interaction with other factors, chronic conditions, poverty, and race that makes it a strong determinant. These factors reflect disparities and systemic social injustices that interact to increase the vulnerability of older adults. This paper discusses the many roles that social work, with its focus on social change, injustice, and vulnerable groups can intervene at many levels of practice and with specific groups to alleviate these fundamental disparities.","Cox, Carole",J Gerontol Soc Work,,167

359914,Q&A: Ned Sharpless on COVID-19 and Cancer Prevention,2021,"Environmental degradation is a global phenomenon with a high likelihood of influencing human quality of life. Effective management responses are needed to achieve societal goals of sustainability. We develop here a new monitoring protocol (Management Check: MATCH) that comprehensively evaluates management outcomes at the operational level. Using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework, we identified pressures influencing ecosystem integrity inside conservation corridors and commercial compartments of a timber production landscape mosaic. They were 1) domestic livestock grazing (the only exogenous pressure), 2) fire management, 3) invasive alien plants (IAPs), and potential soil erosion from two sources: 4) roads, and 5) harvested timber compartments. We assessed the effects of these on wetland and stream buffers. Environmental incidents accounted for more serious management issues (e.g. oil spills). Management responses were systematically unpacked into point-form questions, which formed the building blocks of our monitoring protocol. We assessed management in twelve plantations in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Answers were compared with Best Operational Practice (BOP), and reworked into a Weighted Index of Compliance (WIC) per section. We found that there was poor management of livestock grazing, but good management of IAPs, roads, and timber compartments. Management of wetland and stream buffers was very good. Fire management presented problems linked to lack of direct effects, measurable at the spatial and temporal scales of operations. We discuss operational outcomes within their respective legislative frameworks, and suggest ways of improving management operations, where needed. MATCH is the first monitoring protocol to comprehensively assess environmental management of commercial forestry at the operational level, and to clearly translate operational activities into measurable progress towards strategic goals. In doing so, MATCH breaks down silos and builds bridges for efficient environmental management in dynamic socio-ecological systems. Moreover, the principles developed here can be applied to build tools that help manage major risks in other economic sectors too. Overall, MATCH strengthened strategic and informed action, which is necessary at multiple levels of an organization, to combat major societal risks, such as environmental degradation.","Joubert-van der Merwe, L; Samways, M J; Pryke, J S",J Environ Manage,,167

360756,Emotional Response of US Breast Cancer Survivors during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background There is a paucity of literature addressing COVID-19 case-fatality ratios (CFR) by zip code (ZC). We aim to analyze trends in COVID-19 CFR, population density, and socioeconomic status (SES) indicators (unemployment, median household income) to identify ZCs heavily burdened by COVID-19. Methods Cross-sectional study to investigate the US prevalence of COVD-19 fatalities by ZC and SES. CFRs were calculated from state/county Departments of Health. Inclusion criteria were counties that reported cases/deaths by ZC and a CFR≥2%. This study was reported in line with the STROCSS criteria. Results 609/1,853 ZCs, spanning 327 counties in 7 states had CFRs ≥2%. A significant positive correlation was found between the CFR and median household income (Pearson correlation:0.107;95% CI [289.1,1937.9];p &lt; 0.001). No significant correlations exist between the CFR, and population/mi (Sen-Crowe et al., 2020) [2] or unemployment rate. Significant associations exist between the CFR and young males and elderly females without public insurance. CFR was inversely associated with persons aged &lt;44 and individuals aged ≥65. The percentage of nursing homes (NHs) within cities residing within high CFR ZCs range from 8.7% to 67.6%. Conclusion Significant positive association was found between the CFR and median household income. Population/mi (Sen-Crowe et al., 2020) [2] and unemployment rates, did not correlate to CFR. NHs were heavily distributed in high CFR zip codes. We recommend the targeted vaccination of zip codes with a large proportion of long-term care facilities. Finally, we recommend for improved screening and safety guidelines for vulnerable populations (e.g nursing home residents) and established protocols for when there is evidence of substantial infectious spread.","Sen-Crowe, Brendon Lin I.

361383,Are the Allergic Reactions of COVID-19 Vaccines Caused by mRNA Constructs or Nanocarriers? Immunological Insights,2021,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed a grave threat to the global public health. The COVID-19-induced infection is closely related to coagulation dysfunction in the affected patients. This paper attempts to conduct a meta-analysis and systematically review the blood coagulation indicators in patients with severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed to compare the blood coagulation indicators in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies published between 1 December 2019 and 7 May 2020. A total of 13 studies with 1341 adult patients were enrolled in this analysis. Platelet (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -24.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -34.12 to -15.54; P < .001), d-dimer (WMD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29; P < .001), and fibrinogen (WMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.50-1.54; P < .001) were significantly associated with the severity in patients with COVID-19. The meta-analysis revealed that no correlation was evident between an increased severity risk of COVID-19 and activated partial thromboplastin time (WMD = -1.56, 95% CI: -5.77 to 2.64; P = .468) or prothrombin time (WMD = 0.19, 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.51; P = .243). The single arm meta-analysis showed that compared with the nonsevere group, the severe group had a lower pooled platelet (165.12 [95% CI: 157.38-172.85] vs 190.09 [95% CI: 179.45-200.74]), higher d-dimer (0.49 [95% CI: 0.33-0.64] vs 0.27 [95% CI: 0.20-0.34]), and higher fibrinogen (4.34 [95% CI: 1.98-6.70] vs 3.19 [95% CI: 1.13-5.24]). Coagulation dysfunction is closely related to the severity of patients with COVID-19, in which low platelet, high d-dimer, and fibrinogen upon admission may serve as risk indicators for increased aggression of the disease. These findings are of great clinical value for timely and effective treatment of the COVID-19 cases.","Lin, Jing; Yan, Han; Chen, Hanchuan; He, Chen; Lin, Chunjin; He, Haoming; Zhang, Sicheng; Shi, Songjing; Lin, Kaiyang",J. med. virol,,167
362306,Health Canada: AKI or ARF with remdesivir for COVID-19?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The present study investigated the impact of the COVID-19-related rehabilitation services lockdown on the mental health of caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. METHODS: Between 26 March and 11 May 2020, 84 caregivers filled out ad-hoc and standardized questionnaires through an online survey in order to measure their psychological response to the emergency and lockdown as well as their levels of parenting stress, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Worries about COVID-19 contagion and concerns for the child left without rehabilitation programs were the greatest sources of mental health burden for caregivers. Nonetheless, only the concerns for the child were significantly associated with caregivers' reports of stress, depressive and anxious symptoms. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the burden faced by caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities during the COVID-19 emergency in Italy. These families should be considered as a high-risk population that requires dedicated healthcare attention, such as promoting continuity of care by investing in tele-rehabilitation programs. Implications for rehabilitation Caregivers of children with disability reported symptoms of anxiety and depression during COVID-19 emergency. Major concerns regarded COVID-19 contagion risk and child development during rehabilitation lockdown. Caregivers' psychological symptoms were associated with concerns for child development during the lockdown. Parents of children with disability may face relevant stress during and after COVID-19 psychological burden. During COVID-19 recovery, policy-makers and clinicians should dedicate specific care actions for families of children with disability.","Grumi, Serena; Provenzi, Livio; Gardani, Alice; Aramini, Valentina; Dargenio, Erika; Naboni, Cecilia; Vacchini, Valeria; Borgatti, Renato",Disabil Rehabil,,167

Kenaf plantations were introduced in Malaysia in the last two decades, but have generally not produced much kenaf composite product that has been widely accepted by the public. However, woven kenaf fiber enhances the thermoset composites to a similar degree or better than other natural fibers, especially with respect to impact resistance. Woven kenaf composites have been applied in automotive structural studies in Malaysia, yet they are still far from commercialization. Hence, this review discusses the kenaf fiber woven in Malaysia, thermoset and bio-based thermoset polymers, thermoset composite processing methods and, most importantly, the challenges faced in Malaysia. This review sets guidelines, provides an overview, and shares knowledge as to the potential challenges currently faced by woven kenaf reinforcements in thermoset polymer composites, allowing researchers to shift their interests and plans for conducting future studies on woven kenaf thermoset polymer composites.","Ching Hao, Lee Khalina Abdan Nurazzi N.

363642,Global dynamics of a SUIR model with predicting COVID-19,2020-04-26,"Severe COVID-19 is reflected by significant changes in multiple urine peptides. Based on this observation, a clinical test based on urinary peptides predicting COVID-19 severity, CoV50, was developed and registered as IVD in Germany. We have hypothesized that molecular changes displayed by CoV50, to a large degree likely reflective of endothelial damage, can be significantly reversed by specific drugs. To test this hypothesis, we have collected urinary peptide data from patients without COVID-19 prior and after drug treatment. The drugs chosen were selected based on availability of sufficient number of participants in the dataset (n>20) and potential value of drug therapies in the treatment of COVID-19 based on reports in the literature. In these participants without COVID-19, while spironolactone did not demonstrate a significant impact on CoV50 scoring, empagliflozin treatment resulted in a significant change in CoV50 scoring, indicative of a potential therapeutic benefit. The results serve as a proof-of-principle for a drug repurposing approach based on human urinary peptide signatures and support the initiation of a randomised control trial testing a potential positive effect of empagliflozin in the treatment of severe COVID-19, possibly via endothelial protective mechanisms. Significance of the studyCOVID-19 pandemic has imposed a heavy burden on society, health care and economics. Although multiple drugs have been tested in the context of COVID-19, effective treatments for patients experiencing severe disease are still missing, with some drugs demonstrating benefit only at earlier disease stage. Computational drug repurposing emerged as a promising approach to boost drug development, allowing to predict drug efficacy based on the molecular signature of drug impact, mainly using transcriptomics data from cell lines. Recently we demonstrated that urinary proteomics profiles significantly differ between patients with severe COVID-19 course and those with mild/ moderate disease. This resulted in the development of a molecular signature associated with COVID-19 severity (CoV50), allowing to predict COVID-19 course, and enabling guiding intervention. Here we report on the first study demonstrating the application of clinical proteomics data (from clinical trial participants) in a drug repurposing approach. We used the CoV50 signature to examine if the molecular changes associated with COVID-19 severity in patients without COVID-19 might be altered by existing drugs. In a study population without COVID-19, empagliflozin demonstrated a partial, yet significant reversion of the CoV50 signature, indicating a potential benefit in the context of severe COVID-19.","Latosinska, Agnieszka; Siwy, Justyna; Cherney, David Z.; Perkins, Bruce A.; Mischak, Harald; Beige, Joachim",,,167

How can those who were thrust out of manufacturing, services, hospitality, and retail move across those sectors or into other sectors where opportunities exist or will emerge? There has perhaps never been a clearer need for employers, government, and workers to identify needed and desired skills and competencies.

366993,"Indian Academy of Pediatrics National Conference (CIAP-PEDICON), 5th February, 2021, Mumbai",2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and placed tremendous financial pressure on nearly all aspects of the U.S. health care system. Diabetes care is an example of the confluence of the pandemic and heightened importance of technology in changing care delivery. It has been estimated the added total direct U.S. medical cost burden due to COVID-19 to range between $160B (20% of the population infected) and $650B (80% of the population infected) over the course of the pandemic. The corresponding range for the population with diabetes is between $16B and $65B, representing between 5% and 20% of overall diabetes expenditure in the United States. We examine the evidence to support allocating part of this added spend to infrastructure capabilities to accelerate remote monitoring and management of diabetes. Methods and Results: We reviewed recent topical literature and COVID-19-related analyses in the public health, health technology, and health economics fields in addition to databases and surveys from government sources and the private sector. We summarized findings on use cases for real-time continuous glucose monitoring in the community, for telehealth, and in the hospital setting to highlight the successes and challenges of accelerating the adoption of a digital technology out of necessity during the pandemic and beyond. Conclusions: One critical and lasting consequence of the pandemic will be the accelerated adoption of digital technology in health care delivery. We conclude by discussing ways in which the changes wrought by COVID-19 from a health care, policy, and economics perspective can add value and are likely to endure postpandemic.","Garg, Sandip; Norman, Gregory J",Diabetes Technol Ther,,167
367133,Is carbonic anhydrase inhibition useful as a complementary therapy of Covid-19 infection?,2021,"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on prehospital stroke care is largely unknown. We aimed to compare stroke care patterns before and during a state-wide lockdown. Thus, we analysed prospective data of stroke alerts referred to our stroke centre between 1 December 2019 and 16 June 2020, and compared them between two periods-15 weeks before and 13 weeks during the state-wide lockdown declared in Lithuania on 16 March 2020. Among 719 referrals for suspected stroke, there was a decrease in stroke alerts (rate ratio 0.61, 95% CI (0.52-0.71)), stroke admissions (0.63, 95% CI (0.52-0.76)), and decrease in prehospital stroke triage quality (positive predictive value 72.1% vs. 79.9%, p = 0.042) during the lockdown. The onset-to-door time was longer (153.0 vs. 120.5 min, p = 0.049) and seizures and intracranial tumours were more common among stroke mimics (16.9% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.012 and 9.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.037, respectively). We conclude that there was a decline in prehospital stroke triage quality during the lockdown despite low COVID-19 incidence in the country. Moreover, we observed an increase in hospital arrival delays and severe conditions presenting as stroke mimics. Our findings suggest that improved strategies are required to maintain optimal neurological care during public health emergencies.","Melaika, Kazimieras; Sveikata, Lukas; Wisniewski, Adam; Jaxybayeva, Altynshash; Ekkert, Aleksandra; Jatuzis, Dalius; Masiliunas, Rytis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,167

368052,The need for standards for COVID-19 quantitative imaging analysis applications,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to a general uncertainty about risk and consequences of the disease. Older adults are specifically vulnerable with regard to severe courses of the disease and have been particularly encouraged to self-isolate during the pandemic. Subsequently, expressions of concern have been raised regarding the negative impact of disease risk and quarantine on the mental health of older people. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of psychosocial stress, coping strategies, need for support, and sense of coherence of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study follows a qualitative research design. Between May and June 2020 Nâ¯= 11 guided telephone interviews were conducted with older adults (70+ years). Telephone interviews were recorded by audio tape and fully transcribed. A qualitative content analysis was performed according to Mayring and Fenzl (2019) using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Participants were 74.8 years old on average. Participants showed predominantly good psychosocial health and functional coping strategies. Life experience, an optimistic attitude, understanding of the necessity of restrictions, and previous crises that have been mastered were the most important resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. Offers of support were rarely used. Participants were critical of the closing of centers or meeting points for older people. CONCLUSION: Older adults appear to be able to preserve their mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relevance of mental resources of older adults for supporting younger generations seems to be unrecognized.","Welzel, Franziska D; Schladitz, Katja; Förster, Franziska; Löbner, Margrit; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,167
368113,Real-World Evidence in Prescription Medication Use Among U.S. Adults with Neck Pain,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of accurate capture of vaccine, and vaccine component, allergy. There remains a gap in the prevalence literature from the perspective of direct primary care provider (PCP) reporting at a population level. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine and polyethylene glycol (PEG) allergy using Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the CPCSSN repository. Machine learning algorithms were applied to assess for vaccine allergy documentation, and ATC codes used for PEG allergy or allergy to common injectable medications containing PEG (CIMCP). RESULTS: The prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine allergy in Canada was 0.037%, (395/1,055,677) and of PEG allergy was 0.0009% (10/1,055,677). In total, 0.01% of patients had a documented allergy to either PEG or CIMCP (135/1,055,677). None of the patients with PEG allergy had a documented allergy to a CIMCP. Patients with vaccine allergy and PEG allergy were significantly more likely to have other atopic comorbidities including asthma (P<.0001 for both), eczema (P<.0001 and P=.001 respectively), rhinitis (P=.002 and P<.0001 respectively) and food allergy (P<.0001 for both). Significantly higher rates of depression (P=.0005 and P<.0001 respectively) and anxiety (P=.003 and P<.0001) were seen in those with vaccine allergy, or PEG allergy, compared to those without. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of vaccine and PEG allergy in a national cohort that utilizes PCP documentation, demonstrating a low reported rate of vaccine allergy and PEG allergy.","Abrams, Elissa M; Greenhawt, Matthew; Shaker, Marcus; Kosowan, Leanne; Singer, Alexander G",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,,167

Early identification of concurrent complications can significantly alter patient management and course. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can be particularly useful in helping to differentiate concomitant complications with COVID-19. While lung POCUS findings related to COVID-19 have been published, little guidance exists on how ultrasound can be incorporated into a more comprehensive evaluation of patients under investigation for COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: We devised a pathway called COVUS that incorporates POCUS into the initial evaluation of patients under investigation for COVID-19 to guide diagnosis and management. DISCUSSION: The pathway was derived based on a review of literature, consensus from the ultrasound faculty, as well as feedback from the entire faculty group at one academic institution with high volumes of patients with COVID-19. The scanning protocol uses a cardiac-first (rather than lung-first) approach to identify potential concomitant organ failure that may immediately alter management. CONCLUSIONS: COVUS aims to maximize identification of the most immediately life-threatening complications while minimizing time at bedside and provider risk of exposure to COVID-19.","Coneybeare, Di; Das, Devjani; Lema, Penelope; Chang, Bernard; Ng, Lorraine",J. emerg. med,,167

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients aged 21-50 years who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a multicenter urban health system from March 10 to 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation at real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction screening were identified. The initial chest radiographs, clinical variables, and outcomes, including admission, intubation, and survival, were collected within 30 days (n = 338;median age, 39 years;210 men). Two fellowship-trained cardiothoracic radiologists examined chest radiographs for opacities and assigned a clinically validated severity score. A deep learning algorithm was trained to predict outcomes on a holdout test set composed of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who presented between March 27 and 29, 2020 (n = 161;median age, 60 years;98 men) for both younger (age range, 21-50 years;n = 51) and older (age &gt;50 years, n = 110) populations. Bootstrapping was used to compute CIs. Results: The model trained on the chest radiograph severity score produced the following areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs): 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88) for the chest radiograph severity score, 0.76 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.84) for admission, 0.66 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.75) for intubation, and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.69) for death. The model trained on clinical variables produced an AUC of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.73) for intubation and an AUC of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.68) for death. Combining chest radiography and clinical variables increased the AUC of intubation and death to 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.96) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91), respectively.

370585,"Oxidative Stress, Proton Fluxes, and Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Treatment for COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: A growing number of adolescents are coming out as transgender and gender expansive (TGE). These teenagers have been shown to have significantly worse health outcomes than their cisgender peers. Hypotheses to explain this discrepancy are based on increased stress levels surrounding the societal acceptance of gender identity. In this context, elevated allostatic load (AL), which describes the wear and tear sustained by the body in response to repeated exposure to stress, has been associated with adverse long-term health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to measure AL among TGE adolescents compared with their cisgender peers and assess how AL varies depending on psychological stress and perceived societal acceptance. METHODS: This is an observational proof-of-concept pilot study in which AL will be measured by assaying an array of inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in urine, saliva, and hair samples of TGE youth, and these parameters will be compared with those of age-matched control participants. A questionnaire will assess 4 aspects of psychosocial well-being: presence and management of depression and anxiety, gender identity support by family members, gender minority stress, and degree of perceived safety in the surrounding community. Samples and surveys will be collected at 3 visits (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months). This study will incorporate TGE coinvestigators to inform all aspects of design, data collection, and analysis and ensure that practices are carried out in a respectful and sensitive manner. RESULTS: As of May 2021, the start of data collection for this project has continued to be postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has both impacted the functioning of the clinic and funding requests. We hope to begin participant recruitment and interviews with coinvestigators soon. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that AL will be primarily influenced by psychological well-being and perceived support and that it will be similar in TGE adolescents and in age-matched cisgender control participants when acceptance and perceived support are high. The results of this study have the potential to increase our understanding of the health challenges faced by TGE individuals during adolescence as well as to show that low levels of acceptance may have detrimental health outcomes secondary to elevated ALs; this may lead to the development of a biomarker profile to assess allostatic stress in TGE patients that can be used to guide management.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Korean healthcare system. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu Metropolitan City, Korea, were examined. All sequentially hospitalized patients between February 15, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on the positive results on the polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and death, were evaluated. Moreover, data on baseline comorbidities such as a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic cardiac diseases were obtained. RESULTS: Of all the patients enrolled, 954 (42.0%) had preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, the most common were hypertension (28.8%) and diabetes mellitus (17.0%). The prevalence rates of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs increased with age (P < 0.001). The number of patients requiring intensive care (P < 0.001) and invasive MV (P < 0.001) increased with age. The in-hospital death rate increased with age (P < 0.001). Patients requiring intensive care (5.3% vs. 1.6%; P < 0.001) and invasive MV (4.3% vs. 1.7%; P < 0.001) were significantly greater in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. In-hospital mortality (12.9% vs. 3.1%; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased requirement of intensive care and invasive MV and in-hospital death. Among the known CVDs, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure were associated with invasive MV and in-hospital death. In multivariate analysis, preexisting CVRFs or CVDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-3.01; P = 0.027) were independent predictors of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding variables. Among individual preexisting CVRF or CVD components, diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.51-3.90; P < 0.001) and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.06-5.87; P = 0.049) were independent predictors of in-hospital death.

371275,Initial whole-genome sequencing and analysis of the host genetic contribution to COVID-19 severity and susceptibility,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with pleural infections frequently have several comorbidities and inferior long-term survival. We hypothesized that these patients represent a vulnerable cohort with high rates of hospitalization and frequent use of healthcare services. This study aims to ascertain the need for and causes of treatment episodes after pleural infections during long-term follow-up. METHODS: Patients treated for pleural infections at Tampere University Hospital between January 2000 and December 2008 (n = 191, 81% males, median age 58 years) were included and compared to a demographically matched population-based random sample of 1910 controls. Seventy percent of the pleural infections were caused by pneumonias and 80% of the patients underwent surgery. Information regarding later in-hospital periods and emergency room and out-patient clinic visits, as well as survival data, was obtained from national registries and compared between patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients treated for pleural infections had significantly higher rates of hospitalizations (8.19 vs 2.19), in-hospital days (88.5 vs 26.6), emergency room admissions (3.18 vs 1.45), out-patient clinic visits (41.1 vs 11.8) and procedures performed (1.26 vs 0.55) per 100 patient-months when compared to controls during 5-year follow-up, in addition to having increased mortality (30% vs 11%), P-value <0.00001 each. Particularly, episodes due to respiratory and digestive diseases, malignancies and mental disorders were more frequent. The patients' comorbidities, such as alcoholism or chronic pulmonary disease, were associated with more frequent use of healthcare services.

By using peptide-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tetramers for direct ex vivo analysis, we characterized CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in COVID-19 patients and unexposed individuals. Unlike CD8+ T cells directed toward subdominant epitopes (B7/N257, A2/S269, and A24/S1,208) CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant B7/N105 epitope were detected at high frequencies in pre-pandemic samples and at increased frequencies during acute COVID-19 and convalescence. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells in pre-pandemic samples from children, adults, and elderly individuals predominantly displayed a naive phenotype, indicating a lack of previous cross-reactive exposures. T cell receptor (TCR) analyses revealed diverse TCR&#945;ß repertoires and promiscuous &#945;ß-TCR pairing within B7/N105+CD8+ T cells.

372125,The course of COVID-19 in four patients with HIV during the pandemic,2020,"In recent years, academics and policymakers have increasingly recognized that the full societal value of vaccination encompasses broad health, economic, and social benefits beyond avoided morbidity and mortality due to infection by the targeted pathogen and limited health care costs. Nevertheless, standard economic evaluations of vaccines continue to focus on a relatively narrow set of health-centric benefits, with consequences for vaccination policies and public investments.The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates in stark terms the multiplicity and magnitude of harms that infectious diseases may inflict on society. COVID-19 has overtaxed health systems, disrupted routine immunization programs, forced school and workplace closures, impeded the operation of international supply chains, suppressed aggregate demand, and exacerbated existing social inequities.The obvious nature of the pandemic's broad effects could conceivably convince more policymakers to identify and account for the full societal impacts of infectious disease when evaluating the potential benefits of vaccination. Such a shift could make a big difference in how we allocate societal resources in the service of population health and in how much we stand to gain from that spending.","Bloom, David E; Cadarette, Daniel; Ferranna, Maddalena",Am J Public Health,,167

This gap will increase with the current pandemic due to COVID-19. AIM: To evaluate the current availability of digital health tools for the care of people with epilepsy according to the world medical literature and their use during said pandemic. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the publications in scientific journals in the last decade that had as their main topic the use of digital health tools or telemedicine focused on the care of patients with epilepsy, including 4 months after the national quarantines due to the appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen publications were found on the use of telemedicine focused on epilepsy. The most widely used tools internationally are online platforms, followed by mobile applications, videoconferences, epileptic seizure capture systems, checklists, algorithms for understanding medical data, phone calls, tele-encephalography and text messages. None was published during the COVID-19 current pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is little literature on the use of digital health tools focused on epilepsy, there are several that can be used to fight the attention gap, especially in this global pandemic by COVID-19 that forces quarantines of people and communities for long periods. It is necessary to remove barriers and facilitate patient access to these new information technologies.","Santos-Peyret, A; Durón, R M; Sebastián-Díaz, M A; Crail-Meléndez, D; Goméz-Ventura, S; Briceño-González, E; Rito, Y; Martínez-Juárez, I E",Rev Neurol,,167
373760,Interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and serum amyloid A (SAA) are excellent biomarkers for the prediction of COVID-19 progression and severity,2021,"The widespread outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has posed an enormous threat to global public health. A different set of policy interventions has been implemented to mitigate the spread in most countries. While the use of personal protective equipment and social distancing has been specifically emphasized, South Korea has deployed massive testing and contact-tracing program from the early stage of the outbreak. This study aims at investigating the effectiveness of testing and contact-tracing to counter the spread of infectious diseases. Based on the SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-confirmed-recovered) model, an agent-based simulation model is developed to represent the behavior of disease spreading with the consideration of testing and contact-tracing in place. Designed experiments are conducted to verify the effects of testing and contact tracing on the peak number of infections. It has been observed that testing combined with contact tracing may lower the peak infections to a great extent, and it can thus be avoided for the hospital bed capacity to be overwhelmed by infected patients. It is implied that an adequate capability of testing and contact-tracing may enable us to become better prepared for an impending risk of infectious diseases.","Kim, Young Jin Koo Pyung-Hoi",Healthcare,,167
374073,Increasing accessibility in COVID-19 clinical trials,2020,"There is a lack of real practice studies comparing ustekinumab and ixekizumab effectiveness and safety. The main aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of both drugs used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients over 52 weeks. The secondary objective was to identify which clinical variables could have an impact on its effectiveness. A retrospective observational study was carried out, comparing the first 28 patients treated with ustekinumab after its commercialization was compared to the first 35 patients treated with ixekizumab. Although a higher level of skin clearance was achieved with ixekizumab with a PASI 90 and 100 response of 54.3% and 40% compared to 42.9% and 25% for ustekinumab, these differences were not statistically significant. Ixekizumab achieved a higher PASI 90 response in those patients with BMI > 27 (slightly overweight), which was statistically significant (P = .024). Ustekinumab had a greater survival at 52 weeks than ixekizumab, with a trend towards statistical significance (P = .052). Ixekizumab achieved higher skin clearance rates (PASI 90 and 100 response) than ustekinumab, with no statistically significant differences. However, ixekizumab should be specially considered in overweight patients.","Herrera-Acosta, Enrique; Garriga-Martina, Gustavo Guillermo; Suárez-Pérez, Jorge Alonso; Martínez-García, Eliseo; Herrera-Ceballos, Enrique",Dermatol Ther,,167

374542,Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents and COVID-19: A word of caution,2020,"The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had rapidly spread and became a worldwide pandemic since its detection in Wuhan, China. The disease has caused significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among patients with comorbidities. The current treatment involves supportive management alongside antiviral therapy and immunosuppressant therapy in severely affected patients. We describe a case of a patient with underlying lupus nephritis (LN) who presented with severe COVID-19 infection and concomitant LN flare with acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient was treated with antiviral therapy, Favipiravir, considering his risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. As the patients would usually have AKI alongside LN flare, we administered initial steroid therapy at a lower dose (Methylprednisolone 50mg daily) and oral hydroxychloroquine despite the initial concerns on immunosuppressant usage in COVID-19 infections. Although our patient recovered relatively well from COVID- 19 infection, he continued to have positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 up to 29 days of illness. His kidney function stabilised despite having persistent nephrotic range proteinuria. Hence, the attending team decided to pulse the patient with a high dose steroid (IV Methylprednisolone 250mg OD for three days) after two weeks of illness despite the persistent positive swab. The patient's condition continued to improve, and this case illustrates an approach in treating COVID-19 with concomitant active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. We find that it is safe to institute high dose immunosuppressant in recovered COVID-19 patients two weeks after the illness.","Yusuf, A. S.; Cheong, X.

PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline databases were searched upto 19 April 2020. All records were screened as per the protocol eligibility criteria. We included five studies reporting CPT to COVID-19 patients. The main findings from available data are as follows: (a) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients, (b) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy, and (c) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma. Based on the limited scientific data, CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients appears safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality. Well-designed large multicenter clinical trial studies should be conducted urgently to establish the efficacy of CPT to COVID-19 patients.","Rajendran, Karthick; Krishnasamy, Narayanasamy; Rangarajan, Jayanthi; Rathinam, Jeyalalitha; Natarajan, Murugan; Ramachandran, Arunkumar",J. med. virol,,167
375608,Adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination in young Japanese people: A case-control study of the risk of systemic adverse events by a questionnaire surveyShort title: COVID-19 vaccine adverse events in young Japanese,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and hand hygiene have been the primary means of reducing transmission in the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, but understanding of their determinants is limited. This study aimed to investigate knowledge and socio-cognitive perceptions, and their associations with such protective behaviours, in UK university students. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 293 students was undertaken on 13 May 2020. Survey questions addressed demographics, knowledge of the disease and effectiveness of the protective measures, risk perception, socio-cognitive perceptions (e.g. attitude, social support, and self-efficacy), habit, time factors and trust, as well as the hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the strongest associations of potential determinants with behaviour. RESULTS: Participants reported high levels of social distancing with 88.9% answering ""Mostly"" or ""Always"" for every activity, but only 42.0% reporting the same for all hand hygiene activities. Knowledge of the effectiveness of each activity in preventing transmission was high, with 90.7% and 93.5% respectively identifying at least 7 of 8 hand hygiene or 9 of 10 social distancing activities correctly. Habit (ß = 0.39, p = 0.001) and time factors (ß = 0.28, p = 0.001) were the greatest contributors to unique variance in hand hygiene behaviour, followed by ethnicity (ß = - 0.13, p = 0.014) and risk perception (ß = 0.13, p = 0.016). For social distancing behaviour, the determinants were self-efficacy (ß = 0.25, p < 0.001), perceived advantages (ß = 0.15, p = 0.022), trust in policy (ß = 0.14, p = 0.026) and gender (ß = - 0.14, p = 0.016). Regression models explained 40% hand hygiene and 25% social distancing variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that communications about effectiveness of hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours had been effective in terms of knowledge acquisition. However, in the light of likely second waves of COVID-19, attention to maintaining social distancing behaviour and improving hand hygiene behaviour may need to address more difficult areas of changing habits, overcoming time factors and building trust, as well as interventions to increase self-efficacy and address risk perception concerns.","Barrett, Christine; Cheung, Kei Long",BMC Public Health,,167
375671,Does COVID 19 generate a milieu for propagation of mucormycosis?,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection has altered the society, economy, and entire healthcare system. Whilst this pandemic has presented the healthcare system with unprecedented challenges, it has rapidly promoted the adoption of telemedicine to deliver healthcare at a distance. Telemedicine is the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for collecting, organizing, storing, retrieving, and exchanging medical information. But it is faced with the limitations of conventional IP-based protocols which makes it challenging to provide Quality of Service (QoS) for telemedicine due to issues arising from network congestion. Likewise, medical professionals adopting telemedicine are affected with low QoS during health consultations with outpatients due to increased internet usage. Therefore, this study proposes a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based telemedicine architecture to provide QoS during telemedicine health consultations. This study utilizes secondary data from existing research works in the literature to provide a roadmap for the application of SDN to improve QoS in telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study present a practical approach for applying SDN in telemedicine to provide appropriate bandwidth and facilitate real time transmission of medical data.","Jnr, Bokolo Anthony; Nweke, Livinus Obiora; Al-Sharafi, Mohammed A",Health Technol (Berl),,167

377680,COVID-19—therapeutic options using chinese herbal medicine in the acute phase and convalescence,2020,"AIM: To examine how circulating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations during liraglutide treatment relate to its therapeutic actions on glucose and weight, and to study the effects of liraglutide on other proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs), including endogenous GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-2, glucagon, oxyntomodulin, glicentin and major proglucagon fragment, which also regulate metabolic and weight control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults who were overweight/obese (body mass index 27-40 kg/m2 ) with prediabetes were randomized to liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) versus placebo for 14 weeks. We used specific assays to measure exogenous (liraglutide, GLP-1 agonist [GLP-1A]) and endogenous (GLP-1E) GLP-1, alongside five other PGDP concentrations during a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) completed at baseline and at week 14 (liraglutide, n = 16; placebo, n = 19). Glucose during MMTT, steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration for insulin resistance and insulin secretion rate (ISR) were previously measured. MMTT area-under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated for ISR, glucose and levels of PGDPs. RESULTS: Participants on liraglutide versus placebo had significantly (P &#8804; .004) decreased weight (mean -3.6%, 95% CI [-5.2% to -2.1%]), SSPG (-32% [-43% to -22%]) and glucose AUC (-7.0% [-11.5% to -2.5%]) and increased ISR AUC (30% [16% to 44%]). GLP-1A AUC at study end was significantly (P &#8804; .04) linearly associated with % decrease in weight (r = -0.54) and SSPG (r = -0.59) and increase in ISR AUC (r = 0.51) in the liraglutide group. Treatment with liraglutide significantly (P &#8804; .005) increased exogenous GLP-1A AUC (median 310 vs. 262 pg/mL × 8 hours at baseline but decreased endogenous GLP-1E AUC [13.1 vs. 24.2 pmol/L × 8 hours at baseline]), as well as the five other PGDPs. Decreases in the PGDPs processed in the intestines are independent of weight loss, indicating a probable direct effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists to decrease their endogenous production in contrast to weight loss-dependent changes in glucagon and major proglucagon fragment that are processed in pancreatic alpha cells. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating GLP-1A concentrations, reflecting liraglutide levels, predict improvement in weight, insulin action and secretion in a linear manner. Importantly, liraglutide also downregulates other PGDPs, normalization of the levels of which may provide additional metabolic and weight loss benefits in the future.","Kim, Sun H; Abbasi, Fahim; Nachmanoff, Clara; Stefanakis, Konstantinos; Kumar, Ajay; Kalra, Bhanu; Savjani, Gopal; Mantzoros, Christos S",Diabetes obes. metab,,167

Continuous transmission of the virus is mostly due to insufficient infection control measures and a lack of vaccines. Therefore, this review aimed to identify and describe possible vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed through electronic searches of the main databases to identify published reports or studies on vaccines under development against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Websites from international organizations, institutes of health and research, Google, and references from identified studies were also reviewed. Studies examining the mechanisms of infection, immunopathology, and genomics were excluded. Results: A total of 141 vaccines in development against SARS-CoV-2 were identified. The technologies used include weakened and inactive viruses, viral vectors, nucleic acids, and proteins. So far, 13 vaccines (9.2%) are under clinical evaluation; only the AZD1222 vaccine is under clinical evaluation Phase II-III. Ad5-nCoV and mRNA-1273 vaccines showed to produce neutralizing antibodies and also to be safe. Conclusions: Despite efforts invested in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, more research is still required. The vaccine developers, international health organizations, and the decision-makers of health policies must carry out conjunct cooperation to face the different challenges and guarantee the development of an effective vaccine.","Barajas-Nava, Leticia A",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,167

380055,Phytotherapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19: A concise viewpoint,2021,"Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in classification and regression tasks on chest X-rays. In order to establish trust in the clinical routine, the networks' prediction mechanism needs to be interpretable. One principal approach to interpretation is feature attribution. Feature attribution methods identify the importance of input features for the output prediction. Building on Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) method, for each prediction we identify the chest X-ray regions that have high mutual information with the network's output. Original IBA identifies input regions that have sufficient predictive information. We propose Inverse IBA to identify all informative regions. Thus all predictive cues for pathologies are highlighted on the X-rays, a desirable property for chest X-ray diagnosis. Moreover, we propose Regression IBA for explaining regression models. Using Regression IBA we observe that a model trained on cumulative severity score labels implicitly learns the severity of different X-ray regions. Finally, we propose Multi-layer IBA to generate higher resolution and more detailed attribution/saliency maps. We evaluate our methods using both human-centric (ground-truth-based) interpretability metrics, and human-independent feature importance metrics on NIH Chest X-ray8 and BrixIA datasets. The Code is publicly available.","Khakzar, Ashkan; Zhang, Yang; Mansour, Wejdene; Cai, Yuezhi; Li, Yawei; Zhang, Yucheng; Kim, Seong Tae; Navab, Nassir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00411v2.pdf,167
380210,"Does serotonin deficiency lead to anosmia, ageusia, dysfunctional chemesthesis and increased severity of illness in COVID-19?",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in hospitalized adults with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective, single-center, phase 2, randomized, controlled trial that is blinded to participants and clinical outcome assessor. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants include adults (&#8805; 18 years) with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab within 14 days of randomization, evidence of infiltrates on chest radiography, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) &#8804; 94% on room air, and/or need for supplemental oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation, who are willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to performing study procedures or who have a legally authorized representative available to do so. Exclusion criteria include participation in another clinical trial of anti-viral agent(s)* for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), receipt of any anti-viral agent(s)* with possible activity against SARS-CoV-2 <24 hours prior to plasma infusion, mechanical ventilation (including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) for &#8805; 5 days, severe multi-organ failure, history of allergic reactions to transfused blood products per NHSN/CDC criteria, known IgA deficiency, and pregnancy. Included participants will be hospitalized at the time of randomization and plasma infusion. *Use of remdesivir as treatment for COVID-19 is permitted. The study will be undertaken at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, USA. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The investigational treatment is anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma. To procure the investigational treatment, volunteers who recovered from COVID-19 will undergo testing to confirm the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to the spike trimer at a 1:400 dilution. Donors will also be screened for transfusion-transmitted infections (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, WNV, HTLV-I/II, T. cruzi, ZIKV). If donors have experienced COVID-19 symptoms within 28 days, they will be screened with a nasopharyngeal swab to confirm they are SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative. Plasma will be collected using standard apheresis technology by the New York Blood Center. Study participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive one unit (200 - 250 mL) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma versus one unit (200 - 250 mL) of the earliest available control plasma. The control plasma cannot be tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prior to the transfusion, but will be tested for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibody after the transfusion to allow for a retrospective per-protocol analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement. This is defined as time from randomization to either discharge from the hospital or improvement by one point on the following seven-point ordinal scale, whichever occurs first. 1. Not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities 2. Not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities 3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen 4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen 5. Hospitalized, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation 6. Hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both 7. Death This scale, designed to assess clinical status over time, was based on that recommended by the World Health Organization for use in determining efficacy end-points in clinical trials in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A recent clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of lopinavir- ritonavir for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 used a similar ordinal scale, as have recent clinical trials of novel therapeutics for severe influenza, including a post-hoc analysis of a trial evaluating immune plasma. The primary safety endpoints are cumulative incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events during the study period. RANDOMIZATION: Study participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma versus control plasma using a web-based randomization platform. Treatment assignments will be generated using randomly permuted blocks of different sizes to minimize imbalance while also minimizing predictability. BLINDING (MASKING): The study participants and the clinicians who will evaluate post-treatment outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. The blood bank and the clinical research team will not be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): We plan to enroll 129 participants, with 86 in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 arm, and 43 in the control arm. Among the participants, we expect ~70% or n = 72 will achieve clinical improvement. This will yield an 80% power for a one-sided Wald test at 0.15 level of significance under the proportional hazards model with a hazard ratio of 1.5.

381109,"Post-COVID syndrome: Incidence, clinical spectrum, and challenges for primary healthcare professionals",2021,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that partly evade neutralizing antibodies has raised concerns of reduced vaccine effectiveness and increased infection. We previously demonstrated in preclinical models and in human clinical trials that our SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03) elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses in naive subjects. Here, the objective was to document the potency of various booster vaccine formulations in macaques previously vaccinated with mRNA or protein subunit vaccine candidates. We show that one booster dose of AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM, D614 (parental) or B.1.351 (Beta), in monovalent or bivalent (D614 + B.1.351) formulations, significantly boosted pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and elicited high and stable cross-neutralizing antibodies covering the four known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and, unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-1, in primed macaques. Interestingly, the non-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 vaccine formulation also significantly boosted and broadened the neutralizing antibody responses. Our findings show that these vaccine candidates used as a booster have the potential to offer cross-protection against a broad spectrum of variants. This has important implications for vaccine control of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and informs on the benefit of a booster with our vaccine candidates currently under evaluation in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials (NCT04762680 and NCT04904549).","Kishko, Michael; Anosova, Natalie G; Huang, Dean; Tibbitts, Tim; Gutzeit, Cindy; Koutsoukos, Marguerite; Chicz, Roman M",,,167

Observed daily concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and O3 during a ""pre-lockdown"" period (15 February-14 March 2020) and a ""lockdown"" period (22 March-2 May 2020), when lockdown measures were in full force everywhere in Canada, were compared to the same periods in the previous decade (2010-2019). Higher-than-usual seasonal declines in mean daily NO2 were observed for the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020. For PM2.5, Montreal was the only city with a higher-than-usual seasonal decline, whereas for O3 all four cities remained within the previous decadal range. In order to isolate the impact of lockdown-related emission changes from other factors such as seasonal changes in meteorology and emissions and meteorological variability, two emission scenarios were performed with the GEM-MACH air quality model. The first was a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with baseline emissions and the second was a more realistic simulation with estimated COVID-19 lockdown emissions. NO2 surface concentrations for the COVID-19 emission scenario decreased by 31 to 34% on average relative to the BAU scenario in the four metropolitan areas. Lower decreases ranging from 6 to 17% were predicted for PM2.5. O3 surface concentrations, on the other hand, showed increases up to a maximum of 21% close to city centers versus slight decreases over the suburbs, but Ox (odd oxygen), like NO2 and PM2.5, decreased as expected over these cities.

Within months scientists all over the world have developed promising new vaccines, many of which use adenoviral vectors to incorporate immunogenic molecules of SARS-coronavirus in order to elicit effective immune responses. The Gamaleya institute developed the COVID-19 vaccine named Sputnik (Gam-COVID-Vac) using adenoviral vectors ad 26 and ad5 to incorporate a full SARS-Spike Protein for vaccination. Two differing vectors enable so called prime-boost, thus avoiding neutralizing effects against the vector itself, ensuring proper immunogenicity against the vaccine. Current available published evidence has raised controversy among small sample sizes in phase II and early endpoints in phase III studies with Sputnik and scientific community took notice that full study protocols and clinical data haven't been made available yet. Patient subgroups and vaccination efficacy in healthy vaccinated may be at risk in case of partial viral replication of Ad5 vectors or when batch to batch reproducibility is not warranted, as concerns from authorities in Brazil and Slovakia have recently been raised.

Methods: We studied 144 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center in intensive or subintensive care units. Those with previous thyroid dysfunctions or taking interfering drugs were excluded. Differently from previous reports, TSH, FT3, FT4, thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg autoantibodies (TgAb) were measured at baseline and every 3-7 days. C-reacting protein (CRP), cortisol and IL-6 were also assayed. Results: The majority of patients had a normal TSH at admission, usually with normal FT4 and FT3. Low TSH levels were found either at admission or during hospitalization in 39% of patients, associated with low FT3 in half of the cases. FT4 and Tg levels were normal, and TgAb-negative. TSH and FT3 were invariably restored at the time of discharge in survivors, whereas were permanently low in most deceased cases, but only FT3 levels were predictors of mortality. Cortisol, CRP and IL-6 levels were higher in patients with low TSH and FT3 levels. Conclusions: Almost half of our COVID-19 patients without interfering drugs had normal TFTs both at admission and during follow-up. In this series, the transient finding of low TSH with normal FT4 and low FT3 levels, inversely correlated with CRP, cortisol and IL-6 and associated with normal Tg levels, is likely due to the cytokine storm induced by SARS-Cov-2 with a direct or mediated impact on TSH secretion and deiodinase activity, and likely not to a destructive thyroiditis.","Campi, Irene; Bulgarelli, Ilaria; Dubini, Antonella; Perego, Giovanni Battista; Tortorici, Elena; Torlasco, Camilla; Torresani, Erminio; Rocco, Lorenzo; Persani, Luca; Fugazzola, Laura",Eur J Endocrinol,,167

Methods: In this prospective hospital-based registry of patients with COVID-19 in East Azerbaijan, Iran, 368 consecutive diabetic patients with COVID-19 were followed from admission until discharge or death. Self-reported weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) upon admission. Our primary endpoint was analyzing obesity and COVID-19 mortality association. Assessing the associations among obesity and disease severity, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation was our secondary endpoint. Results: We analyzed data from 317 patients and found no significant difference between obese and non-obese patients regarding frequency of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, CURB-65, or qSOFA scores (P&gt;0.05).

In addition to these local aspects, these cytokines have systemic effects from their action on the liver, muscle, adipose tissue and the cardiovascular system. All these diseases have in common an increase in cardiovascular risk. In the general population, the same concepts are applicable, as shown by the link between an even modest rise in CRP and cardiovascular risk. More recently, the cytokine storm of severe forms of COVID-19 has shown that synergistic interactions between cytokines first described in vitro are further amplified in the clinical picture with multiple and severe impairment of key organs.

This study reveals the effect of atorvastatin, amlodipine and ethoxidol on the endogenous CoQ10 plasma concentration. Methods It was determined the total plasma concentration of endogenous CoQ10 in the plasma of 54 healthy individuals and 62 patients with cardiovascular diseases during treatment with various drugs using high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS). Results It was found that CoQ10 plasma concentration in patients is statistically significantly lower (on average -49.0 &#916;%) than in practically healthy individuals. The total CoQ10 plasma level in patients receiving atorvastatin in the complex therapy is statistically significantly lower (-15.2 &#916;%), and in patients taking amlodipine or ethoxidol is statistically significantly higher (+18.2 and + 20.2 &#916;%, respectively) than in patients of control groups (a group of patients who receive the same drugs, except for the studied one). Conclusions The study showed that in patients with CVDs treated with various drugs the CoQ10 plasma level is statistically significantly lower than in practically healthy individuals. So, to avoid the adverse reactions connected with low CoQ10 plasma levels, it is recommended to adjust the therapy to maintain its constant level.","Shikh, Evgenia; Zozina, Vladlena; Kondratenko, Svetlana; Melnikov, Evgeny; Kukes, Vladimir",Drug Metab.

Well-structured open data and the smart systems that make the appropriate use of it are invaluable and can help health researchers and professionals to find the appropriate information by, e.g., configuring the monitoring of information or refining a specific query on a disease. METHODS: We present an automated text classifier approach based on the MEDLINE/MeSH thesaurus, trained on the manual annotation of more than 26 million expert-annotated scientific abstracts. The classifier was developed tailor-fit to the public health and health research domain experts, in the light of their specific challenges and needs. We have applied the proposed methodology on three specific health domains: the Coronavirus, Mental Health and Diabetes, considering the pertinence of the first, and the known relations with the other two health topics. RESULTS: A classifier is trained on the MEDLINE dataset that can automatically annotate text, such as scientific articles, news articles or medical reports with relevant concepts from the MeSH thesaurus. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed text classifier shows promising results in the evaluation of health-related news. The application of the developed classifier enables the exploration of news and extraction of health-related insights, based on the MeSH thesaurus, through a similar workflow as in the usage of PubMed, with which most health researchers are familiar.","Pita Costa, Joao; Rei, Luis; Stopar, Luka; Fuart, Flavio; Grobelnik, Marko; Mladenic, Dunja; Novalija, Inna; Staines, Anthony; Pääkkönen, Jarmo; Konttila, Jenni; Bidaurrazaga, Joseba; Belar, Oihana; Henderson, Christine; Epelde, Gorka; Gabaráin, Mónica Arrúe; Carlin, Paul; Wallace, Jonathan",Artif Intell Med,,167

METHODS: To retrieve the vitamin D levels data, the authors analyzed the vitamin D European population data compiled by 2019 European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) statement on vitamin D status published in the European Journal of Endocrinology. For the data set to be used for analysis, only recently published data that included general adult population of both genders aged 40-65 years or wider and must have included the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. RESULTS: There were data sets from 10 countries that fitted the criteria and were analyzed. Severe vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 25â¯nmol/L (10â¯ng/dL). Pearson correlation analysis between death rate per million of population from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency showed a strong correlation with râ¯= 0.79, pâ¯= 0.007. Over time, correlation strengthened, and r coefficient asymptotically increased. After adjusting for countries' age structure and per capita health expenditures, multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased mortality. Each 1% increase in prevalence increased deaths by 55 per million (95% confidence interval, CI 8-102), pâ¯= 0.03. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend universal screening for vitamin D deficiency, and further investigation of Vitamin D supplementation in randomized control studies, which may lead to possible treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","Pugach, Isaac Z; Pugach, Sofya",Wien Klin Wochenschr,,167

The immunopathological mechanisms that cause excessive inflammation are under investigation and constantly updated. Here, a gene network approach was used on recently published data sets to identify possible COVID-19 inflammatory mechanisms and bioactive genes. First, network analysis of putative SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptors led to the mining of a neutrophil-response signature and relevant inflammatory genes. Second, analysis of RNA-seq data sets of lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 revealed that infected cells expressed neutrophil-attracting chemokines. Third, analysis of RNA-seq data sets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients identified upregulation of neutrophil genes and chemokines. Different inflammatory genes mined here, including TNFR, IL-8, CXCR1, CXCR2, ADAM10, GPR84, MME, ANPEP, and LAP3, might be druggable targets in efforts to limit SARS-CoV-2 inflammation in severe clinical cases.

388354,Sewing Masks - Resilience in the Face of Covid,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate CT images of 100 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients to describe the lesion distribution, CT signs, and evolution during different courses. METHODS: A retrospective study of 100 COVID-19 pneumonia patients without ARDS was performed, and CT scans were reviewed. A COVID-19 pneumonia course diagram was drawn. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the lesion distribution and CT scores, &#967;2 test was used to compare the CT findings between different stages. RESULTS: A total of 272 CT scans from 100 patients (mean age, 52.3 years ± 13.1) were investigated. Four patients with lung abnormalities on CT first showed negative RT-PCR result and turned positive afterwards. One hundred sixty-nine (62.1%) showed predominantly peripheral distribution. The CT scores of the upper zone (3.4 ± 3.6) were significantly lower than those of the middle (5.0 ± 3.9) and lower (4.8 ± 3.6) zones (p < 0.001). The CT scores of the anterior zones (4.9 ± 4.7) were significantly lower than those of the posterior zones (8.4 ± 6.2) (p < 0.001). In the early rapid progressive stage (1~7 days), ground glass opacity (GGO) plus reticular pattern (58.1%), GGO plus consolidation (43.0%), and GGO (41.9%) were all common. In the advanced stage (8~14 days), GGO plus consolidation (79.8%) and repairing CT signs (subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips) showed a significant increase (p < 0.05). In the absorption stage, GGO plus consolidation (9.1%) sharply decreased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CT imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia showed a predominantly peripheral, middle and lower, and posterior distribution. The early rapid progressive stage is 1~7 days from symptom onset, the advanced stage with peak levels of abnormalities on CT is 8~14 days, and the abnormalities started to improve after 14 days. KEY POINTS: â¢ The course of COVID-19 pneumonia consists of three stages: 1~7 days is the early rapid progressive stage, 8~14 days is the advanced stage, and after 14 days, the abnormalities started to decrease. â¢ In the early rapid progressive stage, GGO plus a reticular pattern, GGO plus consolidation, and GGO were all common signs; in the advanced stage, signs of progression and absorption coexisted; lung abnormalities showed an asynchronous process with parts with absorption and parts progressing. â¢ Lung abnormalities mainly showed predominantly peripheral, middle, and lower distribution.","Zhou, Shuchang; Zhu, Tingting; Wang, Yujing; Xia, LiMing",Eur Radiol,,167

There is some previous evidence that weather may influence the incidence of COVID-19 infection. We assessed the role of meteorological factors including temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) considering the concentrations of two air pollutants, inhalable coarse particles (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the incidence of COVID-19 infections in Finland, located in arctic-subarctic climatic zone. Methods: We retrieved daily counts of COVID-19 in Finland from Jan 1 to May 31, 2020, nationwide and separately for all 21 hospital districts across the country. The meteorological and air quality data were from the monitoring stations nearest to the central district hospital. A quasi-Poisson generalized additional model (GAM) was fitted to estimate the associations between district-specific meteorological factors and the daily counts of COVID-19 during the study period. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The incidence rate of COVID-19 gradually increased until a peak around April 6 and then decreased. There were no associations between daily temperature and incidence rate of COVID-19. Daily average RH was negatively associated with daily incidence rate of COVID-19 in two hospital districts located inland. No such association was found nationwide. Conclusions: Weather conditions, such as air temperature and relative humidity, were not related to the COVID-19 incidence during the first wave in the arctic and subarctic winter and spring. The inference is based on a relatively small number of cases and a restricted time period.","Heibati, Behzad; Wang, Wenge; Ryti, Niilo R I; Dominici, Francesca; Ducatman, Alan; Zhang, Zhijie; Jaakkola, Jouni J K",Front Public Health,,167

This study examines the impact that public health measures to control viral spread have had on orthopaedic trauma presenting to an Australian level 1 trauma centre. We hypothesized that the volume of orthopaedic trauma in the period of social distancing would decrease, and the mechanisms of injury differ, compared to pre-pandemic times. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients requiring emergency orthopaedic surgery between 16 March and 21 April 2020 (the period after social distancing and lockdown commenced), and compared it to the group of patients from the same period in 2019. We collected demographic data, as well as injury type, anatomical location, mechanism of injury and surgical logistics. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, total emergency operations performed decreased by 15.6% compared to the same period in 2019. Orthopaedic admissions decreased by 30.8%. Demographics of the groups were unchanged. Anaesthetic time decreased, but total time spent in the operating theatre was unchanged. Road trauma comprised a similar proportion of cases overall; however, cycling-related accidents increased significantly, making up 11% of presentations during COVID-19. Sporting injuries, work-related injuries and multi-traumas reduced during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19-related lockdown measures and social distancing on orthopaedic trauma in Australia has been an overall decrease in volume of cases, combined with significant changes in the mechanisms of injury necessitating surgery.","Probert, Annabel C; Sivakumar, Brahman S; An, Vincent; Nicholls, Sarah L; Shatrov, Jobe G; Symes, Michael J; Ellis, Andrew M",ANZ j.

390355,Audio Interview: Making Decisions about Covid-19 Testing and Treatment for Your Patients,2020,"Wildfire management in the US relies on a complex nationwide network of shared resources that are allocated based on regional need. While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for COVID-19 transmission between fire sites. We develop an agent-based model of COVID-19 built on historical wildland fire assignments using detailed dispatch data from 2016-2018, which form a network of firefighters dispersed spatially and temporally across the US. We use this model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under several intervention scenarios including vaccination and social distancing. We find vaccination and social distancing are effective at reducing transmission at fire incidents. Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed. The current set of interventions in place successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fires, and off-assignment infection may be the dominant infection concern in the 2021 season. COVID-19 control measures in place in wildfire management are highly beneficial at decreasing both the health and resource impacts of the ongoing pandemic.","Belval, Erin J; Bayham, Jude; Thompson, Matthew P; Dilliott, Jacob; Buchwald, Andrea G",,,167

Markets like the Yellowknife Farmers Market (YKFM) are social spaces that support local food, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes to their current model. We explore the potential of online marketplaces to contribute to a resilient, sustainable food system through a case study of the YKFM. METHODS: In 2019, a collaborative mixed-method evaluation was initiated by the YKFM and university partners in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. The evaluation included an in-person Rapid Market Assessment dot survey and questionnaire of market patrons from two YKFM dates prior to the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, a vendor survey and interviews were deferred. Data collected from the two patron surveys, alongside researcher observations, available literature, public announcements, and informal email and phone discussions, inform the discussion. RESULTS: For the patron surveys, 59 dot survey and 31 questionnaire participants were recruited. The top motivators for attendance were eating dinner, atmosphere, and supporting local businesses, and most patrons attended as couples and spent over half of their time talking to others. The YKFM did not move online; instead, they proposed and implemented a ""Shop, don't stop"" market. Informal conversations suggested the small scale of the market and technology challenges were perceived barriers to moving online. The physically-distanced market was well-attended and featured in local media. CONCLUSIONS: NWT food strategies rely on farmers markets to nurture a local food system. Data suggest a potential incongruence between an online model and important market characteristics such as the event-like atmosphere. Available literature suggests online markets can support local food by facilitating purchasing and knowledge-sharing, yet they do not replicate the open-air or social experience. The decision not to move online for the YKFM reflects market patron characteristics and current food context in Yellowknife and the NWT. While online adaptation does not fit into the YKFM plan today, online markets may prove useful as a complementary strategy for future emerging stressors to enhance the resiliency of local systems.","Radcliffe, Josalyn; Skinner, Kelly; Spring, Andrew; Picard, Lise; Benoit, France; Dodd, Warren",Nutr J,,167

To develop vaccines against TW-like IBV strains and investigate the critical genes associated with their virulence, GD strain was attenuated by 140 serial passages in specific-pathogen-free embryonated eggs and the safety and efficacy of the attenuated GD strain (aGD) were examined. The genome sequences of GD and aGD were also compared and the effects of mutations in the S gene were observed. The results revealed that aGD strain showed no obvious pathogenicity with superior protective efficacy against TW-like and QX-like virulent IBV strains. The genomes of strains aGD and GD shared high similarity (99.87 %) and most of the mutations occurred in S gene. Recombinant IBV strain rGDaGD-S, in which the S gene was replaced with the corresponding regions from aGD, showed decreased pathogenicity compared with its parental strain. In conclusion, attenuated TW-like IBV strain aGD is a potential vaccine candidate and the S gene is responsible for its attenuation.

PURPOSE: A case of uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management in a pediatric patient with a ventricular assist device awaiting a heart transplant is reported. SUMMARY: A 4-month-old male in heart failure was experiencing uncontrolled hypertension. Because of a lack of hemodynamic stability, he was unable to be listed as a heart transplant candidate. He received multiple antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, ß-blockers, and direct-acting vasodilators) as both intermittent and continuous infusions over the course of several days without achieving normotension. The decision was then made to administer intravenous phentolamine as a continuous infusion to pursue a different mechanism than with traditional antihypertensive agents to achieve hemodynamic stability. Within 8 hours of initiation of the continuous phentolamine infusion, the patient became normotensive and was listed for a heart transplant. The continuous phentolamine infusion was administered over the next 4 days to maintain normotension, and on day 4 the patient underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: A 4-month-old male in heart failure with a ventricular assist device, experiencing uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management, was successfully treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine.","Hatt, Andrew",Am. j. health system pharm,,167

We studied the effect of the pandemic on inpatients with diabetic foot problems in a level-one trauma center in Central Ohio. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients necessitating a consultation by the foot and ankle surgery service were reviewed from the first 8 months of 2020. A total of 270 patients met the inclusion criteria and divided into pre-pandemic (n = 120) and pandemic groups (n = 150). Demographics, medical history, severity of current infection, and medical or surgical management were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The odds of undergoing any level of amputation was 10.8 times higher during the pandemic versus before the pandemic. The risk of major amputations (below-the-knee or higher) likewise increased with an odds ratio of 12.5 among all patients in the foot and ankle service during the pandemic. Of the patients undergoing any amputation, the odds for receiving a major amputation was 3.1 times higher than before the pandemic. Additionally, the severity of infections increased during the pandemic and a larger proportion of the cases were classified as emergent in the pandemic group compared to the pre-pandemic group. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the pandemic on the health-care system has had a deleterious effect on people with diabetes-related foot problems resulting in more severe infections, more emergencies, and necessitating more amputations. When an amputation was performed, the likelihood it was a major amputation also increased.Editor's Note: This Original Article accompanies ""Diabetes-Related Amputations: A Pandemic within a Pandemic,"" by Lee C.

It is based mainly on the principle that people will consume fewer services, with regards to transportation, rent, et al. Instead, they will replace for more consumption the services at home, such as online courses, delivery services, etc. Modern retail chains, with proper management, are distinguished by fairly good reliability due to the digital logistics approach being considered in the article.Тhe sharing economy, based on the Collaborative Economy about distributing, sharing and reusing excess capacities in goods and services, now is changed by platforms that connect people who need a service with people who can provide it. The article will contribute to identifying the situation of a business regarding the field of the Sharing Economy, and the dissemination of information about what opportunities and threats currently exist in it. The conclusion we have reached is that they need to be monitored for unexpected situations where, in certain contexts, market conditions are polarized on a large scale. The processes of digitalization of society are beginning to accelerate the new habits of consumption and ways how the market develops new paths of sales and distribution bringing this new era to make use of technology with a collateral effect in the labor market where more employees will be released during the pandemic, and they will not return to their old employment. Employees will be surprised because they will be replaced by technology that will take their jobs in the prerogative of the global economy and individual countries, which increases the significance of the discussion of the problems considered below. © 2021","Barykin, S.

394127,"Retraction notice to ""Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis"" [Medical Hypotheses 146 (2021) 5]",2021,"Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has previously shown mortality benefit in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a randomized controlled trial. As the illness is considered to reflect a hyperinflammatory state, this therapeutic effectiveness is presumably ascribed to broad anti-inflammatory activities of glucocorticoids. Here, an unbiased analysis of available transcriptomic data on lung and blood immune cells from severe COVID-19 patients and matching cellular models of dexamethasone treatment is presented that supports this presumption. Comparison of differentially expressed genes in severe COVID-19 with that in dexamethasone treated cells reveals a small set of genes that are regulated in opposite direction between the disease and the drug, and are enriched for genes and processes related to glucocorticoid pathway and receptor binding. This expression signature differentiates as a whole various cytokines from a set of anti-cytokine/anti-inflammatory agents, with the former resembling COVID-19 and the latter dexamethasone in gene regulation. The signature apparently relates to TNF- &#945;, IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, IFN-&#945;, IFN-ß, and IFN-Î³ signaling, but not IL-6 signaling, suggesting that therapeutic effect of dexamethasone in COVID-19 does not involve IL-6 pathway. However, as all these observations are purely based on bioinformatic analysis, experimental evidence will be required to validate the inferences drawn. In conclusion, the present analysis seems to provide a proof of concept for therapeutic mechanisms of dexamethasone in COVID-19.","Sharma, Abhay",Gene,,167

In this article we discuss how we planned and organized this conference, and provide a summary of our experience of the conference itself. We also describe in greater detail the motivations behind its organization, and explore the good and bad dimensions of this relatively new kind of conferencing. As the climate crisis becomes more acute and, in turn, the pressure to reduce the carbon footprint of academic activities increases, we argue that digital conferences of this style will necessarily become more central to how academia operates. By sharing our own experiences of running such a conference, we seek to contribute to a rapidly growing body of knowledge on the subject that might be drawn on to improve our practices going forward.

This study aims to quantitate circulating levels of IgA/IgG and IgG subtypes induced at different days postonset of symptoms, in severe and nonsevere patients. For this, serum or plasma samples (n = 146) collected from 79 COVID-19 patients were used. Indirect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific IgA, IgG, and IgG subtype specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed. Antibody titers between severe and nonsevere patients were compared at different times postonset of clinical symptoms. Titers in ELISA were compared to neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Over 75% patients were positive for IgA/IgG antibodies in the first week. The ELISA titers did not differ during the first week; however, severe disease exhibited raised titers thereafter. Nab titers correlated with the ELISA titers in mild presentation but not in severe disease. IgA and IgG1 antibodies correlated stronger with Nabs. The findings highlighted that IgA together with IgG play an important in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. These results will prove useful in assessing efficacy of vaccines and understanding disease pathogenesis.","Patil, Harshad P; Rane, Prajakta S; Shrivastava, Shubham; Palkar, Sonali; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh C; Arankalle, Vidya A",Viral Immunol,,167

Surgical specialties have seen severe alterations or reductions to practice, with neurosurgery being one example in which staff and resource reallocation has occurred to meet wider public health needs. This review summarizes the published evidence detailing early experiences and changes to neurosurgical practice in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted up until April 21, 2020 in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, by searching Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science Core Collection databases. Individual studies were qualitatively assessed to outline core themes detailing changes to practice. Iterative analysis allowed themes to be developed and applied to all studies included in the review. RESULTS: In total, 13 themes from 18 studies were identified, grouped into 3 overriding themes: logistics, human resources, and clinical delivery. Studies originated from 3 of the most affected countries (United States, China, and Italy), comprising expert opinions, letters to the editor, editorials, case reports, or perspective pieces. The commonest themes discussed include cancellation of elective operations, reduction in outpatient services, and pandemic rotas. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the early responses of the neurosurgical community to the COVID-19 pandemic and presents a menu of interventions to be considered in future pandemic response, or in recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19. Whilst our review is limited by the low quality of evidence and rapid rate of change in our understanding of COVID-19, it provides a valuable summary of initial responses by the neurosurgical community to a global pandemic.","Hanrahan, John Gerrard; Burford, Charlotte; Adegboyega, Gideon; Nicolaides, Marios; Boyce, Louis; Wong, Kendra; Sideris, Michail",World Neurosurg,,167

Published investigations mostly on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS has taught lessons on vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on the host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus.

OBJECTIVE: The present narrative review aims to compile and synthesize the literature related to social isolation produced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. METHOD: This study is a narrative review of the literature on social isolation in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic. RESULTS: 73 publications were included for full-text reading and were classified into the following categories: levels of social isolation, economic effects, family relationships, health system, mental health of the population, and use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to plan an escalation of responses to the consequences of the pandemic, especially in view of the increased demand on the health sector and social services. The negative effects of social isolation can be prevented by public policies that offer a response to the economic recession, maintenance of social work, encouragement of quality care in mental health services, and community support for vulnerable families.","Both, Luciane Maria; Zoratto, Gustavo; Calegaro, Vitor Crestani; Ramos-Lima, Luis Francisco; Negretto, Bianca Lorenzi; Hauck, Simone; Freitas, Lucia Helena Machado",Trends psychiatry psychother.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the composition of inpatient imaging volumes for modality types and Current Procedural Terminology-coded groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective study of inpatient imaging volumes in a large health care system was performed, analyzing weekly imaging volumes by modality types (radiography, CT, MRI, ultrasound, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine) in years 2020 and 2019. The data set was split to compare pre-COVID-19 (weeks 1-9) and post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) periods. Further subanalyses compared early post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-13) and late post-COVID-19 (weeks 14-16) periods. Statistical comparisons were performed using &#967;2 and independent-samples t tests. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total inpatient imaging volume in 2020 post-COVID-19, early and late post-COVID-19 periods, declined by 13.6% (from 78,902 to 68,168), 16.6% (from 45,221 to 37,732), and 9.6% (from 33,681 to 30,436), respectively. By week 16, inpatient imaging volume rebounded and was only down 4.2% (from 11,003 to 10,546). However, a statistically significant shift (P < .0001) in the 2020 composition mix was observed largely comprised of radiography (74.3%), followed by CT (12.7%), ultrasound (8%), MRI (2.4%), interventional radiology (2.3%), and nuclear medicine (0.4%). Although the vast majority of imaging studies declined, few Current Procedural Terminology-coded groups showed increased trends in imaging volumes in the late post-COVID-19 period, including CT angiography chest, radiography chest, and ultrasound venous duplex. DISCUSSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decrease in inpatient imaging volumes accompanied by a shift away from cross-sectional imaging toward radiography. These findings could have significant implications in planning for a potential resurgence.","Naidich, Jason J; Boltyenkov, Artem; Wang, Jason J; Chusid, Jesse; Hughes, Danny; Sanelli, Pina C",J Am Coll Radiol,,167

This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. METHODS: Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. RESULTS: In total, 845 participants completed the questionnaires correctly (95.80% response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were respectively 33.73% (95% CI: 30.53-36.92%) and 29.35% (95% CI: 26.27-32.43%) when a cut-off score of 5 was used for GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants' self-reported safety scores for HCW's protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to examine and attend to the mental health of this population during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ying, Yuchen; Ruan, Liemin; Kong, Fanqian; Zhu, Binbin; Ji, Yunxin; Lou, Zhongze",BMC Psychiatry,,167

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, and generally lacked quantitative measurements. Here, we report the development, implementation, and initial results of a multilingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in 3 distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, and 8 others, aged 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste, and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change ±100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 ± 28.7, mean ± standard deviation), taste (-69.0 ± 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 ± 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and the lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","Parma, Valentina; Ohla, Kathrin; Veldhuizen, Maria G; Niv, Masha Y; Kelly, Christine E; Bakke, Alyssa J; Cooper, Keiland W; Bouysset, Cédric; Pirastu, Nicola; Dibattista, Michele; Kaur, Rishemjit; Liuzza, Marco Tullio; Pepino, Marta Y; Schöpf, Veronika; Pereda-Loth, Veronica; Olsson, Shannon B; Gerkin, Richard C; Rohlfs Domínguez, Paloma; Albayay, Javier; Farruggia, Michael C; Bhutani, Surabhi; Fjaeldstad, Alexander W; Kumar, Ritesh; Menini, Anna; Bensafi, Moustafa; Sandell, Mari; Konstantinidis, Iordanis; Di Pizio, Antonella; Genovese, Federica; Öztürk, Lina; Thomas-Danguin, Thierry; Frasnelli, Johannes; Boesveldt, Sanne; Saatci, Özlem; Saraiva, Luis R; Lin, Cailu; Golebiowski, Jérôme; Hwang, Liang-Dar; Ozdener, Mehmet Hakan; Guàrdia, Maria Dolors; Laudamiel, Christophe; Ritchie, Marina; Havlícek, Jan; Pierron, Denis; Roura, Eugeni; Navarro, Marta; Nolden, Alissa A; Lim, Juyun; Whitcroft, Katherine L; Colquitt, Lauren R",Chem Senses,,167
401631,Old drugs for a new indication: a review of chloroquine and analogue in COVID-19 treatment,2021,"Black carbon (BC) aerosols perturb climate and impoverish air quality/human health-affecting ~1.5 billion people in South Asia. However, a lack of source-diagnostic observations of BC is hindering evaluation of uncertain bottom-up emission inventories (EIs), and thereby also models/policies. Here, we present dual-isotope-based (&#916;14C/Î´13C) fingerprinting of wintertime BC at two receptor sites of the continental outflow. Our results show a remarkable similarity in contributions of biomass and fossil combustion, both from the site capturing the highly-populated highly-polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain footprint (IGP; &#916;14C-fbiomass=50±3%) and the second site in the N. Indian Ocean representing a wider South Asian footprint (52±6%). Yet, both sites reflect distinct Î´13C-fingerprints, indicating a distinguishable contribution of C4-biomass burning from peninsular India (PI). Tailored-model-predicted season-averaged BC concentrations (700±440 ng m-3) match observations (740±250 ng m-3), however, unveiling a systematically increasing model-observation bias (+19% to -53%) through winter. Inclusion of BC from open burning alone does not reconcile predictions (fbiomass=44±8%) with observations. Direct source-segregated comparison reveals regional offsets in anthropogenic emission fluxes in EIs, overestimated fossil-BC in the IGP and underestimated biomass-BC in PI, which contributes to the model-observation bias. This ground-truthing pinpoints uncertainties in BC emission sources, which benefit both climate/air-quality modeling and mitigation policies in South Asia.","Dasari, Sanjeev; Andersson, August; Stohl, Andreas; Evangeliou, Nikolaos; Bikkina, Srinivas; Holmstrand, Henry; Budhavant, Krishnakant; Salam, Abdus; Gustafsson, Örjan",Environ. sci. technol,,167

We evaluated the impact of these measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across US counties between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020. An event study design allowed each policy's impact on COVID-19 case growth to evolve over time. Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases by 5.4 percentage points after one to five days, 6.8 percentage points after six to ten days, 8.2 percentage points after eleven to fifteen days, and 9.1 percentage points after sixteen to twenty days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply that there would have been ten times greater spread of COVID-19 by April 27 without shelter-in-place orders (ten million cases) and more than thirty-five times greater spread without any of the four measures (thirty-five million cases). Our article illustrates the potential danger of exponential spread in the absence of interventions, providing information relevant to strategies for restarting economic activity.","Courtemanche, Charles; Garuccio, Joseph; Le, Anh; Pinkston, Joshua; Yelowitz, Aaron",Health Aff (Millwood),,167

402565,"A confirmed case of COVID-19 among the first three from Kerala, India",2020,"In recent years, significant attention has been directed toward the fifth generation of wireless broadband connectivity known as '5G', currently being deployed by Mobile Network Operators. Surprisingly, there has been considerably less attention paid to 'Wi-Fi 6', the new IEEE 802.11ax standard in the family of Wireless Local Area Network technologies with features targeting private, edge-networks. This paper revisits the suitability of cellular and Wi-Fi in delivering high-speed wire-less Internet connectivity. Both technologies aspire to deliver significantly enhanced performance, enabling each to deliver much faster wireless broadband connectivity, and provide further support for the Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine communications, positioning the two technologies as technical substitutes in many usage scenarios. We conclude that both are likely to play important roles in the future, and simultaneously serve as competitors and complements. We anticipate that 5G will remain the preferred technology for wide-area coverage, while Wi-Fi 6 will remain the preferred technology for indoor use, thanks to its much lower deployment costs. However, the trend towards providing seamless wireless broadband connectivity, as well as smaller-cell network architectures with increasingly flexible and spectrum-agile technologies, is blurring the traditional boundaries that differentiated earlier generations of cellular and Wi-Fi.","Oughton, Edward J; Lehr, William; Katsaros, Konstantinos; Selinis, Ioannis; Bubley, Dean; Kusuma, Julius",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11601v2.pdf,167

The comprehensive timeline of actions taken by governments and public transport providers in Austria and Norway, and their impact on public transport ridership in the first and second waves of the pandemic form the basis of a descriptive study. Comparing the data, a strong negative impact on the public transport patronage in the first wave of the pandemic was found, despite a comparable low number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, a smaller impact of the second wave of the pandemic on the ridership was registered. The study provides valuable first insights on how the pandemic affected different settlement types. It also documents, in detail, the measures taken by two distinct European countries to curb the pandemic infection rates and how these actions impacted public transport patronage. The results pointed in the direction of a need for further analysis of aspects such as “fresh fear” and “lingering fear” in relation to the effect of a pandemic on public transport. Data availability limitations show the necessity of upgrading and aligning ridership and ticketing monitoring systems across Europe, to allow for better understanding of pandemic impacts on public transport in a more unified manner.","Rasca, Sinziana Markvica Karin Peter Ivanschitz Bernd",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,,167

406190,Cortical excitability threshold can be increased by the AMPA blocker Perampanel in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,2021,"Cadmium (Cd) presents severe risks to human health and environments. The present study proposed a green option to reduce bioavailable Cd. Rice pot experiments were conducted under continuous flooding with three treatments (T1: intercropping azolla with rice; T2: incorporating azolla into soil before rice transplantation; CK: no azolla). The results showed that azolla incorporation reduced soluble Cd by 37% compared with the CK treatment, which may be explained by the decreased soil redox potential (Eh) (r = 0.867, P < 0.01). The higher relative abundance of Methylobacter observed in azolla incorporation treatment may account for dissolved organic carbon increase (r = 0.694; P < 0.05), and hence decreased the Cd availability for rice. Azolla incorporation increased the abundance of Nitrospira, indicating the potentially prominent role of nitrogen mineralization in increasing rice yields. Further, lower soluble Cd decreased the expression of OsNramp5, but increased OsHMA3 levels in rice roots, which decreased Cd accumulation in grains. Through these effects, azolla incorporation decreased Cd concentrations in rice grains by 80.3% and increased the production by 13.4%. The negligible amount of Cd absorbed by azolla would not increase the risk of long-term application. Thus, intercropping azolla with early rice and incorporating azolla into soil before late rice transplantation can contribute to safe production at large scales of double rice cultivation.","Liu, Chen; Guo, Bin; Li, Hua; Fu, Qinglin; Li, Ningyu; Lin, Yicheng; Xu, Guozhong",Sci Rep,,167

407354,Imaging of the temporomandibular joint,2020,"Background: One of the fundamental pillars of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control and vaccine development is understanding mid-and long-term immunity. Early humoral response has been extensively studied, however data on what recovered individuals are still scarce and the most recent studies are based on few time points over time, which limits the comprehension of the longitudinal pattern of the potential changes. In this study we have evaluated the neutralizing activity and IgG antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 in mild/ asymptomatic and hospitalized COVID-19 individuals, over a 6-month period. Methods: We have evaluated the kinetics of the humoral immune response in 210 individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 covering the first and second waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Catalonia (Spain). IgG antibody titer was evaluated with an in-house sandwich ELISA against the S2 subunit, the binding domain receptor (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP) and the neutralizing activity was evaluated by a neutralization assay with HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects non-linear and linear models. Results: Most study participants developed a neutralizing humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, however the maximum neutralization titer was 10-fold lower in mild/asymptomatic individuals compared to those with a more severe illness. We observed a slow and progressive decay of neutralizing activity in individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease throughout the 6-month period. In hospitalized individuals, half maximal neutralization activity was achieved on day 10 and showed an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed and remained nearly flat after day 80. Despite this, activity at six months remained higher in hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic participants. On the other hand, we observed that IgG antibody titers against S2, RBD and NP had a more marked fall without showing differences in the decay pattern between individuals with different degree of severity of the disease. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the neutralizing activity remains relatively stable for more than 6 months despite the decline in IgG antibodies, suggesting that the quality of immune response evolves and allows maintaining the neutralizing activity despite the decay in antibody titers. Our results provide a more detailed picture of the behavior of the natural humoral immune response over time that complements the current evidence on mid-term immunity.","Pradenas, E.; Trinité, B.; Urrea, V.; Marfil, S.; Ávila-Nieto, C.; De La Concepción, M.

Thus, it is essential to improve our understanding of COVID-19 transmission, and develop more focused and effective strategies. As human mobility drives transmission, data from cellphone devices can be utilized to achieve these goals. METHODS: We analyzed aggregated and anonymized mobility data from the cell phone devices of> 3 million users between February 1, 2020, to May 16, 2020 - in which several movement restrictions were applied and lifted in Israel. We integrated these mobility patterns into age-, risk- and region-structured transmission model. Calibrated to coronavirus incidence in 250 regions covering Israel, we evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness in decreasing morbidity and mortality of applying localized and temporal lockdowns (stay-at-home order). RESULTS: Poorer regions exhibited lower and slower compliance with the restrictions. Our transmission model further indicated that individuals from impoverished areas were associated with high transmission rates. Considering a horizon of 1-3 years, we found that to reduce COVID-19 mortality, school closure has an adverse effect, while interventions focusing on the elderly are the most efficient. We also found that applying localized and temporal lockdowns during regional outbreaks reduces the overall mortality and morbidity compared to nationwide lockdowns. These trends were consistent across vast ranges of epidemiological parameters, and potential seasonal forcing. CONCLUSIONS: More resources should be devoted to helping impoverished regions. Utilizing cellphone data despite being anonymized and aggregated can help policymakers worldwide identify hotspots and apply designated strategies against future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Yechezkel, Matan; Weiss, Amit; Rejwan, Idan; Shahmoon, Edan; Ben-Gal, Shachaf; Yamin, Dan",BMC Public Health,,167

The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical service delivery and well-being of these healthcare professionals in Australia. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of Australian radiographers and radiation therapists was conducted in June-July 2020. The survey collected data on demographic characteristics, and the impact of COVID-19 on professional practice, infection control and workplace-related stress. RESULTS: A total of 218 responses were received. Changes in work hours (P < 0.001) and workload (P = 0.022) were experienced due to COVID-19. Diagnostic radiographers reported increased procedural pressure on mobile radiography, computed tomography and general radiography. For radiation therapists, most pressure included areas of simulation and linear accelerator. PPE was in short supply at the start of the pandemic, and at the time of the study, shortages were identified for all PPE items. There was no difference in PPE supply reported by diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists except for hand sanitiser (P = 0.003). Respondents experienced increased personal stress (61.4%) and anxiety (58.2%) at work due to COVID-19. In addition, their work caused increased stress to their family, partners or friends (57.4%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in changes to clinical working patterns and service delivery. PPE shortages, as well as increased workplace-related stress, were identified. Workplaces should seek to mitigate the pandemic impact through the provision of adequate PPE for safe practice as well as implement strategies to support and enhance staff well-being.","Shanahan, Madeleine C; Akudjedu, Theophilus N",J.

410328,Comparison of clinical data and computed tomography semiotics of the lungs in COVID-19,2020,"Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has been announced as a pandemic and is spreading rapidly throughout the world. Early detection of COVID-19 may protect many infected people. Unfortunately, COVID-19 can be mistakenly diagnosed as pneumonia or lung cancer, which with fast spread in the chest cells, can lead to patient death. The most commonly used diagnosis methods for these three diseases are chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. In this paper, a multi-classification deep learning model for diagnosing COVID-19, pneumonia, and lung cancer from a combination of chest x-ray and CT images is proposed. This combination has been used because chest X-ray is less powerful in the early stages of the disease, while a CT scan of the chest is useful even before symptoms appear, and CT can precisely detect the abnormal features that are identified in images. In addition, using these two types of images will increase the dataset size, which will increase the classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no other deep learning model choosing between these diseases is found in the literature. In the present work, the performance of four architectures are considered, namely: VGG19-CNN, ResNet152V2, ResNet152V2 + Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and ResNet152V2 + Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU). A comprehensive evaluation of different deep learning architectures is provided using public digital chest x-ray and CT datasets with four classes (i.e., Normal, COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Lung cancer). From the results of the experiments, it was found that the VGG19 +CNN model outperforms the three other proposed models. The VGG19+CNN model achieved 98.05% accuracy (ACC), 98.05% recall, 98.43% precision, 99.5% specificity (SPC), 99.3% negative predictive value (NPV), 98.24% F1 score, 97.7% Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and 99.66% area under the curve (AUC) based on X-ray and CT images.","Ibrahim, Dina M; Elshennawy, Nada M; Sarhan, Amany M",Comput Biol Med,,167

In July 2020, we conducted a web-based survey of 500 licensed mental health providers to assess their employment and caseloads, logistics of care, quality of care, and patient-provider relationships and communication during the pandemic. Over 90% of providers reported changes to their employment (e.g., furloughs), with 64% no longer practicing. Providers who reported no longer practicing were older in age, racial minorities, served rural communities, worked in small clinics/provider networks, were social workers and marriage and family therapists, and relied on private insurance or out-of-pocket payment. Most practicing providers reported similar-to-increased caseloads (62%), new patients seeking services (67%), and appointment frequency (70%). Approximately 97% of providers used telemedicine, with 54% providing services mostly-to-exclusively via telemedicine.

In this study, we described the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural and urban counties in the U.S. METHODS: Using data from April 1 to November 12, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, we estimated COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and conducted comparisons between urban and rural areas in three time periods at the national level, and in states with higher and lower COVID-19 incidence rates. RESULTS: Results at the national level showed greater COVID-19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. at the beginning of the epidemic. However, the intensity of the epidemic has shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas. In particular, high incidence states located in the Mid-west of the country had more than 3,400 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people compared to 1,284 cases per 100,000 people in urban counties nationwide during the third period (August 30 to November 12). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection rates and mortality in rural areas. Infection prevention and control efforts including healthcare capacity should be scaled up in these vulnerable rural areas.","Cuadros, Diego F; Branscum, Adam J; Mukandavire, Zindoga; Miller, F DeWolfe; MacKinnon, Neil",Ann Epidemiol,,167

The causative role of acidic nature of drinking water has not yet been investigated in Kerala. We attempted to determine the spatial association between the occurrence of self-reported hypothyroidism and pH of ground water using the geographic information system. The cross-sectional study was conducted among 1649 individuals residing in the subcenter area in urban Trivandrum. Self-reported hypothyroidism was obtained by the interview. Differential Global Positioning System was used to record the location of each house and its drinking water source. PH of 50 open-well water samples was estimated. The prevalence of self-reported hypothyroidism was 4.24%. Maps depicting pH distribution and occurrence of hypothyroidism were prepared. Most of the areas had acidic ground water. Geo-statistical analysis revealed the occurrence of statistically significant clustering of hypothyroid individuals in areas having acidic ground water. The study brings out possible linkage between hypothyroidism and acidic water intake necessitating detailed epidemiological investigations for drawing more robust associations.,"Valamparampil, Mathew Joseph; Varghese, Sara; Mohan, Ananth; Reghunath, Rajesh; Achu, A L; Anish, T S",Indian J Public Health,,167

415814,"Quality of early evidence on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of COVID-19",2020,"COVID-19 patients commonly present with neurological signs of central nervous system (CNS) and/or peripheral nervous system dysfunction. However, which neural cells are permissive to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been controversial. Here, we show that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are selectively permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro and upon transplantation in vivo, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a DA neuron inflammatory and cellular senescence response. A high-throughput screen in hPSC-derived DA neurons identified several FDA approved drugs, including riluzole, metformin, and imatinib, that can rescue the cellular senescence phenotype and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RNA-seq analysis of human ventral midbrain tissue from COVID-19 patients, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded autopsy samples, confirmed the induction of an inflammatory and cellular senescence signature and identified low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Our findings demonstrate that hPSC-derived DA neurons can serve as a disease model to study neuronal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and to identify candidate neuroprotective drugs for COVID-19 patients. The susceptibility of hPSC-derived DA neurons to SARS-CoV-2 and the observed inflammatory and senescence transcriptional responses suggest the need for careful, long-term monitoring of neurological problems in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, S.; Han, Y.; Yang, L.; Kim, T.; Nair, M.; Harschnitz, O.; Wang, P.; Zhu, J.; Koo, S.

415950,'We're in one of the cataclysmic times of change': first female NSF director on discrimination and COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus infection is now the leading cause of death globally. Despite the several bedsides- to- bench investigations carried out by researchers all over the world to identify the best prophylactic and therapeutic options for this deadly virus, no novel vaccine or treatment drug has been developed. Accumulating evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV2) is associated with hyper inflammation characterized by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm. The hallmark of this unregulated inflammatory response includes viral sepsis, pneumonitis shock, coagulopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. In the midst of cytokine storm and coagulopathy, anti-viral agents alone will not provide the much needed therapeutic effect. Hence, the need to combine anti-inflammatory agents such as interferons, angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE) 2 inhibitors, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and Janus kinase (JAK) family inhibitors, anticoagulants and other agents involved in inflammation resolution. This review critically presented a comprehensive overview of SAR-CoV2, unveiled the mechanisms of the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV2 and also highlighted possible specific prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that will circumvent inflammatory induced deaths in COVID -19 patients.

Several regions managed to handle the pandemic more successfully than others in terms of life loss, while ongoing heated debates as to the right course of action for battling COVID-19 have divided the academic community as well as public opinion. To this direction, in this paper, an autoregressive COVID-19 prediction model with heterogeneous explanatory variables for Greece is proposed, taking past COVID-19 data, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and Google query data as independent variables, from the day of the first confirmed case-February 26th-to the day before the announcement for the quarantine measures' softening-April 24th. The analysis indicates that the early measures taken by the Greek officials positively affected the flattening of the epidemic curve, with Greece having recorded significantly decreased COVID-19 casualties per million population and managing to stay on the low side of the deaths over cases spectrum. In specific, the prediction model identifies the 7-day lag that is needed in order for the measures' results to actually show, i.e., the optimal time-intervention framework for managing the disease's spread, while our analysis also indicates an appropriate point during the disease spread where restrictive measures should be applied. Present results have significant implications for effective policy making and in the designing of the NPIs, as the second wave of COVID-19 is expected in fall 2020, and such multidisciplinary analyses are crucial in order to understand the evolution of the Daily Deaths to Daily Cases ratio along with its determinants as soon as possible, for the assessment of the respective domestic health authorities' policy interventions as well as for the timely health resources allocation.","Mavragani, Amaryllis; Gkillas, Konstantinos",Sci Rep,,167
417427,Treating COVID-19 by traditional Chinese medicine: a charming strategy?,2020,"Objectives: Sufficient knowledge and positive attitudes are crucial to the prevention of COVID-19. However, little is known about public awareness and attitudes regarding COVID-19 in China. The impact of COVID-19 on the societal well-being and anxiety levels of the public has never been documented. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, attitudes, impact, and anxiety levels of the people of China in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire was undertaken between Jan 24 and Feb 24, 2020. The study participants were residents of mainland China over the age of 18 years. The attitude items in this study measured the perceived threat of COVID-19 based on the Health Belief Model. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a self-reported questionnaire that measure both state (STAI-S), and trait anxiety (STAI-T) Results: A total of 2,446 completed responses were received. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total knowledge score was 20.3 (SD ± 2.9) out of a possible score of 23. The social disruption and household economic impact were notable, particularly in provinces with higher cumulative confirmed cases. The majority of responses indicated a low perceived susceptibility of being infected (86.7% [95%CI 85.4–88.1]), with a fair proportion of respondents perceiving a higher severity (62.9% [95% CI 61.0–64.8]). The mean total impact score was 9.9 (SD ± 3.8) out of a possible score of 15. The mean score for STAI-S was 48.7 (SD ± 10.8), whereas the mean STAI-T score was 45.7 (SD ± 8.5). By demographics, women reported significantly higher odds for higher levels of both STAI-S (OR = 1.67) and STAI-T (OR = 1.30) compared to men. People of a younger age were also more likely to experience higher STAI-S and STAI-T. Higher perceived susceptibility and severity and impact were strong predictors of higher levels of STAI-S and STAI-T. Conclusion: Our findings can assist in tailoring public communication to change people's knowledge and attitudes. The present study also underlined the importance of the promotion of mental health during infectious disease outbreaks to help in moderating the perceived threat, social and household economic impact, targeting the vulnerable segment of the population.","Lin, Yulan; Hu, Zhijian; Alias, Haridah; Wong, Li Ping",Front.

We examined age differences in exposure and affective reactivity to daily stressors and positive events in the first several weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: In March and April 2020, 776 adults from Canada and the U.S. ages 18-91 (mean age 45) reported COVID-19 threats at baseline, then completed nightly surveys for one week about their daily stressors, positive events, and affect. RESULTS: Younger age predicted more concerns about the threat of COVID-19 across multiple domains, in addition to lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less frequent positive events. Younger adults had more non-COVID-19 daily stressors and higher perceived control over stressors, but lower perceived coping efficacy than older adults. There were no age differences in the frequency of COVID-19 daily stressors nor perceived stressor severity. Younger adults had greater reductions in negative affect on days when more positive events occurred and greater increases in negative affect on days when non-COVID-19 stressors occurred. Age moderation was attenuated for negative affective reactivity to COVID-19 stressors. Age did not moderate positive affective reactivity to daily events. DISCUSSION: In the early weeks of the pandemic, older adults showed better emotional well-being and less reactivity to stressors but did not differ from younger adults in their exposure to COVID-19 stressors. Additionally, younger adults benefited more from positive events.","Klaiber, Patrick; Wen, Jin H; DeLongis, Anita; Sin, Nancy L",,,167

Dark side of the heart: A simple approach for a forgotten structure,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Telephone-based cognitive assessment (TBCA) has long been studied but less widely adopted in routine neuropsychological practice. Increased interest in remote neuropsychological assessment techniques in the face of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic warrants an updated review of relevant remote assessment literature. While recent reviews of videoconference-based neuropsychological applications have been published, no updated compilation of empirical TBCA research has been completed. Therefore, this scoping review offers relevant empirical research to inform clinical decision-making specific to teleneuropsychology. METHOD: Peer-reviewed studies addressing TBCA were included. Broad search terms were related to telephone, cognitive, or neuropsychological assessment and screening. After systematic searching of the PubMed and EBSCO databases, 139 relevant articles were retained. RESULTS: In total, 17 unique cognitive screening measures, 20 cognitive batteries, and 6 single-task measures were identified as being developed or adapted specifically for telephone administration. Tables summarizing the identified cognitive assessments, information on diagnostic accuracy, and comparisons to face-to-face cognitive assessment are included in supplementary materials. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, literature suggests that TBCA is a viable modality for identifying cognitive impairment in various populations. However, the mode of assessment selected clinically should reflect an understanding of the purpose, evidence, and limitations for various tests and populations. Most identified measures were developed for research application to support gross cognitive characterization and to help determine when more comprehensive testing was needed. While TBCA is not meant to replace gold-standard, face-to-face evaluation, if appropriately utilized, it can expand scope of practice, particularly when barriers to standard neuropsychological assessment occur.","Carlew, Anne R; Fatima, Hudaisa; Livingstone, Julia R; Reese, Caitlin; Lacritz, Laura; Pendergrass, Cody; Bailey, Kenneth Chase; Presley, Chase; Mokhtari, Ben; Cullum, Colin Munro",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,,167

424970,Response to Letter to the Editor: Triggers of Takotsubo Syndrome should be identified by exclusion,2021,"BACKGROUND: The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is involved in the processing of vital polypeptides required for viral genome replication and transcription and is one of the best-characterized targets to inhibit the progression of SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals. METHODS: We screened a set of novel classes of acridinediones molecules to efficiently bind and inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the Mpro. The repurposed FDA-approved antivirals were taken as standard molecules for this study. Long term (1.1 µs) MD simulations were performed to analyze the conformational space of the binding pocket of Mpro bound to the selected molecules. RESULTS: The molecules DSPD-2 and DSPD-6 showed more favorable MM-PBSA interaction energies and were seated more deeply inside the binding pocket of Mpro than the topmost antiviral drug (Saquinavir). Moreover, DSPD-5 also exhibited comparable binding energy to Saquinavir. The analysis of per residue contribution energy and SASA studies indicated that the molecules showed efficient binding by targeting the S1 subsite of the Mpro binding pocket. CONCLUSION: The DSPD-2, DSPD-6, and DSPD-5 could be developed as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we suggest that targeting molecules to bind effectively to the S1 subsite could potentially increase the binding of molecules to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Bhardwaj, Vijay Kumar; Singh, Rahul; Das, Pralay; Purohit, Rituraj",Comput Biol Med,,167

427488,Rethinking cancer clinical trials for COVID-19 and beyond,2020,"BACKGROUND: Globally, Coronavirus disease-19 has created unprecedented challenges to public health. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of COVID-19 because of their profession. There are limited studies conducted in Ethiopia among HCWs regarding their compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Therefore, this study intended to assess HCWs' compliance with measures to prevent COVID-19, and its potential determinants in public hospitals in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered, multicenter hospital-based cross-sectional survey was proposed to 422 randomly selected HCWs working in seven public hospitals in Western Ethiopia identified as COVID-19 referral centers. Data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 24. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential determinants of outcome variables at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 422 completed questionnaires, the overall HCWs' compliance with COVID-19 prevention is 22% (n = 404). In multivariate regression analysis, factors such as spending most of caring time at bedside (AOR = 1.94, 95%CI, 1.06-3.55), receiving training on infection prevention/COVID-19 (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI, 1.04-3.33), reading materials on COVID-19 (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI, 1.14-3.63) and having support from hospital management (AOR = 2.09, 95%CI, 1.20-3.64) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, inadequate supplies of appropriate personal protective equipment (83.2%), insufficient supportive medications (78.5%), and lack of provision of adequate ventilation (77.7%) were the barriers to COVID-19 prevention most frequently mentioned by participants. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight HCWs' poor compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Providing information and refreshing training to improve the level of healthcare workers' adherence with COVID-19 prevention is as imperative as increasing staff commitment to supply resources necessary to protect HCWs and to reduce healthcare-associated infections transmission of SARS-COV-2.","Etafa, Werku; Gadisa, Gosa; Jabessa, Shibiru; Takele, Tagay",BMC Infect Dis,,167

428426,Update on treatment of COVID-19: ongoing studies between promising and disappointing results,2020,"The Later Life Audio and Radio Co-operative (LLARC) is an England-wide network of older content creators, age-inclusive radio stations, third sector organisations, local authorities and academics working on ageing issues. The co-operative was established in 2019 as an outcome from a participatory action research project. Aiming to promote talk-based content created by older adults, the LLARC advocates for greater representation of older adults in broadcasting. This paper considers radio production as an approach to support civic participation in later life. Firstly, we present findings from a two-day radio festival for older adults at which the LLARC was launched. Drawing on discussions at the radio festival, we highlight three themes that underpin the LLARC's mission: 1) challenging ageist stereotypes;2) advocating for intergenerational cohesion;and 3) considering radio as a technology for community engagement. Secondly, based on observations, we report on the organisation's ongoing digital development and adaptation to remote digital production workflows in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss the potential of radio as a technology to involve older adults in citizen dialogue. Due to its combination of digital and non-digital elements, we conclude that radio production can be an accessible technology for older adults to engage with in order to have their voices heard more widely. Our work contributes to key debates at the intersection of technology use and community engagement in later life, suggesting a central role for audio and radio as accessible routes to support public debates and promote citizen dialogue in later life. © 2020 ACM.","Reuter, A.; Liddle, J.","9th International Conference on Software Development and Technologies for Enhancing Accessibility and Fighting Info-Exclusion, DSAI 2020",,167

Among them, the most scarce information has been obtained from the P.1 variant and more data on its global presence and about its spreading dynamics are needed. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was performed prospectively on travellers arriving from Brasil and on a random selection of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases from our population. RESULTS: In this study we report the first SARS-CoV-2 P.1 and P.2 variants exported from Brazil to Spain. The case infected with the P.1 variant, who had only stayed in Rio de Janeiro, required hospitalization. The two P.2 cases remained asymptomatic. A wider distribution for P.1 variant beyond the Brazilian Amazonia should be considered. The exportation of the P.2 variant, carrying the E484K mutation, deserves attention. CONCLUSION: One month after the first description of P.1 and P.2 importations from Brazil to Madrid, these variants were identified circulating in the community, in cases without a travel history, and involved in household transmissions.","Campoy, Pedro J Sola; Buenestado-Serrano, Sergio; Pérez-Lago, Laura; Rodriguez-Grande, Cristina; Catalán, Pilar; Andrés-Zayas, Cristina; Alcalá, Luis; Losada, Carmen; Rico-Luna, Carla; Muñoz, Patricia; de Viedma, Darío García",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

429577,Fighting against frailty and sarcopenia - As well as COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is disproportionately impacting older individuals and healthcare workers. Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. RESULTS: In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.","Ruthberg, Jeremy S; Quereshy, Humzah A; Jella, Tarun K; Kocharyan, Armine; D039,; Anza, Brian; Maronian, Nicole; Otteson, Todd D",Am J Otolaryngol,,167

In Romania, there have been 983,217 confirmed cases and 24,386 deaths. We aim to show our experience at the Fundeni Clinical Institute in the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in both patients and health care personnel. Swab samples were collected for extraction of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 29380 patients and health care personnel. We have combined three real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2. Also, the presence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was analyzed in 1068 patients and clinical staff using the chemiluminescence method. Other 50 people were screened post-vaccination for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the spike (S) protein, using the chemiluminescence method as well. The majority of confirmed cases were in adults, 71.3% of cases being registered in people aged 30-69 years. Most patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (83%) were admitted to the gastroenterology, hematology, and surgery wards. Our study showed that one-third of people developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence does not vary by gender or age. Also, we noticed the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in all 50 people post-vaccination that were tested two weeks after the second dose. Due to the increasing number of infected patients with SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus pandemic involves a sustained testing effort for an accurate virological diagnosis in both direct and indirect diagnosis.","Maruntelu, Ion; Caragea, Andreea Mirela; Tizu, Maria; Constantinescu, Ileana",J Med Life,,167
430242,"COVID-19, myocardial edema and dexamethasone",2020,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials, conducted efficiently and with the utmost integrity, are a key component in identifying effective vaccines, therapies, and other interventions urgently needed to solve the COVID-19 crisis. Yet launching and implementing trials with the rigor necessary to produce convincing results is a complicated and time-consuming process. Balancing rigor and efficiency involves relying on designs that employ flexible features to respond to a fast-changing landscape, measuring valid endpoints that result in translational actions and disseminating findings in a timely manner. We describe the challenges involved in creating infrastructure with potential utility for shared learning. METHODS: We have established a shared infrastructure that borrows strength across multiple trials. The infrastructure includes an endpoint registry to aid in selecting appropriate endpoints, a registry to facilitate establishing a Data & Safety Monitoring Board, common data collection instruments, a COVID-19 dedicated design and analysis team, and a pragmatic platform protocol, among other elements. RESULTS: The authors have relied on the shared infrastructure for six clinical trials for which they serve as the Data Coordinating Center and have a design and analysis team comprising 15 members who are dedicated to COVID-19. The authors established a pragmatic platform to simultaneously investigate multiple treatments for the outpatient with adaptive features to add or drop treatment arms. CONCLUSION: The shared infrastructure provides appealing opportunities to evaluate disease in a more robust manner with fewer resources and is especially valued during a pandemic where efficiency in time and resources is crucial. The most important element of the shared infrastructure is the pragmatic platform. While it may be the most challenging of the elements to establish, it may provide the greatest benefit to both patients and researchers.","Hedlin, Haley; Garcia, Ariadna; Weng, Yingjie; He, Ziyuan; Sundaram, Vandana; Bunning, Bryan; Balasubramanian, Vidhya; Cunanan, Kristen; Kapphahn, Kristopher; Gummidipundi, Santosh; Purington, Natasha; Boulos, Mary; Desai, Manisha",Clin Trials,,167

While conventional chemical and biological solutions to these challenges are characteristically slow to develop and reach public availability; recent advances in device components operating at Super High Frequency (SHF) bands (3-30 GHz) of the electromagnetic spectrum enable novel approaches to such problems. METHODS: Based on experimentally documented evidence, a clinically relevant in situ radiation procedure to reduce viral loads in patients is devised and presented. Adapted to the currently available medical device technology to cause viral membrane fracture, this procedure selectively inactivates virus particles by forced oscillations arising from Structure Resonant Energy Transfer (SRET) thereby reducing infectivity and disease progression. RESULTS: Effective resonant frequencies for pleiomorphic Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is calculated to be in the 10-17 GHz range. Using the relation y = -3.308x + 42.9 with x and y representing log10 number of virus particles and the clinical throat swab Ct value respectively; in situ patient-specific exposure duration of ~15x minutes can be utilized to inactivate up to 100% of virus particles in the throat-lung lining, using an irradiation dose of 14.5 ± 1 W/m2; which is within the 200 W/m2 safety standard stipulated by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment is designed to make patients less contagious enhancing faster recoveries and enabling timely control of a spreading pandemic.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October 1 and December 1, 2020, in Iran. The study population consisted of patients who used the service. Three hundred-ninety-six patients were enrolled in the study by convenience sampling. Data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire. The face, comprehensibility, and content validity of the questionnaire were tested and met. The reliability of this questionnaire was confirmed (r = 0.9). Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were conducted. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.0 software. RESULTS: In total, 396 patients responded to the online questionnaire. The mean age of patients was 37 ± 10.31 years. More than half of them had an academic degree (65.40 %). Teleconsultation was considered satisfactory by 172 patients (43.43 %), while more than half of the patients (56.57 %) were unsatisfied with teleconsultation. In terms of ""quality of care provided"" and ""patient information privacy"" components, around 41 % of patients were satisfied. However, the number of patients who feel satisfied with teleconsultation's similarity to a face-to-face encounter was lower (37.88 %). The results showed no significant relationship between age, gender, education, and overall satisfaction (p > 0.05). The association between overall satisfaction and health status was (AOR = 1.51, 95 % CI = 1.16-1.96). CONCLUSION: More than half of patients from our study did not have a good experience with teleconsultation. This is also partially due to the use of existing communication platform, instead of custom-made solution.

433436,Announcements,2020,"PURPOSE: The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 illness has had a major impact on all levels of society internationally. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on prison staff and prisoners in England and Wales is unknown. Testing for COVID-19 both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as for antibodies, to date, has been minimal. The purpose of this paper is to explore the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisons poses philosophical and ethical questions around trust, efficacy and ethicacy. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This paper is both descriptive, providing an overview of the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisoners in England and Wales, and conceptual in that it discusses and argues the issues associated with large-scale testing. This paper provides a discussion, using comparative studies, of the issues associated with large-scale testing of prisoners across the prison estate in England and Wales (120 prisons). The issues identified in this paper are contextualised through the lens of COVID-19, but they are equally transferrable to epidemiological studies of any pandemic. Given the prevalence of COVID-19 globally and the lack of information about its spread in prisons, at the time of writing this paper, there is a programme of asymptomatic testing of prisoners. However, there remains a paucity of data on the spread of COVID-19 in prisons because of the progress with the ongoing testing programme. FINDINGS: The authors argue that the widespread testing of prisoners requires careful consideration of the details regarding who is included in testing, how consent is gained and how tests are administered. This paper outlines and argues the importance of considering the complex nuance of power relationships within the prison system, among prisoner officers, medical staff and prisoners and the detrimental consequences. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The widespread testing of COVID-19 presents ethical and practical challenges. Careful planning is required when considering the ethics of who should be included in COVID-19 testing, how consent will be gained, who and how tests will be administered and very practical challenges around the recording and assigning of COVID-19 test kits inside the prison. The current system for the general population requires scanning of barcodes and registration using a mobile number; these facilities are not permitted inside a prison. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper looks at the issues associated with mass testing of prisoners for COVID-19. According to the authors' knowledge, there has not been any research that looks at the issues of testing either in the UK or internationally. The literature available details countries' responses to the pandemic rather and scientific papers on the development of vaccines. Therefore, this paper is an original review of some of the practicalities that need to be addressed to ensure that testing can be as successful as possible.","Lambert, Steve; Wilkinson, Dean",International journal of prisoner health (Online),,167
433789,Reducing Aerosol-Related Risk of Transmission in the Era of COVID-19: An Interim Guidance Endorsed by the International Society of Aerosols in Medicine,2020,"The recent emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been a major threat to human society, as the challenge of finding suitable drug or vaccine is not met till date. With increasing morbidity and mortality, the need for novel drug candidates is under great demand. The investigations are progressing towards COVID-19 therapeutics. Among the various strategies employed, the use of repurposed drugs is competing along with novel drug inventions. Based on the therapeutic significance, the chemical constituents from the extract of Tinospora cordifolia belonging to various classes like alkaloids, lignans, steroids and terpenoids are investigated as potential drug candidates for COVID-19. The inhibition potential of the proposed compounds against viral spike protein and human receptor ACE2 were evaluated by computational molecular modeling (Auto dock), along with their ADME/T properties. Prior to docking, the initial geometry of the compounds were optimized by Density functional theory (DFT) method employing B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-311 + + G (d,p) basis set. The results of molecular docking and ADME/T studies have revealed 6 constituents as potential drug candidates that can inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human receptor ACE2 protein. The narrowed down list of constituents from Tinospora cordifolia paved way for further tuning their ability to inhibit COVID-19 by modifying the chemical structures and by employing computational geometry optimization and docking methods.

433845,Advances in the possible treatment of COVID-19: A review,2020,"This paper applies a Diagonal BEKK model to investigate the risk spillovers of three major cryptocurrencies to ten leading traditional currencies and two gold prices (Spot Gold and Gold Futures). The daily data used are from 7 August 2015 to 15 June 2020. The dataset is analyzed in its entirety and is also subdivided into four distinct subsets in order to study and compare the patterns of spillover effects during economic turmoil, such as the 2018 cryptocurrency crash and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal significant co-volatility spillover effects between cryptocurrency and traditional currency or gold markets, especially during the whole sample period and amid the uncertainty raised by COVID-19. The capabilities of cryptocurrency are time-varying and related to economic uncertainty or shocks. There are significant differences between normal and extreme markets with regard to the capabilities of cryptocurrency as a diversifier, a hedge or a safe haven. We find the significant co-volatility spillover effects are asymmetric in most cases especially during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which means the negative return shocks have larger impacts on co-volatility than positive return shocks of the same magnitude. Evidently, cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies or gold can be incorporated into financial portfolios for financial market participants who seek effective risk management and also for optimal dynamic hedging purposes against economic turmoil and downward movements.","Hsu, Shu-Han Sheu Chwen Yoon Jiho",The North American Journal of Economics and Finance,,167
433977,Can Adhesive Capsulitis of the shoulder be a consequence of COVID-19? Case series of 12 patients,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Rates of maternal syphilis have increased five-fold in Brazil in the past decade. While penicillin remains the only appropriate treatment for maternal syphilis, we hypothesized that low non-treponemal titers (<1:16) may lead to reduced penicillin treatment in Brazil. METHODS: Using Brazilian Ministry of Health data on women diagnosed with maternal syphilis between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, we conducted a random-effects logistic regression model with a cluster correction at the state level to evaluate predictive factors of penicillin treatment. RESULTS: We observed yearly increases in cases of pregnant women with syphilis from 2010 to 2018. There was significant variation by state: 52,451 cases were reported in São Paulo, followed by 26,838 in Rio de Janeiro. Among 215,937 cases of maternal syphilis, 91·3% received penicillin. In the random-effects model, a non-treponemal titer &#8805;1:16 was associated with 1·44 higher odds of receiving penicillin (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1·391·48), and prenatal care was associated with a 2·12 increased odds of receiving penicillin (95% CI: 2·022·21). Although there is an association between the absence of prenatal care and inadequate treatment for syphilis, 83·2% of women in this cohort who did not receive penicillin were engaged in prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: Providers may inappropriately exclude low non-treponemal titers and thereby fail to use penicillin treatment in maternal syphilis. While the cause of the maternal syphilis epidemic in Brazil is multifactorial, we believe our findings can be used to develop targeted interventions throughout Brazil as well as shape public health initiatives globally.","Swayze, Emma Jane; Nielsen-Saines, Karin; Segura, Eddy R; Saad, Eduardo; Yue, Dahai; Comulada, Warren Scott; Cambou, Mary Catherine",Int J Infect Dis,,167

We measure through on-line survey methods (n = 529) how pandemic mandates limiting personal movement and outdoor nature access within the United States affect self-assessed nature exposure, perceived nature deprivation, and subsequent flourishing as measured by the Harvard Flourishing Index. Results indicate that perceived nature deprivation strongly associates with local nature contact, time in nature, and access to municipal nature during the pandemic, after controlling for lockdown mandates, job status, household composition, and sociodemographic variables. Our hypothesis is that individuals with strong perceived nature deprivation under COVID-19 leads to diminished wellbeing proved true. Interaction models of flourishing showed positive modification of nature affinity with age and qualitative modification of nature deprivation with race. Our results demonstrate the potential of local nature contact to support individual wellbeing in a background context of emotional distress and social isolation, important in guiding public health policies beyond pandemics.","Tomasso, Linda Powers; Yin, Jie; Cedeño Laurent, Jose Guillermo; Chen, Jarvis T; Catalano, Paul J; Spengler, John D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,167

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients.","Ozturk, Tulin; Talo, Muhammed; Yildirim, Eylul Azra; Baloglu, Ulas Baran; Yildirim, Ozal; Rajendra Acharya, U",Comput Biol Med,,167

The major electronic databases were searched using both ""text words"" and ""thesaurus terms,"" focusing on viral infections, COVID-19 and healthcare systems in Pakistan. The content of the selected articles was analyzed by using thematic approach. Out of the total 171 potentially relevant citations, 24 articles were included in the data synthesis. We found that the recent COVID-19 outbreak is a major threat to Pakistan's public health and healthcare system, and the country is not in a position to control spread of disease and provide required standards of care deemed necessary by the World Health Organization. A number of intertwined reasons that expose the Pakistani population at increased risk of COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, include public related demurrals, healthcare workforce related demurrals, organizational and regulatory voids, and travel patterns. To cope with the upsurge of COVID-19 in Pakistan, the regulators need to re-examine and recognize deficiencies in the healthcare system, and thereafter reinforce core capacities in workforce and monetary resources, surveillance, laboratory services, and hospital preparedness for isolation and ventilation of patients.","Atif, Muhammad; Malik, Iram",Int J Health Plann Manage,,167

437652,Are telephone consultations here to stay in rheumatology?,2021,"All living languages change over time. The causes for this are many, one being the emergence and borrowing of new linguistic elements. Competition between the new elements and older ones with a similar semantic or grammatical function may lead to speakers preferring one of them, and leaving the other to go out of use. We introduce a general method for quantifying competition between linguistic elements in diachronic corpora which does not require language-specific resources other than a sufficiently large corpus. This approach is readily applicable to a wide range of languages and linguistic subsystems. Here, we apply it to lexical data in five corpora differing in language, type, genre, and time span. We find that changes in communicative need are consistently predictive of lexical competition dynamics. Near-synonymous words are more likely to directly compete if they belong to a topic of conversation whose importance to language users is constant over time, possibly leading to the extinction of one of the competing words. By contrast, in topics which are increasing in importance for language users, near-synonymous words tend not to compete directly and can coexist. This suggests that, in addition to direct competition between words, language change can be driven by competition between topics or semantic subspaces.","Karjus, Andres; Blythe, Richard A.; Kirby, Simon; Smith, Kenny",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09277v1.pdf,167
438190,Retrospective prediction of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Wuhan at four phases,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Prognostic factors are needed to aid clinicians in managing Covid-19, a respiratory illness. Lymphocytopenia has emerged as a simply obtained laboratory value that may correlate with prognosis. METHODS: In this article, we perform a retrospective cohort review study on patients admitted to one academic hospital for Covid-19 illness. We analyzed basic demographic, clinical, and laboratory data to understand the relationship between lymphocytopenia at the time of hospital admission and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We discovered that lymphocyte count is lower (P = .01) and lymphocytopenia more frequent by an odds ratio of 3.40 (95% CI: 1.06-10.96; P = .04) in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), a marker of disease severity, relative to those who were not. We additionally find that patients with lymphocytopenia were more likely to develop an acute kidney injury (AKI), a marker of organ failure, during admission by an odds ratio of 4.29 (95% CI: 1.35-13.57; P = .01). CONCLUSION: This evidence supports the hypothesis that lymphocytopenia can be an early, useful, and easily obtained, prognostic factor in determining the clinical course and disease severity of a patient admitted to the hospital for Covid-19.","Wagner, Jason; DuPont, Andrew; Larson, Scott; Cash, Brooks; Farooq, Ahmad",Int J Lab Hematol,,167

439458,Impaired immune signaling and changes in the lung microbiome precede secondary bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic of Covid-19 on 11 March 2020. The lockdown caused a lifestyle changes: an increase in the use of mobile media devices (MMDs), sleep and psychiatric disorders, incorrect habits regarding food and physical activities. We investigate prevalence of admission for seizures at our emergency department (ED), during Italian lockdown, comparing with that of the same period of the previous year (2019), and the relationship with some lifestyle changes. METHODS: In this observational study, patients (4-14 years) with seizures that accessed at our ED, during Italian lockdown, were eligible. Non-epileptic events and febrile seizures were excluded. We describe two groups: patients with new-onset seizures and not. Moreover, a questionnaire concerning use of MMDs and sleep habits was administered. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included; median age 8.03 years. Considering only paediatric medical emergencies, the prevalence of accesses for seizures was 2.6% (CI 95% 0.020-0.034), while the incidence was 0.94% (CI 95% 0.006-0.0149). There was a statistically significant difference with prevalence of previous years, &#967;2 102.21 (p = 0.0001). We also reported a difference in daily screen time (DST) (p = 0.001) and total sleep time (TST) (p = 0.045), in all population, between period pre- and during lockdown. A negative correlation between DST and seizures latency (Spearman's &#961; -0.426, p = 0.038) was found. In the two groups, the results were partially overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown period, we assisted to an increase of accesses for seizures. It is conceivable that a sleep time change and/or higher MMD use could act as triggers for seizures.","Palladino, Federica; Merolla, Eugenio; Solimeno, Marella; de Leva, Maria Fulvia; Lenta, Selvaggia; Di Mita, Onorina; Bonadies, Anna; Striano, Pasquale; Tipo, Vincenzo; Varone, Antonio",Neurol Sci,,167

This study was designed to examine the effect of this unique time on artistic voice users, the way they perceive their voice and their voice-related behaviors. METHODS: A total of 110 participants volunteered for the study: 57 professional artistic voice users (34 singers and 19 actors) and a control group of 53 nonprofessional voice users. All participants completed three questionnaires related to their self-assessment of their voice, their voice difficulties, vocal training, and current stress in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, artistic voice users were more concerned about their voice (P < 0.001), practiced their voice more often (P < 0.001), and experienced more anxiety and stress (P < 0.05). In addition, within the professional group, singers reported practicing their voice in the time of the COVID-19 significantly more than actors (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Professional artistic voice users experience the COVID-19 pandemic as a stressful time, with negative effects on their well-being and specifically on their voice.

This study assessed associations between chemsex and a wide range of determinants among MSM visiting STI clinics to increase understanding of characteristics and beliefs of MSM practicing chemsex. METHODS: In 2018, 785 MSM were recruited at nine Dutch STI clinics; 368 (47%) fully completed the online questionnaire. All participants reported to have had sex in the past six months. Chemsex was defined as using cocaine, crystal meth, designer drugs, GHB/GBL, ketamine, speed or XTC/MDMA during sex in the past six months. Associations between chemsex and psychosocial determinants, socio-demographics, sexual behaviour and using tobacco or alcohol were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Chemsex was reported by 44% of MSM (161/368) and was not associated with socio-demographics. Independent determinants were 'believing that the majority of friends/sex partners use drugs during sex' (descriptive norm) (aOR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.43-2.65), 'believing that sex is more fun when using drugs' (attitude) (aOR: 2.06, 95%CI: 1.50-2.84), using tobacco (aOR: 2.65, 95%CI: 1.32-5.32), multiple sex partners (aOR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.21-6.00), group sex (aOR: 4.65, 95%CI: 1.54-14.05) and using online dating platforms (aOR: 2.73, 95%CI: 1.13-6.62). CONCLUSION: MSM are likely to find themselves in distinct social networks where it is the norm to use drugs when having sex and pleasure is linked to chemsex. Health services should acknowledge the social influence and pleasurable experiences to increase acceptability of strategies aimed at minimizing the possible harms of chemsex.","Evers, Ymke J; Geraets, Jill J H; Van Liere, Geneviève A F S; Hoebe, Christian J P A; Dukers-Muijrers, Nicole H T M",PLoS One,,167

444124,Blood Cancers Diminish Response to COVID-19 Vaccine,2021,"Most advanced vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 are designed to induce antibodies against spike (S) protein. Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is a new vaccination approach based on intramuscular injection of DNA expression vectors coding for a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) with an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs, even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells can freely circulate into the body and are internalized by antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, EV-associated antigens can be cross-presented to prime antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a strategy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we designed DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and different viral antigens, namely N- and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. We provided evidence that all fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity became detectable in spleens and, most important, in lung airways. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lungs. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed for new anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies.","Ferrantelli, Flavia; Chiozzini, Chiara; Manfredi, Francesco; Giovannelli, Andrea; Leone, Patrizia; Federico, Maurizio",,,167

Our study evaluated the publicly available information on American and Canadian urogynecology fellowship websites and present recommendations for website content development to promote the subspecialty of urogynecology. METHODS: Data were collected from all active American and Canadian urogynecology fellowship program websites between May and June 2020 against 72 criteria developed from previously published studies. The criteria included the following sections: Recruitment, Faculty Information, Current Fellows, Research and Education, Surgical Program, Clinical Work, Benefits and Career Planning, Wellness, and Environment. RESULTS: 54 American urogynecology program websites and 11 Canadian urogynecology program websites were analyzed. The mean score of American and Canadian websites was 46.46% (n = 33.45 ± 7.20 out of 72) and 27.40% (n = 19.73 ± 3.77 out of 72), respectively. American program websites scored significantly higher on available information than Canadian websites. The highest prevalence section across American websites was Wellness (64%, n = 1.92 ± 0.85 out of 3 criteria) while the lowest prevalence section was Clinical Work (15.17%, n = 0.91 ± 1.02 out of 6 criteria). Comparatively, Canadian websites scored highest in the Faculty Information section (43.12%, 3.45 ± 2.02) and lowest in the Clinical Work section (6%, n = 0.36 ± 0.67 out of 6 criteria).

446942,Chest CT Imaging in the Diagnosis of COVID-19: Rapid Publications are not Equal to Quality of Research,2021,"Event detection on social media has attracted a number of researches, given the recent availability of large volumes of social media discussions. Previous works on social media event detection either assume a specific type of event, or assume certain behavior of observed variables. In this paper, we propose a general method for event detection on social media that makes few assumptions. The main assumption we make is that when an event occurs, affected semantic aspects will behave differently from its usual behavior. We generalize the representation of time units based on word embeddings of social media text, and propose an algorithm to detect events in time series in a general sense. In the experimental evaluation, we use a novel setting to test if our method and baseline methods can exhaustively catch all real-world news in the test period. The evaluation results show that when the event is quite unusual with regard to the base social media discussion, it can be captured more effectively with our method. Our method can be easily implemented and can be treated as a starting point for more specific applications.","Zhang, Yihong; Shirakawa, Masumi; Hara, Takahiro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02250v1.pdf,167

447403,The gut microbiome: a missing link in understanding the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19?,2021,"Over the past several decades, studies have demonstrated the existence of bi-directional relationships between periodontal disease and systemic conditions. Periodontitis is a polymicrobial and multifactorial disease involving both host and environmental factors. Tissue destruction is primarily associated with hyperresponsiveness of the host resulting in release of inflammatory mediators. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a major role in bacterial stimulation and tissue destruction. In addition, these cytokines are thought to underlie the associations between periodontitis and systemic conditions. Current research suggests that increased release of cytokines from host cells, referred to as the cytokine storm, is associated with disease progression in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An intersection between periodontitis and pulmonary disease is biologically plausible. Hence, we reviewed the evidence linking COVID-19, cytokines, and periodontal disease. Plaque control is essential to prevent exchange of bacteria between the mouth and the lungs, reducing the risk of lung disease. Understanding these associations may help identify individuals at high risk and deliver appropriate care at early stages.","Sukumar, Kanchana; Tadepalli, Anupama",J Int Med Res,,167

Since then, several countries went into lockdown. Using a mechanistic-statistical formalism, we estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number Reof the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (Re= 0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45–0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0–4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of Reis crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities.","Roques, Lionel; Klein, Etienne K.; Papaïx, Julien; Sar, Antoine; Soubeyrand, Samuel",Front.

However, it remains an open challenge to design locomotion controllers that can operate in a large variety of environments. In this paper, we address this challenge of automatically learning locomotion controllers that can generalize to a diverse collection of terrains often encountered in the real world. We frame this challenge as a multi-task reinforcement learning problem and define each task as a type of terrain that the robot needs to traverse. We propose an end-to-end learning approach that makes direct use of the raw exteroceptive inputs gathered from a simulated 3D LiDAR sensor, thus circumventing the need for ground-truth heightmaps or preprocessing of perception information. As a result, the learned controller demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization capabilities and can navigate 13 different environments, including stairs, rugged land, cluttered offices, and indoor spaces with humans.","Escontrela, Alejandro; Yu, George; Xu, Peng; Iscen, Atil; Tan, Jie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05513v1.pdf,167

Objective: To assess whether racial/ethnic disparities in very preterm birth (VPTB) and preterm birth (PTB) increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 8026 Black, Latina, and White women who gave birth during the study period. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of Black vs White disparities in VPTB or PTB in a pandemic cohort was compared with a prepandemic cohort by using electronic medical records obtained from 2 hospitals in New York City. Exposures: Women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2020, were considered the pandemic cohort, and women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2019, were considered the prepandemic cohort. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were performed using samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab at the time of admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical estimates of gestational age were used to calculate VPTB (<32 weeks) and PTB (<37 weeks). Log binomial regression was performed to estimate Black vs White risk differences, pandemic cohort vs prepandemic cohort risk difference, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator. Covariate-adjusted models included age, insurance, prepregnancy body mass index, and parity. Results: Of 3834 women in the pandemic cohort, 492 (12.8%) self-identified as Black, 678 (17.7%) as Latina, 2012 (52.5%) as White, 408 (10.6%) as Asian, and 244 (6.4%) as other or unspecified race/ethnicity, with approximately half the women 25 to 34 years of age. The prepandemic cohort comprised 4192 women with similar sociodemographic characteristics. In the prepandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.4% (20 of 451) and PTB risk was 14.4% (65 of 451) among Black infants compared with 0.8% (17 of 2188) VPTB risk and 7.1% (156 of 2188) PTB risk among White infants. In the pandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.3% (21 of 491) and PTB risk was 13.2% (65 of 491) among Black infants compared with 0.5% (10 of 1994) VPTB risk and 7.0% (240 of 1994) PTB risk among White infants. The DID estimators indicated that no increase in Black vs White disparities were found (DID estimator for VPTB, 0.1 additional cases per 100 [95% CI, -2.5 to 2.8]; DID estimator for PTB, 1.1 fewer case per 100 [95% CI, -5.8 to 3.6]). The results were comparable in covariate-adjusted models when limiting the population to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. No change was detected in Latina vs White PTB disparities during the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of women who gave birth in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic, no evidence was found for increased racial/ethnic disparities in PTB, among women who tested positive or tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.","Janevic, Teresa; Glazer, Kimberly B; Vieira, Luciana; Weber, Ellerie; Stone, Joanne; Stern, Toni; Bianco, Angela; Wagner, Brian; Dolan, Siobhan M; Howell, Elizabeth A",JAMA Netw Open,,167

In the Jiaokou Irrigation District, ionic concentrations, hydrogeochemistry, and fluoride contaminations were analyzed using correlation matrices, principal component analysis (PCA), and health risk assessment. The patterns for the average cation and anion concentrations were Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and SO42- > HCO3- > Cl- > NO3- > CO32-. The fluoride concentrations ranged between 0.29 and 8.92 mg/L (mean = 2.4 mg/L). 5% of the samples displayed lower than the recommended limit of 0.5 mg/L fluoride content, while 69% exceeded the allowable limits of 1.5 mg/L for drinking. The low F- content is distributed in a small part of the southeast, while elevated F- mainly in the central area of the study region. The PCA results indicated three principal components (PC), PC1 having the greatest variance (45.83%) and affected by positive loadings of TDS, Cl-, SO42-, Na+, and Mg2+, PC2 accounting for 17.03% and dominated by Ca2+, pH, HCO3-, and K+, and PC3 representing 12.17% and mainly comprising of CO32-. High fluoride groundwater is of the SO4-Cl-Na type, followed by HCO3-Na type. Evaporation and ion exchange play important roles in producing high fluoride groundwater. Furthermore, saturation index and anthropogenic activities also promote the high fluoride concentrations. The values of the total hazard quotient of 93% groundwater samples were greater than 1 for infants, followed by 85% for children, 68% for teenagers, and 57% for adults. Non-carcinogenic health risks to infants may occur over the entire study area, while for adults, health risks are mainly found in Weinan and Pucheng. High fluorine may have a potential negative influence on neurodevelopment, especially for infants and children. Adults in this region have serious dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis because of long-term drinking of high fluoride groundwater. Therefore, measures, including using organic fertilizers, strengthening defluoridation process, and optimizing water supply strategies, are necessary in this area.","Zhang, Qiying; Xu, Panpan; Qian, Hui; Yang, Faxuan",Sci Total Environ,,167

At present, Ayurvedic clinicians do not have access to COVID-19 patients in clinical settings. In these circumstances, a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 based on review of modern medical and classical Ayurvedic literature with inputs from Allopathic clinicians treating COVID-19 patients assumes significance. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to develop an Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19 by literature review supported by analysis of clinical data of a cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 was categorized based on a cluster of symptoms with reference to ""Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with confirmed corona virus disease (COVID-19)"" released by the US CDC. As the clinical presentation is found to vary widely, research papers reporting clinical symptoms of patient samples from different parts of the world were also reviewed to identify outliers and atypical presentations. Case records of fourteen COVID-19 patients treated at Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon were analyzed to compare symptomatology with data obtained from published literature. Further, a careful correlation was done with the data collected from selected Ayurvedic classical texts and expert views of clinical practitioners to arrive at a preliminary Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 can be understood from the Ayurvedic perspective as vatakapha dominant sannipatajvara of agantu origin with pittanubandha. The asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical stages of COVID-19 with varying clinical presentations have been analysed on the basis of nidana, dosa, dusya, nidanapañcaka and satkriyakala to present a preliminary clinical profile of the disease. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we have demonstrated that a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 from the Ayurvedic perspective is possible through literature review supported by discussions with Allopathic clinicians as well as examination of patient case records. The provisional diagnosis proposed can be further developed with continued review of literature, wider cooperation and teamwork with Allopathic physicians and access to clinical data as well as direct clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients.","Puthiyedath, Rammanohar; Kataria, Sushila; Payyappallimana, Unnikrishnan; Mangalath, Prasad; Nampoothiri, Vasudevan; Sharma, Pooja; Singh, Manish Kumar; Kumar, Kuldeep; Trehan, Naresh",,,167

However, no study has specifically evaluated the relationship between obesity and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). RESEARCH QUESTION: Is obesity associated with an increased incidence of VAP? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a post hoc analysis of the Impact of Early Enteral vs Parenteral Nutrition on Mortality in Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation and Catecholamines (NUTRIREA2) open-label, randomized controlled trial performed in 44 French ICUs. Adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support for shock and parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition were included. Obesity was defined as BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 at ICU admission. VAP diagnosis was adjudicated by an independent blinded committee, based on all available clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic data. Only first VAP episodes were taken into account. Incidence of VAP was analyzed by using the Fine and Gray model, with extubation and death as competing risks. RESULTS: A total of 699 (30%) of the 2,325 included patients had obesity; 224 first VAP episodes were diagnosed (60 and 164 in obese and nonobese groups, respectively). The incidence of VAP at day 28 was 8.6% vs 10.1% in the two groups (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI 0.63-1.14; P = .26). After adjustment on sex, McCabe score, age, antiulcer treatment, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment at randomization, the incidence of VAP remained nonsignificant between obese and nonobese patients (hazard ratio, 0.893; 95% CI, 0.66-1.2; P = .46). Although no significant difference was found in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, 90-day mortality was significantly lower in obese than in nonobese patients (272 of 692 [39.3%] patients vs 718 of 1,605 [44.7%]; P = .02). In a subgroup of patients (n = 123) with available pepsin and alpha-amylase measurements, no significant difference was found in rate of abundant microaspiration of gastric contents, or oropharyngeal secretions between obese and nonobese patients.

Participants included 16 pwCF and 14 parents, who completed four individual telehealth sessions with a psychologist. Stress ratings, Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder, PHQ-8 and GAD-7, were completed, in addition to Feasibility and Satisfaction ratings. RESULTS: Ratings of stress significantly decreased from pre- to post-testing for pwCF (paired t(14) = -4.06, p < .01) and parents (paired t = -5.2, p < .001). A large percentage of both groups scored in the clinical range for depression and anxiety at baseline (pwCF: depression/anxiety = 71%; parents: depression = 57%; anxiety = 79%); a large proportion (20%-40%) reported moderate to severe symptomatology. Significant reductions in depression for pwCF were found (pre: M = 8.0 to post: M = 4.7; paired t(14) = 2.8, p < .05) but not anxiety (pre: M = 6.9 to post: M = 5.6, t(14) = 1.2, p = NS-non-significant). Parental depression decreased for parents (pre: M = 6.4 to post: M = 5.1, t(14) = -2.5, p < .05), but not anxiety (pre: M = 8.1 to post: M = 7.9, t(14) = -0.2, p = NS). Feasibility and Satisfaction were positive. CONCLUSION: This telehealth intervention yielded reductions in stress and depression for participants. Anxiety did not significantly decrease, possibly because COVID was ongoing. This feasible, satisfactory intervention was effective for improving mental health.","Graziano, Sonia; Boldrini, Francesca; Righelli, Dario; Milo, Francesco; Lucidi, Vincenzina; Quittner, Alexandra; Tabarini, Paola",Pediatr Pulmonol,,167

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study 218 adult patients who had preoperative chest CT and RT-PCR were enrolled. CT imaging results, which have been reported according to the Radiological Society of North America expert consensus on COVID-19, were collected from the picture archiving and communicating system. Demographic data, planned surgeries, and postoperative outcomes were collected from the electronic patient records. RESULTS: One patient (0.5%) showed typical CT features for COVID-19 pneumonia; 12 patients (5.5%) were reported as indeterminate, and eight (3.7%) were reported as atypical for COVID-19 pneumonia. Only one of the three patients with positive RT-PCR had abnormalities on CT. When RT-PCR tests were taken as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of chest CT in showing COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients were 33.3%, 90.7%, and 90.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chest CT screening for COVID-19 has a very low yield in asymptomatic preoperative patients and shows false-positive findings in 9.2% of cases, potentially leading to unnecessary postponing of the surgery.","Gümüs, Terman; Kabaoglu, Zeynep Unal; Coskun, Bilgen; Kartal, Furkan; Artukoglu, Feyzi; Atasoy, Kayhan Cetin",Jpn. j. radiol.

455458,The New Coronavirus COVID-19 Infection,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic requires the rapid isolation of infected patients. Thus, high-sensitivity radiology images could be a key technique to diagnose patients besides the polymerase chain reaction approach. Deep learning algorithms are proposed in several studies to detect COVID-19 symptoms due to the success in chest radiography image classification, cost efficiency, lack of expert radiologists, and the need for faster processing in the pandemic area. Most of the promising algorithms proposed in different studies are based on pre-trained deep learning models. Such open-source models and lack of variation in the radiology image-capturing environment make the diagnosis system vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as fast gradient sign method (FGSM) attack. This study therefore explored the potential vulnerability of pre-trained convolutional neural network algorithms to the FGSM attack in terms of two frequently used models, VGG16 and Inception-v3. Firstly, we developed two transfer learning models for X-ray and CT image-based COVID-19 classification and analyzed the performance extensively in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. Secondly, our study illustrates that misclassification can occur with a very minor perturbation magnitude, such as 0.009 and 0.003 for the FGSM attack in these models for X-ray and CT images, respectively, without any effect on the visual perceptibility of the perturbation. In addition, we demonstrated that successful FGSM attack can decrease the classification performance to 16.67% and 55.56% for X-ray images, as well as 36% and 40% in the case of CT images for VGG16 and Inception-v3, respectively, without any human-recognizable perturbation effects in the adversarial images. Finally, we analyzed that correct class probability of any test image which is supposed to be 1, can drop for both considered models and with increased perturbation;it can drop to 0.24 and 0.17 for the VGG16 model in cases of X-ray and CT images, respectively. Thus, despite the need for data sharing and automated diagnosis, practical deployment of such program requires more robustness.","Pal, Biprodip Gupta Debashis Rashed-Al-Mahfuz Md.; Alyami, Salem A.; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Applied Sciences,,167

Most severely ill COVID-19 patients manifest a hyperactivated immune response, instigated by interleukin 6 (IL6) that triggers a so called ""cytokine storm"" and coagulopathy. Hypoxia is also associated with COVID-19. So far overlooked is the fact that both IL6 and hypoxia depress the abundance of a key anticoagulant, Protein S. We speculate that the IL6-driven cytokine explosion plus hypoxemia causes a severe drop in Protein S level that exacerbates the thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients. Here we highlight a mechanism by which the IL6-hypoxia curse causes a deadly hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients, and we suggest a path to therapy.","Chatterjee, Sabyasachi; Sengupta, Tanusree; Majumder, Samarpan; Majumder, Rinku",Aging (Albany NY),,167

Currently, there is no data regarding TM among MS and NMOSD South American experts. OBJECTIVE: To investigate TM experiences from South American MS and/or NMOSD experts in the follow-up of their patients focusing on TM. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. 141 MS and/or NMOSD experts from Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Brazil were invited to answer an web-based survey. RESULTS: A total of 129 (91.48 %) experts completed the survey. Only 19.4% had experience in TM previous COVID-19 pandemic, while 79.8% are currently using TM, most using video call (52.3%). Using TM, 44.1% of the experts were able to perform neurological examination, 85.6% believed to be able to identify a relapse, 48.6% use Patient Determined Disease Steps and 38.7% kept using the conventional Expanded Disability Status Scale. CONCLUSION: Our survey demonstrates preparedness and responsiveness among South American MS and/or NMOSD experts.

SARS-CoV-2 viruses promote their own spread and virulence by hijacking human proteins, which occurs through viral protein recognition of human targets. To understand the structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 viral-host protein recognition, here we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a complex structure of the human cell junction protein PALS1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope (E) protein. Our reported structure shows that the E protein C-terminal DLLV motif recognizes a pocket formed exclusively by hydrophobic residues from the PDZ and SH3 domains of PALS1. Our structural analysis provides an explanation for the observation that the viral E protein recruits PALS1 from lung epithelial cell junctions. In addition, our structure provides novel targets for peptide- and small-molecule inhibitors that could block the PALS1-E interactions to reduce E-mediated virulence.","Chai, Jin; Cai, Yuanheng; Pang, Changxu; Wang, Liguo; McSweeney, Sean; Shanklin, John; Liu, Qun",Nat Commun,,167
457488,COVID-19 in advanced Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the Netherlands it was noticed that very few blood cultures from COVID-19 patients turned positive with clinically relevant bacteria. This was particularly evident in comparison to the number of positive blood cultures during previous seasonal epidemics of influenza. This observation raised questions about the occurrence and causative microorganisms of bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients, especially in the perspective of the widely reported overuse of antibiotics and the rising rate of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on blood culture results in influenza A, influenza B and COVID-19 patients presenting to two hospitals in the Netherlands. Our main outcome consisted of the percentage of positive blood cultures. The percentage of clinically relevant blood cultures, isolated bacteria and 30-day all-cause mortality served as our secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1331 viral episodes were analysed in 1324 patients. There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.47) in overall occurrence of blood culture positivity in COVID-19 patients (9.0, 95% CI 6.8-11.1) in comparison to influenza A (11.4, 95% CI 7.9-14.8) and influenza B patients (10.4, 95% CI 7.1-13.7,). After correcting for the high rate of contamination, the occurrence of clinically relevant bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients amounted to 1.0% (95% CI 0.3-1.8), which was statistically significantly lower (p = 0.04) compared to influenza A patients (4.0, 95% CI 1.9-6.1) and influenza B patients (3.0, 95% CI 1.2-4.9). The most frequently identified bacterial isolates in COVID-19 patients were Escherichia coli (n = 2) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2). The overall 30-day all-cause mortality for COVID-19 patients was 28.3% (95% CI 24.9-31.7), which was statistically significantly higher (p = <.001) when compared to patients with influenza A (7.1, 95% CI 4.3-9.9) and patients with influenza B (6.4, 95% CI 3.8-9.1). CONCLUSIONS: We report a very low occurrence of community-acquired bacteraemia amongst COVID-19 patients in comparison to influenza patients. These results reinforce current clinical guidelines on antibiotic management in COVID-19, which only advise utilization of antibiotics when a bacterial co-infection is suspected.","Thelen, Julinha M; Buenen, A G Noud; van Apeldoorn, Marjan; Wertheim, Heiman F; Hermans, Mirjam H A; Wever, Peter C",BMC Infect Dis,,167

463941,Hydroxychloroquine-induced creatine kinase elevation,2021,"Introduction: On June 2020, the first case of concurrent Covid-19 and Kawasaki disease (KD) was published. After this first description, further works reported new cases of children affected by KD and KD-like syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical and biochemical features of these patients differed from the historical cohorts of KD, suggesting the possibility of a new multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome. Is still unclear if this new clinical entity, often referred as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), could be considered as part of the KD spectrum or is a new disease with different pathogenic mechanisms and uniquely linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors searched the available literature in MedLine (via Pubmed) with the terms ('coronaviruses' OR 'coronavirus') AND ('Kawasaki disease') for English studies without any temporal limit. Areas covered: This review aims to comprehensively describe multisystem inflammatory syndromes affecting children during Coronaviruses outbreak, and to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of human Coronaviridae in KD and KD-like syndromes. Expert opinion: An increased incidence of PIMS-TS, during the Covid-19 pandemic has been reported, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a severe hyper-inflammatory syndrome in childhood. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease are still unclear. Based on these findings, SARS-CoV-2 may be considered another trigger in the complex mosaic about the relationship among infectious agents and the occurrence of systemic hyper-inflammation related syndromes.","Berardicurti, Onorina; Conforti, Alessandro; Ruscitti, Piero; Cipriani, Paola; Giacomelli, Roberto",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,167

However, the OAM states of magnons (spin waves)$-$the building block of modern magnetism$-$and particularly their implications have yet to be addressed. Here, we theoretically investigate the twisted spin-wave generation and propagation in magnetic nanocylinders. The OAM nature of magnons is uncovered by showing that the spin-wave eigenmode is also the eigenstate of the OAM operator in the confined geometry. Inspired by optical tweezers, we predict an exotic""magnetic tweezer""effect by showing skyrmion gyrations under twisted magnons in exchange coupled nanocylinder$|$nanodisk heterostructure, as a practical demonstration of magnonic OAM to manipulate topological spin defects. Our study paves the way for the emerging magnetic manipulations by harnessing the OAM degree of freedom of magnons.","Jiang, Y.; Yuan, H. Y.; Li, Z.-X.; Wang, Zhenyu; Zhang, H.

In the present study, we aimed to screen microRNA (miRNA) markers in serum exosomes for differential diagnosis of high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma using high-throughput sequencing technology. Methods: Patients with intracranial lymphoma or high-grade glioma and healthy controls were included in this study (training cohort (n = 10) and validation cohort: intracranial lymphoma (n = 10), high-grade glioma (n = 32), and healthy controls (n = 20)). After RNA was extracted from serum exosomes, the high-throughput sequencing was used to determine the expression profiles of serum exosomal miRNAs and screen the differentially expressed miRNAs. RT-qPCR was used to verify the expressions of the selected miRNAs. The differences of miRNA expressions between groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The diagnostic value was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that 170 miRNAs, including 109 upregulated ones and 61 downregulated ones, were differentially expressed in serum exosomes between the patients with intracranial lymphoma and high-grade glioma. Compared with the healthy controls, the number of differential serum exosomal miRNAs in the high-grade glioma group and intracranial lymphoma group was 130 and 173, respectively. RT-qPCR proved that both miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p were significantly downregulated in high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma patients compared with the healthy controls (all p < 0.001), and the expression of serum exosomal miR-766-5p in the intracranial lymphoma group was lower compared with the high-grade glioma group (p < 0.05). The areas under ROC curve (AUCs) of serum exosomal miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p for the diagnosis of glioma were 0.8883 (p < 0.001) and 0.7688 (p = 0.001), respectively, and they were 0.9271 (p < 0.001) and 0.8542 (p < 0.001), respectively, for the diagnosis of intracranial lymphoma. Moreover, the AUC value of serum exosomal miR-766-5p for the differential diagnosis of glioma and intracranial lymphoma was 0.7201 (p = 0.026). Conclusions: miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p in serum exosomes might be used as auxiliary diagnostic indicators for high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma, and miR-766-5p might be used as a differential diagnostic marker for both diseases.","Wang, Shun; Xu, Zhenkuan; Zhang, Chao; Yu, Rui; Jiang, Jun; Wang, Chengwei; Qu, Chuncheng",Biomed Res Int,,167

It is of interest in Pediatrics because of its implications for perinatal and postnatal morbidity and mortality. Predicting birth length will be useful in anticipating and managing possible complications associated with pregnancy and birth of babies with abnormal birth length. Objective: The aim was to identify easily accessible parental determinants of baby's birth length in Lagos, Nigeria, using a sample of patients attending a government hospital. Methods: Parental anthropometrics and other data were obtained from 250 couples by actual measurements, oral interviews and questionnaires. Baby's birth length was measured immediately after delivery by qualified, a well-trained obstetric nurse, and association between parental and offspring parameters were assessed. Results: Weight gain, maternal weight, parity and mid-parental height were the significant parental explanatory variables of offspring birth length. They were the most suitable variables for a generated model for predicting babies' birth length from parental variables in the study. Conclusion: A model that might be useful for predicting babies' birth length from easily accessible parental variables was produced. This model may complement ultrasonographic data for predicting baby's birth length with a view to achieving better perinatal and postnatal care.","Taiwo, Idowu Adewumi; Adeleye, Adenike; Uzoma, Ijeoma Chinwe",Afr Health Sci,,167
468832,Active Therapy with Passive Immunotherapy May Be Effective in the Fight against COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Vocal fold movement impairment (VFMI) in infants and children is most commonly evaluated by flexible nasolaryngoscopy (FNL). FNL in this population can be challenging due to movement, floppy supraglottic structures, or secretions. Laryngeal ultrasound (LUS) may be an alternative, less invasive means of evaluating VFMI that also decreases aerosolization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to examine LUS interpretation proficiency for VFMI via an educational module. A secondary outcome was to determine whether quantitative measurements increase interpretation accuracy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort trial. METHODS: Medical students, residents, fellows, faculty, and staff were recruited to complete the module, composed of a 13-minute teaching video followed by 20 cases. Participants determined both qualitatively (subjective assessment) and then quantitatively (through protractor measurements of the vocal fold to arytenoid angle) whether there was normal versus impaired vocal fold mobility. RESULTS: Thirty participants completed the LUS training module, and about one-third were otolaryngology residents. On average, each participant correctly identified 18 cases. The mean rank percent correct for quantitative measurements was significantly higher than that of qualitative interpretations (P < .0001). Measurements significantly caused participants to change their answer correctly compared to incorrectly (P < .0001). As the module progressed, there was no significant trend of more correct interpretations (P = .30). The sensitivity was higher for quantitative interpretations (89.0% vs. 87.3%) but specificity remained unchanged (92.6%). CONCLUSION: Quantitative measurements may increase LUS interpretation accuracy. There was not a specific number of cases interpreted to achieve learning proficiency. LUS is an easily learned method to evaluate for VFMI across all training levels.

To date, there are no centralized or compiled international COVID-19 guidelines for oculoplastic surgeons. METHODS: We examined COVID-19 guidelines published by oculoplastic societies worldwide. All countries around the world were initially considered in this study, but only 9 oculoplastic societies met the inclusion criteria: (1) publicly available guidelines displayed on the oculoplastic society's website, or (2) guidelines received from the oculoplastic society after contacting them twice using the contact information on their website. RESULTS: The 9 oculoplastic societies examined include: the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the British Oculoplastic Surgery Society, the Canadian Society of Oculoplastic Surgery, the European Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, la Sociedad Española de Cirugía Plástica Ocular y Orbitaria, la Asociación Colombiana de Cirugía Plastica Ocular, the Asia Pacific Society of Ophthalmic Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery, the Oculoplastics Association of India, and the Philippine Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. They all agree that urgent procedures should not be delayed, while non-necessary procedures (including all elective clinic services) should be postponed. When adequate protective equipment is available, oculoplastic surgeons must treat urgent cases. Eight out of 9 societies have provided recommendations on personal protective equipment use in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to adequately protect mucous membranes. Other recommendations provided by certain societies are related to shelter in place measures, hand hygiene and surface disinfection protocols, patient triage, and thyroid eye disease management. CONCLUSIONS: All 9 societies with published recommendations have provided valuable recommendations to their members, regarding urgency of care and infection control solutions (personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, telemedicine, and social isolation).","Nguyen, Anne X; Gervasio, Kalla A; Wu, Albert Y",Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,,167
469878,Anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19: A systematic review [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review],2020,"Influence competition finds its significance in many applications, such as marketing, politics and public events like COVID-19. Existing work tends to believe that the stronger influence will always win and dominate nearly the whole network, i.e.,""winner takes all"". However, this finding somewhat contradicts with our common sense that many competing products are actually coexistent, e.g., Android vs. iOS. This contradiction naturally raises the question: will the winner take all? To answer this question, we make a comprehensive study into influence competition by identifying two factors frequently overlooked by prior art: (1) the incomplete observation of real diffusion networks; (2) the existence of information overload and its impact on user behaviors. To this end, we attempt to recover possible diffusion links based on user similarities, which are extracted by embedding users into a latent space. Following this, we further derive the condition under which users will be overloaded, and formulate the competing processes where users' behaviors differ before and after information overload. By establishing the explicit expressions of competing dynamics, we disclose that information overload acts as the critical""boundary line"", before which the""winner takes all""phenomenon will definitively occur, whereas after information overload the share of influences gradually stabilizes and is jointly affected by their initial spreading conditions, influence powers and the advent of overload. Numerous experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical results where favorable agreement is found. Our work sheds light on the intrinsic driving forces behind real-world dynamics, thus providing useful insights into effective information engineering.","Feng, Chen; Sun, Jiahui; Fu, Luiyi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14086v1.pdf,167

The inhibition of viral entry and thus spread is a plausible therapeutic avenue. SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor-mediated entry into a human host via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in lung tissue as well as the oral and nasal mucosa, kidney, testes and gastrointestinal tract. The modulation of ACE2 levels in these gateway tissues may be an effective strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility. Cannabis sativa, especially those high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to alter gene expression and inflammation and harbour anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its effects on ACE2 expression remain unknown. Working under a Health Canada research license, we developed over 800 new C. sativa cultivars and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to down-regulate ACE2 expression in target COVID-19 tissues. Using artificial 3D human models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high-CBD C. sativa extracts that decrease ACE2 protein levels. Some C. sativa extracts down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. While our most effective extracts require further large-scale validation, our study is important for future analyses of the effects of medical cannabis on COVID-19. The extracts of our most successful novel high-CBD C. sativa lines, pending further investigation, may become a useful and safe addition to the prevention/treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy.","Wang, Bo; Kovalchuk, Anna; Li, Dongping; Rodriguez-Juarez, Rocio; Ilnytskyy, Yaroslav; Kovalchuk, Igor; Kovalchuk, Olga",Aging (Albany NY),,167

470517,Statins and other drugs: Facing COVID-19 as a vascular disease,2020,"The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae), represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardization for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a 387 nt region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with whole-genome analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses are sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, MyCoV, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.","Wilkinson, David A; Joffrin, Léa; Lebarbenchon, Camille; Mavingui, Patrick",,,167

Initially, the key construct of the RADx Tech Deployment Core was helping companies manufacture, commercialize, and develop a digital infrastructure for the purpose of SARS-CoV-2 testing and reporting. However, the team and RADx Tech leadership soon realized that the larger infrastructure to deploy testing in non-clinical environments was nonexistent and that wrap-around services were required to build the necessary bridge between manufacturing and end users. Furthermore, the unique communities that required testing (e.g., manufacturing plants, transportation hubs, K-12 schools, etc.) had different infrastructure requirements and outsized needs for education and support around testing plan implementation. The Deployment Core, therefore, quickly scaled a team to help to complete the picture and provide guidance to end users and ultimately help shape public policy around a useful data model.","Walsh, Brian Hosoi Annette Kingsley Manuel Moreira Susan Ramakrishnan Sreeram Tessier Paul Gagliano Nancy",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,,167
471471,Understanding Obesity: The Role of Adipose Tissue Microenvironment and the Gut Microbiome,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Delayed second dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination trades maximal effectiveness for a lower level of immunity across more of the population. We investigated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses to a single dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. DESIGN: Antibody responses and seroconversion rates in infliximab-treated patients (n=865) were compared with a cohort treated with vedolizumab (n=428), a gut-selective anti-integrin &#945;4ß7 monoclonal antibody. Our primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations, measured using the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody assay 3-10 weeks after vaccination, in patients without evidence of prior infection. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion rates (defined by a cut-off of 15 U/mL), and antibody responses following past infection or a second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. RESULTS: Geometric mean (SD) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were lower in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following BNT162b2 (6.0 U/mL (5.9) vs 28.8 U/mL (5.4) p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4.7 U/mL (4.9)) vs 13.8 U/mL (5.9) p<0.0001) vaccines. In our multivariable models, antibody concentrations were lower in infliximab-treated compared with vedolizumab-treated patients who received the BNT162b2 (fold change (FC) 0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.40), p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (FC 0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.51), p<0.0001) vaccines. In both models, age &#8805;60 years, immunomodulator use, Crohn's disease and smoking were associated with lower, while non-white ethnicity was associated with higher, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations. Seroconversion rates after a single dose of either vaccine were higher in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to a single dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a second dose of vaccine, led to seroconversion in most patients. Delayed second dosing should be avoided in patients treated with infliximab.

473874,Equity in vaccine trials for higher weight people? Protocol for a rapid review of inclusion and exclusion criteria for higher weight people in clinical trials for COVID-19,2021,"Since the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide and has caused severe health and economic issues on a global scale. By the end of February 2021, more than 100 million SARS-CoV-2 cases had been reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be divided into three phases: An early phase with fever and cough (phase I), a pulmonary vascular disease (phase II) and a hyperinflammatory syndrome (phase III). Since viral replication plays a particularly important role in the early stage of the disease and the patient's immune system in the later course of infection, different therapeutic options arise depending on the stage of the disease. The antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir is the only antiviral compound with conditional approval in the European Union. Treatment with remdesivir should be initiated early (within the first seven days of symptom onset) in patients receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive ventilation. In turn, the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone should be administered later in the course of disease in patients receiving oxygen therapy. Since autopsies indicate an increased frequency of thromboembolic events due to COVID-19, additional treatment with anticoagulants is recommended. Since the development of novel antivirals may take years, the application of convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the treatment of COVID-19 is reasonable. However, large-scale studies indicated low efficacy of convalescent plasma. Furthermore, vaccination of the population is essential to control the pandemic. Currently, the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran from BioNTech and Pfizer, the mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna as well as the vector vaccine AZD1222 from AstraZeneca are licensed in the European Union. All three vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in large clinical trials. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many others are being tested in clinical trials. In the present article, an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19 as well as vaccines for protection against SARS-CoV-2 is provided.","Bormann, Maren; van de Sand, Lukas; Witzke, Oliver; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,,167

Additionally to these functional roles, T and B-cell lymphocytes rely on the diversity of their receptor chains to recognize different pathogens. The lymphocyte subclasses emerge from common ancestors generated with the same diversity of receptors during selection processes. Here we leverage biophysical models of receptor generation with machine learning models of selection to identify specific sequence features characteristic of functional lymphocyte repertoires and subrepertoires. Specifically using only repertoire level sequence information, we classify CD4$^+$ and CD8$^+$ T-cells, find correlations between receptor chains arising during selection and identify T-cells subsets that are targets of pathogenic epitopes. We also show examples of when simple linear classifiers do as well as more complex machine learning methods.","Isacchini, Giulio; Walczak, Aleksandra M; Mora, Thierry; Nourmohammad, Armita",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03112v1.pdf,167
474843,"Herbal medicine, a reliable support in COVID therapy",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To examine cardiovascular responses to medical (MED) and fire (FIRE) alarm tones in firefighters. METHODS: Heart rate was collected throughout 24-h shifts (N = 41). Call logs were utilized post hoc to identify heart rate at the time the alarm sounded (TIMETONE), peak heart rate following the alarm (TIMEPEAK), and heart rate at the time of station departure (TIMEDEPART) for MED and FIRE calls. A 2X3 (TONE x TIME) split-plot mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significant differences tests examined the influence of tone type on heart rate, expressed as a percent of age estimated maximum. Bivariate Pearson correlations examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and TIMEPEAK and TIMEDEPART. An alpha of 0.05 determined statistical significance and Bonferroni Corrections were applied to post hoc comparisons (p < 0.017). RESULTS: Follow-up analyses for the significant 2 × 3 repeated-measures ANOVA (p = 0.035) indicated differences in heart rate for MED (p < 0.001) and FIRE (p < 0.001) where TIMETONE < TIMEPEAK, TIMETONE < TIMEDEPART, and TIMEPEAK > TIMEDEPART. There was a non-significant simple effect of time for MED and FIRE at TIMETONE (p = 0.259), but significant effects of tone type where FIRE > MED at TIMEPEAK (p < 0.001) and TIMEDEPART (p = 0.002). There was a significant small positive relationship between BMI and TIMEPEAK (p = 0.002) and TIMEDEPART (p < 0.001) for MED only. CONCLUSIONS: Alarms increased heart rates to a greater extent in FIRE than MED calls. Higher BMI was related to greater heart rate responses in MED but was unrelated to FIRE response.","Marciniak, Rudi A; Tesch, Cody J; Ebersole, Kyle T",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,,167

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)-mediated tumorigenesis and provide a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting the EBV DNA genome. We found that LMP1 upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³) coactivator-1ß (PGC1ß) through activation of nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B). Furthermore, the activated PGC1ß upregulated the expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) through the coactivation of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and GA-binding protein &#945; (GABP&#945;), preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated base incision in the EBV genome and favoring its survival. Interruption of hexokinase domain component 1 (HKDC1) by either shRNA or Tf-D-HKC8 peptide suppressed the interaction of HKDC1 with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), triggering mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive generation of ROS, thus resulting in EBV suppression through ROS-mediated DNA damage. Suppression of the EBV genome inhibited the expression of the LMP1/PGC1ß/HKDC1/OGG1 signaling pathway, forming a positive feed forward loop for the generation of ROS, hence inhibiting the EBV genome and subsequent EBV-associated tumor development. We concluded that LMP1 triggers EBV-associated tumorigenesis through activation of the PGC1ß pathway. This study provided a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EBV-associated tumors by targeting HKDC1.","Feng, Jia; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Ping; Huang, Xiaodong; Xie, Weiguo; Zhang, Hongyu; Yao, Paul",,,167

478195,Acute Hemorrhagic Encephalitis Related to COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The WHO estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 1.3 million deaths (1 377 395) globally (as of November 2020). This surge in death necessitates identification of resource needs and relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Our aim was to develop a generic computer model that could estimate resources required for end-of-life (EoL) care delivery during the pandemic. SETTING: A discrete event simulation model was developed and used to estimate resourcing needs for a geographical area in the South West of England. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. PARTICIPANTS: We used the model to estimate resourcing needs for a population of around 1 million people. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The model predicts the per-day 'staff' and 'stuff' resourcing required to meet a given level of incoming EoL care activity. RESULTS: A mean of 11.97 hours of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night sits will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths based on the model prediction. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day. An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps could be needed to be in use per day. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis for a large region in the South West of England shows the significant additional physical and human resource required to relieve suffering at the EoL as part of a pandemic response.","Chalk, Daniel; Robbins, Sara; Kandasamy, Rohan; Rush, Kate; Aggarwal, Ajay; Sullivan, Richard; Chamberlain, Charlotte",BMJ Open,,167

METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequently underwent non-contrast enhanced chest CT between October 10 and December 10, 2020. Hepatic attenuation values were measured from Couinaud segments 2, 4, and 8 based on the CT images and the relationships between these values and the Pneumonia Severity Score (PSS), requirement of hospitalization, and the length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 414 patients (182 were female, 43.96%), among whom 106 (25.6%) were diagnosed with hepatosteatosis (HS). In the patients with HS, the PSS scores were higher (10.8 ± 4.96 vs. 8.07 ± 5.12; p < 0.001), and 69 (65%) received inpatient care. Moreover, the number of HS patients who received inpatient care was 1.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-3.15, p < 0.003) times higher than that of the non-HS patients. No significant difference was found between the HS and non-HS patients with regard to the length of hospital or ICU stay. CONCLUSION: HS can be easily evaluated using non-contrast enhanced chest CT in COVID-19 patients and can be used as a prognostic marker to determine the requirement of hospitalization.","Çorapli, Mahmut; Çil, Ercan; Oktay, Cemil; Kaçmaz, Hüseyin; Çorapli, Gökhan; Bulut, Haci Taner",Clin Imaging,,167

482040,Telemedicine in neurology: current evidence,2020,"Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Over the years, different therapeutic modalities have been adopted depending on tumor stage and patient characteristics, such as surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy. Recently, with the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), the treatment of metastatic and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has experienced a revolution that has resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival with an enhanced toxicity profile. Despite this paradigm shift, most patients present some kind of resistance to ICI. In this setting, current research is shifting towards the integration of multiple therapies, with RT and ICI being one of the most promising based on the potential immunostimulatory synergy of this combination. This review gives an overview of the evolution and current state of the combination of RT and ICI and provides evidence-based data that can improve patient selection. The combination in lung cancer is a safe therapeutic approach that improves local control and progression-free survival, and it has the potential to unleash abscopal responses. Additionally, this treatment strategy seems to be able to re-sensitize select patients that have reached a state of resistance to ICI, further enabling the continuation of systemic therapy.","Chicas-Sett, Rodolfo; Zafra-Martin, Juan; Morales-Orue, Ignacio; Castilla-Martinez, Juan; Berenguer-Frances, Miguel A; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Elisa; Rodriguez-Abreu, Delvys; Couñago, Felipe",,,167
482241,Potential TRPV1 blockade to treat severe lung dysfunction in COVID-19 infection,2020,"Exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens is unavoidable Yet, the mere presence of these threats is not enough to automatically predispose to illness The susceptibility of an individual to viral or bacterial infections is dependent upon immune competence Many factors can interfere with the functioning of the immune system Epigenetic alterations in the form of lifestyle or environmental factors can lead to impaired immunity For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19 Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion Melatonin has been found to have antiviral and immune-enhancing effects, and it has been proposed that this hormone may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients Zinc and vitamins D and C have also been well studied for their ability to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections, and vitamin D has been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients Cannabidiol can both directly and indirectly improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, reducing inflammation, and relieving stress Other dietary supplements backed by solid scientific evidence to show they act as immune enhancers are astragalus, a yeast fermentate (EpiCor®), olive leaf extract, berberine, N-acetyl cysteine, and garlic","Meletis, C.

METHODS: We used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2014-2017 which included 2,888 pregnant women 18 years or older. The WHODAS instrument was utilized to measure disability as the degree of functional impairment due to emotional/behavioral problems experienced by the respondent. Multinomial logistic regression models were built to assess the magnitude and direction of the association between severity of mental health-related disability with opioid use and abuse/dependency in the past year. RESULTS: Approximately 30% of pregnant women suffered from moderate/severe mental health-related disability, and 2% reported opioid abuse/dependency. Compared to those with no opioid use, the odds of opioid use in the past year for individuals with moderate/severe mental health-related disability were 1.73 (95% CI 1.36, 2.21) times higher than those with no/mild disability. Similarly, the odds of opioid abuse/dependency were at least three times higher (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.80, 6.84) among those with moderate/severe mental health-related disability relative to pregnant women with no/mild disability. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider screening for both opioid use and mental health conditions and related disabilities using screening tools such as the WHODAS during the initial prenatal visits.","Kitsantas, Panagiota; Adams, Amy R; Cheema, Jehanzeb; Kornides, Melanie L",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,167

Wastage occurs at all stages from harvesting to the consumer, calling for advanced techniques of food preservation. Wastage is mainly due to presence of moisture and microbial organisms present in food. Microbes can be killed or deactivated, and cross-contamination by microbes such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) should be avoided. Moisture removal may not be feasible in all cases. Preservation methods include thermal, electrical, chemical and radiation techniques. Here, we review the advanced food preservation techniques, with focus on fruits, vegetables, beverages and spices. We emphasize electrothermal, freezing and pulse electric field methods because they allow both pathogen reduction and improvement of nutritional and physicochemical properties. Ultrasound technology and ozone treatment are suitable to preserve heat sensitive foods.

Few studies assessed the psychophysical impact of COVID-19 on chronically ill children. This study examined these effects on children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) and their caregivers. Seventy-one patients (7-13 years) with T1D and their caregivers were administered a survey created ad hoc and some standardized questionnaires, assessing psychological well-being and anxiety. Medical data (physical and biochemical characteristics) were recorded before (T0, January-February) and after (T1, May-June) the lockdown. Paired Student t-test, Spearman two-tailed correlations, and a linear regression model were used for statistical analysis. Children at T1 showed higher BMI (body mass index), daily total and basal insulin dose, and time spent in therapeutic range, and they showed lower HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), time spent above the therapeutic range, and standard deviations of the mean glucose values than at T0. A total of 32.9% scored in the clinical range for separation anxiety. The increase in separation anxiety was predicted by younger age, female gender, more recent T1D diagnosis, less time spent in therapeutic range at T1, and higher perceived fear of COVID-19 infection. In a pandemic context, separation anxiety may be stronger in younger females, with more recent T1D diagnosis and poor metabolic control, thus affecting the parent's ability to manage diabetes and to support children's autonomy.","Di Riso, Daniela; Bertini, Simone; Spaggiari, Silvia; Olivieri, Francesca; Zaffani, Silvana; Comerlati, Lara; Marigliano, Marco; Piona, Claudia; Maffeis, Claudio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,167

Three hundred and forty-four individuals (&#8805;18 years and 67% women) answered a self-reported online survey that included questions related to the physical exercise practice (e.g., supervised and remote) during social distancing and questions about perceptions of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated [MADRS-S] scores) and metabolic equivalent task minutes per week (METs minâ¢wk-1) of moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA scores (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form) before and during social distancing. The RSE group (n=45) showed higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA than the SGE (n=146) and NE (n=109) groups. The RSE and FFE (n=44) groups showed higher METs of the total PA scores than the SGE and NE groups. The NE group showed higher MADRS-S scores than the other groups. Lower MADRS-S scores depend on the exercise practice and higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA depend on the supervised exercise practice. Thus, telehealth interventions can be implemented during the pandemic to enhance vigorous PA.","Moreira-Neto, Acácio; Martins, Bruce; Miliatto, Angelo; Nucci, Mariana Penteado; Silva-Batista, Carla",Psychiatry Res,,167

We examined the possible complementary role of laboratory-developed class-specific clinical serology in assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. Serological tests for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated using samples from real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)-confirmed inpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. We analyzed the influence of timing and clinical severity on the diagnostic value of class-specific COVID-19 serology testing. Cross-sectional analysis revealed higher sensitivity and specificity at lower optical density cutoffs for IgA in hospitalized patients than for IgG and IgM serology (IgG area under the curve [AUC] of 0.91 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.89 to 0.93] versus IgA AUC of 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98] versus IgM AUC of 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97]). The enhanced performance of IgA serology was apparent in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset and the first week after PCR testing. In patients requiring intubation, all three tests exhibit enhanced sensitivity. Among PCR-negative patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 out of 61 showed clear evidence of seroconversion IgG, IgA, and IgM. Suspected false-positive results in the latter population were most frequently observed in IgG and IgM serology tests. Our findings suggest the potential utility of IgA serology in the acute setting and explore the benefits and limitations of class-specific serology as a complementary diagnostic tool to PCR for COVID-19 in the acute setting.","Verkerke, Hans; Horwath, Michael; Saeedi, Bejan; Boyer, Darra; Allen, Jerry W; Owens, Joshua; Arthur, Connie M; Nakahara, Hirotomo; Rha, Jennifer; Patel, Kashyap; Wu, Shang-Chuen; Paul, Anu; Yasin, Nini; Wang, Jianmei; Shin, Sooncheon; Brown, DeAndre; Normile, Katherine; Cole, Lisa; Meyers, Mark; Lin, Heather; Woods, Emily; Isaac, Jennifer; Broder, Kari; Wade, Jenna; Kauffman, Robert C; Patel, Ravi; Josephson, Cassandra D; Reynolds, Stacian; Sherman, Melanie; Wrammert, Jens; Alter, David; Guarner, Jeannette; Roback, John D; Neish, Andrew; Stowell, Sean R",J. clin. microbiol,,167

In 2017, APSIG moved to the ACPSEM's charity, the Better Healthcare Technology (BHT) Foundation, enabling improvement in fundraising, marketing and partnerships with like-minded organizations. METHODS: APSIG's main activity is to recruit certified medical physicists as volunteers to train local staff in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Mongolia. APSIG also supports remote mentoring, coordinates the delivery of donated radiotherapy equipment, and brings Asia-Pacific medical physicists to Australia and New Zealand for conferences and hospital training. RESULTS: The number of APSIG volunteer assignments has been steadily increasing over the last decade. Challenges include the limited number of ACPSEM certified medical physics volunteers, the limited opportunities to train the local physicists due to their heavy workloads, and language barriers. The COVID-19 pandemic has halted volunteer assignments for now but a range of alternative means of assistance such as webinars, online tutorials and virtual meetings are planned to continue APSIG's activities. CONCLUSION: APSIG will continue to provide a support service to radiation oncology staff in the Asia-Pacific region. APSIG and the BHT Foundation's work promotes quality health care by supporting medical physicists in Asia-Pacific countries and championing better radiotherapy technology access and treatment knowledge sharing.","Downes, Simon; Ralston, Anna",J. med. imaging radiat. oncol.

The privacy implications of such apps have been discussed both in academic circles and the general population. The discussion in Germany focused on the trade-off between a centralized or decentralized approach for data collection and processing and their implications. Specifically, privacy dominated the public debate about the proposed “Corona-Warn-App.” This paper presents a study with a quota sample of the German population (n = 744) to assess what the population knew about the soon-to-be-released app and their willingness to use it. We also presented participants potential properties the app could have and asked them how these would affect their usage intention. Based on our findings, we discuss our participants' views on privacy and functionality, including their perception of selected centralized and decentralized features. We also examine a wide range of false beliefs and information that was not communicated successfully. Especially technical details, such as that the app would use Bluetooth, as opposed to location services, were unknown to many participants. Our results give insights on the complicated relationship of trust in the government and public communication on the population's willingness to adopt the app. © is held by the author/owner.

Reclassifying (switching) medicines from prescription to non-prescription can reduce pressure on health resources and aid timely access to medicines. Since Austria is less progressive in this area than many other countries, this research aimed to elucidate enablers and barriers to it reclassifying medicines and make recommendations for change in the context of similar research conducted elsewhere. METHODS: Qualitative research using a heuristic approach was conducted in Austria in 2018. Informed by their own ""insider"" and ""outsider"" knowledge, the authors identified themes from personal interviews with 24 participants, including reclassification committee members, government officials and stakeholders, before comparing these themes with earlier research findings. RESULTS: Significant barriers to reclassification included committee conservatism, minimal political support, medical negativity and few company applications. Insufficient transparency about committee decisions, expectations of adverse committee decisions and a limited market discouraged company applications. Austria's 'social partnership' arrangement and consensus decision making aided a conservative approach, but the regulator and an alternative non-committee switch process were enabling. Pharmacy showed mixed interest in reclassification. Suggested improvements include increasing transparency, committee composition changes, encouraging a more evidence-based approach by the committee, more pharmacy undergraduate clinical training, and companies using scientific advisory meetings and submitting high quality applications. CONCLUSION: Removing barriers to reclassification would facilitate non-prescription availability of medicines and encourage self-care, and could reduce pressure on healthcare resources.","Gauld, Natalie J; Baumgärtel, Christoph A; Buetow, Stephen A",PLoS One,,167

Perturbation of micronutrients has been broadly reported to be a common characteristic in patients with ALD, given the fact that micronutrients often act as composition or coenzymes of many biochemical enzymes responsible for the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and cell proliferation. Mapping the metabolic pattern and the function of these micronutrients is a prerequisite before targeted intervention can be delivered in clinical practice. Recent years have registered a significant improvement in our understanding of the role of micronutrients on the pathogenesis and progression of ALD. However, how and to what extent these micronutrients are involved in the pathophysiology of ALD remains largely unknown. In the current study, we provide a review of recent studies that investigated the imbalance of micronutrients in patients with ALD with a focus on zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, selenium, vitamin D and vitamin E, and determine how disturbances in micronutrients relates to the pathophysiology of ALD. Overall, zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and vitamin E uniformly exhibited a deficiency, and iron demonstrated an elevated trend. While for copper, both an elevation and deficiency were observed from existing literature. More importantly, we also highlight several challenges in terms of low sample size, study design discrepancies, sample heterogeneity across studies, and the use of machine learning approaches.","Wu, Jing; Meng, Qing-Hua",World J Gastroenterol,,167

Objective: To review immune changes brought along by each of these entities and how they might interrelate. Methods: We start presenting a brief review of the structure of the new coronavirus and how it alters the functioning of the human immune system. Subsequently, we describe the immune changes induced by AIT and how these changes could be favorable or unfavorable in the allergic patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a particular point of time during the evolving infection. Results: We describe how a healthy immune response against SARS-CoV-2 develops, versus an immune response that is initially suppressed by the virus, but ultimately overactivated, leading to an excessive production of cytokines (cytokine-storm-like). These changes are then linked to the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patient. Reviewing the immune changes secondary to AIT, it becomes clear how AIT is capable of restoring a healthy innate immunity. Investigators have previously shown that the frequency of respiratory infections is reduced in allergic patients treated with AIT. On the other hand it also increases immunoregulation. Conclusion: As there are many variables involved, it is hard to predict how AIT could influence the allergic patient's reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In any case, AIT is likely to be beneficial for the patient with allergic rhinitis and/or allergic asthma in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as controlling allergic diseases leads to a reduced need for contact with healthcare professionals. The authors remind the reader that everything in this article is still theoretical, since at the moment, there are no published clinical trials on the outcome of COVID-19 in allergic patients under AIT.","Larenas-Linnemann, Désirée E; Ortega-Martell, José A; Blandón-Vijil, María V; Rodríguez-Pérez, Noel; Luna-Pech, Jorge A; Estrada-Cardona, Alan; Arias-Cruz, Alfredo; Del Rio-Navarro, Blanca E; Rodríguez, Elsy M Navarrete; Pozo-Beltrán, Cesar F; Takane, Ernesto Onuma; Rojo-Gutiérrez, María I; Espinosa-Rosales, Francisco J; Martínez-Infante, Eric A",Allergy Asthma Proc,,167
497558,"Response to Comment on ""ApoE e4e4 Genotype and Mortality With COVID-19 in UK Biobank"" by Kuo et al",2020,"Since COVID-19 has emerged as a word public health problem, attention has been focused on how immune suppressive drugs used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders influence the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we discuss the disease-modifying agents approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) within this context. Interferon (IFN)-ï¢1a and -1b, which display antiviral activity, could be protective in the early stage of COVID-19 infection, although SARS-CoV-2 may have developed resistance to IFNs. However, in the hyper inflammation stage, IFNs may become detrimental by facilitating macrophage invasion in the lung and other organs. Glatiramer acetate and its analogues should not interfere with the development of COVID-19 and may be considered safe. Teriflunomide, a first-line oral drug used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) may display antiviral activity by depleting cellular nucleotides necessary for viral replication. The other first-line drug, dimethyl fumarate, may afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 by activating the Nrf-2 pathway and reinforcing the cellular defences against oxidative stress. Concern has been raised on the use of second-line treatments for MS during COVID-19 pandemic. However, this concern is not always justified. For example, fingolimod, might be highly beneficial during the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19 for a number of mechanisms including the reinforcement of the endothelial barrier. Caution is suggested for the use of natalizumab, cladribine, alemtuzumab, and ocrelizumab, although MS disease recurrence after discontinuation of these drugs may overcome a potential risk for COVID-19 infection.","Alborghetti, Marika; Bellucci, Gianmarco; Gentile, Antonietta; Calderoni, Chiara; Nicoletti, Ferdinando; Capra, Ruggero; Salvetti, Marco; Centonze, Diego",Curr. neuropharmacol,,167

499485,COVID-19 in a Face Transplant Patient,2021,"Rationale: Individuals recovering from COVID-19 may have prolonged symptoms and functional limitations well after the acute illness has subsided. Pulmonary rehabilitation, with its interdisciplinary, holistic approach to individuals with complex and systematic manifestations from chronic respiratory disease may be a platform to provide comprehensive healthcare to these patients. Methods: We did a structured telephone interview and review of medical records from a random sample of patients discharged home from our hospital approximately five months after a COVID-19 hospitalization this spring. This was a hypothesis-generating study. Data categories included: 1) Demographics;2) Acute disease severity markers;3) Dyspnea (Modified MRC);4) A structured review of systems (ROS);and 5) Generic heath status (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form -12, Version 1). The SF-12 has 8 domains and physical and mental composite scores (PCS and MCS, respectively). Results: In our sample of 26 patients, 65% were male, age (mean ± SD) was 60 ± 16 years, hospital length of stay was 5.6 ± 3.5 days, interval from discharge to telephone contact was 154 ± 34 days, 85% had pneumonia, and 42% required &gt; 4 L/min supplemental oxygen. The most common positive ROS categories were: (% for each) dyspnea (50), cognitive impairment (38), fatigue (27), and sleepiness (24). The MRC (range, 0-4 with higher scores indicating more dyspnea) was 0.87 ± 1.00, corresponding to breathlessness hurrying or walking up a slight hill;27% were MRC2 or higher. SF-12 Composite and its 8 domain scores for the sample are given in Table 1. Comparative reference values for these variables from a large sample are provided. Conclusions: Patients discharged from the hospital following COVID-19 infection approximately five months earlier had, on average, mild-to-moderate MRC dyspnea and mild-to-moderate impairments in general health status. It is uncertain whether these abnormalities are residual effects of the remote COVID -19 infection or represent unrelated medical or mental problems. Limitations of our study include its small size and potential selection bias from evaluating those discharged directly to home from the hospital. Based on these observations, pulmonary rehabilitation would not be uniformly indicated months after hospital discharge for COVID-19. However, in view of the considerable variability in dyspnea and health status, the intervention would be reasonable in selected patients with more substantial limitations.","Shahzad, H.; Reardon, J.; Congrete, S.; ZuWallack, R.

In response to in-person visit restrictions, our institution trained &gt;1,000 clinicians in telemedicine. Little is known about telemedicine-naïve pediatric healthcare provider's perceptions as they adopted telemedicine practice. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of clinicians after expanding telemedicine practice at an independent children's hospital. The survey assessed experience with, concerns about, and intentions to continue telemedicine. Outpatient providers were included if they were first trained for telemedicine in response to COVID-19 and conducted at least one video visit, 3/21/2020-6/30/2020. Descriptive statistics were calculated;perceptions were compared across telemedicine activity level quartiles (based on proportions of visits delivered by video in June 2020) using Fisher's exact tests. Results: Of 609 survey responses, 305 (50.1%) met inclusion criteria, representing various roles and disciplines. Over half (54.1%) conducted &gt;20 video visits 3/21/2020-6/30/2020. More than 75% of providers found telemedicine easy to learn. Providers with greater proportions of video visits in a typical week in June reported greater ease of incorporating telemedicine into clinical practice and greater intention to continue telemedicine practice in 6 months. Nearly all providers endorsed concerns. Patient care experiences reinforced technology-related concerns and alleviated liability and privacy concerns. Payer reimbursement was the leading influencer of anticipated future use of telemedicine. Discussion: Providers who conducted more telemedicine encounters reported greater ease of incorporating telemedicine into practice. Provider concerns were influenced by patient care experiences. Targeted training and quality improvement strategies are needed to sustain a robust post-pandemic telemedicine program.","Schinasi, D. A.; Foster, C. C.; Bohling, M. K.; Barrera, L.; Macy, M.

A 41-year-old Hispanic male presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of bleeding gums and blood-tinged sputum. A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive on admission. Initial laboratory studies showed severe thrombocytopenia of 3x10(9)/L (150-400x10(9)/L) with no abnormal platelets or schistocytes seen on peripheral blood smear, with normal prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and fibrinogen levels. Secondary causes of thrombocytopenia were ruled out. One unit of single donor platelets was transfused and the patient was treated with intravenous dexamethasone for a total of five days and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for two days. One week after discharge the patient had a recurrence of epistaxis and hematuria requiring a second course of steroids and IVIG and the decision was made to start the patient on eltrombopag 50mg daily, which maintained his platelet counts within normal limits. COVID-19-associated ITP can be severe and life-threatening and hence warrants rapid and prompt management with steroids and IVIG.

501257,Unilateral axillary Adenopathy in the setting of COVID-19 vaccine,2021,"As the multi-systemic components of COVID-19 emerge, parallel etiologies can be drawn between SARS-CoV-2 infection and radiation injuries. While some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals present as asymptomatic, others exhibit mild symptoms that may include fever, cough, chills, and unusual symptoms like loss of taste and smell and reddening in the extremities (e.g., ""COVID toes"", suggestive of microvessel damage). Still others alarm healthcare providers with extreme and rapid onset of high-risk indicators of mortality that include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ hypercoagulation, hypoxia and cardiovascular damage. Researchers are quickly refocusing their science to address this enigmatic virus that seems to unveil itself in new ways without discrimination. As investigators begin to identify early markers of disease, identification of common threads with other pathologies may provide some clues. Interestingly, years of research in the field of radiation biology documents the complex multi-organ nature of another disease state that occurs after exposure to high doses of radiation: the acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Inflammation is a key common player in COVID-19 and ARS, and drives the multi-system damage that dramatically alters biological homeostasis. Both conditions initiate a cytokine storm, with similar pro-inflammatory molecules increased and other anti-inflammatory molecules decreased. These changes manifest in a variety of ways, with a demonstrably higher health impact in patients having underlying medical conditions. The potentially dramatic human impact of ARS has guided the science that has identified many biomarkers of radiation exposure, established medical management strategies for ARS, and led to the development of medical countermeasures for use in the event of a radiation public health emergency. These efforts can now be leveraged to help elucidate mechanisms of action of COVID-19 injuries. Furthermore, this intersection between COVID-19 and ARS may point to approaches that could accelerate the discovery of treatments for both.","Rios, Carmen I; Cassatt, David R; Hollingsworth, Brynn A; Satyamitra, Merriline M; Tadesse, Yeabsera S; Taliaferro, Lanyn P; Winters, Thomas A; DiCarlo, Andrea L",Radiat. res,,167

However, these data could help answer important questions in cancer surveillance and epidemiology research. Artificial intelligence (AI) data processing methods are capable of evaluating large volumes of data, yet current literature on their use in this context of pharmacy informatics is not well characterized. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate relevant publications within four domains (cancer, pharmacy, AI methods, population science) across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and included all publications indexed between July 17, 2008, and December 31, 2018. The search returned 3,271 publications, which were evaluated for inclusion. RESULTS: There were 36 studies that met criteria for full-text abstraction. Of those, only 45% specifically identified the pharmacy data source, and 55% specified drug agents or drug classes. Multiple AI methods were used; 25% used machine learning (ML), 67% used natural language processing (NLP), and 8% combined ML and NLP. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that the application of AI data methods for pharmacy informatics and cancer epidemiology research is expanding. However, the data sources and representations are often missing, challenging study replicability. In addition, there is no consistent format for reporting results, and one of the preferred metrics, F-score, is often missing. There is a resultant need for greater transparency of original data sources and performance of AI methods with pharmacy data to improve the translation of these results into meaningful outcomes.","Grothen, Andrew E; Tennant, Bethany; Wang, Catherine; Torres, Andrea; Bloodgood Sheppard, Bonny; Abastillas, Glenn; Matatova, Marina; Warner, Jeremy L; Rivera, Donna R",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,167

Minority populations, however, continue to be a high-risk population to contract the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While socioeconomic inequality may help to explain why minority ethnic populations are contracting the SARS-CoV-2 in larger proportions, the reason for elevated mortality rates in African Americans is still unknown. African Americans are less likely than whites to utilize high-quality hospitals, ambulatory care services, and regular primary care providers; this is most likely a result of barriers to accessing high quality treatment, as African Americans have substantially higher uninsured rates. However, previous reports have shown that regardless of insurance status, African Americans are more likely to be directed toward lower quality treatment plans compared to their white counterparts, and that physicians carry implicit biases that negatively impact treatment regimens for these minority populations. While income, education, and access to healthcare should be revised in due time, in the short term physicians should do everything possible to learn about implicit biases that may exist in healthcare, as the first step to minimize implicit biases is to recognize that they exist.","Chaturvedi, Rahul; Gabriel, Rodney A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,167

506091,Reply to Colorectal cancer and COVID-19: Do we need to raise awareness and vigilance?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Imported COVID-19 cases, if unchecked, can jeopardize the effort of domestic containment. We aim to find out what sustainable border control options for different entities (e.g., countries, states) exist during the reopening phases, given their own choice of domestic control measures. METHODS: We propose a SUIHR model, which has built-in imported risk and (1-tier) contact tracing to study the cross-border spreading and control of COVID-19. Under plausible parameter assumptions, we examine the effectiveness of border control policies, in combination with internal measures, to confine the virus and avoid reverting back to more restrictive life styles again. RESULTS: When the basic reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 exceeds 2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically, and resumes ""normal"", without mandatory institutional quarantine, even very strict border control measures combined with effective contact tracing can only delay another outbreak by 6 months. For entities employing a confining domestic control policy, non-increasing net imported cases is sufficient to remain open. CONCLUSIONS: Extremely strict border control in entities, where domestic spreading is currently eliminated (e.g., China), is justifiable. However such harsh measure are not necessary for other places. Entities successfully confining the virus by internal measures can open up to similar entities without additional border controls so long as the imported risk stays non-increasing. Opening the borders to entities lacking sufficient internal control of the virus should be exercised in combination with pre-departure screening and tests upon arrival.","Zhu, Zhen; Weber, Enzo; Strohsal, Till; Serhan, Duaa",Travel Med Infect Dis,,167
506740,The role of Interleukin-4 in COVID-19 associated male infertility - A hypothesis,2020,"BackgroundDeaths in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in England & Wales have been shown to be unevenly distributed socioeconomically and geographically. However, the full scale of inequalities may have been underestimated as most measures of excess mortality do not adequately account for varying age profiles of deaths between social groups. We measured years of life lost (YLL) attributable to the pandemic, directly or indirectly, comparing mortality across geographic and socioeconomic groups. MethodsYLL for registered deaths in England & Wales, from 27th December 2014 until 25th December 2020, were calculated using 2019 single year sex-specific life tables for England & Wales. Panel time-series models were used to estimate expected YLL by sex, geographical region, and deprivation quintile between 7th March 2020 and 25th December 2020 by cause: direct deaths (COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases), cardiovascular disease & diabetes, cancer, and other indirect deaths - all other causes). Excess YLL during the pandemic period were calculated by subtracting observed from expected values. Additional analyses focused on excess deaths for region and deprivation strata, by age-group. FindingsBetween 7th March 2020 and 25th December 2020 there were an estimated 763,550 (95% CI: 696,826 to 830,273) excess YLL in England & Wales, equivalent to a 15% (95% CI: 14 to 16) increase in YLL compared to the equivalent time period in 2019. There was a strong deprivation gradient in all-cause excess YLL, with rates per 100,000 population ranging from (916; 95% CI: 820 to 1,012) for the least deprived quintile to (1,645; 95% CI: 1,472 to 1,819) for the most deprived. The differences in excess YLL between deprivation quintiles were greatest in younger age groups; for all-cause deaths, an average of 9.1 years per death (95% CI: 8.2 to 10.0) were lost in the least deprived quintile, compared to 10.8 (95% CI: 10.0 to 11.6) in the most deprived; for COVID-19 and other respiratory deaths, an average of 8.9 years per death (95% CI: 8.7 to 9.1) were lost in the least deprived quintile, compared to 11.2 (95% CI: 11.0 to 11.5) in the most deprived. There was marked variability in both all-cause and direct excess YLL by region, with the highest rates in both in the North West. InterpretationDuring 2020, the first calendar year of the COVID-19 pandemic, longstanding socioeconomic and geographical health inequalities in England & Wales were exacerbated, with the most deprived areas suffering the greatest losses in potential years of life lost.

Medical rescue team is the main emergency rescue team. While carrying out the rescue mission, they are under great pressure both physically and mentally due to the unadaptability of the rescue environment, the lack of protective materials, overwork and other reasons, often resulting in fear, tension, anxiety, pessimism, self-blame and even acute stress disorder. Without timely and effective psychological support, long-term psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder will remain after the event. Comprehensive psychological support includes psychological measurement of the whole rescue process, team formation before rescue and detailed psychological support intervention training, self-relaxation during rescue, basic life and safety guarantee, drug treatment, online psychological assistance, withdrawal of stressors after rescue and lifestyle reconstruction.","Tong, LI; YANG, Wei-rui; ZHENG, Xia-bing; YANG, Xiao-yu; GUAN, Nian-hong",Journal of Sun Yat-sen University(Medical Sciences),,167

Left temporo-occipital lesions sometimes result in a face recognition disorder but in a context of visual object agnosia with spared familiarity feelings for faces, usually in left-handers. We describe a patient with a left temporo-occipital hemorrhagic lesion unexpectedly resulting in a deficit of face familiarity, which could represent a mild form of associative prosopagnosia. Our patient failed to feel familiarity feelings even with very well-known famous faces but had neither visual object agnosia nor defects with semantics or naming of celebrities. This was confirmed even when the patient was re-tested a year later. We speculate that a graded lateralization of face processing could be at the basis of occasional cases of prosopagnosia.","Papagno, Costanza; Barvas, Edoardo; Tettamanti, Marco; Gainotti, Guido",Neurol. sci,,167

Investigation about PAEs in terrestrial ecosystem has been extensively conducted while the fate of PAEs in marine environment remains underexplored. In this study, a novel di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) degrading marine bacterial strain, Mycolicibacterium phocaicum RL-HY01, was isolated and characterized from intertidal sediments. Strain RL-HY01 could utilize a range of PAE plasticizers as sole carbon source for growth. The effects of different environmental factors on the degradation of PAEs were evaluated and the results indicated that strain RL-HY01 could efficiently degrade PAEs under a wide range of pH (5.0 to 9.0), temperature (20 °C to 40 °C) and salinity (below 10%). Specifically, when Tween-80 was added as solubilizing agent, strain RL-HY01 could rapidly degrade DEHP and achieve complete degradation of DEHP (50 mg/L) in 48 h. The kinetics of DEHP degradation by RL-HY01 were well fitted with the modified Gompertz model. The metabolic intermediates of DEHP by strain RL-HY01 were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis and then the metabolic pathway of DEHP was deduced. DEHP was transformed into di-ethyl phthalate (DEP) via ß-oxidation and then DEP was hydrolyzed into phthalic acid (PA) by de-esterification. PA was further transformed into gentisate via salicylic acid and further utilized for cell growth. Bioaugmentation of strain RL-HY01 with marine samples was performed to evaluate its application potential and the results suggested that strain RL-HY01 could accelerate the elimination of DEHP in marine samples. The results have advanced our understanding of the fate of PAEs in marine ecosystem and identified an efficient bioremediation strategy for PAEs-polluted marine sites.","Ren, Lei; Wang, Guan; Huang, Yongxiang; Guo, Jianfu; Li, Chengyong; Jia, Yang; Chen, Sha; Zhou, John L; Hu, Hanqiao",Sci Total Environ,,167

To support the process of digital competence assessment, it is consequently necessary to understand the different approaches and methods. This paper carries out a systematic literature review and includes an analysis of the existing proposals and conceptions of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education, with the aim of better understanding the field of research. The review follows three objectives: (i) describe the characteristics of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education;(ii) provide an overview of current trends;and, finally, (iii) identify challenges and issues in digital competence assessment in higher education with a focus on the reliability and validity of the proposed methods. On the basis of the findings, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital competence assessment in higher education requires more attention, with a specific focus on instrument validity and reliability. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to further investigate the use of assessment tools to support systematic digital competence assessment processes. The analysis includes possible opportunities and ideas for future lines of work in digital competence evaluation in higher education.","Sillat, Linda Helene Tammets Kairit Laanpere Mart",Education Sciences,,167

As a job retention (JR) program, JobKeeper supports businesses, protects jobs and employment relationships and secures income of Australian workers. Drawing on microeconomic and macroeconomic evaluations of the JR programs published in other countries in a pre-pandemic period, this paper studies how the generosity, responsiveness, governance and eligibility criteria of JobKeeper may shape its efficiency and equity. We show that expected benefits of JobKeeper may be limited by some negative economic effects of short-time work subsidies. Locking employees in their current position potentially crowds out more efficient matches on the labour market. These displacement effects may slow down economic recovery. As a wage subsidy, JobKeeper distorts the relative wage and employment prospects between eligible and non-eligible workers. These substitution effects can increase the dualization of the Australian labour market and institutionalise lay-offs inequities for workers holding a temporary visa. Finally, we argue that subsidies for part-time work also generate incentives for working time reorganisations that should be evaluated. © 2021 Institute of Public Administration Australia","Walkowiak, E.",Australian Journal of Public Administration,,167

Re-examining this association using up-to-date data reflecting current and real-world practices, across different global regions and in both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, is important. METHODS: We describe the association between serum phosphate and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident dialysis patients between 2008 and 2018 using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. Time-dependent Cox proportionate hazards models were used. Models were adjusted for available covariates and fitted for the overall cohort, and also each dialysis modality. RESULTS: 31,989 patients were followed over 97,122 person-years at risk (mean age at first dialysis 61 years, 38% female, 67% haemodialysis). We observed a U-shaped association between serum phosphate and all-cause mortality. In the fully adjusted model, categories of serum phosphate above and below 1.25 - 1.99 mmol/L were associated with progressively higher risk, reaching a hazard ratio of 2.13 (95% CI 1.93 - 2.36, p<0.001) for serum phosphate &#8805;2.75mmol/L, and 1.56 (95% CI 1.44 - 1.69, p<0.001) for serum phosphate <1.00mmol/L. Low and high levels of serum phosphate were also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, however the association with high serum phosphate was more pronounced (""J-shaped relationship""). The associations were consistent across sub-analyses of patients receiving haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this large contemporary dialysis cohort, both high and low levels of serum phosphate were independently associated with increased risk of mortality. Future studies are required to determine whether treatment of abnormal serum phosphate levels improves mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

512760,COVID or cancer: Tragic choice and ethical dilemma/ COVID ou cancer: Choix tragique et dilemme éthique,2020,"In the Fall 2020 semester, faculty at colleges and universities across the United States changed course structures in many ways to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. At our institution, a regional comprehensive open-access university in the Midwest, campus was open for in-person courses with specific COVID precautions in place. Faculty were given substantial flexibility in how they restructured their courses, within constraints of socially distanced classrooms and accessibility for students. In prior semesters, our upper-division undergraduate animal physiology course met fully in-person for three 50-minute lecture periods and one 3-hour lab period per week. In fall 2020, a previously planned shift to a 4-day class week had led to a change to two 80-minute lecture periods and one 3-hour lab period per week. To align with COVID mitigation policies, the class was further restructured to a hybrid format as follows: For lecture, half of the students attended the first in-person class meeting of the week, and the other half attended the second in-person class meeting of the week. The same topics were covered in both in-person sessions in a given week and all in-person classes were recorded for asynchronous viewing by students who did not attend in person that week. The remaining lecture content was posted online via instructor-produced video lectures, outside videos or animations, and online homework. For lab sessions, half of the students attended in-person each week, and the other half were assigned activities to complete remotely, such as PhysioEx lab simulations, online documentary videos, or low-tech hands-on activities that could be completed at home. In the 8th week of the semester, students were surveyed about use of course resources and attitudes about the course and the fall semester in general. A high percentage of survey respondents reported that they ?frequently? accessed recordings of live class sessions (14/20 respondents) and online-only video lectures (17/21 respondents). Technology issues such as slow internet or device incompatibility were reported by 57% of respondents. In response to open-ended questions about positives and negatives of the course structure, examples of positives included accessibility of class recordings and other materials, flexibility, and ?COVID-friendly?. The majority of negative comments about the course structure involved a general dislike of online learning. The course grade distribution was within the range of grade distributions from prior offerings of the course by the same instructor, suggesting that student learning was not significantly impaired by the change in course structure, although negative impacts on individual students cannot be ruled out. Course structure-related comments on university student evaluation forms included ?easy to maintain studies during quarantine? and ?I actually really enjoyed the format?. In conclusion, the hybrid format for this course was generally well-received by this group of upper-division biology majors and represents a viable strategy for adapting a biology majors course to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Walton, Kristen Baker Jason Grantham Michael",The FASEB Journal,,167

OBJECTIVE: To study the seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors in Jordan, at various points of time and as the pandemic evolves in the community. METHODS: In total, 1374 blood donor samples, from three groups, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin antibodies. In the first group, samples from 734 individuals (from donations made between January and June 2020) were tested in June. In the second group, 348 individuals were tested in September 2020. The third group of 292 individuals was tested in February 2021. A qualitative assay was used for testing (specificity 99.8%, sensitivity 100%). RESULTS: The first two groups, from January-June and September 2020, when confirmed Covid-19 cases numbered between several hundred and 3000, showed a seroprevalence rate of 0% (95% CI 0.00-0.51%). The third group (early February 2021), when the number of confirmed cases had reached 100 times that of September 2020, revealed a seroprevalence of 27.4% (95% CI 22.5-32.9%). CONCLUSIONS: A dramatic rise in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was seen among healthy blood donors in Jordan, in parallel with widespread intracommunity transmission of the disease. This information is useful for assessing the degree of herd immunity, and provides for better understanding of the pandemic.","Sughayer, Maher A; Mansour, Asem; Al Nuirat, Abeer; Souan, Lina; Ghanem, Mohammad; Siag, Mahmoud",Int J Infect Dis,,167

Our objective is to describe the methods used to collect and ensure the data quality of a multicentre registry of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: This methodology study describes a population-based registry that has been enrolling consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 since Mar. 1, 2020. Most data are collected from retrospective chart review. Phone follow-up with patients at 30 days captures the World Health Organization clinical improvement scale and contextual, social and cultural variables. Phone follow-up also captures patient-reported quality of life using the Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey at 30 days, 60 days, 6 months and 12 months.

It has revolutionized the rate at which information is shared and enhanced its reach. However, another side of the coin dictates an alarming story. These platforms have led to an increase in the creation and spread of fake news. The fake news has not only influenced people in the wrong direction but also claimed human lives. During these critical times of the Covid19 pandemic, it is easy to mislead people and make them believe in fatal information. Therefore it is important to curb fake news at source and prevent it from spreading to a larger audience. We look at automated techniques for fake news detection from a data mining perspective.

Recently, numbers of epidemiological studies have illustrated that climate conditions and air pollutants are associated with the COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide. Researches also suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in fecal and wastewater samples. These findings provided the possibility of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic from an environmental perspective. With this review, the main purpose is to summarize the relationship between the atmospheric and wastewater environment and COVID-19. In terms of the atmospheric environment, the evidence of the relationship between atmospheric environment (climate factors and air pollution) and COVID-19 is growing, but currently available data and results are various. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze their associations to provide constructive suggestions in responding to the pandemic. Recently, large numbers of studies have shown the widespread presence of this virus in wastewater and the feasibility of wastewater surveillance when the pandemic is ongoing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to clarify the occurrence and implication of viruses in wastewater and to understand the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology of pandemic. Overall, environmental perspective-based COVID-19 studies can provide new insight into pandemic prevention and control, and minimizes the economic cost for COVID-19 in areas with a large outbreak or a low economic level.","Hu, Lixin; Deng, Wen-Jing; Ying, Guang-Guo; Hong, Huachang",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,167
517658,Health Canada approves first drug for treatment of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Patients living with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) continue to be concerned about risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Using a large multi-center electronic health record network, we conducted a comparative cohort study of patients with SARDs diagnosed with COVID-19 (identified by diagnostic code or positive molecular test) versus non-SARD comparators with COVID-19, matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (primary model) and comorbidities and health care utilization (extended model). Thirty-day outcomes were assessed, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (ARF), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and death. RESULTS: We initially identified 2,379 SARD patients with COVID-19 (mean age 58 years, 79% female) and 142,750 comparators (mean age 47 years, 54% female). In the primary matched model (2,379 SARD patients and 2,379 matched non-SARD comparators with COVID-19), SARD patients had significantly higher risks of hospitalization (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.26), ICU admission (RR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.68), ARF (RR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.07), and VTE (RR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.45) versus comparators but did not have significantly higher risks of mechanical ventilation or death. In the extended model, all risks were largely attenuated except risk of VTE (RR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.25). CONCLUSIONS: SARD patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, ARF, and VTE versus matched comparators. These risks may be largely mediated by comorbidities, except for risk of VTE.","D039,; Silva, Kristin M; Jorge, April; Cohen, Andrew; McCormick, Natalie; Zhang, Yuqing; Wallace, Zachary S; Choi, Hyon K",Arthritis rheumatol.

We assessed the prevalence and characteristics of PDs in COVID-19 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and negative CTPA. METHODS: This retrospective study included COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia groups of patients with DE-CTPA negative for PE. Two radiologists rated the presence of PD within the lung opacities and analyzed the type of lung opacities and PD pattern (i.e. homogeneous or heterogeneous). The clinical, biological, radiological characteristics including time from first symptoms and admission to DE-CTPA, oxygen requirements, CRP, D-dimer levels, duration of hospital admission and death were compared within the COVID-19 group between patients with (PD +) or without PD (PD-). RESULTS: 67 COVID-19 and 79 non-COVID-19 patients were included. PDs were more frequent in the COVID-19 than in the non-COVID-19 group (59.7% and 26.6% respectively, p < 0.001). Patterns of PDs were different, with COVID-19 patients exhibiting heterogenous PDs (38/40, 95%) whereas non-COVID-19 patients showed mostly homogeneous perfusion defects (7/21 heterogeneous PDs, 33%), p < 0.001. In COVID-19 patients, most consolidations (9/10, 90%) exhibited PDs while less than a third of consolidations (19/67, 28%) had PDs in non-COVID-19 patients.

We report our challenges caring for CARDS patients on VV-ECMO and alterations to traditional management strategies. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of our institutional strategies for managing patients with COVID-19 who required VV-ECMO in a dedicated airlock biocontainment unit (BCU), from March to June 2020. The data collected included the time course of admission, VV-ECMO run, ventilator length, hospital length of stay, and major events related to bleeding, such as pneumothorax and tracheostomy. The dispensation of sedation agents and trial therapies were obtained from institutional pharmacy tracking. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. (3) Results: Forty COVID-19 patients on VV-ECMO were managed in the BCU during this period, from which 21 survived to discharge and 19 died. The criteria for ECMO initiation was altered for age, body mass index, and neurologic status/cardiac arrest. All cannulations were performed with a bedside ultrasound-guided percutaneous technique. Ventilator and ECMO management were routed in an ultra-lung protective approach, though varied based on clinical setting and provider experience. There was a high incidence of pneumothorax (n = 19). Thirty patients had bedside percutaneous tracheostomy, with more procedural-related bleeding complications than expected. A higher use of sedation was noted. The timing of decannulation was also altered, given the system constraints. A variety of trial therapies were utilized, and their effectiveness is yet to be determined. (4) Conclusions: Even in a high-volume ECMO center, there are challenges in caring for an expanded capacity of patients during a viral respiratory pandemic. Though institutional resources and expertise may vary, it is paramount to proceed with insightful planning, the recognition of challenges, and the dynamic application of lessons learned when facing a surge of critically ill patients.","Shah, Aakash Dave Sagar Galvagno Samuel George Kristen Menne Ashley R.; Haase, Daniel J.; McCormick, Brian Rector Raymond Dahi Siamak Madathil Ronson J.; Deatrick, Kristopher B.; Ghoreishi, Mehrdad Gammie James S.; Kaczorowski, David J.; Scalea, Thomas M.; Menaker, Jay Herr Daniel Tabatabai Ali Krause Eric",Membranes,,167

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been used in patients with critically ill COVID-19 with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE). A retrospective cohort study of 6095 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at 5 acute care hospitals in New York was conducted. 57 patients received tPA for presumed PE during March 10th to April 27th. The mean age was 60.8 ± 10.8 years, and 71.9% (41/57) were male. We defined strongly suspected PE among 75.4% (43/57) of patients who had acute worsening of hypoxia and acute hypotension requiring pressors. The findings suggestive of PE included right ventricular (RV) strain in 15.8% (9/57), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 7.0% (4/57), increased dead space ventilation (Vd) in 31.6% (18/57) of patients, respectively. RV strain and RV thrombus were present in 3.5% (2/57), RV strain and DVT in 5.3% (3/57), RV strain and increased Vd in 8.8% (5/57), and DVT and increased Vd in 3.5% (2/57) of patients. Chest CT Angiography was not performed in any of the patients. Following tPA infusion, 49.1% (28/57) of patients demonstrated improvement. Six patients (10.5%) survived to discharge, of whom 2 received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and were transferred to other facilities for lung transplant, 2 were discharged home, and 2 were discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

Because of their economic and logistical effects, tracking mobility changes during quarantines is crucial in assessing their efficacy and predicting the virus spread. Chile, one of the worst-hit countries in the world, unlike many other countries, implemented quarantines at a more localized level, shutting down small administrative zones, rather than the whole country or large regions. Given the non-obvious effects of these localized quarantines, tracking mobility becomes even more critical in Chile. To assess the impact on human mobility of the localized quarantines in Chile, we analyze a mobile phone dataset made available by Telef\'onica Chile, which comprises 31 billion eXtended Detail Records and 5.4 million users covering the period February 26th to September 20th, 2020. From these records, we derive three epidemiologically relevant metrics describing the mobility within and between comunas.

Moreover, elevated D-dimer levels have been identified as an important prognostic marker in COVID-19 directly associated with disease severity and progression. Prophylactic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients might not be enough to prevent thrombotic events; therefore, therapeutic anticoagulation regimens deserve clinical investigation. DESIGN: : ACTION is an academic-led, pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase IV clinical trial that aims to enroll around 600 patients at 40 sites participating in the Coalition COVID-19 Brazil initiative. Eligible patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with symptoms up to 14 days and elevated D-dimer levels will be randomized to a strategy of full-dose anticoagulation for 30 days with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or full-dose heparin if oral administration is not feasible) versus standard of care with any approved venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis regimen during hospitalization. A confirmation of COVID-19 was mandatory for study entry, based on specific tests used in clinical practice (RT-PCR, antigen test, IgM test) collected before randomization, regardless of in the outpatient setting or not. Randomization will be stratified by clinical stability at presentation. The primary outcome is a hierarchical analysis of mortality, length of hospital stay, or duration of oxygen therapy at the end of 30 days. Secondary outcomes include the World Health Organization's 8-point ordinal scale at 30 days and the following individual efficacy outcomes: incidence of VTE, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, major adverse limb events, duration of oxygen therapy, disease progression, and biomarkers. The primary safety outcomes are major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. SUMMARY: : The ACTION trial will evaluate whether in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban for stable patients, or enoxaparin for unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban through 30 days compared with standard prophylactic anticoagulation improves clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels.

METHODS: Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were randomized to receive lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine or no antiviral therapy (control). The primary endpoint was an ordinal scale of organ support-free days. Analyses used a Bayesian cumulative logistic model and expressed treatment effects as an adjusted odds ratio (OR) where an OR > 1 is favorable. RESULTS: We randomized 694 patients to receive lopinavir-ritonavir (n = 255), hydroxychloroquine (n = 50), combination therapy (n = 27) or control (n = 362). The median organ support-free days among patients in lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and combination therapy groups was 4 (– 1 to 15), 0 (– 1 to 9) and—1 (– 1 to 7), respectively, compared to 6 (– 1 to 16) in the control group with in-hospital mortality of 88/249 (35%), 17/49 (35%), 13/26 (50%), respectively, compared to 106/353 (30%) in the control group. The three interventions decreased organ support-free days compared to control (OR [95% credible interval]: 0.73 [0.55, 0.99], 0.57 [0.35, 0.83] 0.41 [0.24, 0.72]), yielding posterior probabilities that reached the threshold futility (≥ 99.0%), and high probabilities of harm (98.0%, 99.9% and > 99.9%, respectively). The three interventions reduced hospital survival compared with control (OR [95% CrI]: 0.65 [0.45, 0.95], 0.56 [0.30, 0.89], and 0.36 [0.17, 0.73]), yielding high probabilities of harm (98.5% and 99.4% and 99.8%, respectively).

A single primer pair was designed to amplify a 348 bp region of spike, and probes were initially designed to detect K417, E484K, and N501Y. The assay was evaluated using characterized variant sample pools and residual nasopharyngeal samples. Variant calls were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in a subset of samples. Subsequently, a fourth probe was designed to detect L452R. The lower limit of 95% detection was 2.46 to 2.48 log10 GE/mL for the three initial targets (∼1-2 GE/reaction). Among 253 residual nasopharyngeal swabs with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the Spike SNP assay was positive in 238 (94.1%) samples. All 220 samples with Ct values < 30 for the SARS-CoV-2 N2 target were detected, whereas 18/33 samples with N2 Ct values ≥ 30 were detected. Spike SNP results were confirmed by sequencing in 50/50 samples (100%). Addition of the 452R probe did not affect performance for the original targets. The Spike SNP assay accurately identifies SARS-CoV-2 mutations in receptor binding domain, and it can be quickly modified to detect new mutations that emerge.","Babiker, Ahmed; Immergluck, Katherine; Stampfer, Samuel D; Rao, Anuradha; Bassit, Leda; Su, Max; Nguyen, Vi; Stittleburg, Victoria; Ingersoll, Jessica M; Bradley, Heath L; Mavigner, Maud; Schoof, Nils; Kraft, Colleen S; Chahroudi, Ann; Schinazi, Raymond F; Martin, Greg S; Piantadosi, Anne; Lam, Wilbur A; Waggoner, Jesse J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01446-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34432488/,167
592126,Multiple sclerosis immunomodulatory therapies tested for effectiveness in COVID-19.,2021-08-04,"One Health is an emerging concept in the health sciences that approaches human, animal and environmental health from a single framework. This policy approach is grounded in the knowledge that approximately 70 percent of emerging diseases in humans originate from other species, and that this species crossover is precipitated by stresses to environmental systems such as habitat change and biodiversity loss. Remote sensing tools apply well to this approach due to the multitude of variables that can be measured across borders in real-time. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of using satellite remote sensing to monitor biodiversity loss in real time, with a goal of predictive surveillance for emerging disease events. Key findings include that (1) certain emerging disease events are preceded by biodiversity changes that can be observed from space; (2) refining quantitative assessments of biodiversity loss is a critical next step; and (3) biodiversity loss as observed from space merits inclusion in emerging disease surveillance programs as a complement to in situ and epidemiological surveillance data.","Malloy, Samuel S.; Horack, John M.; Lee, Jiyoung; Newton, Elizabeth K.",Acta Astronaut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287491/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576518302479; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.10.042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0094576518302479,167

The main goal of this research is to identify the difficulties related to the professional activity and personal life of obstetrics and gynecology doctors. Material and Methods: In total, 94 physicians from a single university center answered to an online questionnaire. Socio-demographic, health, family, and job-related data were collected. Data were processed using SPSS (v.25). Results: 7.4% of the doctors were confirmed infected with SARS-Cov-2 during the first 6 months of the pandemic, and 48.94% treated infected patients. Due to the large number of patients, 10.64% of the doctors have had no days-off during the last 6 months, and 22.34% of them have had new medical problems that led them to see a specialist. Seventeen to nineteen percent mentioned an increasing number of working hours and shifts per month due to the pandemic period, more than 10% used pills to cope with work-stress, and 25% of them had sleep disorders along with appetite loss. Extra-protection rules and negative consequences of wearing special equipment were identified: thermal discomfort that caused decreasing resistance and concentration during the surgery (52%), reduced mobility and accuracy of surgical or medical gestures (40%), and intraoperative visibility (47%). Doctors who were working with confirmed pregnant women preferred caesarean section. Conclusions: Working under the stress of an infection with SARS-Cov-2 is causing a lot of pressure and determines changes in personal, familial, social, and professional life. Understanding the challenges that ob-gyn doctors are facing will help institutions to better provide support.","Iorga, Magdalena; Soponaru, Camelia; Socolov, Răzvan-Vladimir; Cărăuleanu, Alexandru; Socolov, Demetra-Gabriela",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57040325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915713/,167

We explain what a responsible DEI program might look like. We explore a consequentialist argument for DEI according to which DEI is a viable harm‐reduction strategy. Then we consider a nonconsequentialist argument for DEI that draws on the moral significance of consent. Additionally, we consider arguments for the view that DEI is unethical on the grounds that, given that large‐scale DEI would be highly likely to result in some severe illnesses and deaths, DEI amounts to a form of killing. Our thesis is that incorporating a DEI program alongside the status quo ‘calibrate the curve’ responses could have significant advantages at the early stages of pandemics. These potential advantages mean that, at a minimum, research into DEI would have been justified early in the COVID‐19 pandemic and that DEI programs should be explored as potential additions to our overall approach to emerging pandemics in the future.","Streiffer, Robert; Killoren, David; Chappell, Richard Y.",J Appl Philos,https://doi.org/10.1111/japp.12492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821073/,167

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a non-infectious pandemic of the modern world; it is estimated that in 2045 it will affect 10% of the world’s population. As the prevalence of diabetes increases, the problem of its complications, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), grows. DR is a highly specific neurovascular complication of diabetes that occurs in more than one third of DM patients and accounts for 80% of complete vision loss cases in the diabetic population. We are currently witnessing many groundbreaking studies on new pharmacological and surgical methods of treating diabetes. Aim. The aim of the study is to assess the safety of pharmacological and surgical treatment of DM in patients with DR. Material and methods. An analysis of the data on diabetes treatment methods currently available in the world literature and their impact on the occurrence and progression of DR. Results. A rapid decrease in glycaemia leads to an increased occurrence and progression of DR. Its greatest risk accompanies insulin therapy and sulfonylurea therapy. The lowest risk of DR occurs with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors; the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues is also safe. Patients undergoing pancreatic islet transplants or bariatric surgeries require intensive monitoring of the state of the eye, both in the perioperative and postoperative period. Conclusions. It is of utmost importance to individualize therapy in diabetic patients, in order to gradually achieve treatment goals with the use of safe methods and minimize the risk of development and progression of DR.","Matuszewski, Wojciech; Baranowska-Jurkun, Angelika; Stefanowicz-Rutkowska, Magdalena Maria; Gontarz-Nowak, Katarzyna; Gątarska, Ewa; Bandurska-Stankiewicz, Elżbieta",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670143/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10040705,167

The incidence in women is higher than in men, whereas severe forms of the disease are significantly more common in men as well as the mortality; however, premenopausal and postmenopausal women again present a dimorphism in the course depending on hormonal status. Premenopausal women have lower rates of hospitalization and need respiratory support less often. Postmenopausal women who receive hormone replacement therapy seem to benefit from this intervention. The results of basic research in a murine model show that in the case of influenza the female sex steroids have a positive effect on the course of inflammation and in the case of the SARS-CoV‑2 virus, reduce the susceptibility to the virus, while androgens result in an increase in the infection rate. This is also the case in patients with polycystic ovarian disease syndrome (PCOD). The first results of a treatment study with progesterone, albeit with small numbers of patients, indicate that such a treatment with this sex steroid can have a positive effect on the course of the disease in affected men; however, complications after vaccination against COVID-19 show a clear gender difference, with an increased relative risk for younger women.","Felberbaum, Ricardo; Küpker, Wolfgang",Gynakol Endokrinol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335125/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10304-021-00395-6,167

Depression and QOL were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire nine items (PHQ-9) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses and analysis of covariance were used. A total of 10,516 frontline clinicians participated in this study, of which, 28.52% (n=2,999) met screening criteria for depression. Compared to those without depression, clinicians with depression had a lower quality of life (F ((1, 10515)) =2874.66, P<0.001). Higher educational level (OR=1.225, P=0.014), if the number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital catchment area surpassed 500 (OR=1.146, P=0.032), having family/friends/colleagues who were infected (OR=1.695, P<0.001), being a current smoker (OR=1.533, P<0.001), and longer working hours (OR=1.020, P=0.022) were independently associated with higher risk of depression. Living with family members (OR=0.786, P<0.001), and being junior clinicians (OR=0.851, P=0.011) were independently associated with lower odds of depression.

In this study, we aimed to shed greater light on early steps in IBV infection. By using chemical inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant negative mutants, we observed that lipid rafts and low pH was indeed required for virus entry; IBV mainly utilized the clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) for entry; GTPase dynamin 1 was involved in virus containing vesicle scission; and the penetration of IBV into cells led to active cytoskeleton rearrangement. By using R18 labeled virus, we found that virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. Finally, by using dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion was induced after 1 h.p.i. in late endosome/lysosome.","Wang, Huan; Yuan, Xiao; Sun, Yingjie; Mao, Xiang; Meng, Chunchun; Tan, Lei; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Ding, Chan; Liao, Ying",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218303775; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597347/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218303775,167

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine which virtual communication method (ie, telephone call or video call) was preferred by confined older hospital patients and nursing home residents and the variables influencing this preference. METHODS: The TOVID (Telephony Or Videophony for Isolated elDerly) study was a cross-sectional study that was designed to examine the preference between telephone calls and video calls among frail older adults who were either hospitalized in a geriatric acute care unit or institutionalized in a long-term care and nursing home during the COVID-19 confinement period. RESULTS: A total of 132 older people were surveyed between March 25 and May 11, 2020 (mean age 88.2 years, SD 6.2); 79 (59.8%) were women. Patients hospitalized in the geriatric acute care unit were more able to establish communication independently than residents institutionalized in the long-term care and nursing home (P=.03) and were more satisfied with their communication experiences (P=.02). Overall, older people tended to favor telephone calls (73/132, 55.3%) over video calls (59/132, 44.7%); however, their satisfaction degree was similar regardless of the chosen method (P=.1), with no effect of age (P=.97) or gender (P=.2). In the geriatric acute care unit, the satisfaction degrees were similar for telephone calls (40/41, 98%) and video calls (33/38, 87%) in older patients (P=.10). Conversely, in the long-term care and nursing home, residents were more satisfied with the use of video calls to communicate with their relatives (14/15, 93%) versus the use of telephone calls (6/12, 50%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Older people confined to health care settings were able to complete telephone calls more independently than video calls, and they tended to use telephone calls more often than video calls. The satisfaction degrees were similar with both modalities and even greater with video calls among long-term care and nursing home residents when they were given assistance to establish communication.

However, due to their ecological design based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 mortality in England using high geographical resolution. In this nationwide cross-sectional study in England, we included 38,573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level (n = 32,844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2.5 concentration during 2014–2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. We find a 0.5% (95% credible interval: −0.2%, 1.2%) and 1.4% (95% CrI: −2.1%, 5.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality risk for every 1 μg/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2.5 respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect equal to 0.93 and 0.78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO2 exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM2.5 remains more uncertain.","Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos; Padellini, Tullia; Bennett, James; Davies, Bethan; Ezzati, Majid; Blangiardo, Marta",Environment International,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395952/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322716; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412020322716; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106316,167

The objective of this study was to evaluate the exposure, impact and experience of the pandemic on families of pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients compared to families of healthy children and adolescents. METHODS: We recruited 96 families, 48 with a pediatric SOT recipient and 48 healthy controls, matched by child age and gender. A primary caregiver from each family responded to an online sociodemographic questionnaire and the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS), which explores the exposure, impact and experience of the pandemic and lockdown on families. RESULTS: Exposure to the pandemic was greater in families of healthy children and adolescents. The impact was mostly negative in both groups: caregivers reported increased anxiety (76%) and mood disturbances (71.9%) and hindered quality of sleep (64.6%) and health habits (58.3%). On the positive side, family relationships improved. Qualitatively, the SOT group positively perceived isolation and established hygienic measures as protective and destigmatizing, although they reported fear of virus transmission to their child. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the pandemic has been similar in both groups, although families of transplant recipients have protected themselves more, probably because they are used to prevention measures and they see contagion as a graver risk. Additionally, SOT recipients’ families presented some idiosyncratic elements, especially a decrease in their perception of stigma associated with the medical condition.","Forner-Puntonet, Mireia; Castell-Panisello, Eudald; Quintero, Jesús; Ariceta, Gema; Gran, Ferran; Iglesias-Serrano, Ignacio; Gisbert-Gustemps, Laura; Daigre, Constanza; Ibañez-Jimenez, Pol; Delgado, Mercedes; Español-Martín, Gemma; Parramon, Gemma; Pont, Teresa; Ramos-Quiroga, Josep Antoni",J Pediatr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313783/,167

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a significant threat to international health. COVID-19 is highly infectious and can lead to fatal comorbidities especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, fully understanding the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS is conducive to early identification and precise treatment. We aimed to describe the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS and to elucidate the differences from ARDS caused by other factors. COVID-19 mainly affected the respiratory system with minor damage to other organs. Injury to the alveolar epithelial cells was the main cause of COVID-19-related ARDS, and endothelial cells were less damaged with therefore less exudation. The clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some COVID-19 patients, which was inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings. The onset time of COVID-19-related ARDS was 8–12 days, which was inconsistent with ARDS Berlin criteria, which defined a 1-week onset limit. Some of these patients might have a relatively normal lung compliance. The severity was redefined into three stages according to its specificity: mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe. HFNO can be safe in COVID-19-related ARDS patients, even in some moderate-severe patients. The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure. Thus, the timing of invasive mechanical ventilation is very important. The effects of corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS patients were uncertain. We hope to help improve the prognosis of severe cases and reduce the mortality.","Li, Xu; Ma, Xiaochun",Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-02911-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375845/,167

This study aimed to describe the demographic, clinical, and functional status after the discharge of COVID-19 survivors who underwent intensive multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation at the Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Institute of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School General Hospital and Lucy Montoro Rehabilitation Institute. We determined the most important factors related to the length of inpatient rehabilitation treatment and present the functional outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on electronic medical records. In addition to the severity of COVID-19 and length of hospital stay for the management of COVID-19 and comorbidities, we collected sociodemographic data including age, sex, height, and weight. Functional assessments were performed using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM); Short Physical Performance Battery; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; Revised Impact of Events Scale; bioelectrical impedance; Functional Oral Intake Scale; oropharyngeal dysphagia classification; and nutritional assessment. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in FIM before and after inpatient rehabilitation treatment (p<0.0001). Muscle strength and walking capacity were significantly improved (p<0.01). The most important factors related to the length of inpatient rehabilitation treatment were improvement in FIM scores (Spearman’s r=0.71) and gain in lean mass (Spearman’s r=0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation of patients after COVID-19 recovery improves their functional status and should be considered in the post-acute phase for selected patients with COVID-19.","Imamura, Marta; Mirisola, Aline Rossetti; Ribeiro, Fernando de Quadros; De Pretto, Lucas Ramos; Alfieri, Fábio Marcon; Delgado, Vinicius Ramos; Battistella, Linamara Rizzo",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2021/e2804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133481/,167

Governors of some states moved swiftly to impose the lockdowns. Others delayed and a few even refused to implement these policies. We explore common narratives of what determines the speed of implementation, namely partisanship and virus exposure. While correlation exists, we show that the most consistent explanation for the speed of the implementation of these orders is the state's economic freedom. It was the economically unfree states that issued stay‐at‐home orders earlier.","McCannon, Bryan C.; Hall, Joshua C.",South Econ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821047/; https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12495,167
599632,1608P The impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of systemic anti-cancer treatment at Guy’s Cancer Centre,2021-09-30,"Carbon-based photosensitizers are more attractive than the other ones based on their low cost, high stability, broadband of light absorption, tunable emission spectra, high quantum yield, water solubility, high resistance to metabolic degradation, and selective delivery. These properties allow multiple applications in the field of biology and medicine. The present study evaluated in vitro and in vivo the antimicrobial photodynamic effect of a one-pot microwave produced C-DOTS based on citric acid. The in vitro assays assessed the effectiveness of illuminated C-DOTS (C-DOTS + light) against Staphylococcus aureus suspension and biofilm. The concentrations of 6.9 and 13.8 mg/mL of C-DOTS and light doses of 20 and 40 J/cm(2) were able to reduce significantly the microorganisms. Based on these parameters and results, the in vivo experiments were conducted in mice, evaluating this treatment on wounds contaminated with S. aureus. The viability test showed that C-DOTS–mediated photodynamic inactivation reduced 10(4) log of the bacteria present on the skin lesions. These results, altogether, showed that antibacterial photodynamic therapy using C-DOTS is a promising and viable treatment for Gram-positive bacteria-infected wounds.","Romero, María Paulina; Alves, Fernanda; Stringasci, Mirian Denise; Buzzá, Hilde Harb; Ciol, Heloísa; Inada, Natalia Mayumi; Bagnato, Vanderlei Salvador",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.662149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234756/,167
599961,Gastroparesis After Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccination,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the number of low-volume and non-metropolitan mifepristone purchasers and their role in the expansion of medication abortion. METHODS: We use de-identified data from Danco Laboratories, the sole distributor of mifepristone during the study period, to examine trends in mifepristone distribution. We focus on customers who purchased < 100 doses a year and a subset of those who purchased < 10 doses for the periods of 2008–2011 and 2014–2017. We use data from the Guttmacher Institute Abortion Provider Census (APC) studies in 2008 and 2017 to examine the extent to which some facilities that purchased mifepristone may be missing from Guttmacher's APC. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2017, the number of medication abortions increased 73%, though the number of mifepristone purchasers only increased 15%. The number of low-volume mifepristone customers, or those who purchased < 100 tablets of mifepristone per year, decreased 8% over the study period, while the number purchasing < 10 tablets per year decreased 14%. However, in recent years low-volume customers were more likely to have purchased mifepristone in multiple years. In non-metropolitan areas, the number of sites purchasing mifepristone increased slightly but the amount of mifepristone that was purchased more than doubled between 2008 and 2017. CONCLUSIONS: While reliance on medication abortion increased substantially between 2008 and 2014, there is no evidence that this was due to an increase in the number of facilities that purchased low-volumes of mifepristone. IMPLICATIONS. While their numbers declined, abortion providers purchasing low volumes of mifepristone likely played an important role for the individuals they cared for. Access to abortion could increase if a wider network of healthcare practitioners, especially those in settings that do not currently provide abortions, were able to offer medication abortion.","Jones, Rachel K.",Contracept X,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590151620300253; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conx.2020.100042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073229/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590151620300253?v=s5,167

601261,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Ovarian Cancer Management: Adjusting to the New Normal,2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused havoc across the globe since, no specific treatment exists for this disease, thus, far. Hence, there is an urgent need to find an effective treatment to mitigate this scourge. Honey and Nigella sativa are two natural substances with anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-microbial and immune modulating properties. They could be potentially beneficial in these patients. METHODS: We conducted an add-on, randomized, open label, placebo-controlled clinical trial using parallel group design. This was a multi-centered study with superiority framework conducted in RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients showing moderate or severe disease. All patients receiving standard care were randomized into treatment and control groups. In the treatment arm, patients received HNS (honey plus Nigella sativa) in predefined doses for up to 13 days. The primary outcome measures (time taken for alleviation of symptoms, viral clearance and clinical status improvement on day 6) outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Of 1046 patients testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2, 210 showing moderate and 103 showing severe disease were randomized into treatment and control groups as per inclusion criteria. In the moderate cases, 107 were assigned to the HNS group and 103 to the control group. Among 103 severe cases, 50 were assigned to the HNS group and 53 to the control group. In the moderate and severe cases, the HNS treatment was associated with a normalized median symptoms alleviation time reduction of 3 and 7 days (HR: 6.11; 95% CI: 4.23-8.84 and HR: 4.04; 95% CI, 2.46-6.64) respectively. The HNS treatment in both groups were further associated with 4 days earlier reduction in median viral clearance time (Moderate HR: 5.53; 95% CI: 3.76-8.14) and Severe HR: 4.32; 95% CI: 2.62-7.13). Moreover, in the intention-to-treat analysis, the HNS groups led to a lower (better) clinical score on day 6 with resumption of normal activity among 63.6% of the moderate (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.13) and 28% of severe cases (OR: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01-0.09). Furthermore, a significant (14.87%) reduction (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02-0.92) in mortality was observed in the HNS arm. No difference in adverse effects were seen between the HNS and control arms. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in in the severity of disease, the time taken for viral clearance and mortality was observed with HNS treatment in COVID-19 patients. HNS represents a safe, effective, over the counter and affordable therapy for this pandemic essentially lowering health care burden. It can be used alone or in combination with other expensive treatments and give an additive effect. Hence, the potential of HNS against COVID-19 should be explored in future larger studies.

The challenge now is to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic without overburdening economic and social activities. An agent-based model simulated the population of King County, Washington. SARS-CoV-2 transmission probabilities were estimated by fitting simulated to observed hospital admissions. Interventions considered included encouraging telecommuting, reducing contacts to high-risk persons, and reductions to contacts outside of the home, among others. Removing all existing interventions would result in nearly 42,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations between June 2020 and January 2021, with peak hospital occupancy exceeding available beds 6-fold. Combining interventions is predicted to reduce total hospitalizations by 48% (95% CI, 47-49%), with peak COVID-19 hospital occupancy of 70% of total beds. Targeted school closures can further reduce the peak occupancy.

Metabolism can modulate the immune responses against infectious diseases, yet our understanding remains limited on how host metabolism correlates with inflammatory responses and affects cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Here we perform both metabolomics and cytokine/chemokine profiling on serum samples from healthy controls, mild and severe COVID-19 patients, and delineate their global metabolic and immune response landscape. Correlation analyses show tight associations between metabolites and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IL-6, M-CSF, IL-1α, IL-1β, and imply a potential regulatory crosstalk between arginine, tryptophan, purine metabolism and hyperinflammation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that targeting metabolism markedly modulates the proinflammatory cytokines release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques ex vivo, hinting that exploiting metabolic alterations may be a potential strategy for treating fatal CRS in COVID-19.","Xiao, Nan; Nie, Meng; Pang, Huanhuan; Wang, Bohong; Hu, Jieli; Meng, Xiangjun; Li, Ke; Ran, Xiaorong; Long, Quanxin; Deng, Haijun; Chen, Na; Li, Shao; Tang, Ni; Huang, Ailong; Hu, Zeping",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33712622/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21907-9,167

Infection prevention (IP) performance among aircraft cabin crew is crucial for preventing in-flight transmission. We aimed to identify the level of IP performance and factors affecting IP performance among aircraft cabin crew during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. An online survey was conducted with 177 cabin crew members between August and September 2020. The survey assessed IP performance, and IP awareness, using a five-point Likert scale, and also evaluated simulation-based personal protective equipment (PPE) training experience, and organizational culture. The average IP performance score was 4.56 ± 0.44. Although the performance level for mask-wearing was high (4.73 ± 0.35), hand hygiene (HH) performance (4.47 ± 0.56) was low. Multivariate analysis showed that IP performance was significantly associated with IP awareness (p < 0.05) and simulation-based PPE training experience (p < 0.05). Since HH performance was relatively low, cabin crew and airlines should make efforts to improve HH performance. Furthermore, a high level of IP awareness and PPE training experience can improve IP performance among cabin crew members. Therefore, simulation-based PPE training and strategies to improve IP awareness are essential for preventing in-flight infection transmission.","Ryu, Jaegeum; Kim, Jungha; Choi-Kwon, Smi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203806/,167

To date, multiple editorials and commentaries indicate the severity of the disruption without providing sufficient evidence with quantifiable data. METHODS: An online survey was submitted to the administrative offices of biomedical and medical PhD-programs at eight major universities in Sweden to gauge the impact of the pandemic on the students. It consisted of multiple-choice and open-ended questions where students could provide examples of positive and/or negative supervision strategies. Open answered questions were coded as either examples of positive or negative support. RESULTS: PhD students were divided into two groups: those with improved or unchanged supervision during the pandemic (group 1, n = 185), versus those whose supervision worsened (group 2, n = 69). Group 1 received more help from supervisors and more frequent supervision via both online and alternative platforms (email/messages and telephone). There was no significant difference in educational-stage, gender or caretaking responsibilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for the scientific community to learn how to provide the best possible supervision for PhD students during the pandemic. Our data suggests that more frequent supervision, and using a diverse array of meeting platforms is helpful. In addition, it is important for the students to feel that they have their supervisor’s emotional support. Several students also expressed that they would benefit from an extension of their PhD programs due to delays caused by the pandemic.","Börgeson, Emma; Sotak, Matus; Kraft, Jamie; Bagunu, Grace; Biörserud, Christina; Lange, Stephan",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022871/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02727-3,167
602799,Design of advanced siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19,2021-05-08,"BACKGROUND: While genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) have successfully elucidated the genetic architecture of complex human traits and diseases, understanding mechanisms that lead from genetic variation to pathophysiology remains an important challenge. Methods are needed to systematically bridge this crucial gap to facilitate experimental testing of hypotheses and translation to clinical utility. RESULTS: Here, we leveraged cross-phenotype associations to identify traits with shared genetic architecture, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to accurately capture shared SNPs by proxy, and calculate significance of enrichment. This shared genetic architecture was examined across differing biological scales through incorporating data from catalogs of clinical, cellular, and molecular GWAS. We have created an interactive web database (interactive Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS database (iCPAGdb)) to facilitate exploration and allow rapid analysis of user-uploaded GWAS summary statistics. This database revealed well-known relationships among phenotypes, as well as the generation of novel hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of common diseases. Application of iCPAGdb to a recent GWAS of severe COVID-19 demonstrated unexpected overlap of GWAS signals between COVID-19 and human diseases, including with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis driven by the DPP9 locus. Transcriptomics from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that DPP9 was induced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls or those with bacterial infection. Further investigation of cross-phenotype SNPs associated with both severe COVID-19 and other human traits demonstrated colocalization of the GWAS signal at the ABO locus with plasma protein levels of a reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, CD209 (DC-SIGN). This finding points to a possible mechanism whereby glycosylation of CD209 by ABO may regulate COVID-19 disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, connecting genetically related traits across phenotypic scales links human diseases to molecular and cellular measurements that can reveal mechanisms and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

As of June 2021, S proteins have exclusively been purified using difficult-to-scale, low-yield methodologies such as affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Herein we present the first known non-affinity purification method for two S constructs, S_dF_2P and HexaPro, expressed in the mammalian cell line, CHO-DG44. A high-throughput resin screen on the Tecan Freedom EVO200 automated bioprocess workstation led to identification of ion exchange resins as viable purification steps. The chromatographic unit operations along with industry-standard methodologies for viral clearances, low pH treatment and 20 nm filtration, were assessed for feasibility. The developed process was applied to purify HexaPro from a CHO-DG44 stable pool harvest and yielded the highest yet reported amount of pure S protein. Our results demonstrate that commercially available chromatography resins are suitable for cGMP manufacturing of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein constructs.

604786,Correction: COVID-19 prevention and treatment: A critical analysis of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine clinical pharmacology,2020-10-23,"OBJECTIVES: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with dysregulations of leptin and tryptophan–kynurenine (Trp–Kyn) (TKP) pathways. Leptin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, activates Trp conversion into Kyn. However, leptin association with down-stream Kyn metabolites in MDD is unknown. METHODS: Fasting plasma samples from 29 acutely ill drug-naïve (n = 16) or currently non-medicated (⩾6 weeks; n = 13) MDD patients were analyzed for leptin, Trp, Kyn, its down-stream metabolites (anthranilic [AA], kynurenic [KYNA], xanthurenic [XA] acids and 3-hydroxykynurenine [3HK]), C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, body mass index (BMI), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Depression severity was assessed by HAM-D-21. RESULTS: In female (n = 14) (but not in male) patients HAM-D-21 scores correlated with plasma levels of AA (but not other Kyn metabolites) (rho = −0.644, P = .009) and leptin (Spearman’s rho = −0.775, P = .001). Inclusion of AA into regression analysis improved leptin prediction of HAM-D from 48.5% to 65.9%. Actual HAM-D scores highly correlated with that calculated by formula: HAM-D = 34.8518−(0.5660 × leptin [ng/ml] + 0.4159 × AA [nmol/l]) (Rho = 0.84, P = .00015). In male (n = 15) (but not in female) patients leptin correlated with BMI, waist circumference/hip ratio, CRP, and HOMA-IR. CONCLUSIONS: Present findings of gender specific AA/Leptin correlations with HAM-D are important considering that AA and leptin are transported from plasma into brain, and that AA formation is catalyzed by kynureninase—the only TKP gene associated with depression according to genome-wide analysis. High correlation between predicted and actual HAM-D warrants further evaluation of plasma AA and leptin as an objective laboratory test for the assessment of depression severity in female MDD patients","Steiner, Johann; Dobrowolny, Henrik; Guest, Paul C; Bernstein, Hans-Gert; Fuchs, Dietmar; Roeser, Julien; Summergrad, Paul; Oxenkrug, Gregory F",Int J Tryptophan Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045868/; https://doi.org/10.1177/11786469211016474,167
605038,TERAVOLT: Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration,2020-05-16,"The diagnosis of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) types 1/2 is difficult due to their rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations. APS-1 development can be identified with assays for autoantibodies against cytokines, and APS-2 development with organ-specific antibodies. In this study, a microarray-based multiplex assay was proposed for simultaneous detection of both organ-specific (anti-21-OH, anti-GAD-65, anti-IA2, anti-ICA, anti-TG, and anti-TPO) and APS-1-specific (anti-IFN-ω, anti-IFN-α-2a, and anti-IL-22) autoantibodies. Herein, 206 serum samples from adult patients with APS-1, APS-2, isolated autoimmune endocrine pathologies or non-autoimmune endocrine pathologies and from healthy donors were analyzed. The prevalence of autoantibodies differed among the groups of healthy donors and patients with non-, mono- and multi-endocrine diseases. APS-1 patients were characterized by the presence of at least two specific autoantibodies (specificity 99.5%, sensitivity 100%). Furthermore, in 16 of the 18 patients, the APS-1 assay revealed triple positivity for autoantibodies against IFN-ω, IFN-α-2a and IL-22 (specificity 100%, sensitivity 88.9%). No anti-cytokine autoantibodies were found in the group of patients with non-APS-1 polyendocrine autoimmunity. The accuracy of the microarray-based assay compared to ELISA for organ-specific autoantibodies was 88.8–97.6%. This multiplex assay can be part of the strategy for diagnosing and predicting the development of APS.","Savvateeva, Elena N.; Yukina, Marina Yu.; Nuralieva, Nurana F.; Filippova, Marina A.; Gryadunov, Dmitry A.; Troshina, Ekaterina A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071130/,167

METHODS: We sought to summarize the current telemedicine environment in order to highlight the important changes triggered by the novel coronavirus pandemic, as well as highlight how the current crisis may inform the future of telemedicine. RESULTS: At many institutions, the number of telemedicine visits dramatically increased within days following the institution of novel coronavirus pandemic restrictions on in-person clinical encounters. Prior to the pandemic, telemedicine utilization was weak throughout surgical specialties due to regulatory and reimbursement barriers. As part of the pandemic response, the USA government temporarily relaxed various telemedicine restrictions and provided additional telemedicine funding. DISCUSSION: The post-pandemic role of telemedicine is dependent on permanent regulatory solutions.

To develop early anti-viral therapies and proactive administration, it is important to understand the very first steps of this process. Plant somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the earliest and most studied model for de novo programming upon severe stress that, in contrast to virus attacks, promotes individual cell and organism survival. We argued that transcript level profiles of target genes established from in vitro SE induction as reference compared to virus-induced profiles can identify differential virus traits that link to harmful reprogramming. To validate this hypothesis, we selected a standard set of genes named ‘ReprogVirus’. This approach was recently applied and published. It resulted in identifying ‘CoV-MAC-TED’, a complex trait that is promising to support combating SARS-CoV-2-induced cell reprogramming in primary infected nose and mouth cells. In this perspective, we aim to explain the rationale of our scientific approach. We are highlighting relevant background knowledge on SE, emphasize the role of alternative oxidase in plant reprogramming and resilience as a learning tool for designing human virus-defense strategies and, present the list of selected genes.

In our ""set up"" cohort we found that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detectable in 100% of patients tested 14 days post positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Serum samples taken from pregnant women in 2018 were used as a negative control group with zero false positives. We also analysed samples from patients with non-COVID-19 viral infections, paraproteinaemia or autoantibodies and found false positive results in 6/179. Modification of the sensitivity threshold to five standard deviations from the mean of the control group eliminated all false positive result in the set up cohort. We confirmed the validity of the test with a revised threshold on an independent prospective ""validation cohort"" of patient samples. Taking data from both cohorts we report a sensitivity of the Mount Sinai assay of 96.6% (28/29) and specificity of 100% (299/299) using a revised threshold cut-off, at a time point at least 14 days since the diagnostic antigen test. Finally, we conducted a health economic probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) on the costs of producing the tests, and the mean cost we estimate to be 13.63 pounds sterling (95%CI 9.63 - 18.40), allowing its cost effectiveness to be tested against other antibody tests. In summary, we report that the Mount Sinai IgG ELISA assay is highly sensitive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection, however modification of thresholding was required to minimise false positive results.","Rushworth, S.

Design and methods: 94 parents of adolescents (11–18 years old, M = 13.90, SD = 1.85) participated at different times during the state of alert in Spain. 91.5% were mothers. Their ages ranged from 35 to 63 years (M = 46.54; SD = 5.09). The variables assessed were anxiety, depression and stress (DASS), moods (MOOD), somatization (SCL) and resilience (CD-RISC). Descriptive analyses, t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, and hierarchical regressions were performed. All this by means of a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design. Results: at the beginning of the confinement parents showed low levels of emotional distress and moderate levels of positive emotionality and resilience. However, those with a prior psychological problem, who had lost their job, or had lost someone to the pandemic, showed worse emotional adjustment. Resilience was relevant in predicting anxiety-depressive symptoms, and a low level of happiness was relevant in predicting stress. Emotional symptoms improved over time, and resilience remained stable. Conclusions: the emotional impact of COVID over time is influenced by mood, mental health, and resilience. In addition, parents who had a previous health problem, had lost their job or a loved one, had a worse adjustment. Practical implications: it is important to carry out intervention programs that increase resilience, treating parents who require it, since their emotional adjustment has repercussions on the emotional adjustment of family system.","Valero-Moreno, Selene; Lacomba-Trejo, Laura; Tamarit, Alicia; Pérez-Marín, Marián; Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada",J Pediatr Nurs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882596321000312; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882596321000312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608182/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.01.028,167

These properties could be improved by chemical and/or physical modification, including grafting and/or crosslinking techniques. In this work, acrylonitrile (ACN) has been successfully grafted onto ENR- 25 by a radical photopolymerization technique. The effect of (ACN to ENR) mole ratios on chemical structure and interaction, thermo-mechanical behaviour and that related to the viscoelastic properties of the polymer was investigated. The existence of the –C≡N functional group at the end-product of ACN-g-ENR is confirmed by infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. An enhanced grafting efficiency (~57%) was obtained after ACN was grafted onto the isoprene unit of ENR- 25 and showing a significant improvement in thermal stability and dielectric properties. The viscoelastic behaviour of the sample analysis showed an increase of storage modulus up to 150 × 10(3) MPa and the temperature of glass transition (T(g)) was between −40 and 10 °C. The loss modulus, relaxation process, and tan delta were also described. Overall, the ACN-g-ENR shows a distinctive improvement in characteristics compared to ENR and can be widely used in many applications where natural rubber is used but improved thermal and mechanical properties are required.

611876,COVID-19 vaccine-related lymph node activation – patterns of uptake on PET-CT,2021-04-20,"INTRODUCTION: Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States, contributing to suboptimal care, serious patient injury, and mortality among beneficiaries in the Military Health System. Recent media reports have scrutinized the safety and quality of military healthcare, including surgical complications, infection rates, clinician competence, and a reluctance of leaders to investigate operational processes. Military leaders have aggressively committed to a continuous cycle of process improvement and a culture of safety with the goal to transform the Military Health System into a high-reliability organization. The cornerstone of patient safety is effective clinician communication. Military surgical teams are particularly susceptible to communication error because of potential barriers created by military rank, clinical specialty, and military culture. With an operations tempo requiring the military to continually deploy small, agile surgical teams, effective interpersonal communication among these team members is vital to providing life-saving care on the battlefield. METHODS: The purpose of our exploratory, prospective, cross-sectional study was to examine the association between social distance and interpersonal communication in a military surgical setting. Using social network analysis to map the relationships and structure of interpersonal relations, we developed six networks (interaction frequency, close working relationship, socialization, advice-seeking, advice-giving, and speaking-up/voice) and two models that represented communication effectiveness ratings for each participant. We used the geodesic or network distance as a predictor of team member network position and assessed the relationship of distance to pairwise communication effectiveness with permutation-based quadratic assignment procedures. We hypothesized that the shorter the network geodesic distance between two individuals, the smaller the difference between their communication effectiveness. RESULTS: We administered a network survey to 50 surgical teams comprised of 45 multidisciplinary clinicians with 522 dyadic relationships. There were significant and positive correlations between differences in communication effectiveness and geodesic distances across all five networks for both general (r = 0.819-0.894, P < 0.001 for all correlations) and task-specific (r = 0.729-0.834, P < 0.001 for all correlations) communication. This suggests that a closer network ties between individuals is associated with smaller differences in communication effectiveness. In the quadratic assignment procedures regression model, geodesic distance predicted task-specific communication (ß = 0.056-0.163, P < 0.001 for all networks). Interaction frequency, socialization, and advice-giving had the largest effect on task-specific communication difference. We did not uncover authority gradients that affect speaking-up patterns among surgical clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for safety and quality. Stronger connections in the interaction frequency, close working relationship, socialization, and advice networks were associated with smaller differences in communication effectiveness. The ability of team members to communicate clinical information effectively is essential to building a culture of safety and is vital to progress towards high-reliability. The military faces distinct communication challenges because of policies to rotate personnel, the presence of a clear rank structure, and antifraternization regulations. Despite these challenges, overall communication effectiveness in military teams will likely improve by maintaining team consistency, fostering team cohesion, and allowing for frequent interaction both inside and outside of the work environment.","Stucky, Christopher H; De Jong, Marla J; Kabo, Felichism W",Mil Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665390/; https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usz330,167

We assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the Ivorian public regarding preventive measures, conducting a hybrid survey across the country. Participants were invited to complete a questionnaire online, by phone, or face-to-face. Chi-squared, Fisher’s exact, and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to compare the frequency of responses regarding compliance with preventive measures. Data were validated for 564 individuals. Over one-third of respondents believed that COVID-19 was related to non-natural causes. Though the disease was perceived as severe, respondents did not consider it to be highly infectious. Overall, 35.6% of respondents fully trust health officials in the management of the pandemic, and 34.6% trusted them moderately. Individuals who believed COVID-19 was a disease caused by a pathogen and the well-educated were likely to comply with preventive measures.

This systematic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) on reducing pain, fear and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing needle-related procedures. Pain, anxiety, fear, changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as satisfaction were evaluated as outcomes during needle-related procedures in VR compared with standard care conditions. A meta-analysis was performed, taking into account online databases. Two authors independently conducted literature searches in December 2020. The last search was conducted in March 2021 from a total of 106 records, 7 met our inclusion criteria. One study was excluded from the meta-analysis due to insufficient data. VR was applied as a distractor during venous access. Statistically significant benefits of using VR were shown in children’s pain scores, where VR significantly decreased symptoms (n = 3204 patients, MD = −2.85; 95% CI −3.57, −2.14, for the Wong–Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale and n = 2240 patients, MD = −0.19; 95% CI −0.58, 0.20, for the Faces Pain Scale—Revised). The analysis of fear, anxiety and satisfaction scores revealed no significant differences between the conditions, as the studies were too heterogeneous to be pooled. Distraction using virtual reality may be an effective intervention for reducing pain in children undergoing needle-related medical procedures. However, further research in the implementation of VR as a distractor for children and adolescents is required, due to the limited research into this field.","Czech, Oliver; Wrzeciono, Adam; Rutkowska, Anna; Guzik, Agnieszka; Kiper, Paweł; Rutkowski, Sebastian",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362032/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153248,167

The present analysis investigates how the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the myocardial infarction (MI) network of Emilia-Romagna (Italy). METHODS: Based on Emilia-Romagna mortality registry and administrative data from all the hospitals from January 2017 to June 2020, we analysed: i) temporal trend in MI hospital admissions; ii) characteristics, management, and 30-day mortality of MI patients; iii) out-of-hospital mortality for cardiac cause. FINDINGS: Admissions for MI declined on February 22, 2020 (IRR -19.5%, 95%CI from -8.4% to -29.3%, p = 0.001), and further on March 5, 2020 (IRR -21.6%, 95%CI from -9.0% to -32.5%, p = 0.001). The return to pre-COVID-19 MI-related admission levels was observed from May 13, 2020 (IRR 34.3%, 95%CI 20.0%-50.2%, p<0.001). As compared to those before the pandemic, MI patients admitted during and after the first wave were younger and with fewer risk factors. The 30-day mortality remained in line with that expected based on previous years (ratio observed/expected was 0.96, 95%CI 0.84–1.08). MI patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were few (1.5%) but showed poor prognosis (around 5-fold increase in 30-day mortality). In 2020, the number of out-of-hospital cardiac deaths was significantly higher (ratio observed/expected 1.17, 95%CI 1.08–1.27). The peak was reached in April. INTERPRETATION: In Emilia-Romagna, MI hospitalizations significantly decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management and outcomes of hospitalized MI patients remained unchanged, except for those with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A concomitant increase in the out-of-hospital cardiac mortality was observed.

We aimed to identify factors related to lapses in PPE use that may influence transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to healthcare personnel (HCP). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care medical center in Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 345 HCP who sustained a significant occupational exposure to a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from May 13, 2020, through November 30, 2020, were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 8 HCP (2.3%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection during their 14-day postexposure quarantine. A lack of eye protection during the care of a patient with COVID-19 was associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the postexposure quarantine (relative risk [RR], 10.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–82.39; P = .009). Overall, the most common reason for a significant exposure was the use of a surgical face mask instead of a respirator during an aerosol-generating procedure (55.9%). However, this was not associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the postexposure quarantine (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96–1; P = 1). Notably, transmission primarily occurred in units that did not regularly care for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The use of universal eye protection is a critical aspect of PPE to prevent patient-to-HCP transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Shah, Vishal P.; Breeher, Laura E.; Hainy, Caitlin M.; Swift, Melanie D.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975656/,167

Although biological sex is an important determinant, gender roles and norms influence the exposure and vulnerability to risk factors for noncommunicable diseases. Norms and roles might be reinforced or change due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) related measures as well as the exposure to risk factors for childhood obesity. COVID‐19 related changes, such as home confinement, influence a child's risk of obesity. Using Dahlgren and Whitehead's model of the main determinants of health, this paper aims to provide a roadmap for future research on sex, gender, and childhood obesity during the time of COVID‐19. It examines how COVID‐19 has led to important changes in children's general socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental conditions, social and community networks, and individual lifestyle factors and how these may affect a child's risk for obesity. It focuses on the influence of gender and sex and outlines key considerations and indicators to examine in future studies concerned with promoting health and gender equity and equality. We need to understand the differential impact of COVID‐19 related measures on girls' and boys' risk for obesity to adequately react with preventive measures, policies, and programs.","Knebusch, Veronika; Williams, Julianne; Yordi Aguirre, Isabel; Weber, Martin W.; Rakovac, Ivo; Breda, João",Obes Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184392/; https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13222,167

To examine the sustainability of effects, we assessed students’ fraction knowledge immediately after the 4 weeks and once again after a period of additional 8 weeks. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that students only benefitted from evidence-based instruction if digital support was available in addition.

Study Design: Paired maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery from women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at any point during pregnancy. Difference in transmission of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies across the placenta were analyzed according to symptomatic vs asymptomatic infection and latency from time of infection to delivery. Sera was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Suthar et al, 2020). Result(s): A total of 23 paired maternal-infant dyads were included in the study. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 37.7 weeks' (+/- 1.2, range 31.0 - 40) and the mean gestational age at delivery was 38.4 (+/- 0.3, range 34.4 - 40.1). All maternal delivery serum samples had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody (n=23) and 91% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgM (n = 21). Among cord blood samples, 87% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG (n= 20), while 13% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody (n=3). In stratifying the study sample based on latency from initial SARS-COV-2 test positive to delivery, there were no significant differences in the end point titers of maternal or cord blood IgG or IgM levels (Figure 1). Similarly, no significant differences were found based on indication for testing (asymptomatic testing vs symptomatic/person under investigation - Figure 2). All three cord blood samples with detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were from symptomatic women (Figure 2). Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that pregnant women in this cohort almost uniformly mounted an IgG and IgM response to SARS-CoV-2, even if asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis;almost all samples showed robust transfer of IgG antibodies into the cord blood. These results form a promising foundation for further investigation into the maternal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy.

Methods We developed a probabilistic framework to analyse detailed patient trajectories from 198,846 hospitalisations in France during the first nine months of the pandemic. Our model accounts for the varying age- and sex- distribution of patients, and explore changes in outcome probabilities as well as length of stay. Findings We found that there were marked changes in the age and sex of hospitalisations over the study period. In particular, the proportion of hospitalised individuals that were >80y varied between 27% and 48% over the course of the epidemic, and was lowest during the inter-peak period. The probability of hospitalised patients entering ICU dropped from 0·25 (0·24–0·26) to 0·13 (0·12–0·14) over the four first months as case numbers fell, before rising to 0·19 (0·19–0·20) during the second wave. The probability of death followed a similar trajectory, falling from 0·25 (0·24–0·26) to 0·10 (0·09–0·11) after the first wave before increasing again during the second wave to 0·19 (0·18–0·19). Overall, we find both the probability of death and the probability of entering ICU were significantly correlated with COVID-19 ICU occupancy. Interpretation There are large scale trends in patients outcomes by age, sex and over time. These need to be considered in ongoing healthcare planning efforts.

Amidst the bleak economic outlook, investors’ concerns over the pandemic spread rapidly through social media but wore out shortly. Similarly, the crash only caused a relatively short-lived bear market, which bottomed out and recovered quickly. Meanwhile, technology stocks have grabbed the spotlight as the digitally advanced sectors seemed to show resilience in this Coronavirus-plagued market. This paper aims to examine market sentiments using social media to predict the stock market performance before, during and after the March 2020 stock market crash. In addition, using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Taxonomy of Sectoral Digital-intensity Framework, we identified market sectors that have outperformed others as the market sentiment was impacted by the unfolding of the pandemic. The daily stock performance of a usable sample of 1619 firms from 34 sectors was first examined via a combination of hierarchical clustering and shape-based distance measure. This was then tested against a time series of daily price changes through augmented vector auto-regression. Results show that market sentiments towards the pandemic have significantly impacted the price differences. More interestingly, the stock performance across sectors is characterized by the level of digital intensity, with the most digitally advanced sectors demonstrating resilience against negative market sentiments on the pandemic. This research is among the first to demonstrate how digital intensity mitigates the negative effect of a crisis on stock market performance.","Guan, Chong; Liu, Wenting; Cheng, Jack Yu-Chao",Ann,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40745-021-00353-w,167

Here we demonstrate that Pin1 is a key cellular molecule necessary for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) propagation. In this study, siRNA-mediated silencing of Pin1 expression markedly suppressed the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. In addition, several recently generated Pin1 inhibitors showed strong inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 proliferation, measured by both viral mRNA and protein synthesis, and alleviated the cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. One compound, termed H-77, was found to block SARS-CoV-2 proliferation at an EC(50) below 5 μM regardless of whether it was added to the culture medium prior to or after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inhibition of viral N protein mRNA synthesis by H-77 implies that the molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is likely to be associated with viral gene transcription or earlier steps. Another Pin1 inhibitor, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)—a commercially available drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and which both activates the retinoic acid receptor and inhibits the activity of Pin1—similarly reduced the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, the results indicate that Pin1 inhibitors could serve as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19.","Yamamotoya, Takeshi; Nakatsu, Yusuke; Kanna, Machi; Hasei, Shun; Ohata, Yukino; Encinas, Jeffrey; Ito, Hisanaka; Okabe, Takayoshi; Asano, Tomoichiro; Sakaguchi, Takemasa",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535740/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97972-3,167

So far, only a limited number of studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic on the mental health of parents having children with cancer. This study investigated the hope, and relevant influencing factors (depression, anxiety, demographic data) among parents whose children had retinoblastoma (RB) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey and a convenient sampling survey were conducted on 317 parents of RB children admitted to the Ninth People’s Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, and Qilu Children’s Hospital of Shandong University. The survey tools included Demographic Questionnaire, Herth Hope Index (HHI), The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ)-2. RESULTS: The hope level score of the parents of RB patients was (35.36 ± 4.42), which was at the medium level. The highest dimension of hope score was inner positive readiness and expectancy (12.07 ± 1.57), and the lowest dimension was interconnectedness with self and others (11.50 ± 1.64). The incidence rate of depression and anxiety was 29.97% (95/317) and 41.32% (131/317), respectively. Monoculus or binoculus disease, sleep status, health status, and depression /anxiety had statistically significant effects on the parental hope level (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that time since diagnosis, education level, treatment type and depression were independent influencing factors (p < 0.05), accounting for 22.60% of the variation in hope level.

We applied a backcasting approach, coupled with Monte Carlo methods, to estimate a distribution for the true (population) cumulative number of infections (infected and recovered) for 15 countries where reliable data are available. We find a positive relationship between the testing rate per 1,000 people and the implied true detection rate of COVID-19, and a negative relationship between the proportion who test positive and the implied true detection rate. Our estimates suggest that the true number of people infected across our sample of 15 developed countries is 18.2 (5-95% CI: 11.9-39.0) times greater than the reported number of cases. In individual countries, the true number of cases exceeds the reported figure by factors that range from 1.7 (5-95% CI: 1.1-3.6) for Australia to 35.6 (5-95% CI: 23.2-76.3) for Belgium.","Phipps, S.

In this study, our purpose is to evaluate whether or not these videos are an appropriate educational source for surgeons by analyzing their quality and content, in an environment of reduced elective operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: YouTube video search was performed by entering keywords such as CRS and HIPEC, cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and HIPEC. A total of 115 videos were found. Videos were divided into two groups as those containing operation videos and those that do not (slides, congress presentations, and informative videos). And then, for evaluating operation videos, a scoring system was defined based on CRS + HIPEC steps as defined by Sugarbaker and video quality. Results: There were 45 operation videos and 70 videos of other content. The total number of views, number of views per day, and the total number of likes and comments were all significantly higher in the operation video group (p values 0.003-0.002-0.004-0.002). No statistically significant difference was found in the median values of the number of views, likes, and dislikes; the number of views per day; the number of comments; and the dates of uploads within different video-scoring system groups. Conclusion: Our study shows that there is an increasing interest in CRS + HIPEC videos on YouTube. On the other hand, when the educational value of these videos that are receiving attention is considered, we believe it is not right to adjudicate due to the fact that the numbers are very low.","Morkavuk, Şevket Barış; Badem, Atilla",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522479/,167

Due to its anti-apoptotic activity, Bcl-xL co-determines the viability of various virally infected cells. Their survival may determine the effectiveness of viral replication and spread, dynamics of systemic infection, and viral pathogenesis. In this paper, we have reviewed the role of Bcl-xL in the context of host infection by eight different RNA and DNA viruses: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), Maraba virus (MRBV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and coronavirus (CoV). We have described an influence of viral infection on the intracellular level of Bcl-xL and discussed the impact of Bcl-xL-dependent cell survival control on infection-accompanying pathogenic events such as tissue damage or oncogenesis. We have also presented anti-viral treatment strategies based on the pharmacological regulation of Bcl-xL expression or activity.","Wyżewski, Zbigniew; Świtlik, Weronika; Mielcarska, Matylda Barbara; Gregorczyk-Zboroch, Karolina Paulina",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669408/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22041956,167

METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on human nasal epithelial cells following stimulation of the intracellular viral recognition receptor RIG-I. Next, we evaluated whether measuring identified host mRNAs and proteins from patient nasopharyngeal swabs could predict the presence of a respiratory virus in the sample. RESULTS: Our first study showed that a signature of 3 mRNAs, CXCL10, IFIT2, and OASL, predicted respiratory virus detection with an accuracy of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9–1.0), and identified proteins correlating with virus detection. In a second study, elevated CXCL11 or CXCL10 protein levels identified samples containing respiratory viruses, including viruses not on the initial test panel. Overall area under the curve (AUC) values were: CXCL11 AUC = 0.901 (95% CI, 0.86–0.94); CXCL10 AUC = 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80–0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Host antiviral mRNAs and single host proteins detectable using nasopharyngeal swabs accurately predict the presence of viral infection.

As COVID‐19 vaccine research continues to progress, the world's eyes are turning toward medicine regulators. COVID‐19 vaccines need to be authorized for use in each country in which the pharmaceutical industry intends to commercialize its product. This results in a patchwork of regulations that can influence the speed at which products are launched and the standards that govern them. In this research forum article, we discuss several key questions about COVID‐19 vaccine regulations that should shape research on the next stage of the pandemic response. We call for a research agenda that looks into the political economy of pharmaceutical regulation, particularly from a comparative perspective, including Global South countries.","da Fonseca, Elize M.; Jarman, Holly; King, Elizabeth J.; Greer, Scott L.",Regul Gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226834/; https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.12413,167

Similar to the parental strain, the infectious clone virus (icPDCoV) replicated efficiently in cell culture and caused mild clinical symptoms in piglets. To investigate putative viral interferon (IFN) antagonists, we generated two mutant viruses: a nonstructural protein 15 mutant virus that encodes a catalytically-inactive endoribonuclease (icEnUmut), and an accessory gene NS6-deletion virus in which the NS6 gene was replaced with the mNeonGreen sequence (icDelNS6/nG). By infecting PK1 cells with these recombinant PDCoVs, we found that icDelNS6/nG elicited similar levels of type I IFN responses as icPDCoV, however icEnUmut stimulated robust type I IFN responses, demonstrating that the deltacoronavirus endoribonuclease, but not NS6, functions as an IFN antagonist in PK1 cells. Collectively, the construction of a full-length infectious clone and the identification of an IFN-antagonistic endoribonuclease will aid in the development of live-attenuated deltacoronavirus vaccines.","Deng, Xufang; Buckley, Alexandra C.; Pillatzki, Angela; Lager, Kelly M.; Baker, Susan C.; Faaberg, Kay S.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682220302245?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.11.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682220302245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33220618/,167

Data were analyzed using Minitab at a significance level of .05. The execution of preventative measures in patients hospitalized with a HAI (n = 44) and the use of PPE by health care workers (n = 514) have been observed. The presence of defined PPE items usage differs on the basis of the department type (P = .0004). The correctness of PPE use differs on the basis of profession (P < .001), hand disinfection before PPE use (P < .001), use of all PPE (P < .001), and hand hygiene after PPE use (P < .001). General nurses had a higher observed frequency of hand hygiene (53.3%) than physicians (42.4%).

620637,Hypothesis: Mechanisms That Prevent Recovery in Prolonged ICU Patients Also Underlie Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS),2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a primary strategy to protect health care personnel (HCP) from infectious diseases. When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. METHODS: The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. RESULTS: The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. DISCUSSION: A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. CONCLUSIONS: Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.","Jones, Rachael M.; Bleasdale, Susan C.; Maita, Dayana; Brosseau, Lisa M.",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655319306546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.06.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358421/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655319306546,167

Ensuring sufficient resources for health is necessary for basic infrastructure including vaccines; the overall level of health expenditure and the public sources of funding are important. Funding for public health services, including infection prevention and control, surveillance, and information systems, is fundamental to ensure health systems are prepared for and respond to health emergencies. Funding should be made available for a quick and effective response to emergencies, requiring a supportive flexible public financial management system. Moreover, it is essential to mitigate the potential risks of health system collapses through innovative ways, for example, telemedicine, and mobilizing private sector providers.

Global platforms for cross-border coordination and cooperation, set up by the WHO and other global health partnerships, were constrained by national self-interest. Arguably, the lack of a global supranational (or post-Westphalian) authority in global health governance is one important structural reason for the fragmented, chaotic and ineffective global health response to a post-Westphalian challenge like Covid-19. We argue that the failure of Westphalian governance responses to the pandemic provides a unique window of opportunity for post-Westphalian governance structures to be established and play a vital role in reforming international pandemic preparedness. While we realise that this is unlikely to happen anytime soon at the global level, we show that a comprehensive post-Westphalian health governance framework is indeed emerging at EU level in the form of a European Health Union. Through a combined conceptualisation of supranational governance and the securitisation process of international health crises, we demonstrate how COVID-19 has pushed the door wide open for the emergence of post-Westphalian health governance at EU level coordinated by the European Commission.

To document time reduction patients spent in clinical settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients with prior exposure to at least three natalizumab or two 300mg ocrelizumab infusions were approved for rapid protocols. A retrospective audit and survey were completed. Results: We analysed 269 rapid natalizumab infusions and 100 rapid ocrelizumab infusions. Infusion related reactions during the natalizumab or ocrelizumab infusions occurred in two patients (1.52%) and eight patients (8%), respectively. All infusion related reactions were mild to moderate and did not require infusion discontinuation. No infusion reactions occurred during the post-infusion observation. Patient experience was positive. Conclusion: Frequency or severity of infusion related reactions in rapid infusions were no different compared to published data.

622035,Education: The role of the first siderophore cephalosporin Fetcroja(®) (cefiderocol) in UK clinical practice: introduction,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: In order to develop a district child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) plan, it is vital to engage with a range of stakeholders involved in providing CAMH services, given the complexities associated with delivering such services. Hence this study sought to explore multisectoral dynamics in providing CAMH care in one resource-constrained South African district as a case study, towards informing the development of a model for district mental health plan and generating lessons for mental health systems strengthening to support CAMH services using the Health Systems Dynamics (HSD) framework. HSD provides a suitable structure for analysing interactions between different elements within the health system and other sectors. METHODS: Purposive sampling of 60 key informants was conducted to obtain an in-depth understanding of various stakeholders' experiences and perceptions of the available CAMH services in the district. The participants include stakeholders from the Departments of Health (DoH), Basic Education (DBE), community-based/non-governmental organizations and caregivers of children receiving CAMH care. The data was categorized according to the elements of the HSD framework. RESULTS: The HSD framework helped in identifying the components of the health systems that are necessary for CAMH service delivery. At a district level, the shortage of human resources, un-coordinated CAMH management system, lack of intersectoral collaboration and the low priority given to the CAMH system negatively impacts on the service providers' experiences of providing CAMH services. Services users' experiences of access to available CAMH services was negatively impacted by financial restrictions, low mental health literacy and stigmatization. Nevertheless, the study participants perceived the available CAMH specialists to be competent and dedicated to delivering quality services but will benefit from systems strengthening initiatives that can expand the workforce and equip non-specialists with the required skills, resources and adequate coordination. CONCLUSIONS: The need to develop the capacity of all the involved stakeholders in relation to CAMH services was imperative in the district. The need to create a mental health outreach team and equip teachers and caregivers with skills required to promote mental wellbeing, promptly identify CAMH conditions, refer appropriately and adhere to a management regimen was emphasized.","Babatunde, Gbotemi Bukola; van Rensburg, André Janse; Bhana, Arvin; Petersen, Inge",Int J Ment Health Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020703/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00406-2,167

623375,Immunogenicity of a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine after failed vaccination in a lymphoma patient,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a number of instances of large-scale panic buying. Taking the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, this paper explores the impact of panic in uncertain environments on panic buying behavior. Under certain circumstances, the spread of rumors about shortage of goods is likely to cause large-scale panic buying. This paper focuses on the study of such panic buying caused by online rumors. METHODS: Firstly, based on the improved BA network, this paper constructs a directed network for public opinion communication and integrates an offline communication network to build a two-layer synchronous coupling network based on online and offline communications. Secondly, the individual decision model and the panic emotion transmission model under the uncertain environment are constructed. Netizens judge the authenticity of network information, determine their own panic degree according to the above two models, and judge whether they participate in the panic buying based on the above factors. Finally, the spread of the public opinion of goods buying under the panic state is simulated and analyzed. RESULTS: The experimental results of the two-layer synchronous network that integrates offline interaction are significantly different from the results of pure online interaction, which increases the speed of public opinions spread after offline interaction and affects a wider range of groups. Under the condition of sufficient supplies, panic in local areas will not cause large-scale panic buying on the whole network. However, the results under the same parameters suggest that if there is a shortage of supplies, panic will spread quickly across the network, leading to large-scale panic buying. It is very important to ensure sufficient supply of materials at the beginning of the spread of rumors, which can reduce the number of buyers. However, if there is a shortage of goods before the panic dissipates in the later stage, there will still be a large-scale rush purchase. CONCLUSION: These results explain the reasons why it is difficult to stop the buying events in many areas under the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the uncertain environment, the panic caused by people’s fear of stock shortage promotes the occurrence of large-scale rush buying. Therefore, in the event of major public health events, ensuring adequate supply of materials is the top priority.","Li, Qianqian; Chen, Tinggui; Yang, Jianjun; Cong, Guodong",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390730/; https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s280825,167

Data were collected from 2081 adults (16+) using a module of questions incorporated into the NSW Health Adult Population Health Survey. High levels of willingness to comply were reported with 73% either very or extremely willing to receive vaccination, 67% willing to isolate themselves, 58% willing to wear a face mask, and 48% willing to comply with all three behaviors. Further analysis indicated concern for self and family and higher levels of education were associated with high levels of willingness to comply. Younger people (16–24) were the least willing to comply; especially with wearing a face mask. Those with children reported higher levels of willingness to receive vaccination, and respondents who speak a language other than English at home were less willing to isolate themselves or comply with all behaviors. These findings provide a baseline measure of anticipated public compliance with key public health behaviors in the event of an influenza pandemic in the Australian population, and help to identify groups that may be more resistant to individual measures and may require additional attention in terms of risk communication strategies or health education.","Taylor, Melanie; Raphael, Beverley; Barr, Margo; Agho, Kingsley; Stevens, Garry; Jorm, Louisa",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s4810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22312204/,167

Social restrictions aimed at flattening the curve may be associated with an increase in mental health problems and have raised concerns regarding their effect on alcohol consumption. The objective of this study was to characterize changes in alcohol use during lockdown in Ireland and associations with drinking motives and psychopathological symptoms. METHODS: We collected data from 713 adults (aged 18–60) during the second lockdown period (October/December 2020). By means of an online survey, participants self-reported their alcohol use before COVID and during lockdown. Motives to drink and psychopathological symptoms were also recorded. RESULTS: Our findings showed that 66% decreased their alcohol consumption, while 15% increased their alcohol consumption. An older age and coping motives were the strongest predictors of increased alcohol use during lockdown. Depression and hostility were the specific psychopathological dimensions associated with drinking to cope. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults who drink to cope—mainly with depression symptomatology—are an important at-risk population, in line with predictions from alcohol self-medication frameworks. Future research is needed to incorporate strategies into the public mental health ecosystem.","Carbia, Carina; García-Cabrerizo, Rubén; Cryan, John F; Dinan, Timothy G",Alcohol Alcohol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557890/; https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/agab067,167

The number of people infected with COVID-19 virus in Brazil was about 529,405, the number of death is 30046, the number of recovered is 211080, and the number is subject to increase. This is due to the delay by a number of countries in general, and Brazil in particular, in taking preventive and proactive measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, we propose to study an optimal control approach with delay in state and control variables in our mathematical model proposed by kouidere et al. which describes the dynamics of the transmission of the COVID-19. That the time with delay represent the delay to applying preventive precautions measures. Pontryagin’s maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method.

624483,Hand hygiene and the novel coronavirus pandemic: The role of healthcare workers,2020-03-19,"The Covid‐19 pandemic affects societies worldwide, challenging not only health sectors but also public administration systems in general. Understanding why public administrations perform well in the current situation—and in times of crisis more generally—is theoretically of great importance; and identifying concrete factors driving successful administrative performance under today’s extraordinary circumstances could still improve current crisis responses. This article studies patterns of sound administrative performance with a focus on networks and knowledge management within and between crises. Subsequently, it draws on empirical evidence from two recent public administration surveys conducted in Germany in order to test derived hypotheses. The results of tests for group differences and regression analyses demonstrate that administrations that were structurally prepared, learned during preceding crises, and that displayed a high quality in their network cooperation with other administrations and with the civil society, on average, performed significantly better in the respective crises.","Schomaker, Rahel M.; Bauer, Michael W.",Public Adm Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.13280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836467/,167
624519,Cancer History and Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy Independently Predict COVID-19 Mortality: A UK Tertiary Hospital Experience,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infection causes highly contagious, severe respiratory disorders and gives rise to thousands of deaths every year; however, the efficacy of currently approved defense strategies, including vaccines and neuraminidase inhibitors, is limited because the virus frequently acquires resistance via antigen drift and reassortment. It is therefore important to establish a novel, effective therapeutic strategy that is effective irrespective of viral subtype. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we identify the Ras–phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway as a host-cell regulatory mechanism for influenza virus entry. The binding of Ras to PI3K is specifically involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis, endosomal maturation, and intracellular transport of viruses, which result in decreased infectious efficacy of different subtypes of influenza viruses in cells lacking the Ras–PI3K interaction. Moreover, influenza virus infection indeed triggered Ras activation and subsequent PI3K activation in early endosomes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Ras–PI3K signaling axis acts as a host-oriented mechanism for viral internalization. Given that virus incorporation is a process conserved among virus subtypes and species, this signaling pathway may provide a target for potent, well-tolerated prophylactics and therapeutics against a broad range of viruses.","Fujioka, Yoichiro; Tsuda, Masumi; Hattori, Tomoe; Sasaki, Junko; Sasaki, Takehiko; Miyazaki, Tadaaki; Ohba, Yusuke",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21283725/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016324,167

We assessed the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the care of pediatric patients with epilepsy in Jordan. Potential predictors for seizure control during COVID-19 outbreaks were investigated. METHODS: A cross- sectional survey was conducted on pediatric patients with epilepsy in Jordan, between January and February 2021, via online questionnaires. The collected data included demographic information, epilepsy-related characteristics, views of caregivers and changes in seizure control during COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: A total number of 672 subjects were screened, 276 were eligible, and 154 completed the questionnaire adequately. Two thirds of caregivers (66.2%) reported that the COVID -19 outbreaks prevented their child from getting proper epilepsy care and 28.6% reported difficulty giving the drugs to their child on time because of loss of daily routine. In addition, more than half (55.8%) reported difficulty obtaining antiseizure medicines (ASMs). On the other hand, 77.3% of caregivers reported that seizure status remained unchanged or improved for their children during the COVID-19 and 22.7% reported worsened seizure control. The number of antiseizure medicines taken by patients (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.032), residency area (p = 0.013) and the difficulty in giving the medicine during COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.002) were the major factors influencing the seizure worsening experienced by patients. CONCLUSION: Almost one of every five patients reported worsened seizure control during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Jordan. Moreover, two thirds of caregivers reported poor epilepsy care. This finding highlights the need to implement organized and efficient telemedicine programs devoted to epilepsy care.","Al Momani, Miral; Almomani, Basima A.; Sweidan, Philip; Al-Qudah, Aladdin; Aburahma, Samah; Arafeh, Yusra",Seizure,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1059131121002879; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059131121002879; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2021.08.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496329/,167
626781,Strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for COVID-19 in India,2020,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the common diseases in children and the routine detection methods frequently fail to identify the infectious pathogens especially for viruses. The Filmarray respiratory panel (FARP) can reliably and rapidly identify viruses and bacteria pathogens. This study is to evaluate the performance and clinical significance of FARP in children. METHODS: Children diagnosed with RTIs in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) were enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples of these children were collected and the FARP assay for 17 pathogens and routine microbiological methods were performed. Clinical data of all patients was also collected and evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 90 children were enrolled into this study and 58 patients (64.4%) were positive for 13 pathogens by FARP, with 18 being detected positive with multiple-virus (31.3%, 18/58). Human rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.0%%, 17/58) were the predominant pathogen, followed by adenovirus (18.5%). Higher proportions of various pathogens were identified in the infant and toddler (0–2 years) groups with human rhinovirus/enterovirus being mostly virus. Adenovirus were common in the group aged 3–5 years, but only three pathogens including M.pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were also found in age group (6–14 years). Among 58 FARP positive patients, significant differences were found in antibiotic prescription and use of glucocorticoid between the single-organism-positive group and the multi-organism-positive group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there was significant difference in use of anti-virus and usage of glucocorticoid between severe respiratory infections group and non severe respiratory infections group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that FARP can provide the rapid detection of respiratory virus and atypical bacteria for children, especially with severe respiratory tract infections.","Pan, Fen; Wang, Bingjie; Zhang, Hong; Shi, Yingying; Xu, Qi",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-05900-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33639884/,167
626898,COVID-19 and oral diseases: Assessing manifestations of a new pathogen in oral infections.,2021-09-16,"The socio-demographic factors have a substantial impact on the overall casualties caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19). In this study, the global and local spatial association between the key socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the European regions were analyzed using the spatial regression models. A total of 31 European countries were selected for modelling and subsequent analysis. From the initial 28 demographic variables, a total of 2 (for COVID-19 cases) and 3 (for COVID-19 deaths) key variables were filtered out for the regression modelling. The spatially explicit regression modelling and mapping were done using four spatial regression models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS). Additionally, Partial Least Square (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) was performed to estimate the overall explanatory power of the regression models. For the COVID cases, the local R(2) values, which suggesting the influences of the selected demographic variables on COVID cases and death, were found highest in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Italy. The moderate local R(2) was observed for Luxembourg, Poland, Denmark, Croatia, Belgium, Slovakia. The lowest local R(2) value for COVID-19 cases was accounted for Ireland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Spain, Cyprus, Romania. Among the 2 variables, the highest local R(2) was calculated for income (R(2) = 0.71), followed by poverty (R(2) = 0.45). For the COVID deaths, the highest association was found in Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria. The moderate association was documented for Hungary, Greece, Switzerland, Slovakia, and the lower association was found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, Cyprus. This suggests that the selected demographic and socio-economic components, including total population, poverty, income, are the key factors in regulating overall casualties of COVID-19 in the European region. This study found that the demographic composition, as well as key socio-economic determinants of the country, predominantly controls the high rate of mortality and casualties caused by COVID-19. In this study, the influence of the other controlling factors, such as environmental conditions, socio-ecological status, climatic extremity, etc. have not been considered.

DESIGN: An outbreak investigation was undertaken among all residents and staff. A screening event involved nose and throat swab samples from residents and staff that were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An electronic questionnaire regarding risk factors was distributed to staff. RESULTS: 58 residents out of 1,156 (5.0%, 95% CI: 3.8 – 6.3) and 129 staff out of 510 (25.3%, 95% CI: 21.5 – 29.1) displayed COVID-19 symptoms, including six and eight confirmed, respectively. Residents reported symptoms of cough with no fever (29.3%), followed by a cough and fever (15.5%). 62.1% of symptomatic residents were 50 years or older, placing them in the group at risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Wing I had the highest attack rate (12.5%). 1,063 individuals were swabbed during the 5-day screening event, and all had negative swab results.

While quarantine, self-isolation and shutdown laws helped to effectively contain and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on trauma care in emergency departments (EDs) remains elusive. METHODS: All ED patient records from the 35-day COVID-19 shutdown (SHUTDOWN) period were retrospectively compared to a calendar-matched control period in 2019 (CTRL) as well as to a pre (PRE)- and post (POST)-shutdown period in an academic Level I Trauma Center in Berlin, Germany. Total patient and orthopedic trauma cases and contacts as well as trauma causes and injury patterns were evaluated during respective periods regarding absolute numbers, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and risk ratios (RRs). FINDINGS: Daily total patient cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 106.94 vs. 167.54) and orthopedic trauma cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 30.91 vs. 52.06) decreased during the SHUTDOWN compared to the CTRL period with IRRs of 0.64 and 0.59. While absolute numbers decreased for most trauma causes during the SHUTDOWN period, we observed increased incidence proportions of household injuries and bicycle accidents with RRs of 1.31 and 1.68 respectively. An RR of 2.41 was observed for injuries due to domestic violence. We further recorded increased incidence proportions of acute and regular substance abuse during the SHUTDOWN period with RRs of 1.63 and 3.22, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While we observed a relevant decrease in total patient cases, relative proportions of specific trauma causes and injury patterns increased during the COVID-19 shutdown in Berlin, Germany.

DESIGN: A scoping review and content analysis of online media reports. SETTING: WHO European region. METHODS: A scoping review of media reports and publications and a search of other grey literature (published from 1 January to 17 September 2020). Primary and secondary outcome measures included measures implemented by governments, public services and non-governmental and civil organisations to prevent or respond to VAWC during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our study found that in 52 of the 53 member states there was at least one measure undertaken to prevent or respond to VAWC during the pandemic. Government-led or government-sponsored measures were the most common, reported in 50 member states. Non-governmental and other civil society-led prevention and response measures were reported in 40 member states. The most common measure was the use of media and social media to raise awareness of VAWC and to provide VAWC services through online platforms, followed by measures taken to expand and/or maintain helpline services for those exposed to violence. CONCLUSION: The potential increase in VAWC during COVID-19-imposed restrictions and lockdowns resulted in adaptations and/or increases in prevention and response strategies in nearly all member states. The strength of existing public health systems influenced the requirement and choice of strategies and highlights the need for sustaining and improving violence prevention and response services. Innovative strategies employed in several member states may offer opportunities for countries to strengthen prevention and responses in the near future and during similar emergencies.","Pearson, Isabelle; Butler, Nadia; Yelgezekova, Zhamin; Nihlén, Åsa; Yordi Aguirre, Isabel; Quigg, Zara; Stöckl, Heidi",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827844/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045872,167

OBJECTIVE: The study examined the impact of population density on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in two sociodemographic divergent countries. METHODS: The study conducted a scoping review of published and unpublished articles including blogs on incidences and fatalities of COVID-19. The analysis followed qualitative description and quantitative presentation of the findings using only frequency distribution, percentages, and graphs. RESULTS: The two countries shared similar experience of “importation” of COVID-19, but while different states ordered partial lockdown in Nigeria, it was an immediate total lockdown in Italy. The physician/patient ratio is high in Italy (1 : 328) but low in Nigeria (1 : 2500), while population density is 221 in Nigeria and 206 in Italy. Daily change in incidence rate reduced to below 20% after 51 and 30 days of COVID-19 first incidence in Italy and Nigeria, respectively. Fatality rate has plummeted to below 10% after the 66(th) day in Italy but has not been stabilised in Nigeria. CONCLUSION: The authors upheld both governments' recommending measures that tilted towards personal hand-hygienic practices and social distancing. Authors suggested that if Italy with its high physician/patient ratio and lower population density compared to Nigeria could suffer high fatality from COVID-19 pandemic under four weeks, then Nigeria with its low physician/patient ratio and higher population density should prepare to face harder time if the pandemic persists.","Amoo, Emmanuel O.; Adekeye, Olujide; Olawole-Isaac, Adebanke; Fasina, Fagbeminiyi; Adekola, Paul O.; Samuel, Gbemisola W.; Akanbi, Moses A.; Oladosun, Muyiwa; Azuh, Dominic E.",ScientificWorldJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528234/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8923036,167

However, the imposed safety measures allowed to flatten the epidemic curve and hence to ease the restrictions and inaugurate, on the 4th of May 2020, the Italian phase (P) 2 of the pandemic. The present survey study, endorsed by CODRAL and AIRO-L, aimed to assess how radiotherapy (RT) departments in Lombardy have dealt with the recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire dealing with the management of pandemic was developed online and sent to all CODRAL Directors on the 10th of June 2020. Answers were collected in full anonymity one week after. RESULTS: All the 33 contacted RT facilities (100%) responded to the survey. Despite the scale of the pandemic, during P1 14 (42.4%) centres managed to safely continue the activity (≤ 10% reduction). During P2, 10 (30.3%) centres fully recovered and 14 (42.4%) reported an increase. Nonetheless, 6 (18.2%) declared no changes and, interestingly, 3 (9.1%) reduced activities. Overall, 21 centres (63.6%) reported suspected or positive cases within healthcare workforce since the beginning of the pandemic. Staff units were quarantined in 19 (57.6%) and 6 (18.2%) centres throughout P1 and P2, respectively. In the two phases, about two thirds centres registered positive or suspected cases amongst patients.

We aimed to chronicle the prevalence and correlations of symptoms and comorbidities, and associated covariates among the patients. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis [PROSPERO registration: CRD42020182677]. Databases [PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, WHO, Semantic Scholar, and COVID-19 Primer] were searched for clinical studies published in English from January 1 to April 20, 2020. The pooled prevalence of symptoms and comorbidities were identified using the random effect model, and sub-groups analysis of patients age and locations were investigated. A multivariable factor analysis was also performed to show the correlation among symptoms, comorbidities and age of the COVID-19 patients. Findings: Twenty-nine articles [China (24); Outside of China (5)], with 4,884 COVID-19 patients were included in this systematic review. The meta-analysis investigated 33 symptoms, where fever [84%], cough/dry cough [61%], and fatigue/weakness [42%] were found frequent. Out of 43 comorbidities investigated, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [61%] was a common condition, followed by hypertension [23%] and diabetes [12%]. According to the patients age, the prevalence of symptoms like fatigue/weakness, dyspnea/shortness of breath, and anorexia were highly prevalent in older adults [[≥]50 years] than younger adults [<50 years]. Diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and COPD/lung disease were more prevalent comorbidities in older adults than younger adults. The patients from outside of China had significantly higher prevalence [p<0.005] of diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, sore throat, and dyspnea, and the prevalent comorbidities in that region were diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ARDS. The multivariable factor analysis showed positive association between a group of symptoms and comorbidities, and with the patients age.

632021,Neural Alterations in Interpersonal Distance (IPD) Cognition and Its Correlation with IPD Behavior: A Systematic Review,2021-07-30,"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was presumed to arise from mutations in the 3c of a ubiquitous and largely nonpathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). However, a recent study found that one-third of FIPV isolates have an intact 3c and suggested that it is not solely involved in FIP but is essential for intestinal replication. In order to confirm these assumptions, 27 fecal and 32 FIP coronavirus isolates were obtained from resident or adopted cats from a large metropolitan shelter during 2008–2009 and their 3a–c, E, and M genes sequenced. Forty percent of coronavirus isolates from FIP tissues had an intact 3c gene, while 60% had mutations that truncated the gene product. The 3c genes of fecal isolates from healthy cats were always intact. Coronavirus from FIP diseased tissues consistently induced FIP when given either oronasally or intraperitoneally (i.p.), regardless of the functional status of their 3c genes, thus confirming them to be FIPVs. In contrast, fecal isolates from healthy cats were infectious following oronasal infection and shed at high levels in feces without causing disease, as expected for FECVs. Only one in three cats shed FECV in the feces following i.p. infection, indicating that FECVs can replicate systemically, but with difficulty. FIPVs having a mutated 3c were not shed in the feces following either oronasal or i.p. inoculation, while FIPVs with intact 3c genes were shed in the feces following oronasal but not i.p. inoculation. Therefore, an intact 3c appears to be essential for intestinal replication. Although FIPVs with an intact 3c were shed in the feces following oronasal inoculation, fecal virus from these cats was not infectious for other cats. Attempts to identify potential FIP mutations in the 3a, 3b, E, and M were negative. However, the 3c gene of FIPVs, even though appearing intact, contained many more non-synonymous amino acid changes in the 3′ one-third of the 3c protein than FECVs. An attempt to trace FIPV isolates back to enteric strains existing in the shelter was only partially successful due to the large region over which shelter cats and kittens originated, housing conditions prior to acquisition, and rapid movement through the shelter. No evidence could be found to support a recent theory that FIPVs and FECVs are genetically distinct.","Pedersen, Niels C.; Liu, Hongwei; Scarlett, Jennifer; Leutenegger, Christian M.; Golovko, Lyudmila; Kennedy, Heather; Kamal, Farina Mustaffa",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211005156; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211005156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22280883/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.12.020,167
632043,ESMO Management and treatment adapted recommendations in the COVID-19 era: Lung cancer,2020-06-23,"Background: The lung CT images of COVID-19 patients can be characterized by three different regions: Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), consolidation and pleural effusion. GCOs have been shown to precede consolidations. Quantitative characterization of these regions using radiomics can facilitate accurate diagnosis, disease progression and response to treatment. However, according to the knowledge of the author, regional CT radiomics analysis of COVID-19 patients has not been carried out. This study aims to address these by determining the radiomics features that can characterize each of the regions separately and can distinguish the regions from each other. Methods: 44 radiomics features were generated with four quantization levels for 23 CT slice of 17 patients. Two approaches were the implemented to determine the features that can differentiate between lung regions: 1) Z-score and correlation heatmaps and 2) one way ANOVA for finding statistically significantly difference (p<0.05) between the regions. Radiomics features that show agreement for all cases (Z-score, correlation and statistical significant test) were selected as suitable features. The features were then tested on 52 CT images. Results: 10 radiomics features were found to be the most suitable among 44 features. When applied on the test images, they can differentiate between GCO, consolidation and pleural effusion successfully and the difference provided by these 10 features between three lung regions are statistically significant. Conclusion: The ten robust radiomics features can be useful in extracting quantitative data from CT lung images to characterize the disease in the patient, which in turn can help in more accurate diagnosis, staging the severity of the disease and allow the clinician to plan for more successful personalized treatment for COVID-19 patients. They can also be used for monitoring the progression of COVID-19 and response to therapy for clinical trials.","Tamal, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.24.20139410v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.20139410,167

633285,Epilepsy surgery in COVID times—a unique conundrum,2021-04-10,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, COVID-19 diagnosis relies on RT-PCR testing which is relatively costly and time-consuming. To date, few studies have assessed the performance and implementation of rapid antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in a setting with a low prevalence of COVID-19 infections, such as Australia. METHODS: This study recruited participants presenting for COVID-19 testing at three Melbourne metropolitan hospitals during a period of low COVID-19 prevalence. The Abbott PanBio(TM) COVID-19 Ag point-of-care test was performed alongside RT-PCR. In addition, participants with COVID-19 notified to the Victorian Government were invited to provide additional swabs to aid validation. Implementation challenges were also documented. FINDINGS: The specificity of the Abbott PanBio(TM) COVID-19 Ag test was 99.96% (95% CI 99.73 - 100%). Sensitivity amongst participants with RT-PCR-confirmed infection was dependent upon the duration of symptoms reported, ranging from 77.3% (duration 1 to 33 days) to 100% in those within seven days of symptom onset. A range of implementation challenges were identified which may inform future COVID-19 testing strategies in a low prevalence setting. INTERPRETATION: Given the high specificity, antigen-based tests may be most useful in rapidly triaging public health and hospital resources while expediting confirmatory RT-PCR testing. Considering the limitations in test sensitivity and the potential for rapid transmission in susceptible populations, particularly in hospital settings, careful consideration is required for implementation of antigen testing in a low prevalence setting.

The funder was not involved in data analysis or manuscript preparation.","Muhi, Stephen; Tayler, Nick; Hoang, Tuyet; Ballard, Susan A.; Graham, Maryza; Rojek, Amanda; Kwong, Jason C.; Trubiano, Jason A.; Smibert, Olivia; Drewett, George; James, Fiona; Gardiner, Emma; Chea, Socheata; Isles, Nicole; Sait, Michelle; Pasricha, Shivani; Taiaroa, George; McAuley, Julie; Williams, Eloise; Gibney, Katherine B.; Stinear, Timothy P.; Bond, Katherine; Lewin, Sharon R.; Putland, Mark; Howden, Benjamin P.; Williamson, Deborah A.",Lancet Reg Health West Pac,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanwpc.2021.100115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666606521000249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937887/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666606521000249,167
633343,Potentials of Interferons and Hydroxychloroquine for the Prophylaxis and Early Treatment of COVID-19,2020,"Respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, are a leading cause of death in persons 65 years or older in both developed and developing countries. Because many attributes of immunity wane with advancing age, the elderly may be more susceptible to respiratory infections, even if they appear to be in good health. A decline in the ability of lymphoid tissues to mount an antigen-specific response (adaptive immunity) to specific microorganisms such as influenza virus or Streptococcus pneumoniae is thought to be an important factor in increasing susceptibility to respiratory tract infection with advancing age. However, abnormalities in innate immunity may also contribute to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and have been poorly characterized in the elderly. Although changes in immune parameters such as T cell subsets and immunoglobulin concentrations have been observed in respiratory secretions from older healthy individuals compared to younger subjects, the significance of these changes for protective immunity in the lung is unknown. The incidence of pneumonia may be lessened by measures such as optimizing treatment of comorbid conditions, optimizing nutrition, and addressing swallowing disorders. The use of vaccines directed against the influenza virus and S. pneumoniae appears to have made an impact on the degree of morbidity and mortality, and perhaps, the incidence, of community-acquired pneumonia. However, better stimulation of specific immune responses with improved vaccines and more widespread use of these vaccines for protection of elderly individuals are needed.","Meyer, Keith C",Respir Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11535259/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034568701002614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034568701002614,167

The effects of social stress on the most vulnerable individuals may be underestimated and it is therefore important to evaluate welfare between individuals within groups. This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups. We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order on 20 groups of 46–91 animals. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P = 0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P<0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P = 0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P<0.0001). New sows, especially with a low social status, are more vulnerable throughout gestation and could serve as indicators of non-optimal conditions.","Brajon, Sophie; Ahloy-Dallaire, Jamie; Devillers, Nicolas; Guay, Frédéric",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101733/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244704,167

METHODS: We have searched GenBank in order to identify all viral accessions that have s2m(−like) sequence motifs. Rigorous phylogenetic analyses and constrained tree topology testing were also performed in order to investigate the apparently mobile nature of s2m. RESULTS: The stem-loop s2m structure can be found in four families of + ssRNA viruses; Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae. In all of these virus families, with the possible exception of Caliciviridae, multiple gains and/or losses of s2m would have to be postulated in order to explain the distribution of this character. CONCLUSIONS: s2m appears to be a mobile genetic element with a unique evolutionary history in all of the four virus families where it can be found. Based on our findings and a review of the current literature on s2m, a hypothesis implying an RNAi-like function for the s2m element is also outlined.","Tengs, Torstein; Kristoffersen, Anja Bråthen; Bachvaroff, Tsvetan R; Jonassen, Christine Monceyron",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23618040/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-132,167

The development of rapid diagnostic kits can assist the Tzu Chi Foundation in supporting global volunteers working to provide relief during the current pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, nucleotide sequences derived from publicly available viral genome data for several domains of the SARS-CoV2 spike and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were chemically synthesized, with codon optimization for Escherichia coli protein expression. No actual viral particles were involved in these experiments. The synthesized sequences were cloned into an E. coli expression system based on pQE80L, and expressed viral proteins were subsequently purified using Ni-affinity chromatography. Western blotting was conducted using human antiviral sera to assess the response of codon-modified viral proteins to COVID-19 patient sera. RESULTS: N protein was expressed in amounts large enough to support large-scale production. The N-terminal domain, receptor-binding domain (RBD), Region 3, and the S2 domain were expressed in small but sufficient amounts for experiments. Immunoblotting results showed that anti-N IgG and anti-N IgM antibodies were detected in most patient sera, but only 60% of samples reacted with the recombinant RBD and S2 domain expressed by E. coli. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that codon-optimized SARS-CoV2 viral proteins can be expressed in E. coli and purified for rapid antibody detection kit preparation, with the codon-optimized N protein, RBD, and S2 protein demonstrating the most potential.","Toh, Yee-Huan; Huang, Yu-Weng; Chang, Yo-Chen; Chen, Yi-Ting; Hsu, Ya-Ting; Lin, Guang-Huey",Tzu Chi Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912411/; https://doi.org/10.4103/tcmj.tcmj_189_20,167

Immunological Insights,2021-05-22,"BACKGROUND: It is expected that the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt malfunctions would remain unchanged during the shelter-in-place period related to the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the number of shunt surgeries performed in a single institution during this time interval in comparison to equivalent periods in past years. METHODS: The numbers of elective and emergent/urgent shunt surgeries performed at a single institution were queried for a 28-d period starting on the third Monday of March, between years 2015 and 2020. These were further stratified by how they presented as well as the type of surgery performed. RESULTS: During the 28-d period of interest, in the years between 2015 and 2020, there was a steady increase in the number of shunt surgeries performed, with a maximum of 64 shunt surgeries performed in 2019. Of these, approximately 50% presented in urgent fashion in any given year. In the 4-wk period starting March 16, 2020, a total of 32 shunt surgeries were performed, with 15 of those cases presenting from the outpatient setting in emergent/urgent fashion. For the surgeries performed, there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of revision shunt surgeries performed. CONCLUSION: During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unexpected decrease in the number of shunt surgeries performed, and particularly in the number of revision surgeries performed.

634317,Machine learning prediction for mortality of patients diagnosed with COVID-19: a nationwide Korean cohort study,2020-10-30,"Widespread school closures occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened schools with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools were low risk and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We describe the contrasting literature on school transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by heterogeneity, or ``overdispersion'' in transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in children and youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic individual-based model to find the implications of these combined observations for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider both individual and environment/activity contributions to the transmission rate, as both are known to contribute to variability in transmission. We find that even small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly variable transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols we modeled, initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic individual, are able to prevent large transmission clusters unless the transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters do not occur in any case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring (for example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention. We suggest approaches and the rationale for mitigating these ``unfortunate events'', even if they are expected to be rare.","Tupper, P.; Colijn, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216267v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.20.20216267,167

However, the correct interpretation of the electron density of a small molecule bound to a crystal structure of a macromolecule is not trivial. Our analysis involving quality assessment of ~0.28 million small molecule–protein binding site pairs derived from crystal structures corresponding to ~66,000 PDB entries indicates that the majority (65%) of the pairs might need little (54%) or no (11%) attention. Out of the remaining 35% of pairs that need attention, 11% of the pairs (including structures with high/moderate resolution) pose serious concerns. Unfortunately, most users of crystal structures lack the training to evaluate the quality of a crystal structure against its experimental data and, in general, rely on the resolution as a ‘gold standard’ quality metric. Our work aims to sensitize the non-crystallographers that resolution, which is a global quality metric, need not be an accurate indicator of local structural quality. In this article, we demonstrate the use of several freely available tools that quantify local structural quality and are easy to use from a non-crystallographer’s perspective.

In this study, we have screened ‘drug-like’ 7476 ligands and found that over thirty ligands can effectively inhibit the TMPRSS-2 better than the control ligand. Finally, the three best drug agents L1, L2, and L6 were selected according to their average binding affinities and fitting score. These ligands interact with Asp435, Cys437, Ser436, Trp461, and Cys465 amino acid residues. The three best candidates and a reported drug Nafamostat mesylate (NAM) were selected to run 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Various properties of ligand-protein interactions obtained from MD simulation such as bonds, angle, dihedral, planarity, coulomb, and van der Waals (VdW) were used for principal component analysis (PCA) calculation. PCA discloses the evidence of the structural similarities to the corresponding complexes of L1, L2, and L6 with the complex of TMPRSS2(TM) and Nafamostat mesylate (TM-NAM). Moreover, Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) pattern recognition was generated using PCA for the investigation of structural similarities among the selected ligands. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model was built to predict the binding energy compared to the binding energy obtained from molecular docking. The MLR regression model reveals an accuracy of 80% for the prediction of the binding energy of ligands. ADMET analysis demonstrates that these drug agents are appeared to be safer inhibitors.

The major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is in contention, with the airborne route a likely transmission pathway for carrying the virus within indoor environments. Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19. We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020. To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h. Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO2, relative humidity and temperature were recorded throughout the sampling duration. Viral RNA was extracted from samples taken from the impingers and Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was applied to confirm the positivity of collected samples based on the virus genome sequence. Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients' beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative. Despite we indicated that all air samples were negative, however, we suggest further in vivo experiments should be conducted using actual patient cough, sneeze and breath aerosols in order to show the possibility of generation of the airborne size carrier aerosols and the viability fraction of the embedded virus in those carrier aerosols.","Faridi, Sasan; Niazi, Sadegh; Sadeghi, Kaveh; Naddafi, Kazem; Yavarian, Jila; Shamsipour, Mansour; Jandaghi, Nazanin Zahra Shafiei; Sadeghniiat, Khosro; Nabizadeh, Ramin; Yunesian, Masud; Momeniha, Fatemeh; Mokamel, Adel; Hassanvand, Mohammad Sadegh; MokhtariAzad, Talat",Science of The Total Environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138401; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720319148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283308/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720319148,167

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Based on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine release syndrome inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, the patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Results: All the patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients were discharged clinically recovered with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminary assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects were well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit (ICU) was prevented. Discussion/Conclusion: Itolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect is associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death. This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab, in combination with other antiviral and anticoagulant therapies, is associated with a reduction the COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.","Ramos-Suzarte, M.; Diaz, Y.; Martin, Y.; Calderon, N.

636116,Elevated transaminases and hypoalbuminemia in Covid-19 are prognostic factors for disease severity,2021-05-13,"INTRODUCTION: Within a few months coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evolved into a pandemic causing millions of cases worldwide, but it remains challenging to diagnose the disease in a timely fashion in the emergency department (ED). In this study we aimed to construct machine-learning (ML) models to predict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection based on the clinical features of patients visiting an ED during the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of all patients who received reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the ED of Baylor Scott & White All Saints Medical Center, Fort Worth, from February 23–May 12, 2020. The variables collected included patient demographics, ED triage data, clinical symptoms, and past medical history. The primary outcome was the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 infection) by a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, and was used as the label for ML tasks. We used univariate analyses for feature selection, and variables with P<0.1 were selected for model construction. Samples were split into training and testing cohorts on a 60:40 ratio chronologically. We tried various ML algorithms to construct the best predictive model, and we evaluated performances with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the testing cohort. RESULTS: A total of 580 ED patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study periods, and 98 (16.9%) were identified as having the SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the RT-PCR results. Univariate analyses selected 21 features for model construction. We assessed three ML methods for performance: of the three methods, random forest outperformed the others with the best AUC result (0.86), followed by gradient boosting (0.83) and extra trees classifier (0.82). CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is feasible to use ML models as an initial screening tool for identifying patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further validation will be necessary to determine how effectively this prediction model can be used prospectively in clinical practice.","Chou, Eric H.; Wang, Chih-Hung; Hsieh, Yu-Lin; Namazi, Babak; Wolfshohl, Jon; Bhakta, Toral; Tsai, Chu-Lin; Lien, Wan-Ching; Sankaranarayanan, Ganesh; Lee, Chien-Chang; Lu, Tsung-Chien",West J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856307/; https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.12.49370,167

Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available for this virus (SARS-CoV-2). The viral polymerase is a promising antiviral target. Here, we describe the near-atomic resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex, consisting of nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and suggests the mechanism for activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies reveal reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to that of SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate a well adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 towards humans with relatively lower body temperatures than the natural bat hosts.","Peng, Qi; Peng, Ruchao; Yuan, Bin; Zhao, Jingru; Wang, Min; Wang, Xixi; Wang, Qian; Sun, Yan; Fan, Zheng; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F.; Shi, Yi",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720307543?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531208/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720307543; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107774,167

This was a prospective clinical trial on non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 (>18 years) who had severe microsmia or anosmia within two weeks. The subjects were randomly assigned to the mometasone furoate group (100 mcg twice daily) or sodium chloride group (0.9%); both groups also received olfactory training for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the improvement of the olfactory score at the end of the study. Visual analog scale (VAS) and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) were used to assess primary outcome. A total of 80 patients were recruited, 77 of them completed the study and were analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of demographics and baseline clinical characteristics. The olfactory scores (based on VAS) at weekly intervals showed a significant difference between the two groups (P:0.318, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, respectively).

The clinical setting, mortality rate and prognostic factors in these patients have not been well established. METHODS: We included all dialyzed patients with COVID-19 referred to our dialysis center between March 11 and April 11, 2020. Data were obtained through the review of the medical records and were censored at the time of data cutoff, on May 11, 2020. RESULTS: Forty-four patients on maintenance dialysis with COVID-19 were referred to our dialysis unit during the COVID-19 epidemic. Median age was 61 years IQR [51.5-72.5]. 65.9% were men. Comorbidities included hypertension (97.7%), diabetes mellitus (50%), chronic cardiac (38.6%) and respiratory (27.3%) diseases. Initial symptoms were fever (79.5%), shortness of breath (29.5%), cough (43.2%), and diarrhea (13.6%). Three profiles of severity were distinguished based on the WHO progression scale. Forty-one (93.2%) were hospitalized and only three were maintained on outpatient hemodialysis. Thirty-three (75%) patients required oxygen therapy, including 15 (45.5%) who were referred to the intensive care unit. Overall, 27.3% of patients died, and 58.5% were discharged from hospital, including only two (13.3%) of those admitted to the intensive care unit. By multivariate analysis, cough, thrombopenia < 120 G/L, LDH level greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal, and blood CRP > 175 mg/L were significantly associated with death.

639558,Response to “Comment on Mastellos and colleagues and efficacy of complement-targeting drugs in COVID-19”,2020-10-25,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID‐19 pandemic caused an unprecedented impact to haemophilia healthcare delivery. In particular, rapid implementation of telehealth solutions was required to ensure continued access to comprehensive care. AIMS: To explore patient and healthcare provider (HCP) experience of telehealth in a European Haemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre. METHOD: A systematic evaluation was performed to survey patient and HCP experience and compare clinical activity levels with telehealth to in‐person attendances. RESULTS: Public health measures implemented in March 2020 to reduce COVID‐19 spread resulted in a 63% decrease in medical/nursing clinic consultation activity compared to the same period in 2019. Implementation of digital care pathways resulted in marked increase in activity (52% greater than 2019). Importantly, enhanced patient engagement was noted, with a 60% reduction in non‐attendance rates. Survey of patients who had participated in medical/nursing teleconsultations demonstrated that teleconsultations improved access (79%), reduced inconvenience (82%), was easy to use (94%) and facilitated good communication with the HCP (97%). A survey exploring the telemedicine experience of HCPs, illustrated that HCPs were satisfied with teleconsultation and the majority (79%) would like to continue to offer teleconsultation as part of routine patient care. In addition to medical/nursing reviews, continued access to physiotherapy with virtual exercise classes for people with haemophilia and teleconsultation for acute dental issues was equally successful. CONCLUSION: During an unprecedented public health emergency, telehealth has enabled continued access to specialized haemophilia comprehensive care. Our novel findings show that this alternative is acceptable to both patients and HCPs and offers future novel opportunities.","O’Donovan, Mairead; Buckley, Catherine; Benson, Julie; Roche, Sheila; McGowan, Mark; Parkinson, Laura; Byrne, Patricia; Rooney, Gloria; Bergin, Catherine; Walsh, Deirdre; Bird, Rachel; McGroarty, Feargal; Fogarty, Helen; Smyth, Elizabeth; Ahmed, Saad; O’Donnell, James S.; Ryan, Kevin; O'Mahony, Brian; Dougall, Alison; O’Connell, Niamh M.",Haemophilia,https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.14156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32997849/,167

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital′s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","Zhang, Bicheng; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Qiu, Yanru; Feng, Fan; Feng, Jia; Jia, Yifan; Zhu, Hengcheng; Hu, Ke; Liu, Jiasheng; Liu, Zaiming; Wang, Shihong; Gong, Yiping; Zhou, Chenliang; Zhu, Ting; Cheng, Yanxiang; Liu, Zhichao; Deng, Hongping; Tao, Fenghua; Ren, Yijun; Cheng, Biheng; Gao, Ling; Wu, Xiongfei; Yu, Lilei; Huang, Zhixin; Mao, Zhangfan; Song, Qibin; Zhu, Bo; Wang, Jun",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191,167

AIMS: To establish a mouse model of virus infection‐induced AE‐IPF and investigate the mechanism underlying the AE‐IPF. METHODS: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) was inoculated intranasally to wild‐type (WT) and IL‐17A gene knockout (IL‐17A(‐/‐)) mice 21 days after intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM). RESULTS: HSV1 infection caused acute exacerbation in mice with BLM‐induced fibrosis. Compared with the BLM+Saline mice, the mice with BLM+HSV1 showed significantly higher acute lung injury (ALI) score (P < 0.0001), lower survival rate (100% vs 21.4%, P < 0.0001), poorer lung function and higher inflammatory response representing by increased total inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P = 0.0323), increased proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood (P = 0.0004) and higher inflammatory factors in BALF. In addition, HSV1 infection increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)‐related proteins in mice with BLM‐induced fibrosis. The inhibition of ERS by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, an ERS inhibitor) significantly reduced the IL‐17A levels in BALF (P = 0.0140) and TH17 cells in the peripheral blood (P = 0.0084) of mice with BLM+HSV1, suggesting that suppression of ERS may reduce TH17 response in mice with AE‐IPF. Compared with WT mice with BLM+HSV1, IL‐17A(‐/‐) mice with BLM+HSV1 had lower ALI score (P = 0.0119), higher survival rate (78.6% vs 21.4%, P = 0.004), improved lung function, and milder inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: HSV1 infection in addition to BLM‐induced IPF can successfully establish AE‐IPF in mice.

Despite the urgent need to find effective therapeutics, research on SARS-CoV-2 has been affected by a lack of suitable animal models. To facilitate the development of medical approaches and novel treatments, we compared the ACE2 receptor, and TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases usage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein in human and in a panel of animal models, i.e. guinea pig, dog, cat, rat, rabbit, ferret, mouse, hamster and macaque. Here we showed that ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 or Furin, has a higher level of sequence variability in the Spike protein interaction surface, which greatly influences Spike protein binding mode. Using molecular docking simulations we compared the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins in complex with the ACE2 receptor and showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein is compatible to bind the human ACE2 with high specificity. In contrast, TMPRSS2 and Furin are sufficiently similar in the considered hosts not to drive susceptibility differences. Computational analysis of binding modes and protein contacts indicates that macaque, ferrets and hamster are the most suitable models for the study of inhibitory antibodies and small molecules targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interaction with ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 and Furin are similar across species, our data also suggest that transgenic animal models expressing human ACE2, such as the hACE2 transgenic mouse, are also likely to be useful models for studies investigating viral entry.","Brooke, Greg N.; Prischi, Filippo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72528-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985513/,167

For the prevention and treatment of COVID19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, it has become increasingly apparent that T cell responses are equally, if not more important than humoral responses in mediating recovery and immune-protection. One of the major challenges in developing T cell-based therapies for infectious and malignant diseases has been the identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell response. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico methods to predict putative epitopes deduced from binding affinities and consensus data. Our studies find that, in contrast to current dogma, ‘immunodominant’ SARS-CoV-2 peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses recognizing naturally presented SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.","Pan, Ke; Chiu, Yulun; Chen, Michelle; Wang, Junmei; Lai, Ivy; Singh, Shailbala; Shaw, Rebecca; Yee, Cassian",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268504/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.451555,167

644004,US Taxpayers Heavily Funded the Discovery of COVID‐19 Vaccines,2021-07-09,"Current SARS-CoV-2 pandemy mortality created the hypothesis that some populations may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 encodes a transmembrane serine protease which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 might influence SARS-CoV2 entry into the cell. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SNPs on TMPRSS2 function and structure. In silico tools such as Ensembl, Gtex, ExPASY 2, GEPIA, CCLE, KEGG and GO were engaged to characterize TMPRSS2 and its expression profile. The functional effects of SNPs were analyzed by PolyPhen-2, PROVEN, SNAP2, SIFT and HSF. Also, Phyre2, GOR IV and PSIPRED were used to predict the secondary structure of TMPRSS2. Moreover, post-translational modification (PTM) and secretory properties were analyzed through Modpredand Phobius, respectively. Finally, miRNA profiles were investigated by PolymiRTS and miRSNPs. Out of 11,184 retrieved SNPs from dbSNP, 92 showed a different frequency between Asians and other populations. Only 21 SNPs affected the function and structure of TMPRSS2 by influencing the protein folding, PTM, splicing and miRNA function. Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile. This study highlighted the role of TMPRSS2 SNPs and epigenetic mechanisms especially non-coding RNAs in appearance of different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations.

644343,Mortality Attributed to COVID-19 in High-Altitude Populations,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, computer simulation models have supported development of pandemic influenza preparedness policies. However, U.S. policymakers have raised several concerns about the practical use of these models. In this review paper, we examine the extent to which the current literature already addresses these concerns and identify means of enhancing the current models for higher operational use. METHODS: We surveyed PubMed and other sources for published research literature on simulation models for influenza pandemic preparedness. We identified 23 models published between 1990 and 2010 that consider single-region (e.g., country, province, city) outbreaks and multi-pronged mitigation strategies. We developed a plan for examination of the literature based on the concerns raised by the policymakers. RESULTS: While examining the concerns about the adequacy and validity of data, we found that though the epidemiological data supporting the models appears to be adequate, it should be validated through as many updates as possible during an outbreak. Demographical data must improve its interfaces for access, retrieval, and translation into model parameters. Regarding the concern about credibility and validity of modeling assumptions, we found that the models often simplify reality to reduce computational burden. Such simplifications may be permissible if they do not interfere with the performance assessment of the mitigation strategies. We also agreed with the concern that social behavior is inadequately represented in pandemic influenza models. Our review showed that the models consider only a few social-behavioral aspects including contact rates, withdrawal from work or school due to symptoms appearance or to care for sick relatives, and compliance to social distancing, vaccination, and antiviral prophylaxis. The concern about the degree of accessibility of the models is palpable, since we found three models that are currently accessible by the public while other models are seeking public accessibility. Policymakers would prefer models scalable to any population size that can be downloadable and operable in personal computers. But scaling models to larger populations would often require computational needs that cannot be handled with personal computers and laptops. As a limitation, we state that some existing models could not be included in our review due to their limited available documentation discussing the choice of relevant parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: To adequately address the concerns of the policymakers, we need continuing model enhancements in critical areas including: updating of epidemiological data during a pandemic, smooth handling of large demographical databases, incorporation of a broader spectrum of social-behavioral aspects, updating information for contact patterns, adaptation of recent methodologies for collecting human mobility data, and improvement of computational efficiency and accessibility.","Prieto, Diana M; Das, Tapas K; Savachkin, Alex A; Uribe, Andres; Izurieta, Ricardo; Malavade, Sharad",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22463370/,167
644479,Advances in the possible treatment of COVID-19: A review.,2020-09-15,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the predominant clinical presentation is a respiratory disease, neurologic manifestations are being recognized increasingly. CASE REPORT: We report 2 children 9 years of age who developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis-like disease associated with SARS-CoV-2. Seizures and encephalopathy were the main central nervous system symptoms. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis performed within the first week of disease onset showed elevated protein in both children with normal cell count and no evidence of infection including negative SARS-CoV-2 by antibody and polymerase chain reaction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed T2A, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery cortical and subcortical hyperintensity without restricted diffusion consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis–like disease. They received methylprednisolone followed by therapeutic plasma exchange. One of them showed complete clinical improvement and resolution in magnetic resonance imaging findings. The other developed laminar necrosis in brain magnetic resonance imaging and showed significant clinical improvement after therapeutic plasma exchange. He was positive for positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody in cerebrospinal fluid on day 55 of admission. They were both positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum after 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our two cases highlight the occurrence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis–like disease as a postinfectious/immune-mediated complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Akçay, Nihal; Bektaş, Gonca; Menentoğlu, Mehmet Emin; Oğur, Mustafa; Sofuoğlu, Ayşe İrem; Palabiyik, Figen Bakirtaş; Şevketoğlu, Esra",Pediatr Infect Dis J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387618/; https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003295,167
644667,The Causal Closure of Physics in Real World Contexts,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND: Various perceptions and practices have been associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we assessed the perception and practices regarding COVID-19 among residents in selected urban communities of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study design using a multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit 360 respondents (Mean age: 33.2 ± 10.6 years; 62.5% females) from households in Ibadan. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire from 3rd to 6th June 2020. Those who demonstrated washing of the palm, back of the hand, spaces between the fingers, fingernails, wrist, and thumbs had six points and were categorized to have had a good practice of handwashing. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Bivariate analyses of sociodemographic characteristics and good handwashing practices were conducted using Chi-square test. Logistic regression was conducted to identify the determinants of good handwashing practices. P-values < 0.05 were statistically significant. RESULTS: Going to the hospital (95%) and calling the COVID-19 help number (58.3%) were the frequently reported practices among respondents following the development of COVID-19 symptoms. Also, 89 (26%) knew they could contract COVID-19, while 41 (12%) perceived it as an exaggerated event. The effects most frequently reported by respondents were hunger/low income (48.8%) and academic delay (8.8%). Use of face masks by 64.5% and social distancing (48%) were the most frequently reported practices for prevention. Only 71 (20.8%) demonstrated good handwashing practices. The perception of the likelihood to contract COVID-19 and practices to prevent COVID-19 had a weak correlation of 0.239 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Gaps exist in the practices that prevent COVID-19. There is a need to improve handwashing, use of face masks and other practices that prevent COVID-19.

The development of novel methods to detect respiratory infections is essential for mitigating epidemics and developing pandemic-preparedness infrastructure. From October 2019 to March 2020, we conducted a home-based cross-sectional study in the greater Seattle, WA, area, utilizing electronic consent and data collection instruments. Participants received nasal swab collection kits via rapid delivery within 24 hours of self-reporting respiratory symptoms. Samples were returned to the laboratory and were screened for 26 respiratory pathogens and a housekeeping gene. Participant data were recorded via online survey at the time of sample collection and 1 week later. Of the 4,572 consented participants, 4,359 (95.3%) received a home swab kit and 3,648 (83.7%) returned a nasal specimen for respiratory pathogen screening. The 3,638 testable samples had a mean RNase P relative cycle threshold (C(rt)) value of 19.0 (SD, 3.4), and 1,232 (33.9%) samples had positive results for one or more pathogens, including 645 (17.7%) influenza-positive specimens. Among the testable samples, the median time between shipment of the home swab kit and completion of laboratory testing was 8.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7.0 to 14.0). A single adverse event occurred and did not cause long-term effects or require medical attention. Home-based surveillance using online participant enrollment and specimen self-collection is a safe and feasible method for community-level monitoring of influenza and other respiratory pathogens, which can readily be adapted for use during pandemics.","Kim, Ashley E.; Brandstetter, Elisabeth; Wilcox, Naomi; Heimonen, Jessica; Graham, Chelsey; Han, Peter D.; Starita, Lea M.; McCulloch, Denise J.; Casto, Amanda M.; Nickerson, Deborah A.; Van de Loo, Margaret M.; Mooney, Jennifer; Ilcisin, Misja; Fay, Kairsten A.; Lee, Jover; Sibley, Thomas R.; Lyon, Victoria; Geyer, Rachel E.; Thompson, Matthew; Lutz, Barry R.; Rieder, Mark J.; Bedford, Trevor; Boeckh, Michael; Englund, Janet A.; Chu, Helen Y.",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02934-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563599/,167

Given the limitations of ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) due to their load dependency, a novel imaging tool called myocardial work (MW) has emerged as a promising method for LV performance evaluation. MW is a novel, less load-dependent method based on computation of myocardial strain–arterial blood pressure curves. This method provides a more detailed assessment of segmental and global LV function incorporating the patient’s LV pressure and is derived by brachial artery pressure utilizing an empiric reference curve adjusted to the duration of the isovolumic and ejection phases as determined by echocardiography. The clinical implications of this unique method have been expanding in the last few years, which attest to the robust additive role of MW in routine practice.","Papadopoulos, Konstantinos; Özden Tok, Özge; Mitrousi, Konstantina; Ikonomidis, Ignatios",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11030573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810120/,167

Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3′-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important.

Yet, our sudden need for social distancing, isolation, and for some, strict lockdown measures, required change within our academic delivery. The sudden need for virtual change in higher education has been felt worldwide and although the utility of VR in radiography has been used prior to COVID-19, it has never been used as a supplementary tool for clinical placement. In response, this commentary provides us with an opportunity to explore the appropriateness of VR in future years and what it may mean of prospective students. This commentary not only highlights our reliance on VR but identifies how it kept abreast with quality standards.

The immunohistochemical peroxidase technique, with an antiviral nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody, was used for the localization of the multiplication sites, in the intestine and other organs. The Gep II and the Purdue-115 strains, administered orally to piglets, caused clinical signs and lesions of TGE. These strains multiplied within the intestinal tract in the enterocytes of the jejunum and ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. In view of the small numbers of infected cells in the tonsils, spleen, kidney, liver and lung, these tissues are not considered to be preferential multiplication sites. The attenuated Nouzilly strain multiplies only in the ileum and the mesenteric lymph nodes. The variation in the tropism for particular parts of the intestine (with the preferential localization of the virus in the ileum rather than the jejunum), could be related to the high degree of attenuation of the Nouzilly strain.","Cubero, M.

The pandemic, along with the obvious health-related impact, also poses a serious threat to the psychological well-being of individuals and has resulted in significant behavioral changes. We aimed to describe the psycho-behavioral response to this crisis among the population of Karachi, Pakistan, in the month of March 2020. Methods A structured, self-administered questionnaire was constructed, based on previously conducted surveys, assessing the psychological impact and behavioral changes pertaining to COVID-19. Questionnaires were made available online, and were administered to any individual who was a resident of Karachi, during March 2020. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) to identify possible risk factors for psychological and behavioral changes. The responses were compared based on gender, age, and level of education, to find possible statistical correlations using chi-square test. Results This research studied data from 400 participants residing in Karachi, Pakistan. The spread of the virus had resulted in subsequent development of fears in the target population, with the majority of the respondents feeling anxious on a daily basis (62.5%). The participants feared going to marketplaces (88.8%), were concerned for the health of their family members (94.5%), and felt under-confident with the current infection control measures (71%). Significantly elevated levels of fear were noted among people >35 years of age. They were more likely to fear for the safety of their health even at home (p=0.06). Meanwhile, increased levels of anxiety due to use of social media among people below 35 years had resulted in avoidance behaviors (p=0.04). There was a higher tendency for graduates to fear for the safety of their health, even at home (p<0.01). In addition, more than three-fourths of our participants had incorporated changes in their behavior to ensure their safety i.e. reduced physical contact (86.5%) and visits to healthcare facilities (74.5%), canceled plans (84.5%), and washing hands more often (87%). Conclusion Our study highlighted the increased anxiety levels that an individual experienced on a regular basis regarding their health, the health of their peers, certain avoidance behaviors as a result of the disease, and behavioral changes of the concerned population. Besides calling attention to this worrisome situation, we also tried to list possible solutions to avert any future distress that may ensue as a result. Hopefully, our study will help the concerned authorities to take measures in order to alleviate the psychological and behavioral impact of COVID-19.","Balkhi, Fizra; Nasir, Aamna; Zehra, Arhama; Riaz, Ramsha",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32499970/,167

648639,Open Development and Clinical Validation Of Multiple 3D-Printed Sample-Collection Swabs: Rapid Resolution of a Critical COVID-19 Testing Bottleneck,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND: A new syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has emerged as a rare side-effect of vaccination against COVID-19. Cerebral venous thrombosis is the most common manifestation of this syndrome but, to our knowledge, has not previously been described in detail. We aimed to document the features of post-vaccination cerebral venous thrombosis with and without VITT and to assess whether VITT is associated with poorer outcomes. METHODS: For this multicentre cohort study, clinicians were asked to submit all cases in which COVID-19 vaccination preceded the onset of cerebral venous thrombosis, regardless of the type of vaccine, interval between vaccine and onset of cerebral venous thrombosis symptoms, or blood test results. We collected clinical characteristics, laboratory results (including the results of tests for anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies where available), and radiological features at hospital admission of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis after vaccination against COVID-19, with no exclusion criteria. We defined cerebral venous thrombosis cases as VITT-associated if the lowest platelet count recorded during admission was below 150 × 10(9) per L and, if the D-dimer was measured, the highest value recorded was greater than 2000 μg/L. We compared the VITT and non-VITT groups for the proportion of patients who had died or were dependent on others to help them with their activities of daily living (modified Rankin score 3–6) at the end of hospital admission (the primary outcome of the study). The VITT group were also compared with a large cohort of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis described in the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis. FINDINGS: Between April 1 and May 20, 2021, we received data on 99 patients from collaborators in 43 hospitals across the UK. Four patients were excluded because they did not have definitive evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis on imaging. Of the remaining 95 patients, 70 had VITT and 25 did not. The median age of the VITT group (47 years, IQR 32–55) was lower than in the non-VITT group (57 years; 41–62; p=0·0045). Patients with VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis had more intracranial veins thrombosed (median three, IQR 2–4) than non-VITT patients (two, 2–3; p=0·041) and more frequently had extracranial thrombosis (31 [44%] of 70 patients) compared with non-VITT patients (one [4%] of 25 patients; p=0·0003). The primary outcome of death or dependency occurred more frequently in patients with VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis (33 [47%] of 70 patients) compared with the non-VITT control group (four [16%] of 25 patients; p=0·0061). This adverse outcome was less frequent in patients with VITT who received non-heparin anticoagulants (18 [36%] of 50 patients) compared with those who did not (15 [75%] of 20 patients; p=0·0031), and in those who received intravenous immunoglobulin (22 [40%] of 55 patients) compared with those who did not (11 [73%] of 15 patients; p=0·022). INTERPRETATION: Cerebral venous thrombosis is more severe in the context of VITT. Non-heparin anticoagulants and immunoglobulin treatment might improve outcomes of VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis. Since existing criteria excluded some patients with otherwise typical VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis, we propose new diagnostic criteria that are more appropriate.

Main caregivers (parents) of adolescent patients with AN were randomly allocated to a workshop (n = 50) or online version (n = 50). Participants were compared to a non-randomised comparison group (n = 49) receiving multi-family or systemic family therapy. Primary (General Health Questionnaire) and secondary outcomes were obtained at baseline, three-month and 12-month follow-up.

In this large prospective cohort, we observed that the rate of weight loss was reduced during LD. This reduction was counterbalanced in participants involved in a remote consultation follow-up with a dose-effect response based on the number of remote consultations.","Bailly, Sébastien; Fabre, Odile; Legrand, Rémy; Pantagis, Laurent; Mendelson, Monique; Terrail, Robin; Tamisier, Renaud; Astrup, Arne; Clément, Karine; Pépin, Jean-Louis",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201490/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072152,167

Less than one year later, published phase 3 clinical trials underlined the effectiveness of vaccines utilizing hitherto unusual technology consisting in injection of the messenger RNA (m-RNA) of a viral protein. In the meantime, numerous clinical trials had failed to identify a maximally effective antiviral treatment, and mass vaccination came to be considered as the strategy most likely to put an end to the pandemic. The objective of this text is to address and hopefully answer the questions being put forward by healthcare professionals on the different anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as regards their development, their modes of action, their effectiveness, their limits, and their utilization in different situations; we are proposing a report on both today’s state of knowledge, and the 14 February 2021 recommendations of the French health authorities.","Lefebvre, M.; Vignier, N.; Pitard, B.; Botelho-Nevers, E.; Cohen, R.; Epaulard, O.",Infect Dis Now,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33681861/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.02.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921000580; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921000580?v=s5,167

This novel virus is thought to enter and cause infection in its host through the attachment of its structural protein known as the S-glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 with its consequences globally, it is mandatory that health caregivers and researchers across all disciplines abreast themselves with the potential effects that this novel virus may have on their fields and the medical society at large. During the infection, the cardiovascular system is affected by unknown pathomechanistic processes, hence accounting for an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among COVID-19 patients. As cardiovascular researchers, we are more concerned about the cardiovascular aspect of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Hence, this concise review addresses these aspects where CVD as a risk factor of COVID-19, the prevalence of CVDs in COVID-19, and the potential cardiovascular disorders which may evolve owing to COVID-19 are discussed. A better understanding of these issues will be pivotal to improve cardiovascular health during this SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Adu-Amankwaah, Joseph; Mprah, Richard; Adekunle, Adebayo Oluwafemi; Ndzie Noah, Marie Louise; Adzika, Gabriel Komla; Machuki, Jeremiah Ong’achwa; Sun, Hong",Annals of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345626/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2020.1861644,167

With no ambitious mitigation, recent years have witnessed an increasing frequency of extreme climate events, including cross-border or borderless climate risks. Accordingly, the Paris Agreement frames adaptation as a global goal and global responsibility. However, financing for adaptation continues to remain extremely poor, relative to the estimated needs, even though the regime has obligatory provisions for support by developed countries. Why is this so? Why should the majority of the countries, with an insignificant contribution to causing the problem, suffer from increasing climate impacts? How can adaptation finance be enhanced at scale? As a response to these queries, the paper substantiates three claims: (1) that poor funding can be attributed to the territorial framing under the regime that conceptualizes adaptation largely as a local or national public good and, hence, the inefficacy of market mechanisms, (2) that it makes conceptual and political sense to consider adaptation as a global public good, and (3) that such a reframing should make a difference in boosting adaptation finance. In a multi-polar world with different views on adaptation finance, multilateral agencies should lead in promoting the proposed framing.","Khan, Mizan R.; Munira, Sirazoom",Clim Change,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456401/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03195-w,167

Their elimination results from treatment processes of polluted effluents in the sewage treatment plant or in the lagooning pilot plant. Bacteriophages are regarded as viruses models and as indicators of faecal contamination. In an expiremental study, two pilot plants laboratories have been used (natural lagooning and activated sludge pilot) to follow and evaluate the elimination rate of somatic coliphage X-174 or the ARN F-specific one MS2. The two phages removal, ranging to 99 % in the two systems, are related with previous values on enteric viruses. The main factors of viral removal and inactivation (adsorption to solid matters, microbial activities, solar radiations, dissolved matters) have been studied too. Adsorption of infectious particles to solid matters is a very significant process. This was obtained in the pilot plant laboratory experiment and in in vitro study (X-174 or MS2 in the presence of the kaolinite or the montmorillonite). Otherwise, 12 hours of solar rays exposition were efficient ro inactivate nearly the whole phagic suspension.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, multi-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Multivariate competing risk models were employed to explore the rate of reintubation and its determining factors. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-one extubated patients were included (mean age, 61.0 years [±13.9]; 54.8% male). Reintubation occurred in 93 (33.1%). In multivariate analysis accounting for death, reintubation risk increased with age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 -1.06), vasopressors (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.04-3.60), renal replacement (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22-3.29), maximum PEEP (HR 1.07 per 1-unit increase, 95% CI 1.02 -1.12), paralytics (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.25) and requiring more than nasal cannula immediately post-extubation (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.37-3.50). Reintubation was associated with higher mortality (36.6% vs 2.1%; P < 0.0001) and risk of inpatient death after adjusting for multiple factors (HR 23.2, 95% CI 6.45-83.33). Prone ventilation, corticosteroids, anticoagulation, remdesivir and tocilizumab did not impact the risk of reintubation or death. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 1 in 3 critically ill COVID-19 patients required reintubation. Older age, paralytics, high PEEP, need for greater respiratory support following extubation and non-pulmonary organ failure predicted reintubation. Extubation failure strongly predicted adverse outcomes.","Ionescu, Filip; Zimmer, Markie S.; Petrescu, Ioana; Castillo, Edward; Bozyk, Paul; Abbas, Amr; Abplanalp, Lauren; Dogra, Sanjay; Nair, Girish B.",J Intensive Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211020281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34074160/,167

To be effective in the digital environment, school teachers have to master new transprofessional competences (TPCs), enabling them to use the skill sets of other careers, gain new skills and abilities and find non-standard solutions to professional and pedagogical problems using digital technologies. This study investigated education employers’ opinions (61 principals and deputy principals from 31 Russian secondary schools) about the comparative importance of TPCs for school teachers working in the digital environment and their perceptions of what barriers prevent teachers from developing TPCs. The survey used a three-item questionnaire asking the respondents to rank the TPCs and the TPC clusters in order of importance for teachers working with the digital and to describe the obstacles to teachers’ TPC development. The findings revealed that the employers attached the greatest importance to psychological TPCs while assigning the least importance to digital citizenship TPCs. The major barriers to TPC development, in the respondents’ opinion, lay in teachers’ fear of new trends and their excessive workload. Based on the survey results, we designed a model of school teachers’ transprofessional competences in digital teaching and learning that can be used as an assessment tool in different professional settings. The paper concludes with suggestions on how to overcome the barriers and help improve school teachers’ TPC development.","Yurinova, Evgenia A.; Byrdina, Olga G.; Dolzhenko, Svetlana G.",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10687-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377078/,167

A Prospective, Randomized, Pilot Study",2021-08-12,"Background: The serologic response of individuals with mild forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly characterized. Methods: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using three assays: a LuLISA targeting the N protein (99% specificity), a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity), and a S- Flow assay (>99.5% specificity). The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay. Results: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV- 2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39). The LuLISA N assay detected antibodies in 129 (80.6%) of the samples, with better performance for samples collected after 28 days (45/48 = 93.8%); the rapid immunodiagnostic test in 153 (95.6%); and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (none of the other tests detected antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02). Conclusion: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff after 13 days from the COVID-19 symptom onset. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime.

The PRRSV E protein contains the consensus motif of (1)MGxxxS(6) for myristoylation, and in the presence of 2-hydroxymyristic acid, the virus titer decreased by 2.5 log TCID(50) and the level of viral RNA was reduced significantly. When the glycine at position 2 was mutated to alanine (G2A) using an infectious cDNA clone, a viable virus was recoverable and a mutant PRRSV was obtained. The titers of G2A mutant virus were 2.0 × 10(4) and 1.0 × 10(6) TCID(50)/ml for ‘passage-2’ and ‘passage-3’ viruses, respectively, in PAM cells, and these titers were significantly lower than those of wild-type PRRSV. When treated with the myristoylation inhibitor, the G2A mutant virus was resistant to the drug. The data show that the PRRSV E protein myristoylation is non-essential for PRRSV infectivity but promotes the growth of the virus.","Du, Yijun; Zuckermann, Federico A.; Yoo, Dongwan",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2009.11.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170209004171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19951726/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170209004171,167

DKA is an acute complication of diabetes with a mortality rate of approximately 0.67%. Little is known about the natural history of DKA in the presence of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 on presentation, clinical course and outcome in patients presenting with DKA. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: All patients treated for DKA between 1 March 2020 and 30 May 2020 were included. Patients were categorised as COVID-positive or COVID-negative based on the swab test. A pre-COVID group was established using data from 01 March 2019 to 30 May 2019 as external control. Data regarding demographics, diabetes type, pH, bicarbonate, lactate, glucose, DKA duration, complications and outcome were collected. RESULTS: A total of 88 DKA episodes were included in this study. There was no significant difference in the severity or duration of DKA between the three groups. COVID-positive T1DM were more hyperglycaemic on admission compared to COVID-negative and pre-COVID patients. There was an over representation of T2DM in COVID-positive patients with DKA than in pre-COVID or COVID-negative groups. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appears to influence the natural history of DKA differently in T1DM and T2DM. Patients with T1DM and COVID-19 presented with more hyperglycaemia (60 mmol/L (35.9–60.0) vs 31.4 mmol/L (28.0–39.1) vs 24 mmol/L (20.2–33.75), respectively). Patients with T2DM were unusually presenting in DKA when infected with COVID-19 with greater ICU need and higher mortality rates.

Therefore, a rapid detection assay for the pathogen, preferably applicable in the field, is important. In the current study, we developed a new and improved detection method using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). This assay, which targets the infB gene, was tested on a collection of 60 field isolates of G. parasuis comprising 14 different serovars. In addition, 63 isolates from seven different closely related species of the family Pasteurellaceae, including A. indolicus, A. porcinus, and A. minor, and a species frequently found in the respiratory tract of pigs were used for exclusivity experiments. This assay showed an analytical specificity of 100% (both inclusivity and exclusivity) and an analytical sensitivity of 10 fg/µL. In further steps, 36 clinical samples were tested with the LAMP assay. An agreement of 77.1 (95% CI: 59.9, 89.6) and 91.4% (95% CI: 75.9, 98.2) to the culture-based and PCR results was achieved. The mean limit of detection for the spiked bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was 2.58 × 10(2) CFU/mL. A colorimetric assay with visual detection by the naked eye was tested to provide an alternative method in the field and showed the same sensitivity as the fluorescence-based LAMP assay. Overall, the optimized LAMP assay represents a fast and reliable method and is suitable for detecting G. parasuis in the laboratory environment or in the field.","Pilchová, Veronika; Seinige, Diana; Hennig-Pauka, Isabel; Büttner, Kathrin; Abdulmawjood, Amir; Kehrenberg, Corinna",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9010041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375599/,167

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of these services came to a complete halt following strict lockdowns. Many services have resumed in a hybrid format using face to face and virtual modes of delivery. This study describes findings from the COVID-19 impact survey administered at the onset of the pandemic in a subgroup of families from the SPARK cohort (N = 6393), one of the largest ASD cohorts in the US. The differential early impact of COVID-19 on various subgroups of children with ASD and their families was examined. Caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD between 19 months and 18 years completed an online survey inquiring about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on access to services, parent concerns about the same, impact on child's ASD-related behaviors, child, and parent mental health, and the benefits/potential benefits of online/future online services. Analysis revealed that certain demographic (age, income/SES) and child-related factors (repetitive behaviors, language, functional, cognitive, and motor impairments, and child's understanding), as well as parent's past mental health were associated with/predicted greater service disruptions, greater ASD-related behaviors, and greater negative impact on parent mental health. In conclusion, younger children, children from low-income families, and children with greater impairment severity (more severe repetitive behaviors, language, cognitive, function, language, and motor impairments) were more negatively impacted by the pandemic through service disruptions, increased ASD-related behaviors, parent health/family impact, and found online interactions to be less beneficial. LAY SUMMARY: The SPARK study impact survey shows that at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents reported significant service disruptions, negative impact on their child's ASD-related behaviors as well as their own mental health; which was greater in families with younger children, children with greater ASD severity, and children from low-income families. Majority of families did not report significant benefits of online services whereas some families did. Low-income families were hopeful about receiving benefits through future online services. Overall, these findings have important implications for future clinical care delivery and healthcare policies to ensure that healthcare services are not interrupted during a potential resurgence of COVID-19 or other pandemics. A combination of in-person and online healthcare and family support services must be implemented to prevent negative health impacts in the future.","Bhat, Anjana",Autism research (Online),https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591364/,167

METHODS: Volumetric airflow were measured to assess air change rate per hour by ventilation (ACH(vent)). Equivalent ventilation provided by the PAC (ACH(pac)) was calculated based on its clean air delivery rate. Concentrations of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 μm aerosol particles were measured in 10 dental treatment rooms with various ventilation rates at baseline, after 5-min of incense burn, and after 30-min of observation with and without the PAC or ventilation system in operation. Velocities of aerosol removal were assessed by concentration decay constants for the 0.3 μm particles with ventilation alone (K(n)) and with ventilation and PAC (K(n+pac)), and by times needed to reach 95 % and 100 % removal of accumulated aerosol particles. RESULTS: ACH(vent) varied from 3 to 45. K(n) and K(n+pac) were correlated with ACH(vent) (r = 0.90) and combined ACH(total) (r = 0.81), respectively. Accumulated aerosol particles could not be removed by ventilation alone within 30-min in rooms with ACH(vent)<15. PAC reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal, and accumulated aerosols could be completely removed in 4 to 12-min by ventilation combined with PAC. Effectiveness of the PAC was especially prominent in rooms with poor ventilation. Added benefit of PAC in aerosol removal was inversely correlated with ACH(vent). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol accumulation may occur in dental treatment rooms with poor ventilation. Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter significantly reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter improves aerosol removal in rooms with low ventilation rates.","Ren, Yan-Fang; Huang, Qirong; Marzouk, Tamer; Richard, Ray; Pembroke, Karen; Martone, Pat; Venner, Tom; Malmstrom, Hans; Eliav, Eli",J Dent,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300571220303237; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388387/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571220303237,167

Such a model was only seen as one of the supplementary components for performing arts education in the past. From January 2020, this online pedagogy was inevitably placed to surmount the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The social distancing measures demanded the blended pedagogy into a new online approach, in which the traditional face-to-face teaching to be replaced by synchronous online learning (facilitated by technologies such as Zoom, Cisco Webex, Google Class, Panopto etc.). Meanwhile, to offer opportunities for cognitive participation which allows students to process the learning and be reflective, webinar and innovative performance projects were launched from the concept of ‘flipped classroom and outcome-based education.’ This mixed approach (blended learning, flipped classroom, and outcome-based education) is described as ‘hybrid learning’ in this study. The ‘hybrid learning’ pedagogy is implemented at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA) for all teaching activities in the 2nd semester 2020/2021 to overcome the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire survey about how it affected the performing arts education, and how the new pedagogy was implemented took place in July 2020. The survey results from both the teachers (76) and students (163) share lessons, insights, and new understandings on teaching and learning online. Hybrid learning has been widely investigated and researched, yet study on hybrid learning in performing arts such as creative art, theatre art and music, remains insufficient. This study fills the research gap.","Li, Qingyun; Li, Zihao; Han, Jie",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220284/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10612-1,167

658577,N95 Mask Decontamination using Standard Hospital Sterilization Technologies,2020-04-08,"JC polyomavirus (JCV), a DNA virus that leads to persistent infection in humans, is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a lethal brain disease that affects immunocompromised individuals. Almost nothing is currently known about how JCV infection is controlled by the innate immune response and, further, whether JCV has evolved mechanisms to antagonize antiviral immunity. Here, we show that the innate immune sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) control JCV replication in human astrocytes. We further identify that the small t antigen (tAg) of JCV functions as an interferon (IFN) antagonist by suppressing RIG-I-mediated signal transduction. JCV tAg interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, thereby preventing its ability to bind RNA and to induce the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which is known to facilitate RIG-I-mediated cytokine responses. Antagonism of RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitination and antiviral signaling is also conserved in the tAg of the related polyomavirus BK virus (BKV). These findings highlight how JCV and BKV manipulate a key innate surveillance pathway, which may stimulate research into designing novel therapies.","Chiang, Cindy; Dvorkin, Steve; Chiang, Jessica J.; Potter, Rachel B.; Gack, Michaela U.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849980/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00620-21,167
658627,Platelet Recruitment in COVID-19,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has emerged as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To inform treatment considerations the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 complications and the influence of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors deserves continued attention. OBJECTIVE: To determine if obesity is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 complications and mortality and examine the relationship between BMI, race, ethnicity, distressed community index and COVID-19 complications and mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1,019 SARS-CoV-2 positive adult admitted to an academic medical center (n = 928) and its affiliated community hospital (n-91) in New York City from March 1 to April 18, 2020. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years (IQR 52–75), 58.7% were men, 23.0% were Black, and 52.8% were Hispanic. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 75.2%; median BMI was 28.5 kg/m(2) (25.1–33.0). Over the study period 23.7% patients died, 27.3% required invasive mechanical ventilation, 22.7% developed septic shock, and 9.1% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). In the multivariable logistic regression model, BMI was associated with complications including intubation (Odds Ratio [OR]1.03, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]1.01–1.05), septic shock (OR 1.04, CI 1.01–1.06), and RRT (OR1.07, CI 1.04–1.10), and mortality (OR 1.04, CI 1.01–1.06). The odds of death were highest among those with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2) (OR 2.05, CI 1.04–4.04). Mortality did not differ by race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic distress score, though Black and Asian patients were more likely to require RRT. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Severe complications of COVID-19 and death are more likely in patients with obesity, independent of age and comorbidities. While race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status did not impact COVID-19 related mortality, Black and Asian patients were more likely to require RRT. The presence of obesity, and in some instances race, should inform resource allocation and risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Page-Wilson, Gabrielle; Arakawa, Rachel; Nemeth, Samantha; Bell, Fletcher; Girvin, Zachary; Tuohy, Mary-Claire; Lauring, Max; Laferrère, Blandine; Reyes-Soffer, Gissette; Natarajan, Karthik; Chen, RuiJun; Kurlansky, Paul; Korner, Judith",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383798/,167

Standard imaging features of KD include interstitial and lobular inflammatory lesions in the lungs, while KD shock syndrome (KDSS), complicated with substantial consolidation and atelectasis in the lung, is rarely reported. PATIENTS CONCERNS: Herein, we report a single case of a 5-year-old female patient who manifested KDSS on the seventh day of the course of KD. Chest enhanced computed tomography indicated large-area consolidation in the lower lobes of the bilateral lungs. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with KDSS complicated with non-infective lung consolidation. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received human intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) and aspirin (30–50 mg/kg(.)d), methylprednisolone, a vasoactive agent, and albumin. Infective factors were excluded. OUTCOMES: The consolidation in the lower lobe of the bilateral lungs was completely recovered after 3 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Children with KDSS may present with pulmonary lesions such as substantial consolidation and atelectasis; thus, infective factors should be excluded. If there is no etiological evidence, antibiotics should be used with caution.","Song, Yue; Wei, Wuran; Liu, Lan; Wang, Yibing; Shi, Xiaoqing; Li, Li",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702840/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020998,167

Genetic manipulation of full-length cDNA clones has become an especially important and widely used tool to study the biology, pathogenesis, and virulence determinants of both positive and negative stranded RNA viruses. The first full-length infectious cDNA clone of equine arteritis virus (EAV) was developed in 1996 and was also the first full-length infectious cDNA clone constructed from a member of the order Nidovirales. This clone was extensively used to characterize the molecular biology of EAV and other Nidoviruses. The objective of this review is to summarize the characterization of the virulence (or attenuation) phenotype of the recombinant viruses derived from several infectious cDNA clones of EAV in horses, as well as their application for characterization of the molecular basis of viral neutralization, persistence, and cellular tropism.","Balasuriya, Udeni B.R.; Zhang, Jianqiang; Go, Yun Young; MacLachlan, N.

659116,Correlation of genotype and phenotype in 32 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis in China,2021,"In recent years, telemedicine has been increasingly incorporated into medical practice, a process which has now been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As telemedicine continues to progress, it is necessary for medical institutions to incorporate telemedicine into their curricula, and to provide students with the necessary skills and experience to effectively carry out telemedicine consultations. The purposes of this study are to review the involvement of medical students with telemedicine and to determine both the benefits and the challenges experienced. A literature review on the MEDLINE; CINAHL Plus; APA PsychInfo; Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts; and Health Business Elite databases was performed on September 7, 2020, yielding 561 results. 33 manuscripts were analysed, with the main benefits and challenges experienced by medical students summarized. In addition to increasing their understanding of the importance of telemedicine and the acquisition of telemedicine-specific skills, students may use telemedicine to act as a valuable workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges that students face, such as discomfort with carrying out telemedicine consults and building rapport with patients, may be addressed through the incorporation of telemedicine teaching into the medical curricula through experiential learning. However, other more systemic challenges, such as technical difficulties and cost, need to be examined for the full benefits of telemedicine to be realized. Telemedicine is here to stay and has proven its worth during the COVID-19 pandemic, with medical students embracing its potential in assisting in medical clinics, simulation of clinical placements, and online classrooms.","Cheng, Chelsea; Humphreys, Hilary; Kane, Bridget",Ir J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626350/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02720-1,167

OBJECTIVES: To separate the effects of RSV LRTI and an atopic diathesis on subsequent recurrent wheezing, we examined the protective effect of previous palivizumab administration against subsequent recurrent wheeze in infants with and without a family history of atopy. METHODS: A prospective multicenter, matched, double cohort study was conducted in 27 centers in Europe and Canada. The rates of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing in premature infants <36 weeks gestation who had received palivizumab in the first year of life were compared to those of gestational age–matched controls. RESULTS: The relative protective effect of palivizumab on physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing through the ages of 2 to 5 years was 68% in those with no family history of asthma (odds ratio, 0.32; (95% CI, 0.14-0.75; N = 146 palivizumab-treated, 171 untreated) and 80% in those with no family history of atopy or food allergies (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.59; N = 101 palivizumab-treated, 100 untreated). In contrast, there was no effect of palivizumab on subsequent recurrent wheezing in the 90 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies compared to 130 untreated infants with atopic families. CONCLUSION: Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in nonatopic children decreases by 80% the relative risk of recurrent wheezing but does not have any effect in infants with an atopic family history. This suggests that RSV predisposes to recurrent wheezing in an atopy-independent mechanism.","Simões, Eric A.F.; Carbonell-Estrany, Xavier; Rieger, Christian H.L.; Mitchell, Ian; Fredrick, Linda; Groothuis, Jessie R.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.05.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624638/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674910008511; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674910008511,167

To analyze the features, using statistical pattern matching concepts, which are the combination of Chi-square (CSQ), Hu moment invariants (HuMIs), absolute difference probability of white pixels (AbsDifPWPs) and geometric distance values (GDVs) have been proposed for face recognition. The individual grayscale face image is cropped by applying the Viola–Jones face detection algorithm from a face database having variations in illumination, appearance, pose and partial occlusion with complex backgrounds. Doing illumination correction through histogram linearization technique, the grayscale face components such as eyes, nose and mouth regions are extracted using the 2D geometric positions. The binary face image is created by applying cumulative probability distribution function with Otsu adaptive thresholding method and then extracted BFCs such as eyes, nose and mouth regions. Five statistical pattern matching tools such as the standard deviation of CSQ values with probability of white pixels (PWPs), standard deviation of HuMIs with Hu’s seven moment invariants, AbsDifPWPs and GDVs are developed for recognition purpose. GDVs are determined between two similar facial corner points (FCPs) and nine FCPs are extracted from binary whole face and BFCs.

Guanfacine is also widely used off-label in additional mental disorders that involve impaired functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including stress-related disorders such as substance abuse, schizotypic cognitive deficits, and traumatic brain injury. The PFC subserves high order cognitive and executive functions including working memory, abstract reasoning, insight and judgment, and top-down control of attention, action and emotion. These abilities arise from PFC microcircuits with extensive recurrent excitation through NMDAR synapses. There is powerful modulation of these synapses, where cAMP-PKA opening of nearby potassium (K(+)) channels can rapidly and dynamically alter synaptic strength to coordinate arousal state with cognitive state, e.g. to take PFC “offline” during uncontrollable stress. A variety of evidence shows that guanfacine acts within the PFC via post-synaptic α2A-AR on dendritic spines to inhibit cAMP-PKA-K(+) channel signaling, thus strengthening network connectivity, enhancing PFC neuronal firing, and improving PFC cognitive functions. Although guanfacine’s beneficial effects are present in rodent, they are especially evident in primates, where the PFC greatly expands and differentiates. In addition to therapeutic actions in PFC, stress-related disorders may also benefit from additional α2-AR actions, such as weakening plasticity in the amygdala, reducing NE release, and anti-inflammatory actions by deactivating microglia. Altogether, these NE α2-AR actions optimize top-down control by PFC networks, which may explain guanfacine’s benefits in a variety of mental disorders.","Arnsten, Amy F.T.",Neurobiol Learn Mem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742720301714?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074742720301714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075480/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2020.107327,167

Hypertension, ischemic cardiac disease, and a history of stroke were the most frequent associated diseases. The mean duration from the symptoms’ debut to a RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 3.7 days, while the mean survival time from the RT-PCR positive test was 4.2 days. A histological examination was performed in seven cases and revealed, in most of them, hyaline membranes, and mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the interstitium, alveoli, and perivascular areas.

In patients without previous cardiovascular disease, LV EF < 50% occurred in 3.4%, abnormal LV global longitudinal strain (< 16%) in 24%, and diastolic dysfunction in 20%. Right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RV free wall strain < 20%) was noted in 18%. Moderate and large pericardial effusion were uncommon with an incidence of 0.4% for each category. Forty patients received ECMO support, and 79 died (10.9%). A stepwise increase in AUC was observed with addition of vital signs and laboratory measurements to baseline clinical characteristics, and a further significant increase (AUC 0.91) was observed when echocardiographic measurements were added. The performance of an optimized prediction model was similar to the model including baseline characteristics + vital signs and laboratory results + echocardiographic measurements.","Pournazari, Payam; Spangler, Alison L.; Ameer, Fawzi; Hagan, Kobina K.; Tano, Mauricio E.; Chamsi-Pasha, Mohammed; Chebrolu, Lakshmi H.; Zoghbi, William A.; Nasir, Khurram; Nagueh, Sherif F.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98773-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34593868/,167

In this study, COVID-19 epidemic curve in Tokyo is developed based on weekly reported data from January 23, 2020 until April 16, 2021. The maximum daily number of the infected cases in Tokyo in August 2021 would be 7,991 if the current pace of vaccinations (1/1,000 per day). This daily number is greater than the highest daily cases (2,447) recorded on January 7, 2021. However, if the rollout pace could be doubled (1/500 per day), the peak daily new cases would be 4,470 in August. If it could be quadrupled (1/250 per day), the peak would be noted at 2,128 in July and the highest number in August would be 1,977. If vaccine rollout could not be enhanced, the cancellation might be an acceptable decision, since health is the most precious to our Olympians.","Tokuda, Y.; Kuniya, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.21.21255676v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.21255676,167

MATERIAL/METHODS: The clinical data of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital of Zhuzhou City from January 28 to March 15, 2020, as well as laboratory test results for respiratory pathogens and biochemical indicators, were collected to conduct correlation analyses. All patients were diagnosed based on fluorescence-based PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Eleven of the 78 patients (14.1%) were co-infected with other respiratory pathogens, among which Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=5, 45.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (n=4, 36.4%) were the most frequent. There were 8 patients co-infected with 1 other pathogen and 3 patients co-infected with 2 other pathogens. Compared with mono-infected COVID-19 patients, patients with co-infections had significantly higher levels of procalcitonin (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that Mycoplasma pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common co-infections in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Some of these proteins trigger signals to kidnap cell organelles and factors which will form a new macro-structure, the virus factory, that acts as a physical scaffold for viral replication and assembly. We are only beginning to envisage the extraordinary complexity of these interactions, whose characterisation is a clear experimental challenge for which we now have powerful tools. Conventional study of infection kinetics using virology, biochemistry and cell biology methods can be followed by genome-scale screening and global proteomics. These are important new technologies with which we can identify the cell factors used by viruses at different stages in their life cycle. Light microscopy, electron microscopy and electron tomography, together with labelling methods for molecular mapping in situ, show immature viral intermediates, mature virions and recruited cell elements in their natural environment.

666627,COVID-19 and Erectile Dysfunction: Endothelial Dysfunction and Beyond,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: The health workforce (HWF) is critical in developing responsive health systems to address population health needs and respond to health emergencies, but defective planning have arguably resulted in underinvestment in health professions education and decent employment. Primary Health Care (PHC) has been the anchor of Ghana’s health system. As Ghana’s population increases and the disease burden doubles, it is imperative to estimate the potential supply and need for health professionals; and the level of investment in health professions education and employment that will be necessary to avert any mismatches. METHODS: Using a need-based health workforce planning framework, we triangulated data from multiple sources and systematically applied a previously published Microsoft® Excel-based model to conduct a fifteen-year projection of the HWF supply, needs, gaps and training requirements in the context of primary health care in Ghana. RESULTS: The projections show that based on the population (size and demographics), disease burden, the package of health services and the professional standards for delivering those services, Ghana needed about 221,593 health professionals across eleven categories in primary health care in 2020. At a rate of change between 3.2% and 10.7% (average: 5.5%) per annum, the aggregate need for health professionals is likely to reach 495,273 by 2035. By comparison, the current (2020) stock is estimated to grow from 148,390 to about 333,770 by 2035 at an average growth rate of 5.6%. The health professional’s stock is projected to meet 67% of the need but with huge supply imbalances. Specifically, the supply of six out of the 11 health professionals (~54.5%) cannot meet even 50% of the needs by 2035, but Midwives could potentially be overproduced by 32% in 2030. CONCLUSION: Future health workforce strategy should endeavour to increase the intake of Pharmacy Technicians by more than seven-fold; General Practitioners by 110%; Registered general Nurses by 55% whilst Midwives scaled down by 15%. About US$ 480.39 million investment is required in health professions education to correct the need versus supply mismatches. By 2035, US$ 2.374 billion must be planned for the employment of those that would have to be trained to fill the need-based shortages and for sustaining the employment of those currently available.","Asamani, James Avoka; Christmals, Christmal Dela; Reitsma, Gerda Marie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582504/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257957,167

A case-based online questionnaire was used to examine the prescribing of therapeutic and prophylactic antibiotics in two clinical scenarios. Stratified and systematic sampling strategies were implemented to provide a representative sample. The final valid sample was 60 GDs and 18 OMFSs. The majority of OMFSs (61.1%) routinely prescribed antibiotics for the surgical removal of third molars, which was significantly greater than for GDs (23.5%). For implant placement procedures, 72.2% of OMFSs and 62.1% of GDs prescribed antibiotics. Amoxicillin was the most selected agent for both scenarios. All OMFSs would prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in both cases, but only 56.0–63.0% of GDs would do this. GDs based prescribing decisions primarily on information from prescribing guides, while OMFSs relied more on information gained from specialist training. Surgical prophylaxis protocols differed considerably between groups. Both groups used surgical prophylaxis for some situations that are outside current recommendations.

However, few studies have examined immune responses in bats, and even fewer have evaluated these responses in an ecological context. We examined aspects of both innate and adaptive immune response in adult female Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) at four maternity roosts (two natural caves and two human-made bridges) in south-central Texas. Immune measurements included in vitro bactericidal ability of whole blood and in vivo T cell mediated response to mitogenic challenge. Bactericidal activity in T. brasiliensis varied with roosting ecology, but appears to be sensitive to colony-level effects. Blood from females living at one cave had significantly lower bactericidal ability than blood from females at three other sites. T cell mediated response in this species was associated with variation in roost ecology, with females from two caves having greater responses than females from two bridges. T cell mediated response and bactericidal activity were negatively correlated with one another within individuals that were tested for both. Variation in immunological response of T. brasiliensis is important for understanding the influence of the environment on the frequency and distribution of immunologically competent individuals and for understanding disease-host dynamics in this and other colonial species.","Allen, Louise C.; Turmelle, Amy S.; Mendonça, Mary T.; Navara, Kristen J.; Kunz, Thomas H.; McCracken, Gary F.",J Comp Physiol B,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00360-008-0315-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19002470/,167

In different zip codes in New York City, the epicenter of the epidemic, the number of cases per 100,000 residents has varied between 437 and 4227, i.e., in a 1:10 ratio. To guide policy decisions regarding containment and reopening of the economy, schools, and other institutions, it is vital to identify which factors drive this large variation. This paper reports on a statistical study of the incidence variation across New York City, conducted with data at zip code granularity. Among many socio-economical and demographic measures considered, the average household size emerges as the single most important explanatory variable: an increase of the average household size by one member accounts, in our final model specification, for at least 876 cases, a full 23% of the span of incidence numbers, at a 95% confidence level. The percentage of the population above the age of 65, as well as that below the poverty line, are additional indicators with a significant impact on the case incidence rate, along with their interaction term. Contrary to common belief, population density, per se, fails to have a significantly positive impact. Indeed, population densities and case incidence rates are negatively correlated, with a -33% correlation coefficient. Our model specification is anchored on a basic and established epidemiological model that explains the importance of household sizes on R0, the basic reproductive number of an epidemic.

668788,The Microbiome in Health and Disease from the Perspective of Modern Medicine and Ayurveda,2020-09-11,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are conformationally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S447N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S447N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.","Hark Gan, Hin; Twaddle, Alan; Marchand, Benoit; Gunsalus, Kristin C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436454,167

Id proteins can be produced via tumor-myeloma hybridomas or recombinant methods in mammalian, bacteria, or insect cells. We now demonstrate that terminal mannose residues, characteristic of recombinant proteins produced in insect cells, yield Id proteins with significantly enhanced immunostimulatory properties compared to Id proteins derived from mammalian cells. Recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cell-derived Id showed higher binding to and activation of human dendritic cells mediated by mannose receptors. In vivo, insect cell-derived Id elicited higher levels of tumor-specific CD8(+) CTL and improved eradication of pre-established murine lymphoma. Insect cell and mammalian Id generated similar levels of tumor-specific antibodies, showing no impairment in antibody responses to native tumor antigen despite the glycoslylation differences in the immunogen. Combining insect cell production and maleimide-based KLH conjugation offered the highest levels of anti-tumor immunity.

Such information could help to guide health authorities in providing informed interventions and clear communications. OBJECTIVES: To document the initial knowledge about COVID-19 and recommended health behaviors; to assess worries (ie, one’s perception of the influence of the worries of others on oneself), social appraisal, and preventive behaviors, comparing respondents from areas under different movement restrictions during the first week after the outbreak; and to understand how worries, perceived risk, and preventive behaviors were associated with quality of life and individual characteristics among Italian adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This convenience sample, nonprobablistic survey study recruited adult participants with a snowballing sampling method in any Italian region during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy from February 26, 2020, to March 4, 2020. Data were analyzed from March 5 to 12, 2020.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Levels of knowledge on the virus, contagion-related worries, social appraisal, and preventive behaviors were assessed with ratings of quality of life (measured using the Short Form Health Survey). Additionally, some individual characteristics that may be associated with worries and behaviors were assessed, including demographic characteristics, personality traits (measured using Big Five Inventory-10), perceived health control (measured using the internal control measure in the Health Locus of Control scale), optimism (measured using the Revised Life Orientation Test), and the need for cognitive closure (measured using the Need for Closure Scale). RESULTS: A total of 3109 individuals accessed the online questionnaire, and 2886 individuals responded to the questionnaire at least partially (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [13.2] years; 2203 [76.3%] women). Most participants were well informed about the virus characteristics and suggested behaviors, with a mean (SD) score of 77.4% (17.3%) correct answers. Quality of life was similar across the 3 zones (effect size = 0.02), but mental health was negatively associated with contagion-related worries (β = –0.066), social appraisal (β = –0.221), and preventive behaviors (β = –0.066) in the yellow zone (R(2) = 0.108). Social appraisal was also associated with reduced psychological well-being in the green zone (β = –0.205; R(2) = 0.121). In the yellow zone, higher worries were negatively correlated with emotional stability (β = –0.165; R(2) = 0.047). Emotional stability was also negatively associated with perceived susceptibility in the yellow (β = –0.108; R(2) = 0.040) and green (β = –0.170; R(2) = 0.087) zones. Preventative behaviors and social appraisal were also associated with the need for cognitive closure in both yellow (preventive behavior: β = 0.110; R(2) = 0.023; social appraisal β = 0.115; R(2) = 0.104) and green (preventive behavior: β = 0.174; R(2) = 0.022; social appraisal: 0.261; R(2) = 0.137) zones. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, people were well informed and had a relatively stable level of worries. Quality of life did not vary across the areas, although mental well-being was challenged by the social appraisal and worries related to the contagion. Increased scores for worries and concerns were associated with more cognitive rigidity and emotional instability.","Pagnini, Francesco; Bonanomi, Andrea; Tagliabue, Semira; Balconi, Michela; Bertolotti, Mauro; Confalonieri, Emanuela; Di Dio, Cinzia; Gilli, Gabriella; Graffigna, Guendalina; Regalia, Camillo; Saita, Emanuela; Villani, Daniela",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706385/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15821,167

Four independent barley crop fields (40 x 40 m each) were sampled randomly to estimate the loss. Two were located near Alemsaga Priority State Forest and the other two were away from the forest. Four (2 x 2 m) rodent exclusion plots were established at 10 m interval as control units in each selected experimental barley fields using fine wire mesh. Rodent pest species were collected using both Sherman and snap traps throughout the different crop growing stages. The damaged and undamaged barley tillers by pest rodents were counted on five 1 x 1 m randomly sampled quadrats for each selected experimental fields. Variations on pest rodent population between cropping years and sites were analyzed using Chi square test. The mean crop damages between cropping years and experimental field sites were analyzed using two way ANOVA. Arvicanthis abyssinicus, Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis dembeensis, Mus musculus, Lophuromys simensis, Tachyoryctes splendens and Hystrix cristata were identified as pest rodents in the study area. A total of 968 individual rodents (427 in 2019 and 541 in 2020) were trapped during the study period. There was a statistical variation (χ2 = 13.42, df = 1 and P<0.05) between trapped individuals of the two successive years. The crop fields near the forest were more vulnerable than away from the forest during both cropping years. Statistical variations was observed on mean crop losses between cropping years and experimental barley crop sites. The highest crop damage was seen at maturity stage and the lowest during sowing in all experimental plots and cropping years. The percentage of barley yield loss due to rodent pests was 21.7 kg ha-1. The monetary value of this yield loss was equivalent to 4875 Birr (121.9 US$ h-1). Alemsaga Forest as shelter and conservation strategies like free of farmland from livestock and terracing for soil conservation have great role for the high rodent pest populations in the study area. Field sanitation, trapping and using restricted rodenticides like zinc phosphide are the possible recommendation to local farmers against rodent pests.","Wondifraw, Bewketu Takele; Tamene, Mesele Yihune; Simegn, Afework Bekele",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383810/,167

The secondary objective was to compare venous thromboembolism events and coagulation variables in patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation according to the pathogen. DESIGN: Retrospective observational analysis at a single center. SETTING: Tertiary referral university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy with an injected CT scan performed after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation retrieval. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All of these patients experienced venous thromboembolism: 10 patients (76.9%) had isolated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis, two patients (15.4%) had isolated pulmonary embolism, and one patient (7.7%) had both cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Eleven patients (84.6%) had cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. A jugular associated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis was identified in seven patients (53.8%), a femoral associated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis was identified in 10 patients (76.9%), and six patients (46.2%) had both femoral and jugular cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. A pulmonary embolism was found in three patients (23.1%). No patient had central venous catheter-related deep vein thrombosis. One patient had thrombotic occlusion of the centrifugal pump, and one had oxygenator thrombosis requiring circuit replacement. Three patients (23.1%) had significant bleeding. Three patients (23.1%) had laboratory-confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and all of them developed cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. These three patients had femoral cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis, and two had an oxygenator or pump thrombosis. The mean activated partial thromboplastin time ratio was higher in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 group than in the influenza group and the community-acquired pneumonia group (1.91 vs 1.48 vs 1.53; p = 0.001), which was also found in regard to the percentage of patients with an activated partial thromboplastin time ratio greater than 1.8 (47.8% vs 20% vs 20.9%; p = 0.003) and the mean prothrombin ratio (86.3 vs 61.6 vs 67.1; p = 0.003). There was no difference in baseline characteristics or venous thromboembolism events. CONCLUSIONS: We report a 100% occurrence of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome using CT scan imaging despite a high target and close monitoring of anticoagulation.","Parzy, Gabriel; Daviet, Florence; Puech, Basile; Sylvestre, Aude; Guervilly, Christophe; Porto, Alizée; Hraiech, Sami; Chaumoitre, Kathia; Papazian, Laurent; Forel, Jean-Marie",Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32618700/,167

Governments can contain the disease and thereby mitigate the detrimental public health impact; allow the virus to spread to reach herd immunity; test, track, isolate, and treat; and suppress the disease regionally. An observation of Sweden and Finland showed a difference in feasible ways to communicate the chosen policy to the citizenry. Sweden assumed the herd immunity strategy and backed it up with health utilitarian arguments. This was easy to communicate to the Swedish people, who appreciated the voluntary restrictions approach and trusted their decision makers. Finland chose the contain and mitigate strategy and was towards the end of the observation period apparently hesitating between suppression and the test, track, isolate, and treat approach. Both are difficult to communicate to the general public accurately, truthfully, and acceptably. Apart from health utilitarian argumentation, something like the republican political philosophy or selective truth telling are needed.

The high rate of venous thromboembolism in COVID‐19 patients goes along with derangements in coagulation laboratory parameters. Hemostasis testing has an important role in diagnosed COVID‐19 patients. Elevated D‐dimer levels were found to be a crucial laboratory marker in the risk assessment of thrombosis in COVID‐19 patients. The diagnostic approach also includes prothrombin time and platelet count. Fibrinogen might give an indication for worsening coagulopathy. Other markers (activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinolysis parameters, coagulation factors, natural anticoagulants, antiphospholipid antibodies and parameters obtained by thromboelastography or thrombin generation assays) have been described as being deranged. These may help to understand the pathophysiology of thrombosis in COVID‐19 patients but have currently no place in diagnosis or management in COVID‐19 patients. For monitoring the heparin anticoagulant therapy, the anti‐Xa assay is suggested, because the severe acute‐phase reaction (high fibrinogen and high factor VIII) shortens the aPTT.","Devreese, Katrien M.

674010,Current Status of Cell-Based Therapies for Respiratory Virus Infections: Applicability to COVID-19,2020-04-07,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We highlight the unique properties of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2 inhibitors) which may lend favorably to their efficient integration in the background of other heart failure (HF) therapies. We also discuss the unique aspects of SGLT-2 inhibitor dosing, lack of titration needs, effects on kidney function and electrolytes, diuretic activity, and safety in the high-risk peri-hospitalization window. RECENT FINDINGS: Dapagliflozin was recently approved for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), irrespective of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on the findings of the pivotal DAPA-HF trial. All SGLT-2 inhibitors are once daily medications with minimal drug-drug interactions and do not require titration (for HF treatment) unlike other HF medications. SGLT-2 inhibitors offer modest weight loss and blood pressure reduction without major adverse effects of hyperkalemia, making it ideal for near-simultaneous initiation with other HF medications, and use in high-risk populations (including older adults). Moreover, SGLT-2 inhibitors appear to afford long-term kidney protection in diverse populations. SUMMARY: SGLT-2 inhibitors are the latest class of therapies to demonstrate important clinical benefits among patients with HFrEF, and their pharmacological properties favor ease of use and integration in multi-drug disease-modifying regimens.","Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Vaduganathan, Muthiah",Curr Diab Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11892-020-01347-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33040170/,167
674893,Identifying pathophysiological bases of disease in COVID-19,2020-09-22,"Objective To understand the frequency, profile, and duration of persistent symptoms of covid-19 and to update this understanding as new evidence emerges. Design: A living systematic review produced in response to the rapidly evolving evidence base for long covid. Data sources Medline and CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (Ovid), WHO Global Research Database on covid-19, LitCOVID, and Google Scholar to 28th September 2020. Study selection Studies reporting long-term symptoms and complications among people with confirmed or suspected covid-19, both in those previously hospitalised and those never hospitalised. Only studies incorporating over 100 participants qualified for data extraction and were assessed for risk of bias. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics. Quality assessment Risk of bias was assessed using a quality assessment checklist for prevalence studies. Results Twenty-eight studies qualified for data extraction; 16 of these were cohort studies, ten cross-sectional, and two large case series. The analysis included 9,442 adults with covid-19 from 13 countries. The longest mean follow-up period was 111 (SD: 11) days post-hospital discharge. A wide range of systemic, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychosocial symptoms was reported, of which the most common were breathlessness, fatigue, smell and taste disturbance, and anxiety. Persistent symptoms were described across both previously hospitalised and non-hospitalised populations. The quality of evidence was low, with a high risk of bias and heterogeneity in prevalence. The incorporated studies demonstrated limited external validity, a lack of control subjects, and inconsistent data collection methods. Few studies were conducted in primary care, no studies focused solely on children, and no studies were set in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that long covid is a complex, heterogeneous condition; however, the limited evidence base currently precludes a precise definition of its symptoms and prevalence. There is a clear need for robust, controlled, prospective cohort studies, including different at-risk populations and settings, incorporating appropriate investigations, collected and recorded in a standardised way.","Michelen, M.; Manoharan, L.; Elkheir, N.; Cheng, V.; Dagens, D.; Hastie, C.; O'Hara, M.; Suett, J.; Burls, A.; Foote, C.; Carson, G.; Olliaro, P.

We aimed to investigate the association of corticosteroids therapy with clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this single center, retrospective cohort study, adult patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and dead or discharged between December 29, 2019 and February 15, 2020 were studied. 1:1 propensity score matchings were performed between patients with or without corticosteroids treatment. Multivariable COX proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between corticosteroids treatment and in-hospital mortality by taking corticosteroids as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: Among 646 patients, in-hospital death rate was higher in 158 patients with corticosteroids administration (72/158, 45.6% vs 56/488, 11.5%, p<0.0001). After propensity score-match analysis, no significant differences were observed in in-hospital death between patients with and without corticosteroids treatment (47/124, 37.9% vs 47/124, 37.9%, p=1.000). When patients received corticosteroids before they required nasal high-flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, in-hospital death rate was lower than that in patients who were not administered with corticosteroids (17/86, 19.8% vs. 26/86, 30.2%, log rank p=0.0102), whereas time from admission to clinical improvement was longer (13 [IQR, 10∼17] days vs 10 [IQR, 8∼13] days; p＜0.001). Using Cox proportional hazards regression model accounting for time varying exposures in matched pairs, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with mortality difference (HR=0.98, 95%CI: 0.93-1.03, p=0.4694).

Production of proinflammatory neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been suggested to be a key factor in inducing a hyperinflammatory signaling cascade, allegedly causing both pulmonary tissue damage and peripheral inflammation. Accordingly, therapeutic blockage of neutrophil activation and NETosis, the cell death pathway accompanying NET formation, could limit respiratory damage and death from severe COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic glycopolymers that activate signaling of the neutrophil checkpoint receptor Siglec-9 suppress NETosis induced by agonists of viral toll-like receptors (TLRs) and plasma from patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, Siglec-9 agonism is a promising therapeutic strategy to curb neutrophilic hyperinflammation in COVID-19.","Delaveris, Corleone S.; Wilk, Aaron J.; Riley, Nicholas M.; Stark, Jessica C.; Yang, Samuel S.; Rogers, Angela J.; Ranganath, Thanmayi; Nadeau, Kari C.; Blish, Catherine A.; Bertozzi, Carolyn R.",ACS Cent Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056095/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.0c01669,167

METHODS: From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. RESULTS: Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system.

However, the detection of one gene at high Cycle threshold (Ct) has to be interpreted with caution. In this study we address this specific issue and report our real-life experience. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1639 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were analyzed with Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Positive samples showing high Ct values (Ct>35) were concentrated by centrifugation and re-tested with Cepheid or other methods (RealStar SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics; GeneFinder COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit, Elitech). RESULTS: 1599 (97.5%) negative samples, 36 (2.3%) positive samples and 4 (0.2%) presumptive positive samples were detected. In 17 out of 36 positive patients, very low viral RNA copies were suspected since positivity was detected at high Ct. We confirmed positivity for patients who showed both E and N genes detected and for patients with only N detected but with Ct <39. On the contrary, samples with only gene N detected with Ct values >39 were found negative. NPS taken 24 hours after the first collection confirmed the negativity of the 12 samples. Clinical data sustained these results since only 2 of these 12 patients showed COVID-19-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data support our consideration that detection of the N2 gene at high Ct needs to be interpreted with caution, suggesting that collaboration between virologists and clinicians is important for better understanding of results.","Falasca, Francesca; Sciandra, Ilaria; Di Carlo, Daniele; Gentile, Massimo; Deales, Alberto; Antonelli, Guido; Turriziani, Ombretta",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126109/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220304029; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104660; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220304029?v=s5,167
676834,Editorial: low population mortality from COVID‐19 in countries south of latitude 35 degrees North supports vitamin D as a factor determining severity,2020-04-28,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) have a compromised or inappropriate immune response. Although they might be considered a high-risk group for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reported impact of COVID-19 in these patients has been reassuring, while the differential susceptibility of distinct types of IEI remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the findings and outcomes of our known patients with IEI who were diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: In a retrospective study from March 2020 to February 2021, four centers in Mexico collected clinical, laboratory, and genetic data from pediatric and adult patients with known diagnoses of IEI who presented with COVID-19, based on compatible symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 testing or known household exposure. RESULTS: We report 31 patients with known IEI from Mexico who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventy-four percent were male, 52% were pediatric, and 81% survived. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 56 years, with a median of 17 years. Sixty-five percent had predominant antibody deficiencies, 48% were hospitalized, and 26% required ICU. Pediatric patients had a higher hospital admission rate than adults. Inpatient mortality was 40%, and ICU mortality rate was 63%. Forty-eight percent developed pneumonia, while 36% had evidence of hyperinflammation (4 adults and 7 children). Predominant laboratory features were lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, seen in 70 and 44% of patients, respectively. The serum D-dimer median value was 2.6 (0.5–20.6) μg/mL, and the median highest ferritin value was 1015 (32–10,303) ng/mL. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 80% of patients. Other treatments included macrolides (39%) and corticosteroids (29%). Six patients died from secondary infection or uncontrolled systemic inflammation. DISCUSSION: Although impaired immunity due to IEI may be a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19, most of our patients with IEI who acquired the SARS-CoV-2 infection developed a well-tolerated infection and survived, as have more than 80% of worldwide reported patients to date. An impaired immune or inflammatory response may be a predisposing factor for some and a protective factor for others. A systematic review of the literature could help identify those patients at risk of severe disease and complications. Healthcare-associated infections should be aggressively prevented.","Castano-Jaramillo, Lina M.; Yamazaki-Nakashimada, Marco Antonio; O’Farrill-Romanillos, Patricia M.; Muzquiz Zermeño, David; Scheffler Mendoza, Selma C.; Venegas Montoya, Edna; García Campos, Jorge Alberto; Sánchez-Sánchez, Luz María; Gámez González, Luisa B.; Ramírez López, Jesús Moisés; Bustamante Ogando, Juan Carlos; Vásquez-Echeverri, Estefanía; Medina Torres, Edgar Alejandro; Lopez-Herrera, Gabriela; Blancas Galicia, Lizbeth; Berrón Ruiz, Laura; Staines-Boone, Aidé Tamara; Espinosa-Padilla, Sara Elva; Segura Mendez, Nora Hilda; Lugo Reyes, Saul O.",J Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-021-01077-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114122/,167

METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting with ACS at 18 Centers in Northern-Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak were included. In-hospital all-cause death was the primary outcome. In-hospital cardiovascular death along with mechanical and electrical complications were the secondary ones. A case period (February 20, 2020-May 3, 2020) was compared vs. same-year (January 1–February 19, 2020) and previous-year control periods (February 20–May 3, 2019). ACS patients with Covid-19 were further compared with those without. RESULTS: Among 779 ACS patients admitted during the case period, 67 (8.6%) tested positive for Covid-19. In-hospital all-cause mortality was significantly higher during the case period compared to the control periods (6.4% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4% respectively; p 0.026), but similar after excluding patients with COVID-19 (4.5% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4%; p 0.73). Cardiovascular mortality was similar between the study groups. After multivariable adjustment, admission for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak had no impact on in-hospital mortality. In the case period, patients with concomitant ACS and Covid-19 experienced significantly higher in-hospital mortality (25% vs. 5%, p < 0.001) compared to patients without. Moreover, higher rates of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia were found in Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSION: ACS patients presenting during the Covid-19 pandemic experienced increased all-cause mortality, driven by Covid-19 positive status due to higher rates of cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia. No differences in cardiovascular mortality compared to non-pandemic scenarios were reported.","D'Ascenzo, Fabrizio; De Filippo, Ovidio; Borin, Andrea; Barbieri, Lucia; Adamo, Marianna; Morici, Nuccia; Truffa Giachet, Alessandra; Iannaccone, Mario; Crimi, Gabriele; Gaido, Luca; Bocchino, Pier Paolo; Pivato, Carlo Andrea; Campo, Gianluca; Trabattoni, Daniela; Chieffo, Alaide; Gaibazzi, Nicola; Angelini, Filippo; Rubboli, Andrea; Rognoni, Andrea; Musumeci, Giuseppe; Ugo, Fabrizio; Gili, Sebastiano; Cortese, Bernardo; Vadalà, Paolo; Dusi, Veronica; Gallone, Guglielmo; Patti, Giuseppe; de Ferrari, Gaetano Maria",Int J Cardiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527321005672?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527321005672; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.03.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794235/,167

In the recent past avian and animal influenza viruses have caused human disease ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illnesses, including the 2009–10 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enteroviruses have also impacted humans globally. Since the likely public health impacts are common, plans and policies for intervention strategies can be developed, encompassing early detection through surveillance and diagnostics, as well as treatment and prevention through clinical and non-clinical interventions. The global comprehensiveness of these varies according to differing resources, competing health priorities and the causative agent, yet, irrespective of this, activities must be proportional to the threat.

Despite the efforts of United States healthcare providers to vaccinate the bulk of its population, vaccine hesitancy is still a severe challenge that has led to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases to over 100,000 people during early August 2021. To our knowledge, there are limited nationwide studies that examined the spatial distribution of vaccination rates, mainly based on the social vulnerability index (SVI). In this study, we compiled a database of the percentage of fully vaccinated people at the county scale across the continental United States as of 29 July 2021, along with SVI data as potential significant covariates. We further employed multiscale geographically weighted regression to model spatial nonstationarity of vaccination rates. Our findings indicated that the model could explain over 79% of the variance of vaccination rate based on Per capita income and Minority (%) (with positive impacts), and Age 17 and younger (%), Mobile homes (%), and Uninsured people (%) (with negative effects). However, the impact of each covariate varied for different counties due to using separate optimal bandwidths.

This review summarizes the history, past achievements and future directions of the GeoSentinel Network. KEY FINDINGS: Funded by the US CDC in 1996, GeoSentinel has grown from a group of eight US-based travel and tropical medicine centers to a global network, which currently consists of 68 sites in 28 countries. GeoSentinel has provided important contributions that have enhanced the ability to use destination-specific differences to guide diagnosis and treatment of returning travelers, migrants and refugees. During the last two decades, GeoSentinel has identified a number of sentinel infectious disease events including previously unrecognized outbreaks and occurrence of diseases in locations thought not to harbor certain infectious agents. GeoSentinel has also provided useful insight into illnesses affecting different traveling populations such as migrants, business travelers and students, while characterizing in greater detail the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, leishmaniasis and Zika virus disease. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of travel- and migration-related infectious diseases has been the main focus of GeoSentinel for the last 25 years. However, GeoSentinel is now evolving into a network that will conduct both research and surveillance. The large number of participating sites and excellent geographic coverage for identification of both common and illnesses in individuals who have traversed international borders uniquely position GeoSentinel to make important contributions of travel-related infectious diseases in the years to come.","Hamer, Davidson H; Rizwan, Aisha; Freedman, David O; Kozarsky, Phyllis; Libman, Michael",J Travel Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33247586/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa219,167

The first was conducted at the end of the “first wave” [T1] and the second was carried out on October 12-14 2020 (the last period of the second total general lockdown) in Israel. The participants (N = 805) completed the same questionnaire at both time points. The study examined the predictions of hope and morale at T2 by psychological and demographic predictors at T1. Results indicated the following: (a) The three types of resilience (individual, community, and national) significantly and positively predicted hope and morale. (b) Well-being significantly and positively predicted hope and morale. (c) Younger age significantly and positively predicts higher hope, but not morale. (d) A higher level of religiosity significantly and positively predicts higher hope and morale. (e) More right-wing political attitudes significantly and positively predict higher hope, but not moral. (f) More economic difficulties due to the pandemic, significantly and negatively predict hope and morale. We concluded that hope and morale can serve as significant indicators of the population's ability to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design A retrospective multicentric cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in March-December 2019 (2019) versus March-December 2020 (2020). The independent predictors of disease stage (oncologic stage, associated symptoms, clinical T4 stage, metastasis) and postoperative outcome (surgical complications, palliative surgery, 30-day death) were evaluated using logistic regression. Results The sample consisted of 1755 patients operated in 2019, and 1481 in 2020 (both mean ages 69.6 years). The proportions of cancers with symptoms, clinical T4 stage, liver and lung metastases in 2019 and 2020 were, respectively: 80.8% vs 84.5%; 6.2% vs 8.7%; 10.2% vs 10.3%; and 3.0% vs 4.4%. The proportions of surgical complications, palliative surgery, and death in 2019 and 2020 were, respectively: 34.4%vs 31.9%; 5.0% vs 7.5%; and 1.7% vs 2.4%. At multivariate analysis, as compared with 2019, cancers in 2020 were significantly more likely to be symptomatic (Odds Ratio - OR: 1.36, 95% Confidence Interval - CI: 1.09-1.69), in clinical T4 stage (OR: 1.38; 1.03-1.85), with multiple liver metastases (OR: 2.21; 1.24-3.94), but less likely to cause surgical complications (OR: 0.79; 0.68-0.93).

In this work, a multi-scale territorial analysis of the pandemic is carried out using various models and data-driven approaches. Specifically, a logistic regression is employed to capture the evolution of the total positive cases in each region and throughout Italy, and an enhanced version of a SIR-type model is tuned to fit the different territorial epidemic dynamics via a differential evolution algorithm. Hierarchical clustering and multidimensional analysis are further exploited to reveal the similarities/dissimilarities of the remarkably different geographical epidemic developments.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of five different Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays regarding the quantification of anti-spike (S) antibodies induced after a single dose of BNT162b2. Methods Sera of n=69 SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals 21+/-1 days after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) were tested using the following quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays: Roche S total antibody, DiaSorin trimeric spike IgG, DiaSorin S1/S2 IgG, Abbott II IgG, and Serion/Virion IgG. Test agreement was assessed by Passing-Bablok regression. Results were further compared to the percent inhibition calculated from a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) by correlation and ROC (receiver-operating-characteristics) analysis. Results Individual values were distributed over several orders of magnitude for all assays evaluated. Although the assays were in good overall agreement (rho=0.80-0.94), Passing-Bablok regression revealed systematic and proportional differences, which could not be eliminated by converting the results to BAU/mL as suggested by the manufacturers. 7 (10%) individuals had a negative sVNT results (i.e. <30% inhibition). These samples were reliably identified by most assays and yielded low binding antibody levels (ROC-AUCs 0.84-0.93). Conclusions Although all assays evaluated showed good correlation, readings from different assays were not interchangeable, even when converted to BAU/mL using the WHO international standard for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin.

683847,Accelerating vaccine trial conduct in a pandemic with a hot spot‐based inclusion strategy using trial and epidemic simulation,2021-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of swine is necessary to control this devastating disease. By monitoring host serum antibodies to viral antigens, early virus detection within herds is feasible. In this study, recombinant antigens were generated using recombinant DNA techniques to fuse PRRSV structural protein (N) or nonstructural protein 1α (nsp1α) with the Rellina luciferase gene. Next, fused genes were cloned into plasmids and transfected into HEK-293 T cells for transient expression. Upon co-incubation of lysates with pig sera, antigen-antibody complexes formed that bound to Protein-G coated onto microplates. By further measurement of luminance value, a modified form of Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems, namely luciferase-linked antibody capture assay (LACA) was developed for detection of PRRSV-specific antibodies. RESULTS: Known anti-PRRSV antibody-positive or -negative serum samples (125 and 122 samples, respectively) were used to validate the LACA and compared it with IDEXX PRRS ×3 ELISA. Based on the result, N-Rluc and nsp1α-Rluc LACA results were 95.3 and 94.4% in agreement with IDEXX ELISA, suggested a similar specificity of LACA to IDEXX ELISA. Moreover, when both LACA and IDEXX ELISA were used to evaluate sequential serum samples obtained from PRRSV experimentally infected pigs, the PRRSV-specific antibody response was detectable as early as 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) using N-Rluc LACA, but undetectable until 7 dpi using IDEXX ELISA, suggesting an improved sensitivity of LACA. Meanwhile, antibodies specific for nsp1α were detected at higher levels overall, but were undetectable until 10 dpi. Furthermore,. Notably, one IDEXX ELISA positive result was not confirmed by LACA or IFA and was thus considered a false-positive result. CONCLUSION: The LACA exhibited similar specificity but improved sensitivity to that of the commercial IDEXX PRRS ×3 ELISA kit for detection of PRRSV-specific antibodies in pig serum. Importantly, LACA could be adapted for detecting antibodies against other PRRSV targets, such as nsp1α, to achieve earlier detection of PRRSV infection.","Li, Jie; Wang, Gang; Yang, Di; Zhao, Bao; Zhao, Yongpan; Liu, Yonggang; Cai, Xuehui; Nan, Yuchen; Zhou, En-Min; Wu, Chunyan",BMC Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-018-0483-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445953/,167
684394,Cancer Related Anemia: An Integrated Multitarget Approach and Lifestyle Interventions,2021-02-01,"The duration of natural immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 is a matter of some debate in the literature at present. For example, in a recent publication characterizing SARS-CoV-2 immunity over time, the authors fit pooled longitudinal data, using fitted slopes to infer the duration of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In fact, such approaches can lead to misleading conclusions as a result of statistical model-fitting artifacts. To exemplify this phenomenon, we reanalyzed one of the markers (pseudovirus neutralizing titer) in the publication, using mixed-effects modeling, a methodology better suited to longitudinal datasets like these. Our findings showed that the half-life was both longer and more variable than reported by the authors. The example selected by us here illustrates the utility of mixed-effects modeling in provide more accurate estimates of the duration and heterogeneity of half-lives of molecular and cellular biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 immunity.","Bottino, D.; Hather, G.; Yuan, L.; Stoddard, M.; White, L.; Chakravarty, A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.22.432379,167
684943,Chronic Disease Research Growing Global,2016-04-18,"BACKGROUND: The information regarding viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics in hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in central Fujian is limited. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics of ARTI in hospitalized children admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. METHODS: Cohort of 386 hospitalized children (31 days to 15 years) diagnosed with ARTI admitted to the Department of Pediatrics from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples on the day of hospitalization were tested for 11 viruses via a GeXP‐based multiplex‐PCR assay. The viral profiles and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall positive rate of the samples was 43.26% (167/386). Among the 167 positive samples, 134 (80.24%, 134/167) had a single virus and 33 (19.76%, 33/167) had multiple viruses. There was a significant difference in the frequency of single vs mixed infections among positive samples (80.24% vs 19.76%; χ (2) = 122.168, P = .000) as well as among the total examined samples (34.72% vs 8.55%; χ (2) = 77.945, P = .000). Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus (17.36%, 67/386), followed by influenza A (5.96%, 23/386) and human adenovirus (5.70%, 22/386). There was no significant difference in the etiological distribution of viral pathogens between males and females (χ (2) = 0.480, P = .489). Viral infections were more likely to occur in the winter‐spring months than in the summer‐autumn months (52.51% vs 33.53%, χ (2) = 13.830, P = .000). CONCLUSIONS: The GeXP‐based multiplex PCR is an accurate and high‐throughput assay allows us to quickly detect multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously in pediatric patients. Our study provides information on the viral profiles and clinical characteristics in hospitalized children with ARTI, which would help better effective prevention strategies.","Huang, Huanhuan; Chen, Suqing; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Hong, Linliang; Zeng, Yongbin; Wu, Bin",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31774213/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23127,167

As the number of cases rises in the United States (US), it has become more imperative to detect COVID-19 at its earliest radiologic stage to decrease community transmission. In this case series, we discuss five patients who presented with non-respiratory-related symptoms and underwent non-chest CT imaging, such as abdominal and neck CT, with a portion of the lungs visualized in each respective study. Imaging findings of COVID-19 include basilar and peripherally predominant pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities. All five of our patients had findings suggestive of COVID-19 that prompted the radiologist to suggest testing for the disease. Subsequently, four of the five patients tested positive for COVID-19, and one of them was presumed to have the diagnosis based on clinical and imaging findings.","Gattu, Rishabh; Kainth, Tejasvi; Singh, Gagandeep; Sakla, Nicole M; Sadler, Michael",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403178/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11748,167
686792,Effect of COVID-19 on Thoracic Oncology Surgery in Spain: A Spanish Thoracic Surgery Society (SECT) Survey,2021-06-09,"Abstract Introduction The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally. In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. Methods Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the ‘lockdown’ period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. Results Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. Discussion Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.","Olding, James; Zisman, Sophia; Olding, Carole; Fan, Kathleen",Surgeon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1479666X20301037; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1479666X20301037?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826157/,167

The aim of this study was to use a deep learning approach for predicting the outcome of patients with COVID-19 into two groups of critical and non-critical according to their CT features. Methods This was carried out as a retrospective study from March to April 2020 in Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. From total of 1078 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent chest CT, 169 were critical cases and 909 were non-critical. Deep learning neural networks were used to classify samples into critical or non-critical ones according to the chest CT results. Results The best accuracy of prediction was seen by the presence of diffuse opacities and lesion distribution (both=0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99). The largest sensitivity was achieved using lesion distribution (0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.93), and the largest specificity was for presence of diffuse opacities (0.95, 95% CI: 0.9-1). The total model showed an accuracy of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.79-0.99), and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.51-0.91) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87-0.96), respectively. Conclusions The results showed that CT scan can accurately classify and predict critical and non-critical COVID-19 cases.","Pourhoseingholi, Asma; Vahedi, Mohsen; Chaibakhsh, Samira; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Guest, Paul C; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34279835/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-71697-4_11,167

Statin is one of the drugs which is most commonly used for the treatment of dyslipidemic patients. This study aims to analyze the association between statin use and composite poor outcomes of COVID-19. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until November 25th, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and statin were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3 software. Results A total of 35 studies with a total of 11,930,583 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that statin use did not improve the composite poor outcomes of COVID-19 [OR 1.08 (95% CI 0.86 – 1.35), p = 0.50, I 2 = 98%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcomes of COVID-19 was influenced by age (p = 0.010), gender (p = 0.045), and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.012). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in studies with median age ≥60 years-old (OR 0.94) compared to <60 years-old (OR 1.43), and in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease ≥25% (RR 0.94) compared to <25% (RR 1.24). Conclusion Statin use did not improve the composite poor outcomes of COVID-19. Patients with dyslipidemia should continue taking statin drugs despite COVID-19 infection status, given its beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes.","Hariyanto, Timotius Ivan; Kurniawan, Andree",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939475321000910; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475321000910?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838992/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.02.020,167
687416,"Recommendations for Triage, Prioritization and Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020-04-16,"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that accounts for 10%–15% childhood cholestasis and could lead to infant disability or death. There are three well-established types of PFIC (1–3), caused by mutations in the ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4 genes. Biallelic pathogenic variants in the tight junction protein 2 gene (TJP2) were newly reported as a cause for PFIC type 4; however, only a limited number of patients and undisputable variants have been reported for TJP2, and the underlying mechanism for PFIC 4 remains poorly understood. To explore the diagnostic yield of TJP2 analysis in suspected PFIC patients negative for the PFIC1–3 mutation, we designed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing method to analyze TJP2 gene variants in 267 PFIC patients and identified biallelic rare variants in three patients, including three known pathogenic variants and two novel variants in three patients. By using CRISPR-cas9 technology, we demonstrated that TJP2 c.1202A > G was pathogenic at least partially by increasing the expression and nuclear localization of TJP2 protein. With the minigene assay, we showed that TJP2 c.2668-11A > G was a new pathogenic variant by inducing abnormal splicing of TJP2 gene and translation of prematurely truncated TJP2 protein. Furthermore, knockdown of TJP2 protein by siRNA technology led to inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, dispersed F-actin, and disordered microfilaments in LO2 and HepG2celles. Global gene expression profiling of TJP2 knockdown LO2 cells and HepG2 cells identified the dysregulated genes involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Microtubule cytoskeleton genes were significantly downregulated in TJP2 knockdown cells. The results of this study demonstrate that TJP2 c.1202A > G and TJP2 c.2668-11A > G are two novel pathogenic variants and the cytoskeleton-related functions and pathways might be potential molecular pathogenesis for PFIC.","Tang, Jia; Tan, Meihua; Deng, Yihui; Tang, Hui; Shi, Haihong; Li, Mingzhen; Ma, Wei; Li, Jia; Dai, Hongzheng; Li, Jianli; Zhou, Shengmei; Li, Xu; Wei, Fengxiang; Ma, Xiaofen; Luo, Liangping",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.661599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504838/,167
687642,Emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for urothelial carcinoma,2021-01-14,"The interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with CD4+ T lymphocytes is well studied and typically results in virally induced cytolysis. In contrast, relatively little is known concerning the interplay between HIV-1 and microglia. Recent findings suggest that, counter-intuitively, HIV-1 infection may extend the lifespan of microglia. We developed a novel cell line model system to confirm and mechanistically study this phenomenon. We found that transduction of a human microglial cell line with an HIV-1 vector results in a powerful cytoprotective effect following apoptotic challenge. This effect was reproduced by ectopic expression of a single virus-encoded protein, Tat. Subsequent studies showed that the pro-survival effects of intracellular Tat could be attributed to activation of the PI-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the microglial cell line. Furthermore, we found that expression of Tat led to decreased expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI-3-K pathway. Consistent with this, decreased p53 activity and increased E2F activity were observed. Based on these findings, a model of possible regulatory circuits that intracellular Tat and HIV-1 infection engage during the cytoprotective event in microglia has been suggested. We propose that the expression of Tat may enable HIV-1 infected microglia to survive throughout the course of infection, leading to persistent HIV-1 production and infection in the central nervous system.","Chugh, Pauline; Fan, Shongshan; Planelles, Vicente; Maggirwar, Sanjay B.; Dewhurst, Stephen; Kim, Baek",J Mol Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606015403; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606015403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17157319/,167
688006,ACE2 expression in rat brain: Implications for COVID-19 associated neurological manifestations,2021-08-13,"Purpose.– Molecular processes can have a different impact on epidemiological data. Patients and methods. – The study covers 118 nasal aspirate samples taken on children hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbation for 2 years. Conventional techniques associated viral culture and immunofluorescence while molecular techniques used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results. – Virus presence was revealed with conventional techniques in 34% of the respiratory samples (40/118), while PCR study of viruses and genomes of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae allowed positive identification in 68% of the samples (80/118). The combination of both techniques allowed identification of an infectious agent in 77% of cases (91/118). More than one pathogenic agent was isolated in 23% of positive samples. Epidemiological study shows prevalence of rhinovirus (45%), then respiratory syncytial virus (28%) and enterovirus (8.5%). In children under 2 years of age, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus have a close prevalence (respectively 42 and 36%), which is not the same result as in older children (respectively 66 and 27%). Moreover, PCR techniques allowed the identification of just a few Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6/118). Conclusion. – In this study, molecular techniques of identification demonstrate a clear advantage in sensitivity compared to performances of viral cultures or immunofluorescence. The importance of rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus is remarkable while Chlamydia pneumoniae an Mycoplasma pneumoniae do not seem to be particularly involved.","Brouard, J; Freymuth, F; Toutain, F; Vabret, A; Petitjean, J; Gouarin, S; Guillois, B; Duhamel, J.F",Rev Fr Allergol Immunol Clin,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0335745701000429; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0335745701000429,167

It has been hypothesized that an increased pulmonary blood flow associated with an impairment of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is responsible for an intrapulmonary shunt. COVID-19 may lead to refractory hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio below 100 mmHg) despite mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. We hypothesized that the use of a pulmonary vasoconstrictor may help decrease the shunt and thus enhance oxygenation. CASE SUMMARY: We report our experience with three patients with refractory hypoxemia treated with almitrine to enhance oxygenation. Low dose almitrine (Vectarion(®); Servier, Suresnes, France) was started at an infusion rate of 4 μg × kg/min on a central line. The PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio and total respiratory system compliance during almitrine infusion were measured. For the three patients, the PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio time-course showed a dramatic increase whereas total respiratory system compliance was unchanged. The three patients were discharged from the intensive care unit. The intensive care unit length of stay for patient 1, patient 2 and patient 3 was 30 d, 32 d and 31 d, respectively. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was performed 13 d, 18 d and 15 d after almitrine infusion for patient 1, 2 and 3, respectively. We found no deleterious effects on the right ventricular function, which was similar to previous studies on almitrine safety. CONCLUSION: Almitrine may be effective and safe to enhance oxygenation in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

Using recent advances in Bayesian spatial econometric techniques, we particularly focus on the time-dependent importance of alternative spatial linkage structures such as the number of flight connections, relationships in international trade, and common borders. The flexible model setup allows to study the intensity and type of spatial spillover structures over time. Our results show notable spatial spillover mechanisms in the early stages of the virus with international flight linkages as the main transmission channel. In later stages, our model shows a sharp drop in the intensity spatial spillovers due to national travel bans, indicating that travel restrictions led to a reduction of cross-country spillovers.","Krisztin, Tamás; Piribauer, Philipp; Wögerer, Michael",Lett Spat Resour Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12076-020-00254-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269031/,167

Because of the high transmissibility of the virus and the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, developing effective and safe vaccines is a top research priority. Here, we provide a detailed evaluation of the immunogenicity of lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccines encoding the full length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain in mice. We demonstrate that a single dose of these vaccines induces strong type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, as well as long-lived plasma and memory B cell responses. Additionally, we detect robust and sustained neutralizing antibody responses and the antibodies elicited by nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines do not show antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in vitro. Our findings suggest that the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform can induce robust immune responses and is a promising candidate to combat COVID-19.","Laczkó, Dorottya; Hogan, Michael J.; Toulmin, Sushila A.; Hicks, Philip; Lederer, Katlyn; Gaudette, Brian T.; Castaño, Diana; Amanat, Fatima; Muramatsu, Hiromi; Oguin, Thomas H.; Ojha, Amrita; Zhang, Lizhou; Mu, Zekun; Parks, Robert; Manzoni, Tomaz B.; Roper, Brianne; Strohmeier, Shirin; Tombácz, István; Arwood, Leslee; Nachbagauer, Raffael; Karikó, Katalin; Greenhouse, Jack; Pessaint, Laurent; Porto, Maciel; Putman-Taylor, Tammy; Strasbaugh, Amanda; Campbell, Tracey-Ann; Lin, Paulo J.C.; Tam, Ying K.; Sempowski, Gregory D.; Farzan, Michael; Choe, Hyeryun; Saunders, Kevin O.; Haynes, Barton F.; Andersen, Hanne; Eisenlohr, Laurence C.; Weissman, Drew; Krammer, Florian; Bates, Paul; Allman, David; Locci, Michela; Pardi, Norbert",Immunity,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761320303265; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783919/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320303265?v=s5,167

Infection control interventions in care homes need to not only be effective in containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but also feasible to implement in this special setting which is both a healthcare institution and a home. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 via contacts between individuals, including residents, staff members, and visitors in a care home setting. We explored a representative care home in Scotland in our base case and explore other care home setups in an uncertainty analysis. We evaluated the effectiveness of a range of intervention strategies in controlling the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the presence of the reference interventions that have been implemented in many care homes, including testing of new admissions, isolation of symptomatic residents, and restricted public visiting, routine testing of staff appears to be the most effective and practical approach. Routine testing of residents is no more effective as a reference strategy while routine testing of both staff and residents only shows a negligible additive effect. Modeling results are very sensitive to transmission probability per contact, but the qualitative finding is robust to varying parameter values in our uncertainty analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predictions suggest that routine testing should target staff in care homes in conjunction with adherence to strict hand hygiene and using personal protective equipment to reduce risk of transmission per contact.","Nguyen, Le L.

The energy vs volume plots in the three magnetic states suggest the ferromagnetic phase to be the stable phase of GdP. The cohesive energy calculated for GdP is negative, suggesting the stability of the compound. The electronic band structure calculations predict the binary GdP to be a direct bandgap conventional semiconductor. The optical properties confirm the semiconducting properties of GdP, and the bandgap formation follows Penn’s criteria. The elastic constants also confirm the stability of the compound with ductile nature. The thermodynamic properties including Debye temperature, entropy, and specific heat capacity are studied under varying hydrostatic pressures taking into account the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The doping of Cu in the supercell of GdP results in the compound to exhibit half-metallic ferromagnetic properties. The magnetic moments calculated for Cu(x)Gd(1-x)P (x = 0.25) are integer-valued backing its half-metallic character and fit excellent with the Slauter-Pauling rule Z(t)-8.
