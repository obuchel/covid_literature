6938,„Off-label use“ in der Herzchirurgie,2009-07-22,"Cognitive impairment is a common occurrence that has been shown to occur in over 50 % of patients following critical illness. This impairment occurs across a range of domains including attention, memory, processing speed, and executive dysfunction. In this article, we will discuss the pathophysiology behind cognitive impairment including hypoxemia and cytokines. Secondly, we will describe the risk factors for cognitive impairment including age, length of stay, and delirium. Lastly, we will review emerging data related to the use of cognitive rehabilitation, formation of postintensive care clinics in qualifying patients, and potential neuropharmacologic therapy. While our chapter focuses on cognitive impairment generally, it places a particular emphasis on executive dysfunction, not because impairment occurs solely in this domain but because impairments of an executive nature may be uniquely debilitating.","Stollings, Joanna L.; Wilson, Jo Ellen; Jackson, James C.; Ely, E.

11161,Complex abdominal wall hernia repair with biologic mesh in elderly: a propensity matched analysis,2020-01-24,"KEY MESSAGE: A plant-based multiepitopic protein (LTBentero) containing epitopes from ETEC, S. typhimurium, and V. parahaemolyticus was produced in plants cells and triggered systemic and intestinal humoral responses in immunized mice. ABSTRACT: Around 200 million people suffer gastroenteritis daily and more than 2 million people die annually in developing countries due to such pathologies. Vaccination is an alternative to control this global health issue, however new low-cost vaccines are needed to ensure proper vaccine coverage. In this context, plants are attractive hosts for the synthesis and delivery of subunit vaccines. Therefore, in this study a plant-made multiepitopic protein named LTBentero containing epitopes from antigens of enterotoxigenic E. coli, S. typhimurium, and V. parahaemolyticus was produced and found immunogenic in mice. The LTBentero protein was expressed in tobacco plants at up to 5.29 µg g(−1) fresh leaf tissue and was deemed immunogenic when administered to BALB/c mice either orally or subcutaneously. The plant-made LTBentero antigen induced specific IgG (systemic) and IgA (mucosal) responses against LTB, ST, and LptD epitopes. In conclusion, multiepitopic LTBentero was functionally produced in plant cells, being capable to trigger systemic and intestinal humoral responses and thus it constitutes a promising oral immunogen candidate in the fight against enteric diseases.","Trujillo, Edgar; Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio; Angulo, Carlos",Plant Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223238/,520
11518,Effect of the “Recruitment” Maneuver on Respiratory Mechanics in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Surgery,2020-03-23,"The eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a public health priority. Despite the efficiency of treatment with direct-acting antivirals, the high cost of the therapy and the lack of accurate data about the HCV-infected population worldwide constitute important factors hampering this task. Hence, an affordable preventive vaccine is still necessary for reducing transmission and the future disease burden globally. In this work, chimeric proteins (EnvCNS3 and NS3EnvCo) encompassing conserved and immunogenic epitopes from the HCV core, E1, E2 and NS3 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli, and their immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The impact of recombinant HCV E2.680 protein and oligodeoxynucleotide 39M (ODN39M) on the immune response to chimeric proteins was also assessed. Immunization with chimeric proteins mixed with E2.680 enhanced the antibody and cellular response against HCV antigens and chimeric proteins. Interestingly, the combination of NS3EnvCo with E2.680 and ODN39M as adjuvant elicited a potent antibody response characterized by an increase in antibodies of the IgG2a subclass against E2.680, NS3 and chimeric proteins, suggesting the induction of a Th1-type response. Moreover, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and a broad response of IFN-γ-secreting cells against HCV antigens were induced with this formulation as well. This T cell response was able to protect vaccinated mice against challenge with a surrogate model based on HCV recombinant vaccinia virus. Overall, the vaccine candidate NS3EnvCo/E2.680/ODN39M might constitute an effective immunogen against HCV with potential for reducing the likelihood of viral persistence.","Olivera, Santa; Perez, Angel; Falcon, Viviana; Urquiza, Dioslaida; Pichardo, Dagmara; Martinez-Donato, Gillian",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224087/,520
19981,Characterizing Timing of Postoperative Complications Following Elective Roux-en-Y gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy,2021-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Human mobility among residential locations can drive dengue virus (DENV) transmission dynamics. Recently, it was shown that individuals with symptomatic DENV infection exhibit significant changes in their mobility patterns, spending more time at home during illness. This change in mobility is predicted to increase the risk of acquiring infection for those living with or visiting the ill individual. It has yet to be considered, however, whether social contacts are also changing their mobility, either by socially distancing themselves from the infectious individual or increasing contact to help care for them. Social, or physical, distancing and caregiving could have diverse yet important impacts on DENV transmission dynamics; therefore, it is necessary to better understand the nature and frequency of these behaviors including their effect on mobility. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Through community-based febrile illness surveillance and RT-PCR infection confirmation, 67 DENV positive (DENV+) residents were identified in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Using retrospective interviews, data were collected on visitors and home-based care received during the illness. While 15% of participants lost visitors during their illness, 22% gained visitors; overall, 32% of all individuals (particularly females) received visitors while symptomatic. Caregiving was common (90%), particularly caring by housemates (91%) and caring for children (98%). Twenty-eight percent of caregivers changed their behavior enough to have their work (and, likely, mobility patterns) affected. This was significantly more likely when caring for individuals with low “health-related quality of well-being” during illness (Fisher’s Exact, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates that social contacts of individuals with dengue modify their patterns of visitation and caregiving. The observed mobility changes could impact a susceptible individual’s exposure to virus or a presymptomatic/clinically inapparent individual’s contribution to onward transmission. Accounting for changes in social contact mobility is imperative in order to get a more accurate understanding of DENV transmission.","Schaber, Kathryn L.; Morrison, Amy C.; Elson, William H.; Astete-Vega, Helvio; Córdova-López, Jhonny J.; Ríos López, Esther Jennifer; Flores, W.

In this study, the molecular organization of palmitic acid (PA) films on alkaline buffer solutions (pH 7.4) with and without divalent Ca2+ was measured at a constant surface area using Langmuir troughs coupled with microscopy and X-ray interfacial techniques. Without Ca2+, PA molecules remained a monolayer organization; however, with Ca2+, formation of the inverted bilayers of PA-Ca2+ superstructures caused a spontaneous 2D to 3D transformation under no compression due to the strong interaction between PA and the divalent cation. Self-assembly of this highly-organized inverted bilayer superstructure involved a two-step process of nucleation and nuclei growth. During nucleation, densely packed PA and Ca2+ monolayer firstly corrugated and some of PA and Ca2+ molecules ejected out from the monolayer; the ejected molecules then reorganized and formed the inverted bilayer nuclei. Nucleation was followed by nuclei growth, during which PA and Ca2+ in the monolayer kept integrating into the inverted bilayer structure through molecule migration and PA rotation around Ca2+.","Zhang, Pin; Pham, Tiep; Zheng, Xin; Liu, Chang; Plata, Paola Leon; Král, Petr; Bu, Wei; Lin, Binhua; Liu, Ying","Colloids and surfaces.

59716,Upper Tract Urological Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Surgery (LESS).,2015,"Ever since Darwin's discovery of natural selection, we expect traits to evolve to increase organisms' fitness. As a result, we can use optimization models to make a priori predictions of phenotypic variation, even when selection is frequency-dependent. A notable example is the prediction of female-biased sex ratios resulting from local mate competition (LMC) and inbreeding. LMC models incorporate the effects of LMC and inbreeding. Fig wasp sex ratio adjustments fit LMC predictions well. However, the appropriateness of LMC models to fig wasps has been questioned, and the role that a coincidental by-product plays in creating the apparent fit has been clearly illustrated. Here, we show that the sex ratio adjustments of a fig wasp are the result of a dual mechanism. It consists of a standard facultative LMC response favoured by natural selection, as well as a mechanism that may be the result of selection, but that could also be a coincidental by-product. If it is a by-product, the fitness increase is coincidental and natural selection's role was limited to fine-tuning it for higher fitness returns. We further document a case of an apparent fitness-reducing sex ratio adjustment. We conclude that the use of the adaptationist approach demands that our understanding of traits must be remodelled continually to rectify spurious assumptions.","Greeff, Jaco M; Pentz, Karina; Warren, Marié",Proceedings.

59733,To band or not to band--early results of banded sleeve gastrectomy.,2014,"Humans scan their visual environment using saccade eye movements. Where we look is influenced by bottom-up salience and top-down factors, like value. For reactive saccades in response to suddenly appearing stimuli, it has been shown that short-latency saccades are biased towards salience, and that top-down control increases with increasing latency. Here, we show, in a series of six experiments, that this transition towards top-down control is not determined by the time it takes to integrate value information into the saccade plan, but by the time it takes to inhibit suddenly appearing salient stimuli. Participants made consecutive saccades to three fixation crosses and a vertical bar consisting of a high-salient and a rewarded low-salient region. Endpoints on the bar were biased towards salience whenever it appeared or reappeared shortly before the last saccade was initiated. This was also true when the eye movement was already planned. When the location of the suddenly appearing salient region was predictable, saccades were aimed in the opposite direction to nullify this sudden onset effect. Successfully inhibiting salience, however, could only be achieved by previewing the target. These findings highlight the importance of inhibition for top-down eye-movement control.","Wolf, Christian; Lappe, Markus","Attention, perception & psychophysics",https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-020-02101-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803547/,520

60589,Three-Port Laparoscopic Right Colectomy Versus Conventional Five-Port Laparoscopy for Right-Sided Colon Cancer.,2019,"Background: Existing research suggests positive correlations between screen time sedentary behaviors (STSB) and substance use, including cannabis use, among youth. However, little research has examined what factors mediate these relationships.Methods: This study examined mediating pathways among STSB, internalizing symptoms (IS), and cannabis use in a linked longitudinal sample of 28 269 Canadian youth who participated in the COMPASS study over a two-year period (2017/18 to 2018/19). Structural equation modeling examined two main hypotheses cross-sectionally and over time: 1) if IS mediated associations between STSB and cannabis use frequency, and 2) if STSB mediated associations between IS and cannabis use frequency. Results: Results demonstrated significant partial mediation effects for both hypotheses. For example, indirect effects indicated that IS mediated the association between STSB and cannabis use both cross sectionally (95% CI: 0.021, 0.029) and longitudinally (95% CI: 0.006, 0.010). STSB also mediated associations between IS and cannabis use cross sectionally (95% CI: 0.015, 0.023) and longitudinally (95% CI: 0.010, 0.014). This study demonstrated that the associations between STSB, internalizing symptoms and cannabis use are complex, involving mediation in both directions.Discussion: These findings can be used to inform public health initiatives that aim to take a comprehensive approach to addressing negative health behaviors and outcomes, as it is clear that the multi-directional relationships between STSB and mental health may in-turn impact other health behaviors. Future research should continue to examine mediating factors between STSB and substance use among youth, including exploration of associations with other substances.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1922455 .","Doggett, Amanda; Gohari, Mahmood R; Godin, Katelyn M; Ferro, Mark A; Patte, Karen A; Leatherdale, Scott T",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1922455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975522/,520
61014,"Laparoscopic Repair of Small Ventral Hernias Using the ""Ventralex™ Hernia Patch"".",2019,"UNLABELLED Viruses exploit molecules on the target membrane as receptors for attachment and entry into host cells. Thus, receptor expression patterns can define viral tissue tropism and might to some extent predict the susceptibility of a host to a particular virus. Previously, others and we have shown that respiratory pathogens of the genus Gammacoronavirus, including chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), require specific α2,3-linked sialylated glycans for attachment and entry. Here, we studied determinants of binding of enterotropic avian gammacoronaviruses, including turkey coronavirus (TCoV), guineafowl coronavirus (GfCoV), and quail coronavirus (QCoV), which are evolutionarily distant from respiratory avian coronaviruses based on the viral attachment protein spike (S1). We profiled the binding of recombinantly expressed S1 proteins of TCoV, GfCoV, and QCoV to tissues of their respective hosts. Protein histochemistry showed that the tissue binding specificity of S1 proteins of turkey, quail, and guineafowl CoVs was limited to intestinal tissues of each particular host, in accordance with the reported pathogenicity of these viruses in vivo. Glycan array analyses revealed that, in contrast to the S1 protein of IBV, S1 proteins of enteric gammacoronaviruses recognize a unique set of nonsialylated type 2 poly-N-acetyl-lactosamines. Lectin histochemistry as well as tissue binding patterns of TCoV S1 further indicated that these complex N-glycans are prominently expressed on the intestinal tract of various avian species. In conclusion, our data demonstrate not only that enteric gammacoronaviruses recognize a novel glycan receptor but also that enterotropism may be correlated with the high specificity of spike proteins for such glycans expressed in the intestines of the avian host. IMPORTANCE Avian coronaviruses are economically important viruses for the poultry industry. While infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a respiratory pathogen of chickens, is rather well known, other viruses of the genus Gammacoronavirus, including those causing enteric disease, are hardly studied. In turkey, guineafowl, and quail, coronaviruses have been reported to be the major causative agent of enteric diseases. Specifically, turkey coronavirus outbreaks have been reported in North America, Europe, and Australia for several decades. Recently, a gammacoronavirus was isolated from guineafowl with fulminating disease. To date, it is not clear why these avian coronaviruses are enteropathogenic, whereas other closely related avian coronaviruses like IBV cause respiratory disease. A comprehensive understanding of the tropism and pathogenicity of these viruses explained by their receptor specificity and receptor expression on tissues was therefore needed. Here, we identify a novel glycan receptor for enteric avian coronaviruses, which will further support the development of vaccines.","Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe, I N; de Vries, R P; Weerts, E A W S; van Beurden, S J; Peng, W; McBride, R; Ducatez, M; Guy, J; Brown, P; Eterradossi, N; Gröne, A; Paulson, J C; Verheije, M H",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00745-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063435/,520
61088,Single-incision versus hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy: a case-matched series.,2010,"Introduction Staple-line bleeding and leakage are the most common serious complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The relationship between multiple stapler firings and higher risk of postoperative complications is well defined in colorectal surgery but has not been addressed in bariatric procedures so far. Identification of new factors such as ""the numbers of stapler firings used during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)"" as a predictor for complications can lead to optimization of the patient care at bariatric centers. Aim To determine the association between perioperative morbidity and the number of stapler firings during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Material and methods This observational study was based on retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in patients operated on for morbid obesity in a teaching hospital/tertiary referral center for general surgery. The patients who underwent LSG were analyzed in terms of the number of stapler firings used as a new potential risk predictor for postoperative complications after surgery, adjusting for other patient- and treatment-related factors. The study included 333 patients (209 women, 124 men, mean age: 40 ±11). Results During the first 30 days after surgery, complications were observed in 18 (5.41%) patients. Multivariate analysis showed that prolonging operative time increased morbidity (every minute, OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02) and the complication rate increased with the number of stapler firings (every firing, OR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.09-3.33; p = 0.023). Conclusions Additional stapler firings above the usual number and a prolonged operation should alert a surgeon and the whole team about increased risk of postoperative complications.","Major, Piotr; Wysocki, Michał; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Pisarska, Magdalena; Małczak, Piotr; Wierdak, Mateusz; Dembiński, Marcin; Migaczewski, Marcin; Rubinkiewicz, Mateusz; Budzyński, Andrzej",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2017.70197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29643964/,520

However, their impermeable design causes increased physiological strain and reduced thermoregulation, limiting work times and causing heat-related illnesses (HRI). Use of wearable cooling devices slow heat accumulation and have been shown to reduce thermal and cardiovascular strain in such situations. METHODS This was a prospective clinical evaluation to determine the tolerability and effectiveness of the CarbonCool cooling system - a half-body cooling vest - in participants undergoing a HAZMAT decontamination recertification. Physiological measurements (heart rate [HR], weight, temperature, and blood pressure) and participant feedback were obtained. The main outcome of interest was participants' tolerability of the cooling vest. RESULTS A total of 23 healthy participants were recruited, with 10 randomized to the intervention group and 13 in the control group. Mean age in the control and intervention group was 35.5 years old (SD = 7.8) and 30.0 years old (SD = 6.2), respectively. Qualitative feedback obtained from participants regarding safety, mobility, and cooling efficacy was largely positive.

This study compares safety and imaging response of ablation, chemoembolization, radioembolization, and supportive care in patients with both TIPS and HCC. METHODS This retrospective study included 48 patients who had both a TIPS and a diagnosis of HCC. Twenty-nine of 48 (60%) underwent treatment for HCC, and 19/48 (40%) received best supportive care (i.e., symptomatic management only). While etiology of cirrhosis and indication for TIPS were similar between the two groups, treated patients had better baseline liver function (34 vs. 67% Child-Pugh class C). Tumor characteristics were similar between the two groups. A total of 39 ablations, 17 chemoembolizations, and 10 yttrium-90 radioembolizations were performed on 29 patients. RESULTS Ablation procedures resulted in low rates of hepatotoxicity and clinical toxicity. Post-embolization/ablation syndrome occurred more frequently in patients undergoing chemoembolization than ablation (47 vs. 15%). Significant hepatic dysfunction occurred more frequently in the chemoembolization group than the ablation group. Follow-up imaging response showed objective response in 100% of ablation procedures, 67% of radioembolization procedures, and 50% of chemoembolization procedures (p = 0.001). When censored for OLT, patients undergoing treatment survived longer than patients receiving supportive care (2273 v. 439 days, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Ablation appears to be safe and efficacious for HCC in patients with TIPS. Catheter-based approaches are associated with potential increased toxicity in this patient population. Chemoembolization appears to be associated with increased toxicity compared to radioembolization.","Padia, Siddharth A; Chewning, Rush H; Kogut, Matthew J; Ingraham, Christopher R; Johnson, Guy E; Bhattacharya, Renuka; Kwan, Sharon W; Monsky, Wayne L; Vaidya, Sandeep; Hippe, Daniel S; Valji, Karim",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-014-1009-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25373795/,520

We therefore aimed to develop a preterm lamb model of the non-intubated very preterm infant on CPAP. METHODS After staged exteriorisation and instrumentation, preterm lambs were delivered from anaesthetised ewes at 131 to 133 days gestation. Via a single nasal prong (4-mm internal diameter, 6- to 7-cm depth), positive pressure was delivered from the outset, with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) used until transition to nasal CPAP was attempted, and periodically thereafter for hypoventilation. Caffeine and doxapram were used as respiratory stimulants. Gastric distension was prevented with an oesophageal balloon. Cardiorespiratory parameters and results of arterial blood gas analyses were monitored throughout the study period, which continued for 150 min after first transition to CPAP. RESULTS Ten preterm lambs were studied, at gestation 132 ± 1 days (mean ± SD) and birth weight 3.6 ± 0.45 kg. After stabilisation on NIPPV, transition to nasal CPAP was first attempted at 28 ± 11 min. There was transient respiratory acidosis, with gradual resolution as spontaneous respiratory activity increased. In the final hour, 79% ± 33% of time was spent on CPAP alone, with typical respiratory rates around 60 breaths per minute. PaCO2 at end-experiment was 58 ± 36 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS Non-intubated preterm lambs can be effectively transitioned to nasal CPAP soon after birth. This animal model will be valuable for further research.","Dargaville, Peter A; Lavizzari, Anna; Padoin, Priscila; Black, Don; Zonneveld, Elroy; Perkins, Elizabeth; Sourial, Magdy; Rajapaksa, Anushi E; Davis, Peter G; Hooper, Stuart B; Moss, Timothy Jm; Polglase, Graeme R; Tingay, David G",Intensive care medicine experimental,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-015-0051-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215815/,520
62248,Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy: outcomes of an emerging minimally invasive technique.,2011,"BACKGROUND One of the main barriers to choosing peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the lack of awareness and PD knowledge. There is an increasing trend in the use of the internet as a search tool for health-related information. This study aims to determine how useful YouTube videos are to get information about PD. METHODS YouTube videos were evaluated independently by two nephrologists. The videos' quality was assessed with DISCERN scoring system, global quality score (GQS) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) scoring system. We determined the quartile (Q) of the videos as follows: most reliable top 25% videos Q1 and others Q2-4. RESULTS A total of 295 videos were evaluated. University or society-sourced videos made up 15% (n = 43) of all videos, and healthcare providers were the primary target audience compared to patients (p < 0.001). JAMA, GQS and DISCERN scores were significantly higher for the videos that were targeted healthcare providers compared to the patients (p < 0.001, for all). A total of 34% of the videos in Q1 were obtained from the university or society. Nevertheless, only 17% of the videos prepared for the patients were among the Q1. A small number of videos mentioned that PD maintains the residual kidney function (RKF) longer compared to haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS Universities and societies should upload videos to provide easy-to-understand information on PD. Also, the important benefits of PD, like the preservation of RKF, should be further highlighted in these videos. It may increase the PD penetrance by increasing patients' awareness.","Yeter, Hasan Haci; Akcay, Omer Faruk",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1177/08968608211035947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369832/,520

62557,Dilatation of Sleeve Gastrectomy: Myth or Reality?,2017,"The identification of a beta-cell tracer is a major quest in diabetes research. However, since MRI, PET and SPECT cannot resolve individual islets, optical techniques are required to assess the specificity of these tracers. We propose to combine Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM) with fluorescence detection in a single optical platform to facilitate these initial screening steps from cell culture up to living rodents. OCM can image islets and vascularization without any labeling. Thereby, it alleviates the need of both genetically modified mice to detect islets and injection of external dye to reveal vascularization. We characterized Cy5.5-exendin-3, an agonist of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R), for which other imaging modalities have been used and can serve as a reference. Cultured cells transfected with GLP1R and incubated with Cy5.5-exendin-3 show full tracer internalization. We determined that a dose of 1 μg of Cy5.5-exendin-3 is sufficient to optically detect in vivo the tracer in islets with a high specificity. In a next step, time-lapse OCM imaging was used to monitor the rapid and specific tracer accumulation in murine islets and its persistence over hours. This optical platform represents a versatile toolbox for selecting beta-cell specific markers for diabetes research and future clinical diagnosis.","Berclaz, Corinne; Pache, Christophe; Bouwens, Arno; Szlag, Daniel; Lopez, Antonio; Joosten, Lieke; Ekim, Selen; Brom, Maarten; Gotthardt, Martin; Grapin-Botton, Anne; Lasser, Theo",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep10385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988507/,520

METHODS Before the 2013-2014 influenza season, nasal swabs were obtained from 59 pediatric participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 17 of their healthy siblings immediately before vaccination and 4 times during the week of follow-up. Real-time RT-PCR assays were used to detect influenza RNA. Co-detection of a non-influenza respiratory virus (NIRV) at the time of vaccination was determined by a multiplex RT-PCR assay. Differences in the proportions and rates of influenza detection and their 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated. RESULTS Influenza RNA was detected in 16% fewer participants (95% CrI: -7, 39%) throughout follow-up in the NIRV-positive group compared with the NIRV-negative group (59% vs. 75%). This was also observed in participants with CF alone (66% vs. 74%; RD = 8% 95% CrI: -16, 33%) as well as in healthy participants only (75% vs. 30%; RD = 45%, 95% CrI: -2, 81%). Influenza was detected in NIRV-negative subjects for 0.49 d more compared with NIRV-positive subjects (95% CrI: -0.37, 1.26). CONCLUSION The observed proportion of subjects in whom influenza RNA was detected and the duration of detection differed slightly between NIRV- positive and -negative subjects. However, wide credible intervals for the difference preclude definitive conclusions. If true, this observed association may be related to a recent viral respiratory infection, a phenomenon known as viral interference.","Boikos, Constantina; Papenburg, Jesse; Martineau, Christine; Joseph, Lawrence; Scheifele, David; Chilvers, Mark; Lands, Larry C; De Serres, Gaston; Quach, Caroline",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2017.1287641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273006/,520

Following sequence alignment of IBV strains, a combination of selective primer sets was designed to individually amplify the IBV wild-type and vaccine strains using a multiplex amplification refractory mutation system reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (ARMS RT-PCR) approach. This system was shown to discriminate the IBV wild-type and vaccine strains. Moreover, an ARMS real-time RT-PCR (ARMS qRT-PCR) was combined with a high-resolution analysis (HRMA) to establish a melt curve analysis program. The specificity of the ARMS RT-PCR and the ARMS qRT-PCR was verified using unrelated avian viruses. Different melting temperatures and distinct normalized and shifted melting curve patterns for the IBV Mass, IBV H120, IBV TW-I, and IBV TW-II strains were detected. The new assays were used on samples of lung and trachea as well as virus from allantoic fluid and cell culture. In addition to being able to detect the presence of IBV vaccine and wild-type strains by ARMS RT-PCR, the IBV Mass, IBV H120, IBV TW-I, and IBV TW-II strains were distinguished using ARMS qRT-PCR by their melting temperatures and by HRMA. These approaches have acceptable sensitivities and specificities and therefore should be able to serve as options when carrying out differential diagnosis of IBV in Taiwan and China.","Huang, Shr-Wei; Ho, Chia-Fang; Chan, Kun-Wei; Cheng, Min-Chung; Shien, Jui-Hung; Liu, Hung-Jen; Wang, Chi-Young","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638714547735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223342/,520
62968,Influence of additional resection of the gastric fundus on excessive weight loss in laparoscopic very very long limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,2013,"OBJECTIVES With 70% of care home residents experiencing a medication error every day in the UK, better multi-professional working between medical practitioners, pharmacists and care homes was recommended. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness (falls reduction) and cost-effectiveness, of a multi-professional medication review (MPMR) service in care homes for older people. METHOD A total of care homes in the East of England were cluster randomised to 'usual care' or two multi-professional (General practitioner, clinical pharmacist and care homes staff) medication reviews during the 12-month trial period. Target recruitment was 900 residents with 10% assumed loss to follow-up. Co-primary outcome measures were number of falls and potentially inappropriate prescribing assessed by the Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions. KEY FINDINGS A total of 826 care home residents were recruited with 324 lost to follow-up for at least one primary outcome measure. The mean number of falls per resident per annum was 3.3 for intervention and 3.0 for control (P = 0.947). Each resident was found to be prescribed 0.69 (intervention) and 0.85 (control) potentially inappropriate medicines after 12 months (P = 0.046). No significant difference identified in emergency hospital admissions or deaths. Estimated unadjusted incremental mean cost per resident was £374.26 higher in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS In line with other medication review based interventions in care homes, two MPMRs improved medication appropriateness but failed to demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes. From a health system perspective costs where estimated to increase overall and therefore a different model of medicines management is required.","Desborough, James A; Clark, Allan; Houghton, Julie; Sach, Tracey; Shaw, Val; Kirthisingha, Viveca; Holland, Richard C; Wright, David J",The International journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpp.12656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666576/,520

Here, we characterize chromosome 6 ORF 106 (C6orf106) as an evolutionarily conserved inhibitor of the innate antiviral response. C6orf106 suppresses the synthesis of interferon (IFN)-α/β and proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α in response to the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) and to Sendai virus infection. Unlike canonical inhibitors of antiviral signaling, C6orf106 blocks interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and, to a lesser extent, NF-κB activity without modulating their activation, nuclear translocation, cellular expression, or degradation. Instead, C6orf106 interacts with IRF3 and inhibits IRF3 recruitment to type I IFN promoter sequences while also reducing the nuclear levels of the coactivator proteins p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). In summary, we have defined C6orf106 as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity that blocks IRF3-dependent cytokine production via a noncanonical and poorly defined mechanism. This work presents intriguing implications for antiviral immunity, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.","Ambrose, Rebecca L; Liu, Yu Chih; Adams, Timothy E; Bean, Andrew G D; Stewart, Cameron R",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra117.001491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29802199/,520

63066,Robotic Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy for superior mesenteric artery syndrome: operative technique.,2011,"OBJECTIVES Orotracheal intubation is a key component of prehospital airway management and success rates are dependent on procedural experience. Supraglottic airway devices are increasingly being used in the prehospital setting. As a result, paramedics may have fewer opportunities for performing intubation, limiting their proficiency in the procedure. We aimed to determine the trends in intubation versus supraglottic airway use over an 8 year period. We also aimed to determine the association between system-wide introduction of King LT guidelines and ETI success rates. METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study of 37 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agencies in a 10 county region of Southwestern Pennsylvania. Cases between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012 were included if an advanced airway procedure was performed. We determined trends in advanced airway placement and compared the proportion of cases with first pass intubation success before and after the King LT was introduced and promoted by statewide protocol starting in 2007. Use of airway devices before and after King LT implementation were presented using descriptive statistics and compared using Pearson's Chi-square or Fishers Exact test as appropriate. We compared first pass success rate of orotracheal intubation between study periods using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for other factors that may impact success of orotracheal intubation (year, EMS agency, age category, traumatic injury, and cardiac arrest). RESULTS There were 712 cases of orotracheal intubation before and 2,835 cases after introduction of the King LT. The proportion of cases ultimately managed with orotracheal intubation before and after 2007 decreased from 72.3% (95% CI 68.9-75.6%) to 67.1% (95% CI 65.3-68.8%) (p = 0.007). In the multivariable analysis, success of orotracheal intubation was not associated with implementation of the King LT airway (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74-1.41). CONCLUSION Fewer patients with advanced airway management received orotracheal intubation since introduction of the King LT. In spite of this modest change in airway management, there has not been a change in orotracheal intubation success rate since introduction of this supraglottic device as a primary or rescue airway in this regional EMS setting.","Hilton, Michael T; Wayne, Max; Martin-Gill, Christian",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.3109/10903127.2016.1163446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27058646/,520

63200,Reasons and operative outcomes after reversal of gastric bypass and jejunoileal bypass.,2012,"BACKGROUND Late inspiratory rise in airway pressure (LIRAP, Paw/ΔT) caused by inspiratory muscle relaxation or expiratory muscle contraction is frequently seen during pressure support ventilation (PSV), although the modulating factors are unknown. METHODS We investigated the effects of respiratory mechanics (normal, obstructive, restrictive, or mixed), inspiratory effort (-2, -8, or -15 cm H2O), flow cycle criteria (5-40% peak inspiratory flow), and duration of inspiratory muscle relaxation (0.18-0.3 s) on LIRAP during PSV using a lung simulator and 4 types of ventilators. RESULTS LIRAP occurred with all lung models when inspiratory effort was medium to high and duration of inspiratory muscle relaxation was short. The normal lung model was associated with the fastest LIRAP, whereas the obstructive lung model was associated with the slowest. Unless lung mechanics were normal or mixed, LIRAP was unlikely to occur when inspiratory effort was low. Different ventilators were also associated with differences in LIRAP speed. Except for within the restrictive lung model, changes in flow cycle level did not abolish LIRAP if inspiratory effort was medium to high. Increased duration of inspiratory relaxation also led to the elimination of LIRAP. Simulation of expiratory muscle contraction revealed that LIRAP occurred only when expiratory muscle contraction occurred sometime after the beginning of inspiration. CONCLUSIONS Our simulation study reveals that both respiratory resistance and compliance may affect LIRAP. Except for under restrictive lung conditions, LIRAP is unlikely to be abolished by simply lowering flow cycle criteria when inspiratory effort is strong and relaxation time is rapid. LIRAP may be caused by expiratory muscle contraction when it occurs during inspiration.","Yu, Chun-Hsiang; Su, Po-Lan; Lin, Wei-Chieh; Lin, Sheng-Hsiang; Chen, Chang-Wen",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.03408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371401/,520

63891,A technique of gastrojejunostomy to reduce delayed gastric emptying after pancreatoduodenectomy.,2011,"Salmonellosis is a form of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella infection. The main transmission route of salmonellosis has been identified as poorly cooked meat and poultry products contaminated with Salmonella. However, in recent years, the number of outbreaks attributed to contaminated raw produce has increased dramatically. To understand how Salmonella adapts to produce, transcriptomic analysis was conducted on Salmonella enterica serovar Virchow exposed to fresh-cut radish greens. Considering the different Salmonella lifestyles in contact with fresh produce, such as motile and sessile lifestyles, total RNA was extracted from planktonic and epiphytic cells separately. Transcriptomic analysis of S. Virchow cells revealed different transcription profiles between lifestyles. During bacterial adaptation to fresh-cut radish greens, planktonic cells were likely to shift toward anaerobic metabolism, exploiting nitrate as an electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration, and utilizing cobalamin as a cofactor for coupled metabolic pathways. Meanwhile, Salmonella cells adhering to plant surfaces showed coordinated upregulation in genes associated with translation and ribosomal biogenesis, indicating dramatic cellular reprogramming in response to environmental changes. In accordance with the extensive translational response, epiphytic cells showed an increase in the transcription of genes that are important for bacterial motility, nucleotide transporter/metabolism, cell envelope biogenesis, and defense mechanisms. Intriguingly, Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2 displayed up- and downregulation, respectively, regardless of lifestyles in contact with the radish greens, suggesting altered Salmonella virulence during adaptation to plant environments. This study provides molecular insights into Salmonella adaptation to plants as an alternative environmental reservoir.","Park, Sojung; Nam, Eun Woo; Kim, Yeeun; Lee, Seohyeon; Kim, Seul I; Yoon, Hyunjin",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2007.07036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830190/,520

This review provides an overview of all aspects of PO screening that need to be considered when introducing this methodology. PO screening for CCHD is effective, simple, quick, reliable, cost-effective and does not lead to extra burden for parents and caregivers. Test accuracy can be influenced by targets definition, gestational age, timing of screening and antenatal detection of CCHD. Early screening can lead to more false positive screenings, but has the potential to detect significant pathology earlier. There is no apparent difference in accuracy between screening with post-ductal measurements only, compared with screening using pre-ductal and post-ductal measurements. However, adding pre-ductal measurements identifies cases of CCHD which would have been missed by post-ductal screening. Screening at higher altitudes leads to more false positives. Important non-cardiac pathology is found in 35-74% of false positives in large studies. Screening is feasible in neonatal intensive care units and out-of-hospital births. Training caregivers, simplifying the algorithm and using computer-based interpretation tools can improve the quality of the screening. Caregivers need to consider all aspects of screening to enable them to choose an optimal protocol for implementation of CCHD screening in their specific setting.","Narayen, Ilona C; Blom, Nico A; Ewer, Andrew K; Vento, Maximo; Manzoni, Paolo; te Pas, Arjan B",Archives of disease in childhood.

The most common approach for assessing risk is to use the Wells-Riley equation to relate infectious cases to human and environmental parameters. While it is a simple model that can yield valuable information, the model used as in its original presentation has a number of limitations. This paper reviews recent developments addressing some of the limitations including coupling with epidemic models to evaluate the wider impact of control measures on disease progression, linking with zonal ventilation or computational fluid dynamics simulations to deal with imperfect mixing in real environments and recent work on dose-response modelling to simulate the interaction between pathogens and the host. A stochastic version of the Wells-Riley model is presented that allows consideration of the effects of small populations relevant in healthcare settings and it is demonstrated how this can be linked to a simple zonal ventilation model to simulate the influence of proximity to an infector. The results show how neglecting the stochastic effects present in a real situation could underestimate the risk by 15 per cent or more and that the number and rate of new infections between connected spaces is strongly dependent on the airflow. Results also indicate the potential danger of using fully mixed models for future risk assessments, with quanta values derived from such cases less than half the actual source value.","Noakes, Catherine J; Sleigh, P Andrew","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2009.0305.focus; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812072/,520
64382,Combined robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and laparoscopic hemicolectomy.,2011,"Selective inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter belong to a new class of drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of their action is based on insulin-independent reduction of glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, which leads to stimulation of its excretion in the urine and, accordingly, to a decrease in the concentration of glucose in the blood plasma. Drugs of this group demonstrate effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but their use may be associated with an increased frequency of urinary tract infections. Pharmacological glucosuria, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of glucose in the blood, creates the preconditions for the occurrence of urinary tract infections. Urinary tract and genital infections are the most common adverse events associated with the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors. In the presented literature review for 20162019, the relationship between urinary tract infections in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and therapy with sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors was analyzed.","Sturov, N V; Popov, S V; Mamporia, N K; Mager, A A",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2020.11.000581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720614/,520
64383,One versus two-step Roux-en-Y gastric bypass after gastric banding—data analysis of the German Bariatric Surgery Registry.,2015,"This report describes a challenging obstetric case in which septic emboli from Streptococcus oralis endocarditis subsequently led to central nervous system infection. There were delays in diagnosis as the patient presented with non-specific symptoms of fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, initially suspected to be due to viral gastroenteritis and later SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibiotics were commenced once gram positive cocci were isolated from a blood culture. The patient made no significant improvement despite antimicrobial therapy and subsequently developed a worsening headache and delirium. This deterioration was not rapidly recognised despite the use of a routine obstetric early warning score. However, a diagnosis of meningitis was made once the potential severity of the patient's condition was recognised and Streptococcus oralis was identified in cerebrospinal fluid and blood cultures. Bacterial endocarditis was diagnosed following transthoracic echocardiography. The patient improved with optimised antimicrobial therapy and delivered a healthy baby. This example highlights how non-specific symptoms can be caused by rare and life-threatening illnesses, and emphasises that early warning scores might not easily identify neurological deterioration in obstetric patients.","Wydall, S; Durrant, F; Scott, J; Cheesman, K",Anaesthesia reports,https://doi.org/10.1002/anr3.12133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651130/,520
64392,Defining the learning curve in laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair: a CUSUM analysis.,2011,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Due to its high spatial resolution, intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been used as a valid method for in vivo evaluation of several types of coronary stents at straight lumen and bifurcation sites. We sought to evaluate its effectiveness for flow diverting stents deployed in arterial bifurcation sites involving jailing of a side branch. METHODS Four large white swine were stented with flow diverting stents covering the right common carotid artery-ascending pharyngeal artery bifurcation. After 12 weeks of follow-up the animals were evaluated by digital subtraction angiography and intravascular OCT and subsequently sacrificed. Neointimal thickness on the parent arteries and the free segments of the stent were measured. The stented arteries were harvested and underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Ostia surface values were measured with OCT three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions and SEM images. RESULTS All endovascular procedures and OCT pullback runs were feasible. Stent apposition was satisfactory on the immediate post-stent OCT reconstructions. At 12-week controls, all stents and jailed branches were patent. Mean neointimal thickness was 0.11±0.04 mm on the free segments of the stent. The mean ostia surface at 12 weeks was 319 750±345 533 μm2 with 3D-OCT reconstructions and 351 198±396 355 μm2 with SEM image-derived calculations. Good correlation was found for ostia surface values between the two techniques; the values did not differ significantly in this preliminary study. CONCLUSIONS Intravascular OCT appears to be a promising technique for immediate and follow-up assessment of the orifice of arterial branches covered by flow diverting stents.","Iosif, Christina; Saleme, Suzana; Ponsonnard, Sebastien; Carles, Pierre; Silveira, Eduardo Pedrolo; Waihrich, Eduardo; Trolliard, Gilles; Yardin, Catherine; Mounayer, Charbel",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26819448/,520
64744,"Short-term changes and correlations of plasma spexin, kisspeptin, and galanin levels after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.",2021-02-08,"BACKGROUND Modern medical education requires frequent competency assessment. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) provides a descriptive framework of competencies and milestones but does not provide standardized instruments to assess and track trainee competency over time. Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) represent a workplace-based method to assess the achievement of competency milestones at the point-of-care that can be applied to anesthesiology training in the United States. METHODS Experts in education and competency assessment were recruited to participate in a 6-step process using a modified Delphi method with iterative rounds to reach consensus on an entrustment scale, a list of EPAs and procedural skills, detailed definitions for each EPA, a mapping of the EPAs to the ACGME milestones, and a target level of entrustment for graduating US anesthesiology residents for each EPA and procedural skill. The defined EPAs and procedural skills were implemented using a website and mobile app. The assessment system was piloted at 7 anesthesiology residency programs. After 2 months, faculty were surveyed on their attitudes on usability and utility of the assessment system. The number of evaluations submitted per month was collected for 1 year. RESULTS Participants in EPA development included 18 education experts from 11 different programs. The Delphi rounds produced a final list of 20 EPAs, each differentiated as simple or complex, a defined entrustment scale, mapping of the EPAs to milestones, and graduation entrustment targets. A list of 159 procedural skills was similarly developed. Results of the faculty survey demonstrated favorable ratings on all questions regarding app usability as well as the utility of the app and EPA assessments. Over the 2-month pilot period, 1636 EPA and 1427 procedure assessments were submitted. All programs continued to use the app for the remainder of the academic year resulting in 12,641 submitted assessments. CONCLUSIONS A list of 20 anesthesiology EPAs and 159 procedural skills assessments were developed using a rigorous methodology to reach consensus among education experts. The assessments were pilot tested at 7 US anesthesiology residency programs demonstrating the feasibility of implementation using a mobile app and the ability to collect assessment data. Adoption at the pilot sites was variable; however, the use of the system was not mandatory for faculty or trainees at any site.","Woodworth, Glenn E; Marty, Adrian P; Tanaka, Pedro P; Ambardekar, Aditee P; Chen, Fei; Duncan, Michael J; Fromer, Ilana R; Hallman, Matthew R; Klesius, Lisa L; Ladlie, Beth L; Mitchell, Sally Ann; Miller Juve, Amy K; McGrath, Brian J; Shepler, John A; Sims, Charles; Spofford, Christina M; Van Cleve, Wil; Maniker, Robert B",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661789/,520

The role of such factors has been widely studied on English-speaking individuals with chronic pain. It is possible that the associations between such factors and adjustment may be influenced by culture. This study sought to evaluate the importance of coping responses, self-efficacy beliefs, and social support to adjust to chronic pain in a sample of Portuguese patients, and discuss the findings with respect to their similarities and differences from findings of studies on English-speaking individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS Measures of pain intensity and interference, physical and psychological functioning, coping responses, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with social support were administered to a sample of 324 Portuguese patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Univariate and multivariate analyses were computed. Findings were interpreted with respect to those from similar studies using English-speaking individuals. RESULTS Coping responses and perceived social support were significantly associated with pain interference and both physical and psychological functioning; self-efficacy beliefs were significantly associated with all criterion variables. All coping responses, except for task persistence, were positively associated with pain interference and negatively associated with physical and psychological functioning, with the strongest associations found for catastrophizing, praying/hoping, guarding, resting, asking for assistance, and relaxation. DISCUSSION The findings provide support for the importance of the psychosocial factors studied in terms of adjustment to chronic pain in Portuguese patients, and also suggest the possibility of some differences in the role of these factors due to culture.","Ferreira-Valente, Maria A; Pais-Ribeiro, José L; Jensen, Mark P",The Clinical journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0000000000000027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24042349/,520
64930,Comparison of laparoscopic skills performance between single-site access (SSA) devices and an independent-port SSA approach.,2012,"BACKGROUND A large amount of pesticides that are not deposited on desired locations due to drift and rolling, endangering the ecological environment and human health. Therefore, it is urgent to develop environmentally friendly and foliar affinity formulations. The design and construction of pesticide nano-delivery system is considered to be an effective way to solve this problem. RESULTS In this research, polyamine-modified zein (AM-zein) were synthesized by incorporating ethylenediamine-terminated polyethyleneimine into zein to improve its stability as a nanocarrier, enhance electrostatic force between the carrier and pesticides and plant foliage. Avermectin-loaded nanoparticles, containing a high positive charge, was prepared by the anti-solvent method using AM-Zein as carrier. The nanoparticles can be stably stored for 30 days without any significant change in the particle size and stably dispersed at pH 5 - 9. Compared to the commercial emulsifiable concentrate (EC), nanoparticles dispersions exhibited better leaf affinity, and the retention of dispersion increased from 7.82 mg/cm2 to 13.86 mg/cm2 . Interestingly, we have discovered for the first time that the UV barrier effect of zein increases while prolonging the UV exposure time; 30.47% of the encapsulated AVM remained intact after exposure to UV for 60 min, compared to only 17.13% for the EC. Insecticidal activity of avermectin nanoparticles did not improve compared to EC, but they demonstrated significantly lower toxicity against zebrafish. CONCLUSION This research opens up a new idea for improving the stability of zein nanoparticles, providing a novel path to deliver pesticides efficiently and eco-friendly.","Chen, Long; Lin, Yuanxiong; Zhou, Hongjun; Hao, Li; Chen, Huayao; Zhou, Xinhua",Pest management science,https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.6374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763979/,520

The UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals target suppression of HIV viral load in 73% of all HIV-infected people worldwide by 2030. However, achieving these targets may not lead to expected reductions in HIV incidence if the remaining 27% (persons with unsuppressed viral load) are the drivers of HIV transmission through high-risk behaviors. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the demographics, mobility, geographic distribution, and risk profile of adults who are not virologically suppressed in sub-Saharan Africa in the era of UTT. METHODS We will review the published and grey literature for study sources that contain data on demographic and behavioral strata of virologically suppressed and unsuppressed populations since 2014. We will search PubMed and Embase using four sets of search terms tailored to identify characteristics associated with virological suppression (or lack thereof) and each of the individual 90-90-90 goals. Record screening and data abstraction will be done independently and in duplicate. We will use random effects meta-regression analyses to estimate the distribution of demographic and risk features among groups not virologically suppressed and for each individual 90-90-90 goal. DISCUSSION The results of our review will help elucidate factors associated with failure to achieve virological suppression in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as factors associated with failure to achieve each of the 90-90-90 goals. These data will help quantify the population-level effects of current HIV treatment interventions to improve strategies for maximizing virological suppression and ending the HIV epidemic.

64987,Single-incision versus conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,2015,"Bone metastases are a class of cancerous metastases that result from the invasion of a tumor into bone. The solid mass which forms inside the bone is often associated with a constant dull ache and severe spikes in pain, which greatly reduce the quality of life of the patient. Numerous (99m)Tc-labeled bisphosphonate functionalised complexes are well established tracers for bone metastases imaging. The objective of this research was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and behaviour of three DOTA based bisphosphonate functionalised ligands (BPAMD, BPAPD and BPPED), using both (68)Ga μ-PET in vivo imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in healthy Wistar rats. The compounds were labelled with (68)Ga in high yields using an ammonium acetate buffer, and subsequently purified using a cation exchange resin. High bone uptake values were observed for all (68)Ga-labelled bisphosphonates at 60 minutes p.i. The highest uptake was observed for [(68)Ga]BPPED (2.6 ± 0.3% ID/g) which compares favourably with that of [(99m)Tc]MDP (2.7 ± 0.1 ID/g) and [(18)F]fluoride (2.4 ± 0.2% ID/g). The (68)Ga-labelled DOTA-bisphosphonates showed rapid clearance from the blood and renal system, as well as low binding to soft tissue, resulting in a high bone to blood ratio (9.9 at 60 minutes p.i. for [(68)Ga]BPPED, for example). Although further studies are required to assess their performance in tumor models, the results obtained suggest that these ligands could be useful both in imaging ((68)Ga) and therapeutic treatment ((177)Lu) of bone metastases.","Meckel, Marian; Fellner, Marco; Thieme, Natalie; Bergmann, Ralf; Kubicek, Vojteck; Rösch, Frank",Nuclear medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2013.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915801/,520

However, excitement surrounding gene therapy, particularly Ad-based therapy, was diminished upon the death of Jesse Gelsinger, and recent discouraging results from the HIV vaccine STEP trial have brought efficacy and safety issues to the forefront again. Even so, Ad vectors are still considered among the safest and most effective vaccine vectors. Innate and pre-existing immunity to Ad mediate much of the acute toxicities and reduced therapeutic efficacies observed following vaccination with this vector.

65304,Single incision laparoscopic (SILS) restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.,2011,"It is a sad fact that despite being almost completely preventable through human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and screening, cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer to affect women worldwide. Persistent high-risk HPV infection (hrHPV) is the primary etiological factor for cervical cancer. Upwards of 70% of cases are driven by HPV types 16 and 18, with a dozen other hrHPV associated with the remainder of cases. Current standard-of-care treatments include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or surgical resection. However, they have significant side effects and limited efficacy against advanced disease. There are few treatment options for recurrent or metastatic cases. Immunotherapy offers new hope, as demonstrated by the recent approval of PD1 blocking antibody for recurrent or metastatic disease. This might be augmented by combination with antigen-specific immunotherapy approaches, such as vaccines or adoptive cell transfer, to enhance the host cellular immune response targeting HPV-positive cancer cells. As cervical cancer progresses, it can foster an immunosuppressive microenvironment and counteract host anticancer immunity. Thus, approaches to reverse suppressive immune environments and bolster effector T cell functioning are likely to enhance the success of such cervical cancer immunotherapy. The success of non-specific immunostimulants like imiquimod against genital warts also suggest the possibility of utilizing these immunotherapeutic strategies in cervical cancer prevention to treat precursor lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) and persistent hrHPV infections against which the licensed prophylactic HPV vaccines have no efficacy. Here we review the progress and challenges in the development of immunotherapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.","Ferrall, Louise; Lin, Ken Y; Roden, Richard B S; Hung, Chien-Fu; Wu, T-C",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-2833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888488/,520

To determine the best action, we matched exposure information from COVID-19 case investigations with reported test results and calculated the secondary attack rates (SARs) after masked and unmasked exposures. Mask use by both parties reduced the SAR by half, from 25.6% to 12.5%. Longer exposure duration significantly increased SARs. Masks significantly reduced virus transmission when worn by both the case-patient and the contact, but SARs for each group were higher than anticipated.

This study discusses the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients from the Balochistan province. STUDY DESIGN Situation report Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in Balochistan province of Pakistan. The completion date for the study was April 30, 2020. METHODOLOGY The data was retrieved from the daily situation report from the Health Department, Government of Balochistan. Descriptive statistics (proportions, mean ± SD) were used for data analysis. RESULTS A total of 1136 patients were confirmed to have COVID-19. The highest rate was found in cases with ages >60 years. About 78% of COVID-19 cases were males and majority of the cases (78.56%)were asymptomatic. Out of these, 183 recovered and 16 died. The case fatality rate was 1.3%. CONCLUSION COVID-19 cases and case fatality ratio is low in Balochistan. Whether this is due to inability to carry out more tests is still to be ascertained. Males and elderly are more affected and fatalities were higher in cases with co-morbid conditions. Balochistan having a weak healthcare system and with the majority of cases being asymptomatic, needs more stringent actions to practice social distancing to avoid further spread of COVID-19.","Badini, Abida Munir; Badini, Aurangzeb; Mengal, Naeem M; Nanji, Kashmira",Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,https://doi.org/10.29271/jcpsp.2021.07.104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34271805/,520

Here we report strong Kerr-like nonlinearities by employing efficient optical transitions of charged excitons (trions) observed in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). By hybridising trions in monolayer MoSe2 at low electron densities with a microcavity mode, we realise trion-polaritons exhibiting significant energy shifts at small photon fluxes due to phase space filling. We find the ratio of trion- to neutral exciton-polariton interaction strength is in the range from 10 to 100 in TMDC materials and that trion-polariton nonlinearity is comparable to that in other polariton systems. The results are in good agreement with a theory accounting for the composite nature of excitons and trions and deviation of their statistics from that of ideal bosons and fermions.

In the psychiatric realm, tinnitus has long been associated with depression. To better characterize the co-occurrence of depression and tinnitus, we performed a systematic review of the prevalence of depression among patients with tinnitus. DATA SOURCES We comprehensively examined original studies reporting the prevalence of depression in adult populations with tinnitus, as indexed in the PubMed and Web of Science databases and published from January 2006 to August 2016. REVIEW METHODS All identified articles were reviewed independently by 2 researchers, with a third reviewer for adjudication. Included studies were evaluated for threats to validity across 3 domains-representativeness, response rate, and ascertainment of outcome-on a 4-point modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies were included, representing 15 countries and 9979 patients with tinnitus. Among the included studies, the median prevalence of depression was 33%, with an interquartile range of 19% to 49% and an overall range of 6% to 84%. Studies were high quality overall, with a mean score of 3.3 (SD = 0.76), and 89% utilized a validated tool to ascertain depression. CONCLUSIONS We conducted one of the largest contemporary comprehensive reviews, which suggests a 33% prevalence of depression among patients with tinnitus. Our review reaffirms that a substantial proportion of patients with tinnitus have depression, and we recommend that all who treat tinnitus should screen and treat their patients for depression, if present.","Salazar, James W; Meisel, Karl; Smith, Eric R; Quiggle, Aaron; McCoy, David B; Amans, Matthew R",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599819835178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909841/,520

A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observations A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.","Givi, Babak; Schiff, Bradley A; Chinn, Steven B; Clayburgh, Daniel; Iyer, N Gopalakrishna; Jalisi, Scharukh; Moore, Michael G; Nathan, Cherie-Ann; Orloff, Lisa A; O'Neill, James P; Parker, Noah; Zender, Chad; Morris, Luc G T; Davies, Louise",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232423/,520
66653,Does transumbilical single incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding result in decreased pain medicine use? A case-matched study.,2011,"Spiophanes bombyx (Claparède, 1870) from the Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy, was the first described Spiophanes with fronto-lateral horns on the prostomium. It was also considered the only horned species occurring in European waters. Our sequence data of five gene fragments suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in northern Europe: S. cf. bombyx in the North and the Norwegian seas, and S. cf. convexus in Brittany, northern France, and Bay of Biscay, northern Spain. Spiophanes cf. bombyx worms are genetically close to a single examined specimen of S. bombyx from Venice Lagoon, Italy but their conspecificity should be verified by further study. Our sequence data show that horned Spiophanes from the North Pacific are genetically distant from horned European species, and that S. uschakowi Zachs, 1933, originally described from the Sea of Japan (East Sea) is a valid species. The data also suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in the North East Pacific: S. hakaiensis Radashevsky & Pankova, n. sp. distributed from Alaska south to about Point Conception, and S. norrisi Meißner & Blank, 2009, distributed from San Francisco Bay south to Baja California Sur, Mexico. Spiophanes from South America, morphologically similar to S. norrisi, are suggested to belong to a new species. Molecular data also suggest the presence of two sibling species among the worms from northern Europe identified by morphology as S. kroyeri Grube, 1860. Worms from the Barents Sea and northern part of the North Sea are tentatively referred to as S. cf. kroyeri; worms from the northern and central parts of the North Sea and from the Bay of Biscay, northern Spain, are tentatively referred to as S. cf. cirrata M. Sars in G.O. Sars, 1872. Sequence data also show that S. duplex from California is genetically different from morphologically similar worms from South America. The South American worms are referred to resurrected S. soederstroemi Hartman, 1953 which was originally described from off Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and then considered as a junior synonym of S. duplex. Analysis of divergence times of Spiophanes lineages suggested that the origin of the most recent common ancestor of horned Spiophanes with metameric nuchal organs was around 11.1 mya (95% HPD: 5.1-19.0 mya) and that the divergence of the North Atlantic and North Pacific lineages was around 7.9 mya (95% HPD: 4.1-13.3 mya). The North Atlantic lineage was estimated to have diverged 4.8 mya (95% HPD: 2.2-8.6 mya), resulting in the origin of S. cf. bombyx and S. cf. convexus. The North Pacific lineage was estimated to have diverged first by the isolation and speciation of S. norrisi 1.7 mya (95% HPD: 2.3-1.0 mya), and then by the isolation and speciation of S. uschakowi and S. hakaiensis n. sp. 1.3 mya (95% HPD: 2.0-0.7 mya). The estimates place the divergences soon after maximum glacial period in the North Pacific (2.4-3.0 mya).","Radashevsky, Vasily I; Pankova, Victoria V; Malyar, Vasily V; Neretina, Tatyana V; Choi, Jin-Woo; Yum, Seungshic; Houbin, Céline",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609771/,520
66672,Does helicobacter pylori infection have influence on outcome of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity?,2014,"PURPOSE Previous studies have found that most cerebral oximeters are subject to inaccuracies secondary to extracranial contamination of the cerebral oximetric signals. We hypothesized that the more advanced second-generation FORE-SIGHT ELITE cerebral oximeter would be significantly less affected by extracranial tissue hypoxemia than the more widely used first-generation INVOS™ 5100C monitor. METHODS Twenty healthy volunteers aged 18-45 yr had the INVOS and FORE-SIGHT probes placed on their forehead in a random sequence while in the supine position. A pneumatic head cuff was then placed around each volunteer's head just below both the oximeter and a concomitantly placed scalp forehead pulse oximeter probe. The subjects' scalp cerebral oxygen saturation (SctO2) values were measured and compared using the two different devices in sequence, both before and after scalp tissue ischemia was induced by the pneumatic cuff. RESULTS Extracranial ischemia resulted in a significant reduction in SctO2 values from baseline in both devices. The INVOS 5100C recorded a median [interquartile range] decrease in SctO2 from baseline at five minutes of 15.1% [12.6 - 17.6], while that recorded by the FORESIGHT ELITE device was 8.6% [4.0 -12.3] at five minutes (median difference, 7.9%; 99% confidence interval, 1.9 to 16.5; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION Updated technological algorithms employed in the FORE-SIGHT ELITE cerebral oximeter may be responsible for less extracranial contamination than was observed in the previous-generation INVOS 5100C device. The impact that this extracranial contamination may have on the clinical use of these devices remains to be determined.","Greenberg, Steven; Murphy, Glenn; Shear, Torin; Patel, Aashka; Simpson, Andrew; Szokol, Joseph; Avram, Michael J; Vender, Jeffery",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-015-0451-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26307186/,520

We aimed to investigate the mental health status of Chinese children and adolescents, and provided some considerations of the contributing factors and the coping strategy. Method We investigated the disease composition ratio of sigh syndrome in the pediatric outpatient clinic in Chengdu after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and outbreak mitigation. We also analyzed and compared the annual changing trends in the incidence of sigh syndrome in 2020 with those from previous years. Results The composition ratio of sigh syndrome increased significantly after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The highest incidence was in March 2020, which then decreased gradually over the next few months, then increased again in June 2020 (P<0.05). And the 4-7 years old was the age group with a high incidence of sigh syndrome, and 5 years old had the highest incidence. Conclusions The mental health status of children and adolescents changed significantly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We should also pay attention to the psychological problems caused by returning to school after the epidemic has eased.","Huang, Yijie; Zhang, Huiyun; Fan, Yinghong; Ji, Maosheng; Wang, Li; Ai, Tao",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-21-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708528/,520

We aimed to assess the effects of biologics reduction compared with dose maintenance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in low disease activity or remission. We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis according to a previously registered protocol (PROSPERO registration: CRD42017069080); and searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library and trial registers up to July, 2020. Two researchers selected, extracted and assessed the risk of bias of controlled trials that randomized patients to reduction/spacing or dose maintenance of biologics. Low disease activity, disability and other clinically important outcomes were summarized in random effect meta-analyses. We rated the certainty of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We included ten studies (n = 1331 patients), which assessed reduction or spacing of abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, or tocilizumab. Risk of bias was high in over half of trials, mainly due to lack of blinding. No statistically significant difference was found in low disease activity (RR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.78-1.04; I2 = 60%, very low certainty), and other outcomes. Subgroup analysis of blinded studies led to homogeneous results, which remained heterogeneous in open-label studies. Reduction or spacing biologics did not affect disease activity and other important outcome. Changes in the doses regimen should consider patient preferences, considering the low certainty of evidence.","Vasconcelos, Letícia B; Silva, Marcus T; Galvao, Tais F",Rheumatology international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04651-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710197/,520

67031,Critical concepts and important anatomic landmarks encountered during transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME): toward the mastery of a new operation for rectal cancer surgery.,2016,"INTRODUCTION New Zealand's Smokefree 2025 goal aims to greatly decrease the availability of tobacco. One option is to cease the sale of tobacco from convenience stores. However, tobacco companies and retail trade associations oppose this move and have argued that customers who purchase tobacco drive footfall and spend more than non-tobacco customers. The aim of this study is to test the validity of industry claims about the importance of tobacco to convenience stores. METHODS During November and December 2019, immediate postpurchase surveys were undertaken with customers on exit from a random sample of 100 convenience stores in two New Zealand cities. We estimated the mean number of items purchased, including tobacco and non-tobacco items, and mean expenditure on non-tobacco items. RESULTS Of the 3399 transactions recorded, 13.8% included tobacco, of which 8.3% comprised tobacco only and 5.5% included tobacco and non-tobacco items. The mean number of transactions containing both tobacco and non-tobacco items was 1.98, and 1.87 for those containing non-tobacco items only. Customers who purchased tobacco and non-tobacco items spent on average NZ$6.99 on non-tobacco items, whereas customers who purchased non-tobacco items only, spent on average NZ$5.07. CONCLUSIONS Our results do not support claims that tobacco drives one-quarter of footfall into stores or that customers who purchase tobacco spend almost twice as much as non-tobacco customers. Combined purchases of tobacco and non-tobacco items constituted 5.5% of transactions; the impact on a store's profitability of removing tobacco sales is unknown and could be the focus of future research.","Marsh, Louise; Cameron, Claire; Quigg, Robin; Wood, Sarah; Blank, Mei-Ling; Venter, Noeleen; Thomas, Lathan; Robertson, Lindsay; Hoek, Janet; Sullivan, Trudy",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273053/,520

This study sought to determine whether en bloc hilar dissections were associated with fewer biliary complications in living-donor liver transplants. METHODS This was a retrospective review of 41 adult LDLTs performed in a single, liver transplant center between February 2007 and September 2014. The primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of at least one of the following biliary complications: anastomotic leak, stricture, or biloma. The primary predictor of interest was the hilar dissection technique: conventional hilar dissection vs. en bloc hilar dissection. RESULTS A total of 41 LDLTs were identified, 24 had a conventional, and 17 an en bloc hilar biliary dissection. The occurrence of any biliary complication was significantly more common in the conventional hilar dissection group compared to the en bloc hilar dissection group (66.7 vs. 35.3%, respectively, p = 0.047). In particularly, anastomotic strictures were significantly more common in the conventional hilar dissection group compared to the en bloc hilar dissection group (54.2 vs. 23.5%., respectively, p = 0.049).

67716,The safety of laparoscopic hand-sutured gastrojejunostomy in gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity.,2013,"BACKGROUND Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy is an emerging technique for the surgical resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Besides its wide debates on safety and efficacy throughout the world, there were few report on uniportal VATS from the Eastern countries. In this article, we summarized our primary experience on uniportal VATS lobectomy in an Eastern center. METHODS From October 2013 till February 2014, 54 consecutive uniportal VATS lobectomy were performed in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University. Patients' clinical features and operative details were recorded. Post-operatively, the morbidity and mortality were recorded to analyze the safety and efficacy of uniportal VATS lobectomy for NSCLCs. RESULTS Among the 54 planned uniportal VATS lobectomy, there was one conversion to mini-thoracotomy due to lymph node sticking. Extra ports were required in two patients. The uniportal VATS lobectomy was achieved in 51 out of 54 patients (94.4%). The average operation duration was 122.2±37.5 min (90-160 min). The average volume of estimated blood loss during the operation was 88.8±47.1 mL (50-200 mL). The mean chest tube duration and hospital stay were 3.2±1.9 days and 4.6±2.0 days, respectively. There was no postoperative mortality in this study. Two patients suffered from prolonged air leakage (5 and 7 days), and one atrial fibrillation was observed in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS Based on our primary experience, uniportal VATS lobectomy is a safe and effective procedure for the surgical resection of NSCLCs. The surgical refinements and instrumental improvements would facilitate the technique. Further studies based on larger population are required to determine its benefits towards patients with NSCLCs.","Feng, Mingxiang; Shen, Yaxing; Wang, Hao; Tan, Lijie; Mao, Xuping; Liu, Yi; Wang, Qun",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.11.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589969/,520

Our objective was to describe the structure, organization, and delivery in Asian ICUs. DESIGN A web-based survey with the following domains: hospital organizational characteristics, ICU organizational characteristics, staffing, procedures and therapies available in the ICU and written protocols and policies. SETTING ICUs from 20 Asian countries from April 2013 to January 2014. Countries were divided into low-, middle-, and high-income based on the 2011 World Bank Classification. SUBJECTS ICU directors or representatives. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 672 representatives, 335 (50%) responded. The average number of hospital beds was 973 (SE of the mean [SEM], 271) with 9% (SEM, 3%) being ICU beds. In the index ICUs, the average number of beds was 21 (SEM, 3), of single rooms 8 (SEM, 2), of negative-pressure rooms 3 (SEM, 1), and of board-certified intensivists 7 (SEM, 3). Most ICUs (65%) functioned as closed units. The nurse-to-patient ratio was 1:1 or 1:2 in most ICUs (84%). On multivariable analysis, single rooms were less likely in low-income countries (p = 0.01) and nonreferral hospitals (p = 0.01); negative-pressure rooms were less likely in private hospitals (p = 0.03) and low-income countries (p = 0.005); 1:1 nurse-to-patient ratio was lower in private hospitals (p = 0.005); board-certified intensivists were less common in low-income countries (p < 0.0001) and closed ICUs were less likely in private (p = 0.02) and smaller hospitals (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This survey highlights considerable variation in critical care structure, organization, and delivery in Asia, which was related to hospital funding source and size, and country income. The lack of single and negative-pressure rooms in many Asian ICUs should be addressed before any future pandemic of severe respiratory illness.","Arabi, Yaseen M; Phua, Jason; Koh, Younsuck; Du, Bin; Faruq, Mohammad Omar; Nishimura, Masaji; Fang, Wen-Feng; Gomersall, Charles; Al Rahma, Hussain N; Tamim, Hani; Al-Dorzi, Hasan M; Al-Hameed, Fahad M; Adhikari, Neill K J; Sadat, Musharaf",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347762/,520

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March 2020. AREA COVERED In the review, a comprehensive analysis of the recent developments of the COVID-19 pandemic has been provided, including the structural characterization of the virus, the current worldwide status of the disease, various detection strategies, drugs recommended for the effective treatment, and progress of vaccine development programs by different countries. This report was constructed by following a systematic literature search of bibliographic databases of published reports of relevance until 1st September 2020. EXPERT OPINION Currently, the countries are opening businesses despite a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases. The pharmaceutical industries are developing clinical diagnostic kits, medicines, and vaccines. They target different approaches, including repurposing the already approved diagnosis and treatment options for similar CoVs. At present, over ~200 vaccine candidates are being developed against COVID-19. Future research may unravel the genetic variations or polymorphisms that dictate these differences in susceptibilities to the disease.","Bhagat, Stuti; Yadav, Nisha; Shah, Juhi; Dave, Harsh; Swaraj, Shachee; Tripathi, Shashank; Singh, Sanjay",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1835469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043740/,520

68455,The learning curve of laparoendoscopic single-site adrenalectomy: an analysis of over 100 cases.,2017,"Rotaviruses (RVs) are among the leading causes of enteritis and diarrhea in a number of mammalian and avian species, and impose colossal loss to livestock and poultry industry globally. Subsequent to detection of rotavirus in mammalian hosts in 1973, avian rotavirus (AvRV) was first reported in turkey poults in USA during 1977 and since then RVs of group A (RVA), D (RVD), F (RVF) and G (RVG) have been identified around the globe. Besides RVA, other AvRV groups (RVD, RVF and RVG) may also contribute to disease. However, their significance has yet to be unraveled. Under field conditions, co-infection of AvRVs occurs with other infectious agents such as astroviruses, enteroviruses, reoviruses, paramyxovirus, adenovirus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, cryptosporidium and Eimeria species prospering severity of disease outcome. Birds surviving to RV disease predominantly succumb to secondary bacterial infections, mostly E. coli and Salmonella spp. Recent developments in molecular tools including state-of-the-art diagnostics and vaccine development have led to advances in our understanding towards AvRVs. Development of new generation vaccines using immunogenic antigens of AvRV has to be explored and given due importance. Till now, no effective vaccines are available. Although specific as well as sensitive approaches are available to identify and characterize AvRVs, there is still need to have point-of-care detection assays to review disease burden, contemplate new directions for adopting vaccination and follow improvements in public health measures. This review discusses AvRVs, their epidemiology, pathology and pathogenesis, immunity, recent trends in diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics as well as appropriate prevention and control strategies.","Dhama, Kuldeep; Saminathan, Mani; Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Tiwari, Ruchi; Shabbir, Muhammad Zubair; Kumar, Naveen; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Singh, Raj Kumar",The Veterinary quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1080/01652176.2015.1046014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25917772/,520
69068,Laparoscopic revision of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and management of postoperative complications.,2010,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays important roles in antiviral host defense. Although SP-D shows a preference for glucose/maltose, the protein also recognizes d-mannose and a variety of mannose-rich microbial ligands. This latter preference prompted an examination of the mechanisms of mannose recognition, particularly as they relate to high-mannose viral glycans. Trimeric neck plus carbohydrate recognition domains from human SP-D (hNCRD) preferred alpha1-2-linked dimannose (DM) over the branched trimannose (TM) core, alpha1-3 or alpha1-6 DM, or D-mannose. Previous studies have shown residues flanking the carbohydrate binding site can fine-tune ligand recognition. A mutant with valine at 343 (R343V) showed enhanced binding to mannan relative to wild type and R343A. No alteration in affinity was observed for D-mannose or for alpha1-3- or alpha1-6-linked DM; however, substantially increased affinity was observed for alpha1-2 DM. Both proteins showed efficient recognition of linear and branched subdomains of high-mannose glycans on carbohydrate microarrays, and R343V showed increased binding to a subset of the oligosaccharides. Crystallographic analysis of an R343V complex with 1,2-DM showed a novel mode of binding. The disaccharide is bound to calcium by the reducing sugar ring, and a stabilizing H-bond is formed between the 2-OH of the nonreducing sugar ring and Arg349. Although hNCRDs show negligible binding to influenza A virus (IAV), R343V showed markedly enhanced viral neutralizing activity. Hydrophobic substitutions for Arg343 selectively blocked binding of a monoclonal antibody (Hyb 246-05) that inhibits IAV binding activity. Our findings demonstrate an extended ligand binding site for mannosylated ligands and the significant contribution of the 343 side chain to specific recognition of multivalent microbial ligands, including high-mannose viral glycans.","Crouch, Erika; Hartshorn, Kevan; Horlacher, Tim; McDonald, Barbara; Smith, Kelly; Cafarella, Tanya; Seaton, Barbara; Seeberger, Peter H; Head, James",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi8022703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19249874/,520
69188,Distal Pancreatectomy Combined with Multivisceral Resection Is Associated with Postoperative Complication Rates and Survival Comparable to Those After Standard Procedures.,2018,"A series of ethyl 2-(2-(arylidene)hydrazinyl)thiazole-4-carboxylates (2a-r) was synthesized in two steps from thiosemicarbazones (1a-r), which were cyclized with ethyl bromopyruvate to ethyl 2-(2-(arylidene)hydrazinyl)thiazole-4-carboxylates (2a-r). The structures of compounds (2a-r) were established by FT-IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR. The structure of compound 2a was confirmed by HRMS. The compounds (2a-r) were then evaluated for their antimicrobial and antioxidant assays. The antioxidant studies revealed, ethyl 2-(2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)hydrazinyl)thiazole-4-carboxylate (2g) and ethyl 2-(2-(1-phenylethylidene)hydrazinyl)thiazole-4-carboxylate (2h) as promising antioxidant agents with %FRSA: 84.46 ± 0.13 and 74.50 ± 0.37, TAC: 269.08 ± 0.92 and 269.11 ± 0.61 and TRP: 272.34 ± 0.87 and 231.11 ± 0.67 μg AAE/mg dry weight of compound. Beside bioactivities, density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to study the electronic structure and properties of synthesized compounds (2a-m). The potential of synthesized compounds for possible antiviral targets is also predicted through molecular docking methods. The compounds 2e and 2h showed good binding affinities and inhibition constants to be considered as therapeutic target for Mpro protein of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The present in-depth analysis of synthesized compounds will put them under the spot light for practical applications as antioxidants and the modification in structural motif may open the way for COVID-19 drug.","Haroon, Muhammad; Akhtar, Tashfeen; Khalid, Muhammad; Ali, Shehbaz; Zahra, Saniya; Ul Haq, Ihsan; Alhujaily, Muhanad; C H de B Dias, Mabilly; Cristina Lima Leite, Ana; Muhammad, Shabbir","Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

69401,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy: how I do it.,2011,"STUDY OBJECTIVES The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has become a global health and economic crisis. Recent evidence from small samples suggest that it has increased mood and sleep disturbances, including insomnia, around the world. This study aimed to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on insomnia levels worldwide and in the United States during the acute phase of the pandemic. METHODS We analyzed search query data recorded between January 2004 and May 2020 from Google Trend and Google Keyword Planner for the search term insomnia. RESULTS The number of search queries for insomnia has increased over the past decade and is greater than the number of search queries for other major sleep disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic increased search queries for insomnia both worldwide and in the United States, with the number in the United States increasing by 58% during the first five months of 2020 compared to same months from the previous three years. There is a robust diurnal pattern in insomnia search queries in the United States, with the number of queries peaking around 3 AM and the overall pattern remaining stable during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS These results highlight the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on sleep health, and the urgent need for making effective interventions accessible. Future studies will be needed to determine whether the increase in insomnia symptoms will persist and lead to higher rates of chronic insomnia in the population.","Zitting, Kirsi-Marja; Lammers-van der Holst, Heidi M; Yuan, Robin K; Wang, Wei; Quan, Stuart F; Duffy, Jeanne F",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975191/,520
69573,The impact of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on plasma ghrelin levels: a systematic review.,2013,"BACKGROUND Extremely premature neonates suffer high morbidity and mortality. An artificial placenta (AP) using extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a promising therapy. OBJECTIVES We hypothesized that intratracheal perfluorocarbon (PFC) instillation during AP support would reduce lung injury and promote lung development relative to intratracheal amniotic fluid or crystalloid. METHODS Lambs at an estimated gestational age (EGA) 116-121 days (term 145 days) were placed on venovenous ECLS with jugular drainage and umbilical vein reinfusion and intubated. Airways were managed by the instillation of amniotic fluid and tracheal occlusion (TO; n = 4), or lactated Ringer's (LR; n = 4) or perfluorodecalin (a PFC) without occlusion (n = 4). After 7 days, the animals were sacrificed. Early (EGA 116-121 days) and late (EGA 125-131 days) tissue control lambs were delivered and sacrificed. Lungs were formalin-inflated to 30 cm H2O and sectioned for histology. Injury was scored by an unbiased pathologist. Slides were immunostained for PDGFR-α and α-actin; development was quantified by the area fraction of double-positive tips. Surfactant protein-C (SP-C) concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was quantified using ELISA. RESULTS Total injury scores were lower in PFC lungs (1.8 ± 1.7) than in TO (6.5 ± 2.1; p = 0.01) and LR lungs (5.5 ± 2.4; p = 0.01). The area fraction of double-positive alveolar tips appeared higher in PFC lungs than in TO lungs (0.18 ± 0.007 vs. 0.008 ± 0.004; p = 0.07). SP-C concentration was higher in PFC lungs than in TO lungs (37.9 ± 7.6 vs. 20.0 ± 5.4 pg/mL; p = 0.005), and both early (12.4 ± 1.7 g/mL; p = 0.007) and late tissue control lungs (15.1 ± 5.0 pg/mL; p = 0.0008). CONCLUSION During AP support, intratracheal PFC prevents lung injury and promotes normal lung development better than crystalloid or amniotic fluid with TO.","Church, Joseph T; Perkins, Elena M; Coughlin, Megan A; McLeod, Jennifer S; Boss, Katherine; Bentley, J Kelley; Hershenson, Marc B; Rabah, Raja; Bartlett, Robert H; Mychaliska, George B",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000486387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29478055/,520

69794,Components separation technique combined with a double-mesh repair for large midline incisional hernia repair.,2011,"Resistin and resistin-like molecules are pleiotropic cytokines that are involved in inflammatory diseases. Our previous work suggested that resistin has the potential to be used as a biomarker and therapeutic target for human pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, data are limited on the distribution of resistin in healthy human organs. In this study, we used our newly developed anti-human resistin (hResistin) antibody to immunohistochemically detect the expression, localization, and intracellular/extracellular compartmentalization of hResistin in a full human tissue panel from healthy individuals. The potential cross reactivity of this monoclonal anti-hResistin IgG1 with normal human tissues also was verified. Results showed that hResistin is broadly distributed and principally localized in the cytoplasmic granules of macrophages scattered in the interstitium of most human tissues. Bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells also exhibited hResistin signals in their cytoplasmic granules. Additionally, hResistin labeling was observed in the cytoplasm of nervous system cells. Notably, the cytokine activity of hResistin was illustrated by positively stained extracellular material in most human tissues. These data indicate that our generated antibody binds to the secreted hResistin and support its potential use for immunotherapy to reduce circulating hResistin levels in human disease. Our findings comprehensively document the basal expression patterns of hResistin protein in normal human tissues, suggest a critical role of this cytokine in normal and pathophysiologic inflammatory processes, and offer key insights for using our antibody in future pharmacokinetic studies and immunotherapeutic strategies.","Lin, Qing; Price, Shari A; Skinner, John T; Hu, Bin; Fan, Chunling; Yamaji-Kegan, Kazuyo; Johns, Roger A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609743/,520

70007,National Differences in Remission of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery-Subgroup Analysis of 2-Year Results of the Diabetes Surgery Study Comparing Taiwanese with Americans with Mild Obesity (BMI 30-35 kg/m2).,2017,"BACKGROUND At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rapid increase in the use of telehealth services at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which was accelerated by state and local policies mandating stay-at-home orders and restricting non-urgent in-person appointments. Even though, the VA was an early adopter of telehealth in the late 1990's, the vast majority of VA outpatient care continued to be face-to-face visits through February 2020. OBJECTIVE We compare telehealth services use at one VA Medical Center, Greater Los Angeles across three clinics, primary care (PC), cardiology, and home-based primary care (HBPC), 12-months before and 12-months after onset of COVID-19 (March 2020). METHODS We used a parallel mixed methods approach including simultaneous quantitative and qualitative approaches. The distribution of monthly outpatient and telehealth visits, as well as telephone and VA Video Connect (VVC) encounters were examined for each clinic. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 34 staff involved in telehealth services within PC, cardiology, and HBPC, during COVID-19. All audiotaped interviews were transcribed and analyzed by identifying key themes. RESULTS Prior to COVID-19, telehealth use was minimal at all three clinics, but at the onset of COVID-19, telehealth use increased substantially for all three clinics. Telephone was the main modality of patient choice. Compared to PC and cardiology, video-based care had the greatest increase in HBPC. Several important barriers (multiple steps to connect to video-conferencing, creating new scheduling grids, limited access to internet and internet-connected devices) and facilitators (flexibility in using different video-capable platforms, technical support for patients, identifying staff telehealth champions, and developing workflows to help incorporate telehealth into treatment plans) were noted. CONCLUSIONS Technological issues must be addressed at the forefront of telehealth evolution to achieve access for all patient populations with different socioeconomic backgrounds, living situations and locations, and health conditions. The unprecedented expansion of telehealth during COVID-19 provides opportunities to create lasting telehealth solutions to improve access to care beyond the pandemic.

70430,Endoscopic subcutaneous component separation as an adjunct to abdominal wall reconstruction.,2017,"Severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure (BP) ⩾160 mm Hg) resistant to treatment with multiple antihypertensive medications, poses a serious challenge to therapeutic treatment. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) is being increasingly proposed and researched as a safe and effective method of treating this condition. This article evaluates the existing evidence on the effects of RDN on BP reduction and other conditions with increased sympathetic tone. Findings indicate that RDN is a safe and effective treatment for severe hypertension. Moreover, the antihypertensive response to RDN is sustained for up to 3 years of follow-up. RDN decreases office BP more than ambulatory BP, which may be explained by the white-coat effect that causes an increase in office BP. Findings indicate that although reinnervation may occur following RDN, it does not appear to attenuate or reverse the BP response over 24-36 months. There is also evidence that patients with milder forms of hypertension may benefit from RDN. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that RDN may have a role in the treatment of heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, insulin resistance, atrial fibrillation and hypertension associated with end-stage renal disease. Taking into account that resistant hypertension and other diseases associated with elevated sympathetic tone are associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates, RDN therapy may be expected to have a significant impact on public health.","Ram, C V S; Kumar, A S",Journal of human hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2014.6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599151/,520

70579,"Readmission following open ventral hernia repair: incidence, indications, and predictors.",2013,"A newly identified virus appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 presents similarities with two previous coronavirus pandemics, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS-CoV, concerning phylogenetic origin, structural composition, and clinical symptoms, thus, leading to common pathogenic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to declare the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19 by comparing its effect on SARS-CoV and MERS cases. Increased levels of IL-6 comprise the key for the stimulation of cytokine storm and the progression of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 cases. Especially, in COVID-19 patients, the overactivation of NF-kΒ, which is caused by the binding of coronavirus spike protein S to alveolar epithelial cells, up-regulates IL-6 and promotes its systematic circulation, causing alveolar damage and extrapulmonary injury. Additionally, IL-6 can be used to evaluate respiratory failure and identify asymptomatic patients. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody which blocks IL-6 signaling, comprises a remedial option against COVID-19. TCZ improves oxygenation, reduces fever, and decreases levels of IL-6. IL-6 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and the progression of COVID-19 and may be used as a therapeutic target against COVID-19. However, further research is needed concerning the relation of IL-6 in COVID-19 cases and more clinical trials are required to declare TCZ as a treatment option.","Giannakodimos, Ilias; Gkountana, Georgia-Vasiliki; Lykouras, Dimosthenis; Karkoulias, Kiriakos; Tsakas, Sotiris",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666201209100259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33297909/,520
70637,Single-incision laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal herniorrhaphy for recurrent inguinal hernias: preliminary surgical results.,2011,"BACKGROUND Nephron sparing surgery for renal tumors has evolved as the standard of care for resectable renal tumors. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (PN) has gained recognition after technical refinements were able to match the well-established criteria for open partial nephrectomy. Laparoendoscopic surgery (LESS) is one of the approaches to further minimize invasiveness of laparoscopic surgery. OBJECTIVE We report our initial experience with LESS partial nephrectomy in single-incision transumbilical surgery technique (SITUS) in daily clinical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From 2010, patients undergoing SITUS-PN were prospectively evaluated. Patients with small, solitary or multiple, exophytic-enhancing renal masses were selected, whereas patients with solitary kidney, endophytic or hilar tumors were excluded. Important clinical data, PADUA and RENAL score, were assessed prospectively. MEASUREMENTS Patients' characteristics, perioperative, hematologic and pathologic data as well as pain evaluation using the visual analogue pain scale (VAPS) were assessed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS A total of 13 patients underwent LESS-PN/SITUS-PN (6 right and 7 left renal units). One patient was converted to conventional laparoscopy requiring two additional ports to treat bleeding from renal vessels. Pathology revealed renal cell carcinoma in nine patients, oncocytoma in one and benign cyst in three patients. No positive surgical margin was observed. The mean blood loss was 2.1 g/dl [range 0.5-4.5 g/dl] in hemoglobin. Minimal discomfort was noted at discharge (VAPS = 0.2 ± 0.6 [range 0-2]/10]. CONCLUSION LESS partial nephrectomy in SITUS technique is feasible for selected exophytic tumors and has been integrated into our armamentarium for nephron sparing minimally invasive surgical treatment.","Wolters, Mathias; Imkamp, Florian; Wohlatz, Lucy; Jutzi, Stephan; von Klot, Christoph A; Kuczyk, Markus A; Merseburger, Axel S; Walcher, Ute; Nagele, Udo; Herrmann, Thomas R W",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-014-1320-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859775/,520
70820,Peripheral tumour targeting using open-source virtual bronchoscopy with electromagnetic tracking: a multi-user pre-clinical study.,2018,"Introduction Ceftriaxone is the most frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of various bacterial infections in hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Despite this, inappropriate ceftriaxone use is common. Objective The aim of this review is to assess the appropriate use of ceftriaxone in sub-Saharan African countries. Methods A systematic search was done on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Libraries and Google Scholar for papers published addressing the prescribing pattern and use of ceftriaxone in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings were reported in medians and quartiles. Results A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most frequently diagnosed infections in the included studies. The overall median prevalence of appropriate ceftriaxone use is 39.2% (IQR: 29.9-60.9), showing that most of the included studies reported a higher prevalence of inappropriate ceftriaxone use. Although there are a higher number of patients with inappropriate use of ceftriaxone, a relatively higher number of patients got appropriate daily dose (79.8%, IQR: 45.7-89.4) of ceftriaxone than appropriate duration of ceftriaxone (55%, IQR: 52.2-80). Conclusion The review revealed that three in five patients with ceftriaxone got inappropriate ceftriaxone's dose, frequency or duration. A relatively higher number of patients got appropriate daily dose of ceftriaxone. On the other hand, approximately more than half of the patients got inappropriate duration, too short or too long, of ceftriaxone. Hence, prescribers are recommended to adhere to their country-specific treatment guideline. Moreover, it is highly recommended to either commence or strengthen antimicrobial stewardship program effectively in their healthcare settings.","Meresa Bishaw, Birhanu; Tegegne, Gobezie T; Berha, Alemseged Beyene",Infection and drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s329996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483671/,520

71433,Fistulojejunostomy for Chronic Fistula After Sleeve Gastrectomy.,2020-05-09,"INTRODUCTION Deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for Parkinson's Disease (PD) and dystonia is associated with the possibility of both minor and major complications. One possible side effect is the depletion of implantable pulse generator (IPG) battery and the associated sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms, which can be potentially life-threatening. Delayed or postponed outpatient visits due to COVID -19 may be a risk factor of battery end-of-life consequences. OBJECTIVE To analyse the clinical outcomes in reported PD and dystonia patients treated with DBS, who, as a result of the sudden depletion of the neurostimulator battery, developed life-threatening symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS The databases of PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched using pre-established criteria. RESULTS A total of 244 articles was found, of which 12 met the adopted criteria. Selected papers presented a total of 17 case reports of DBS-treated patients - 11 with PD, and six with dystonia - who had depleted IPG batteries and due to rapid worsening of PD/dystonia symptoms required urgent hospital admission. IPG battery replacement was the only effective treatment in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS IPG battery depletion can result in fatal outcomes. Sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms in patients treated by DBS can be potentially life-threatening, so scheduling the replacement of a discharged IPG battery should not be postponed. The COVID-19 pandemic should alert staff at emergency, neurology and movement disorders wards not to postpone the visits of patients with an implanted DBS system.","Przytuła, Filip; Dulski, Jarosław; Sobstyl, Michał; Sławek, Jarosław",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/pjnns.a2021.0041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056704/,520
71533,Long-term results of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass: evaluation after 9 years.,2012,"The operational and policy complexity of civil-military relations (CMR) during public health emergencies, especially those involving militaries from outside the state concerned, is addressed in several guiding international documents. Generally, these documents reflect humanitarian perspectives and doctrine at the time of their drafting, and primarily address foreign military involvement in natural and humanitarian disasters. However, in the past decade, there have been significant changes in the geopolitical environment and global health landscapes. Foreign militaries have been increasingly deployed to public health emergencies with responses grounded in public health (rather than humanitarian) approaches, while public health issues are of increasing importance in other deployments. This paper reviews key international policy documents that regulate, guide or otherwise inform CMR in the context of recent events involving international CMR during public health emergency responses, grounded in analysis of a March 2017 Chatham House roundtable event on the subject. Major thematic concerns regarding the application of existing CMR guiding documents to public health emergencies became evident. These include a lack of consideration of public health factors as distinct from a humanitarian approach; the assertion of state sovereignty vis-à-vis the deployment of national militaries; the emergence of new armed, military and security groups and a lack of consensus surrounding the 'principle of last resort'. These criticisms and gaps-in particular, a consideration for public health contexts and approaches therein-should form the basis of future CMR drafting or revision processes to ensure effective, safe, and sustainable CMR during public health emergency response.","Boland, Samuel T; McInnes, C; Gordon, S; Lillywhite, L",BMJ military health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32753540/,520

The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying change of well-being in times of threat, using the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on appraisals of the pandemic and affective states, stress, as well as mindfulness in daily life. METHODS: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. We worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as 7189 observations from the diary phase. RESULTS: Results showed that deterioration in mental health symptoms across the duration of the study was associated with (a) change towards less fortunate appraisals of the pandemic and (b), more negative affect and less mindfulness in daily life. Furthermore, appraisals of the pandemic at pretest predicted experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness.

In experiment 1, the TAI process (0 d, GnRH, 100 μg; 7 d, PGF2α, 0.4 mg; 56 hr, GnRH, 100 μg; 16 hr, AI) was applied to 160 dairy cows on 50th and 60th days after parturition respectively. In experiment 2, 320 postpartum dairy cows were treated with TAI (Group A), TAI + 25 μg LRH-A3 (Group B), TAI + 1,500 IU HCG 5 days after AI (Group C), and TAI + 25 μg LRH-A3 + 1,500 IU HCG 5 days after AI (Group D). In experiment 3, endometrial cells were treated with HCG. The results showed that TAI did not affect the pregnancy rate, while LRH-A3 and HCG increased the pregnancy rate of the cow. HCG of 5 IU/ml and 10 IU/ml increased the expressions of leukemia inhibitory factor but decreased those of interleukin-6, epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor in endometrial cells. This study provided a plan for the use of LRH-A3 and HCG to increase pregnancy rate during TAI in dairy cows.","Zheng, Peng; Huang, He; Li, Xiaoyu; Huang, Fushuo; Adeniran, Samson Olugbenga; Wang, Ziming; Feng, Rui; Zhang, Guixue",Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,https://doi.org/10.1111/asj.13549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763962/,520

72007,Impact of barbed suture in controlling the dorsal vein complex during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.,2015,"Background: In response to the public health emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic, American Heart Association volunteers and staff aimed to rapidly develop and launch a resource for the medical and research community to expedite scientific advancement through shared learning, quality improvement, and research. In less than 4 weeks after it was first announced on April 3, 2020, AHA's COVID-19 CVD Registry powered by Get With The Guidelines® (GWTG) received its first clinical records. Methods and Results: Participating hospitals are enrolling consecutive hospitalized patients with active COVID-19 disease, regardless of CVD status. This hospital quality improvement program will allow participating hospitals and health systems to evaluate patient-level data including mortality rates, intensive care unit (ICU) bed days, and ventilator days from individual review of electronic medical records of sequential adult patients with active COVID-19 infection. Participating sites can leverage these data for onsite, rapid quality improvement and benchmarking versus other institutions. After 9 weeks, more than 130 sites have enrolled in the program and more than 4,000 records have been abstracted in the national dataset. Additionally, the aggregate dataset will be a valuable data resource for the medical research community. Conclusions: The AHA COVID-19 CVD Registry will support greater understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular disease and will inform best practices for evaluation and management of patients with COVID-19.","Alger, Heather M; Rutan, Christine; Williams Iv, Joseph H; Walchok, Jason G; Bolles, Michele; Hall, Jennifer L; Bradley, Steven M; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Rodriguez, Fatima; Wang, Tracy Y; Morrow, David A; Das, Sandeep R; de Lemos, James A",Circulation.

However, elite athletes, industrial workers, and military personnel, driven by the tasks at hand, may choose to continue working and face an increased risk of exertional heat illness (EHI). We wanted to examine the efficacy of a new core temperature (Tcr) estimation algorithm in assessing EHI risk. APPROACH Physiological responses of 21 male Royal Marines recruits (age 21±2 y, height 1.79±0.05 m, weight 80.5±7.2 kg) were collected during a physically-demanding criterion road march (14.5 km in 90 min with a 9.6 kg load; air temperature 16°C, relative humidity ≥ 84%). Measured Tcr (thermometer pill) and estimated Tcr (ECTempTM Tcr-est) were compared. MAIN RESULTS Measured Tcr either increased to an asymptote Tcr < 39.5°C (WARM; n=11), or progressively increased to Tcr > 40.0°C (HOT; n=10). In the HOT group, Tcr-est reflected measured Tcr up to Tcr = 40.0°C (Bias = -0.10 ± 0.37°C, root mean square error = 0.37 ± 0.13°C). In the WARM group, Tcr-est overestimated Tcr (Bias = 0.34 ± 0.40°C) and was higher from mid-point to end. A logistic regression (Skin temperature approximate entropy and mean heart rate) was able to predict group membership (95% accuracy) at 20 minutes, allowing a WARM group ECTemp(TM) correction factor (corrected Bias=0.00 ± 0.29°C). SIGNIFICANCE The Tcr-est successfully tracked Tcr in the HOT group with high risk of exertional heat illness (EHI) (40% incidence). Skin temperature complexity shows promise as a non-invasive means of insight into the state of thermoregulatory control mechanisms.","Buller, Mark J; Davey, Trish; Fallowfield, Joanne; Montain, Scott; Hoyt, Reed; Delves, Simon",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ab934b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408286/,520

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. Fifty-nine patients with COVID-19 admitted to Bazhong Central Hospital and Dazhou Central Hospital from January 27th to February 9th, 2020 were selected as the subjects. The data of demography, epidemiology, laboratory examination, chest CT and related clinical treatment were collected. According to the severity of the disease, the patients were divided into three types: mild, general and severe types, and the differences of the above indices among different clinical types were compared. RESULTS (1) General information and epidemiology: 31 cases (52.5%) were male, 28 cases (47.5%) were female, the average age was (42.0±16.4) years old, and the patients over 40 years old accounted for the largest proportion (35 cases, 59.3%). The proportion of clinical type was 72.9% (43 cases) in general type, and 62.7% (37 cases) were imported type. With the increase of disease severity, the average age of patients also showed a significant increase trend [the age of the mild, general and severe patients were (30.9±13.6), (42.7±15.3), (55.8±18.9) years old, P < 0.01]. The proportion of patients with more than one basic disease in severe patients was significantly higher than those in mild and general patients [66.7% (4/6) vs. 20.0% (2/10), 9.3% (4/43), both P < 0.05]. In the distribution of clinical symptoms, the proportion of severe patients with chest distress/dyspnea was significantly higher than those in mild and general patients [66.7% (4/6) vs. 10.0% (1/10), 11.6% (5/43), both P < 0.05]. (2) Laboratory examination index: the total number of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils count (NEU), C-reactive protein (CRP) in severe patients were higher than those in mild patients and general patients [WBC (×109/L): 7.21±4.35 vs. 5.85±1.69, 5.43±2.04; NEU (×109/L): 6.09±4.43 vs. 3.95±1.45, 3.54±1.83; CRP (mg/L): 16.00 (8.20, 46.43) vs. 5.00 (0.00, 16.13), 15.00 (3.13, 28.58)], the albumin (Alb) level in severe patients was lower than those in mild and general patients (g/L: 38.00±5.35 vs. 49.23±5.27, 39.81±2.15, both P < 0.05), while the hemoglobin (Hb) level in mild patients was higher than that in severe and general patients (g/L: 155.2±12.1 vs. 141.3±6.8, 131.1±11.7, both P < 0.05). (3) Chest imaging: the CT manifestations of typical cases were single or multiple ground glass shadows. With the progress of the disease, the focus gradually increased, the scope gradually expanded, and multiple solid shadows of lung lobes were involved. (4) Treatment: all patients received at least 2 kinds of antiviral therapy, and the application rate of Interferon and Ribavirin in severe patients were higher than those in mild and general patients [100.0% (6/6) vs. 80.0% (8/10), 97.7% (42/43); 83.3% (5/6) vs. 0% (0/10), 20.9% (9/43); all P < 0.05]. (5) Prognosis: until March 6th 2020, 50 patients (84.8%) were discharged from the hospital after rehabilitation, and the remaining 9 patients were still under treatment, none deaths. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of severe patients with chest distress/dyspnea is higher, the older the patients are and the more basic diseases are, the more likely they are to develop into severe type. High resolution chest CT could be considered for suspected cases or even fever patients, which may show the progress of the disease.","Li, Biliang; Zhang, Shiguo; Luo, Shilin; Liu, Chun; Jia, Weijun; Jiang, Huating; Dai, Qian",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200317-00227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834980/,520
72243,Advances in circular stapling technique for gastric bypass: transoral placement of the anvil.,2008,"BACKGROUND Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention reduces the risk for coronary thrombotic events (CTEs) at the expense of increasing risk for major bleeding (MB). Metrics to accurately predict the occurrence of each respective event and inform clinical decision making are lacking. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to develop and validate separate models to predict risks for out-of-hospital thrombotic and bleeding events after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. METHODS Using data from 4,190 patients treated with drug-eluting stents and enrolled in the PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Anti-Platelet Regimen in Stented Patients) registry, separate risk scores were developed to predict CTE (defined as the composite of stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction) and MB (defined as the occurrence of a Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5 bleed). External validation was performed in the ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) registry. RESULTS Over 2 years, CTEs occurred in 151 patients (3.8%) and MB in 133 (3.3%). Independent predictors of CTEs included acute coronary syndrome, prior revascularization, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and current smoking. Independent predictors of MB included older age, body mass index, triple therapy at discharge, anemia, current smoking, and renal dysfunction. Each model displayed moderate levels of discrimination and adequate calibration. CONCLUSIONS Simple risk scores of baseline clinical variables may be useful to predict risks for ischemic and bleeding events after PCI with DES, thereby facilitating clinical decisions surrounding the optimal duration of DAPT.

In day-surgery settings, LIL may contribute to increase the surgical success due to several potential benefits in terms of postoperative pain intensity and time to full recovery. In 14 consecutive patients requiring cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis, LIL was carried out uneventfully. No conversion, intra-operative or postoperative complications occurred. All patients were discharged the same day of surgery. Postoperative pain was well tolerated with no need of prolonged opioid therapy.

METHODS Cross-sectional study carried out in a Brazilian public large hospital. The study included 33 patients. The nursing workload was assessed using the Nursing Activities Score (NAS) every 24 hours. We performed 447 Nursing Activities Score assessments. For the statistical analysis, Student's t-test, ANOVA, and Spearman's correlation test were used. The considered significant difference was 5% (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS The Nursing Activities Score mean was 84% (± 4.4), which corresponded to 20.2 hours. There was an association between the nursing workload and the patient's severity (p <0.010), burned body surface (p = 0.010), and hospitalization outcome (p = 0.020). CONCLUSION Burn victims, assisted in the ICU, demanded a high nursing workload, which was influenced by clinical aspects and the hospitalization outcome.

We extracted the α-helical peptide segments that share common secondary-structure environments in the capsid protein-protein interfaces of three unrelated virus classes (PRD1-like, HK97-like, and BTV-like) that encompass different levels of pathogenicity to humans, animals, and plants. The potential for the binding of these peptides to the individual capsid proteins was then investigated using blind docking simulations. Most of the extracted α-helical peptides were found to interact favorably with one or more of the protein-protein interfaces within the capsid in all three classes of virus. Moreover, binding of these peptides to the interface regions was found to block one or more of the putative ""hot spot"" regions on the protein interface, thereby providing the potential to disrupt virus capsid assembly via competitive interaction with other capsid proteins. In particular, binding of the GDFNALSN peptide was found to block interface ""hot spot"" regions in most of the viruses, providing a potential lead for broad-spectrum antiviral drug therapy.","ElSawy, Karim M; Twarock, Reidun; Verma, Chandra S; Caves, Leo S D",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/ci200467s; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390317/,520

Furthermore, due to amplified global connection and speedy modernization, epidemic outbreaks caused by novel and re‑emergingviruses signify potential risk to community health. Despite, great advancements in immunization and drug discovery processes, still various viruses lack prophylactic vaccines and efficient antiviral therapies. Although, vaccine is prophylaxes option, but it can be not applied to infected patients, hence therapeutic interventions are urgently needed to control the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic condition. To spot the novel antiviral therapy is of decisive importance and Mother Nature is an excellent source for such discoveries. In this article, we have implemented prompt high through-put virtual screening for vetting the best possible drug candidates from natural compounds' databases. Herein, we have implemented time tested rigorous multi-layered drug screening process to narrow down 66,969 natural compounds for the identification of potential lead(s). Druggability parameters, different docking approaches and neutralization tendency of the natural products were employed in this study to screen the best possible natural compounds from the digital libraries. The results of this study conclude that compounds PALA and HMCA are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and can be further explored for experimental validation. Overall, the methodological approach reported in this article can be suitably used to find the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in the burning situation of COVID-19 with less expenditure and a very short span of time.","Dhasmana, Anupam; Kashyap, Vivek Kumar; Dhasmana, Swati; Kotnala, Sudhir; Haque, Shafiul; Ashraf, Ghulam Md; Jaggi, Meena; Yallapu, Murali M; Chauhan, Subhash C",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826999200820162937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867645/,520

Ag(+) kills pathogenic organisms at concentrations of <50 ppm, and current/potential anti-infective applications include: acute burn coverings, catheter linings, water purification systems, hospital gowns, and caries prevention. To distill the current best evidence relative to caries, this systematic review asked: Will silver diamine fluoride (SDF) more effectively prevent caries than fluoride varnish? A five-database search, reference review, and hand search identified 99 human clinical trials in three languages published between 1966 and 2006. Dual review for controlled clinical trials with the patient as the unit of observation, and excluding cross-sectional, animal, in vitro studies, and opinions, identified 2 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The trials indicated that SDF's lowest prevented fractions for caries arrest and caries prevention were 96.1% and 70.3%, respectively. In contrast, fluoride varnish's highest prevented fractions for caries arrest and caries prevention were 21.3% and 55.7%, respectively. Similarly, SDF's highest numbers needed to treat for caries arrest and caries prevention were 0.8 (95% CI=0.5-1.0) and 0.9 (95% CI=0.4-1.1), respectively. For fluoride varnish, the lowest numbers needed to treat for caries arrest and prevention were 3.7 (95% CI=3.4-3.9) and 1.1 (95% CI=0.7-1.4), respectively. Adverse events were monitored, with no significant differences between control and experimental groups. These promising results suggest that SDF is more effective than fluoride varnish, and may be a valuable caries-preventive intervention.

Existing outcome prediction models suffer from a low recall of infrequent positive outcomes. We present a highly-scalable and robust machine learning framework to automatically predict adversity represented by mortality and ICU admission from time-series vital signs and laboratory results obtained within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. The stacked platform comprises two components: a) an unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder that learns an optimal representation of the time-series, using it to differentiate the less frequent patterns which conclude with an adverse event from the majority patterns that do not, and b) a gradient boosting model, which relies on the constructed representation to refine the prediction, incorporating static features of demographics, admission details and clinical summaries. The model is used to assess a patient's risk of adversity over time and provides visual justifications of its prediction, based on the patient's static features and dynamic signals. Results of three case studies for predicting mortality and ICU admission show that the model outperforms all existing outcome prediction models, achieving average Precision-Recall Areas Under the Curve (PR-AUCs) of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.878 - 0.969) in predicting mortality in ICU and general ward settings and 0.987 (95% CI: 0.985-0.995) in predicting ICU admission.","Ibrahim, Zina; Bean, Daniel; Searle, Thomas; Qian, Linglong; Wu, Honghan; Shek, Anthony; Kraljevic, Zeljko; Galloway, James; Norton, Sam; Teo, James; Dobson, Richard J",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2021.3089287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129509/,520

A difficulty for this pro-life position has been Judith Jarvis Thomson's violinist analogy, in which she argues that even if the fetus is a person, abortion is often permissible because a pregnant woman is not obliged to continue to offer her body as life support. Here, we outline the moral theories underlying public health ethics, and examine the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of public health considerations overriding individual rights. We argue that if fetuses are regarded as persons, then abortion is of such prevalence in society that it also constitutes a significant public health crisis. We show that on public health considerations, we are justified in overriding individual rights to bodily autonomy by prohibiting abortion. We conclude that in a society that values public health, abortion can only be tolerated if fetuses are not regarded as persons.","Blackshaw, Bruce; Rodger, Daniel",Bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811355/,520

However, how MXYG acts against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not known. We investigated the active ingredients and the therapeutic targets of MXYG decoction against COVID-19. METHODS A network pharmacology strategy involving drug-likeness evaluation, prediction of oral bioavailability, network analyses, and virtual molecular docking were used to predict the mechanism of action of MXYG against COVID-19. RESULTS Thirty-three core COVID-19-related targets were identified from 1023 gene targets through analyses of protein- protein interactions. Eighty-six active ingredients of MXYG decoction hit by 19 therapeutic targets were screened out by analyses of a compound-compound target network. Via network topology, three ""hub"" gene targets (interleukin (IL-6), caspase-3, IL-4) and three key components (quercetin, formononetin, luteolin) were recognized and verified by molecular docking. Compared with control compounds (ribavirin, arbidol), the docking score of quercetin to the IL-6 receptor was highest, with a score of 5. Furthermore, the scores of three key components to SARS-CoV-2 are large as 4, 5, and 5, respectively, which are even better than those of ribavirin at 3. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that MXYG could prevent and treat COVID-19 through anti-inflammatory and immunity-based actions involving activation of T cells, lymphocytes, and leukocytes, as well as cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathways.

This study identifies excess oceanic evaporation, in conjunction with the RCMs' boundary conditions, as drivers contributing to these biases in RCMs with forced sea surface temperatures in a CORDEX RCM ensemble over Europe. The RCMs are relaxed to the prescribed lateral boundary conditions originating from a global model, effectively matching the driving model's overall atmospheric moisture flux divergence. As a consequence, excess oceanic evaporation results in positive precipitation biases over land due to forced internal recycling of moisture to maintain the overall flux divergence prescribed by the boundary conditions.

Given that more people die annually of cardiovascular disease across the globe than from any other cause, it is important to identify the evidence for interventions aimed at improving cardiovascular health among people with personality disorders. METHODS Systematic literature review. PsycINFO, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched using NICE Healthcare Databases, as well as CENTRAL and trial registries. We sought to identify randomised controlled trials of interventions pertaining to adults with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder, where the primary outcome measure was cardiovascular health before and after the intervention. RESULTS A total of 1740 records were identified and screened by two independent reviewers. No papers meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review did not identify any randomised controlled trials testing interventions aimed at improving the cardiovascular health of people with personality disorders. Research in this area could have important public health implications, spanning the fields of psychiatry and general medicine.","Hall, Katherine; Barnicot, Kirsten; Crawford, Mike; Moran, Paul",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-019-01705-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929043/,520

BACKGROUND Randomized trials and PSM studies constitute the highest level of evidence in addressing the long-term oncologic efficacy of laparoscopic versus open resection for CLM. However, individual studies are limited by the reporting of overall survival in ways not amenable to traditional methods of meta-analysis, and violation of the proportional hazards assumption. METHODS Survival information of individual patients was reconstructed from the published Kaplan-Meier curves with the aid of a computer vision program. Frequentist and Bayesian survival models (taking into account random-effects and nonproportional hazards) were fitted to compare overall survival of patients who underwent laparoscopic versus open surgery. To handle long plateaus in the tails of survival curves, we also exploited ""cure models"" to estimate the fraction of patients effectively ""cured"" of disease. RESULTS Individual patient data from 2 randomized trials and 13 PSM studies involving 3148 participants were reconstructed. Laparoscopic resection was associated with a lower hazard rate of death (stratified hazard ratio = 0.853, 95% confidence interval: 0.754-0.965, P = 0.0114), and there was evidence of time-varying effects (P = 0.0324) in which the magnitude of hazard ratios increased over time. The fractions of long-term cancer survivors were estimated to be 47.4% and 18.0% in the laparoscopy and open surgery groups, respectively. At 10-year follow-up, the restricted mean survival time was 8.6 months (or 12.1%) longer in the laparoscopy arm (P < 0.0001). In a subgroup analysis, elderly patients (≥65 years old) treated with laparoscopy experienced longer 3-year average life expectancy (+6.2%, P = 0.018), and those who live past the 5-year milestone (46.1%) seem to be cured of disease. CONCLUSIONS This patient-level meta-analysis of high-quality studies demonstrated an unexpected survival benefit in favor of laparoscopic over open resection for CLM in the long-term. From a conservative viewpoint, these results can be interpreted to indicate that laparoscopy is at least not inferior to the standard open approach.","Syn, Nicholas L; Kabir, Tousif; Koh, Ye Xin; Tan, Hwee Leong; Wang, Louis Z; Chin, Brian Zhaojie; Wee, Ian; Teo, Jin Yao; Tai, Bee Choo; Goh, Brian K P",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000003672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31714304/,520

The tentatively named red panda amdoparvovirus (RpAPV) was detected in the feces and/or tissues of all animals tested. At necropsy of 1 geriatric animal, infection was associated with pyogranulomatous peritonitis, pancreatitis, and myocarditis. Other animals had detectable low-level viral nucleic acid in lymph nodes and both oral and intestinal epithelium at the time of necropsy. Full-length genome sequences of RpAPV strains from 2 animals had 12% sequence divergence, demonstrating genetic diversity even among in-contact animals.

We review epidemiological and clinical data that point to the important roles psychiatric disorders have in the use and abuse of opioids in patients with chronic pain. METHOD We conducted literature searches on the PubMed with the key phrases ""chronic pain"" and ""opioid therapy"" and selected those articles on the epidemiology of comorbidity between chronic pain and psychiatric disorders, the trends in long-term opioid therapy and the clinical trials that involved using opioid therapy for chronic pain or for mental health disorders. We then thoroughly reviewed the bibliography of all relevant articles to identify additional papers to be included in the present review. RESULTS Chronic pain is highly comorbid with common psychiatric disorders. Patients with mental health and substance abuse disorders are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain and more likely to have adverse outcomes from this therapy. Although opioids may exert brief antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in some patients with depression or anxiety, there is scant evidence for long-term benefit from opioid treatment of psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS Opioids may be used in current clinical practice as the de facto and only psychiatric treatment for patients with chronic pain, despite little evidence for sustained benefit. The opioid epidemic thus reflects a serious unmet need for better recognition and treatment of common mental health problems in patients with chronic pain. Psychiatry is the missing P in chronic pain care.","Howe, Catherine Q; Sullivan, Mark D",General hospital psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2013.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211157/,520

Few studies have explored the political contextual factors that impact implementation of evidence-based non-communicable disease prevention (EBNCDP). This study aimed to do so in Australia, Brazil, China and the United States. Investigators conducted 10-13 qualitative, semi-structured interviews of public health practitioners working in functionally similar public health organizations in each country (total N = 50). Study participants were identified through purposive sampling and interviews were structured around an interview guide covering six domains related to EBNCDP. Interviewees from all four countries identified funding as the primary politically-influenced barrier to implementing EBNCDP. Similarly widespread barriers included government funding priorities that shift based on who is in power and the difficulty of convincing policy-makers and funders that non-communicable disease prevention is a wise investment of political capital. Policymakers who are not evidence-driven was another common barrier even in the United States and Australia, where EBNCDP is more established. Findings suggest that political contextual factors influence EBNCDP and vary to an extent by country, though certain factors seem to be universal. This can aid public health practitioners, political leaders, and policymakers in advocating for conditions and policies that encourage evidence-based practice.","Furtado, Karishma S; Budd, Elizabeth L; Ying, Xiangji; deRuyter, Anna J; Armstrong, Rebecca L; Pettman, Tahna L; Reis, Rodrigo S; Sung-Chan, Pauline; Wang, Zhaoxin; Saunders, Tahnee; Becker, Leonardo A; Shi, Jianwei; Mui, Long Sum Tabitha; Brownson, Ross C",Health education research,https://doi.org/10.1093/her/cyy005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29547975/,520

78287,Laparoscopic tailored Nissen fundoplication.,2010,"BACKGROUND A bulky compression dressing (Robert Jones bandage) is commonly used after TKA to reduce blood loss, pain, and swelling. However, it is unclear whether these dressings in fact reduce blood loss. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We compared postoperative blood loss, pain, knee swelling, and postoperative complications in two types of postoperative dressings after TKA: a modified Robert Jones dressing (MRJB) and a conventional wound dressing. METHODS We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 60 patients who underwent a unilateral primary TKA at our institution between November 2010 and July 2011. After wound closure, the patients were allocated into two groups. Thirty patients had the MRJB applied for 24 hours (Group 1) and 30 patients had a conventional wound dressing applied (Group 2). Postoperative hemorrhages in the vacuum drain, units of transfused blood, postoperative pain, knee swelling, and complications were assessed at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. RESULTS We found no differences in the mean postoperative blood loss between the groups (Group 1, 418 mL versus Group 2, 467 mL). Blood transfusion amounts, postoperative pain, and knee swelling also were similar. Three patients in Group 1 experienced bruising and two patients in Group 2 also had bruising. One patient in Group 1 had a blister. CONCLUSIONS Although previous studies have shown reduced blood loss, pain, and knee swelling after application of a MRJB, we found no benefit of this bandage. Our data suggest a postoperative compression dressing is not necessary after primary TKAs.","Pinsornsak, Piya; Chumchuen, Sukanis",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-013-2786-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23307631/,520

However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. METHODS Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. RESULTS We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. CONCLUSION Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting. Thus, our study supports the positive potential of distance learning for teaching anatomy during and after COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes the need for a synchronous learning environment with partially personnel-intensive small group settings to overcome passivity and inequality aspects, and to foster active learning elements.","Darici, D; Reissner, C; Brockhaus, J; Missler, M",Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aanat.2021.151718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33675948/,520
78503,Prediction Model for Hemorrhagic Complications after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: Development of SLEEVE BLEED Calculator.,2017,"BACKGROUND Few publications have addressed prehospital use of ketamine in analgesic doses. We aimed to assess the effect and safety profile of ketamine compared with other analgesic drugs (or no drug) in adult prehospital patients with acute pain. METHODS A systematic review of clinical trials assessing prehospital administration of ketamine in analgesic doses compared with other analgesic drugs or no analgesic treatment in adults. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos from inception until 15 February 2020, including relevant articles in English and Nordic languages. We used the Cochrane and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodologies and exclusively assessed patient-centred outcomes. Two independent authors screened trials for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. RESULTS We included eight studies (2760 patients). Ketamine was compared with various opioids given alone, and intranasal ketamine given with nitrous oxide was compared with nitrous oxide given alone. Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one cluster randomised trial included 699 patients. One prospective cohort included 27 patients and two retrospective cohorts included 2034 patients. Five of the eight studies had high risks of bias. Pain score with ketamine is probably lower than after opioids as demonstrated in a cluster-RCT (308 patients) and a retrospective cohort (158 patients) study, Δvisual analogue scale -0.4 (-0.8 to 0.0) and Δnumeric pain rating scale -3.0 (-3.86 to -2.14), respectively. Ketamine probably leads to less nausea and vomiting (risk ratio (RR) 0.24 (0.11 to 0.52)) but more agitation (RR 7.81 (1.85 to 33)) than opioids. CONCLUSIONS This systematic literature review finds that ketamine probably reduces pain more than opioids and with less nausea and vomiting but higher risk of agitation.

78573,Step-wise integration of single-port laparoscopic surgery into routine colorectal surgical practice by use of a surgical glove port.,2011,"Uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for myriad cardiovascular diseases. Among its many effects, hypertension increases central artery stiffness which in turn is both an initiator and indicator of disease. Despite extensive clinical, animal, and basic science studies, the biochemomechanical mechanisms by which hypertension drives aortic stiffening remain unclear. In this paper, we show that a new computational model of aortic growth and remodeling can capture differential effects of induced hypertension on the thoracic and abdominal aorta in a common mouse model of disease. Because the simulations treat the aortic wall as a constrained mixture of different constituents having different material properties and rates of turnover, one can gain increased insight into underlying constituent-level mechanisms of aortic remodeling. Model results suggest that the aorta can mechano-adapt locally to blood pressure elevation in the absence of marked inflammation, but large increases in inflammation drive a persistent maladaptive phenotype characterized primarily by adventitial fibrosis. Moreover, this fibrosis appears to occur via a marked increase in the rate of deposition of collagen having different material properties in the absence of a compensatory increase in the rate of matrix degradation. Controlling inflammation thus appears to be key to reducing fibrosis, but therapeutic strategies should not compromise the proteolytic activity of the wall that is essential to mechanical homeostasis.","Latorre, Marcos; Bersi, Matthew R; Humphrey, Jay D",International journal of engineering science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijengsci.2019.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831391/,520

79055,Costs of Leaks and Bleeding After Sleeve Gastrectomies.,2015,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the use of a logarithmic amplifier to improve the spatial resolution (RES) of a low-cost electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system. In an EIT system, the measured signal has a large dynamic range from µV to mV, which requires high-RES (analog to digital conversion) cards. The logarithmic amplifier reduces the dynamic range by expanding lower values and compressing higher values, thereby improving the sensitivity and at the same time preventing the signal from saturation. In addition, a low-RES analog to digital conversion (ADC) cards can be used, making the system cost effective. This work evaluates the performance of a logarithmic amplifier and a linear amplifier used for signal conditioning in a low-cost EIT system. APPROACH Two EIT systems based on a linear amplifier and logarithmic amplifier were designed. Phantom experiments were carried out with very small amounts of current injection. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image quality, minimum detectable size and minimum detectable conductivity change were obtained. MAIN RESULTS The logarithmic amplifier-based EIT system increased the average SNR by 4 dB. It also showed improvement in the RES and contrast-to-noise ratio of the images. The minimum size detectable by the logarithmic amplifier-based system was of radius 0.25 cm in a tank of radius 11 cm and the minimum change in conductivity detectable was 11%. SIGNIFICANCE Logarithmic amplifier-based signal conditioning is a promising technique for improving the spatial RES of a low-cost EIT system that has a low-RES ADC.","Saxena, M; Gharpure, D C; Wagh, V G",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abc1b4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305738/,520

We compared the outcomes of ""elderly"" patients presenting to our unit with a colorectal cancer emergency over a 10-year period with those of a ""younger"" cohort. METHODS A single centre retrospective review of colorectal cancer emergencies between 1st April 2007 and 1st April 2017 was performed. Patients were separated into two cohorts: ""young"" (<75 years) and ""elderly"" (≥75 years). Data collected included demographics, disease status, treatment and outcomes. RESULTS A total of 341 patients (<75 yr: n=154; ≥75 yr: n= 187) presented as a colorectal cancer emergency. Significantly fewer ""elderly"" patients underwent curative surgical procedures (72% vs. 49%, P<0.0001) or received adjuvant chemotherapy (56% vs. 21%, P<0.0001). ""Elderly"" patients had significantly more post-operative cardio-respiratory complications (7% vs. 36%, P<0.0001), but despite this there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (7% vs. 12%,), survival rates at 1-year (75% vs. 74%,) or 3-years (56% vs. 49%). Elderly patients treated with best supportive care had a median overall survival of just 62 (range 1-955) days.

Visual Scanning Therapy (VST) is widely used in clinical practice to ameliorate symptoms of VSN. Yet, not all patients benefit from this training and many training sessions are needed in order to achieve stable results. One potentially promising improvement to the VST is based on the theory that different effectors of the motor systems (e.g., eyes, hands) independently allocate attention during the programming of the movement (i.e., Pre Motor Theory of Attention (PMT)). Here, we studied this direct implementation of the PMT and tested whether a congruent movement training (CMT: congruent -i.e., executed at the same time to the same location-eye and pointing movements) is more effective to attenuate symptoms of neglect compared to VST. This study can be seen as a proof of concept. Attenuation of neglect symptoms was found in the CMT group after just 5 h of training in the subacute phase of neglect. In contrast, no training effects were found in the VST group. These findings indicate the potential of CMT which is a minimal -yet crucial-upgrade of the standard VST protocol that can be easily implemented in the clinic.","Elshout, Joris A; Van der Stigchel, Stefan; Nijboer, Tanja C W",Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2021.03.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217016/,520

Retrospective Study in 50 Patients.,2015,"Echinococcosis is one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases recognized by the World Health Organization and causes a huge global disease burden. The Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet) of China is the most epidemic area of echinococcosis worldwide. Echinococcosis poses an enormous threat to local public health and economic development. Identifying vulnerable populations and analyzing people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) with respect to echinococcosis is necessary to prevent and control echinococcosis. Based on reported cases and questionnaire responses, we first used a k-prototypes clustering algorithm to identify vulnerable populations according to human demographics (including gender, age, education level, and occupation). We then used a KAP analysis to evaluate the Tibetan people's understanding of echinococcosis. The results identified three types of vulnerable population. Vulnerable population I comprised illiterate middle-aged and older women engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Vulnerable population II comprised illiterate middle-aged male herdsmen. Vulnerable population III comprised young male farmers with a low education level. The KAP analysis indicated that the pass rate for all participants was 72.6%, 6.4%, 95.0%, and 75.8% for KAP, K, A, and P, respectively. The pass rates were significantly different among different age and gender groups.

79943,A reproducible ex vivo model for transanal minimally invasive surgery.,2014,"OBJECTIVE The first 70 years of critical care can be considered a period of ""industrial revolution-like"" advancement in terms of progressing the understanding and care of critical illness. Unfortunately, like the industrial revolution's impact on the environment, advancing ICU care of increasingly elderly, immunosuppressed, and debilitated individuals has resulted in a greater overall burden and complexity of nosocomial infections within modern ICUs. Given the rapid evolution of nosocomial infections, the authors provide an updated review. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION We searched PubMed and OVID for peer-reviewed literature dealing with nosocomial infections in the critically ill, as well as the websites of government agencies involved with the reporting and prevention of nosocomial infections. Search terms included nosocomial infection, antibiotic resistance, microbiome, antibiotics, and intensive care. DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS Nosocomial infections in the ICU setting are evolving in multiple domains including etiologic pathogens plus novel or emerging pathogens, prevalence, host risk factors, antimicrobial resistance, interactions of the host microbiome with nosocomial infection occurrence, and understanding of pathogenesis and prevention strategies. Increasing virulence and antimicrobial resistance of nosocomial infections mandate increasing efforts toward their prevention. CONCLUSIONS Nosocomial infections are an important determinant of outcome for patients in the ICU setting. Systematic research aimed at improving the prevention and treatment of nosocomial infections is still needed.","Kollef, Marin H; Torres, Antoni; Shorr, Andrew F; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Micek, Scott T",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33438970/,520

The aim of this study was to assess several parameters that might help in diagnosing CD migration on chest X-ray (CXR). Methods Patients with a CD inserted from the safe triangle with a subsequent supine CXR and CT scan performed less than 24 hours apart were assessed for CD foreshortening, angle of inclination of the CD, and CD tortuosity. CD foreshortening was expressed as a ratio between CD length measured in coronal plane only and CD length inside the pleural cavity measured on CT. The angle of inclination of the CD was measured as the angle between the horizontal line and CD at the pleural space entry on CXR. CD tortuosity was calculated as a ratio between the distance from CD pleural space entry to the tip of the CD and the length of CD from the pleural space entry to its tip on CXR. Results Altogether 28 patients were included in the study. The median time between the CXR and CT examinations was 5.4 hours (IQR, 3.8-6.9 hours). CD foreshortening was the best clue of a misplaced CD with AUC of 0.93, 100% sensitivity and 88% specificity for a cut-off value of 82%. The angle of CD inclination was greater in patients with misplaced CD with AUC of 0.83, 75% sensitivity and 92% specificity for a cut-off of 50 degrees. The performance of CD tortuosity was poor. Conclusions Greater foreshortening of the CD and a steep angle of inclination of the CD above the horizontal at chest entry should raise suspicion of CD migration and mandate further investigation by chest ultrasound to rule out residual pneumothorax occult on CXR.","Mokotedi, Masego Candy; Lambert, Lukas; Simakova, Lucie; Lips, Michal; Zakharchenko, Michal; Rulisek, Jan; Balik, Martin",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2018.09.64; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30505477/,520
81525,Meta-analysis of glue versus sutured mesh fixation for Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair.,2013,"CONTEXT The older adult population in the United States is experiencing unprecedented growth and is accompanied by a parallel increase in the health challenges of these individuals. Public health has, historically, not played a large role in older adult health, but given its contributions to longevity, it makes sense for public health to now prioritize the health of this population. PROGRAM With the goal of public health prioritization of healthy aging, Trust for America's Health, with support from The John A. Hartford Foundation, launched an initiative to demonstrate the crucial roles public health departments can play to improve the health of older adults. IMPLEMENTATION An Age-Friendly Public Health Systems (AFPHS) Learning and Action Network was created to provide local health departments in Florida with training and technical assistance through in-person and virtual activities, as well as access to events, opportunities, and resources to increase expertise and capacity to address healthy aging. AFPHS Network participants attended monthly learning activities to enhance their capacity around data analysis, health equity, partnerships and collaboration, social determinants of health, and other age-friendly initiatives. EVALUATION Network participants are being tracked on 13 key indicators to improve the health and well-being of older adults, including data collection and dissemination; ensuring emergency preparedness plans target older adults; and targeting older adult health needs in community health assessments. DISCUSSION Trust for America's Health's AFPHS initiative demonstrates that state and local public health departments have crucial roles to play to improve the health and well-being of older adults through data collection and analysis, collaboration with aging sector stakeholders, and adapting policies and programs to become age-friendly.","Wolfe, Megan; De Biasi, Anne; Carmody, Jane; Fulmer, Terry; Auerbach, John",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956295/,520
81539,Effects and results of fibrin sealant use in 1000 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy cases.,2017,"Air-purifying full-face masks, such as military chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear masks, might offer superior protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 compared to disposable polypropylene P2 or N95 masks. In addition, disposable masks are in short supply, while military chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear masks can be disinfected then reused. It is unknown whether such masks might be appropriate for civilians with minimal training in their use. Accordingly, we compared the Australian Defence Force in-service chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear Low Burden Mask (AirBoss Defense, Newmarket, Canada) with polypropylene N95 masks and non-occlusive glasses worn during simulated tasks performed by civilian clinicians in an Australian tertiary referral hospital intensive care unit. After brief training in the use of the Low Burden Mask, participants undertook a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Previous training with polypropylene N95 masks had been provided. Evaluation of 10 characteristics of each mask type were recorded, and time to mask application was assessed. Thirty-three participants tested the Low Burden Mask, and 28 evaluated polypropylene N95 masks and glasses. The Low Burden Mask was donned more quickly: mean time 7.0 (standard deviation 2.1) versus 18.3 (standard deviation 6.7) seconds; P = 0.0076. The Low Burden Mask was rated significantly higher in eight of the 10 assessed criteria, including ease of donning, comfort (initially and over a prolonged period), fogging, seal, safety while removing, confidence in protection, and overall. Visibility and communication ability were rated equally highly for both systems. We conclude that this air-purifying full-face mask is acceptable to clinicians in a civilian intensive care unit. It enhances staff confidence, reduces waste, and is likely to be a lower logistical burden during a prolonged pandemic. Formal testing of effectiveness is warranted.","Adamson, Steven; Carpenter, Hannah; Pang, George; Pincus, Jason M; Gregory, Bryan E; Reade, Michael C",Anaesthesia and intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1177/0310057x20984787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940939/,520

Analyze the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes. DESIGN Descriptive retrospective observational study. SETTING Mancha-Centro Hospital (Spain). MATERIAL AND METHODS Population: Symptomatic pregnant women with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Between the 12th of March and 17th of April 2020, all the symptomatic pregnancies were screened with diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. Data collection was done by reviewing the medical records and telephone interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical characteristics, management, treatment, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS Twenty patients with positive COVID-19 diagnostic test out of thirty-four suspected. The most common symptoms were fever (70%), cough (65%) and myalgia (35%). A unique symptom of presentation in 20% of cases. COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed in 30% by chest X-ray and one case had pulmonary embolism associated diagnosed by CT-Scan. Thromboprophylaxis was indicated in 16 out of 20 patients. Eight women finished their pregnancy during the observation period. Type of birth: 25% natural birth, 12.5% assisted vaginal delivery and 62.5% caesarean section. We had three severe cases, two of them with intensive care support. All neonates had negative test for COVID 19 infection. CONCLUSIONS We recommend universal screening of all pregnant woman for COVID-19 during the pandemic because of the limits of the symptomatic screening seen in this studio and the ratio of asymptomatic pregnancies with positive test for COVID-19 recently published.","Ortiz Molina, Elias; Hernandez Pailos, Rafael; Pola Guillen, Maria; Pascual Pedreno, Ana; Rodriguez Rodriguez, Eduardo; Hernandez Martinez, Antonio",Ginekologia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/gp.a2020.0130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447995/,520

82496,Single-port-access (SPA) cholecystectomy: a multi-institutional report of the first 297 cases.,2010,"Negative cofactor 2 (NC2), including two subunits NC2α and NC2β, is a conserved positive/negative regulator of class II gene transcription in eukaryotes. It is known that NC2 functions by regulating the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex. However, the exact role of NC2 in transcriptional regulation is still unclear. Here, we reveal that, in Neurospora crassa, NC2 activates catalase-3 (cat-3) gene transcription in the form of heterodimer mediated by histone fold (HF) domains of two subunits. Deletion of HF domain in either of two subunits disrupts the NC2α-NC2β interaction and the binding of intact NC2 heterodimer to cat-3 locus. Loss of NC2 dramatically increases histone variant H2A.Z deposition at cat-3 locus. Further studies show that NC2 recruits chromatin remodeling complex INO80C to remove H2A.Z from the nucleosomes around cat-3 locus, resulting in transcriptional activation of cat-3. Besides HF domains of two subunits, interestingly, C-terminal repression domain of NC2β is required not only for NC2 binding to cat-3 locus, but also for the recruitment of INO80C to cat-3 locus and removal of H2A.Z from the nucleosomes. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of NC2 in transcription activation through recruiting INO80C to remove H2A.Z from special H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.","Cui, Guofei; Dong, Qing; Duan, Jiabin; Zhang, Chengcheng; Liu, Xiao; He, Qun",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633757/,520

However, the effect of bisphenol AF (BPAF), a main substitute for BPA, on heart development remains unclear. In this study, the cardiotoxicity of BPAF was evaluated in zebrafish in vivo and in human cardiac myocytes (HCMs) in vitro. Our results showed that BPAF at a concentration of 200 μg/L results in cardiotoxicity, including a reduced number of cardiomyocytes and endocardial cells in the heart, and reduced heart size in two transgenic zebrafish models (myl7:: dsred2-nuc and fli1a::nGFP). An increase in apoptosis was observed along with antioxidant enzyme inhibition and lipid peroxidation. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of several key genes involved in cardiac development were suppressed by BPAF treatment. In the HCM cell model, BPAF at 2 mg/L induced reactive oxygen species generation, antioxidant enzyme inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative DNA damage. These adverse outcomes can be attenuated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in BPAF-induced cardiotoxicity. These data indicated that BPAF exposure increased oxidative stress and apoptosis and that it suppressed the expression of genes involved in cardiac development, which may play crucial roles in the mechanisms of BPAF-induced cardiotoxicity.","Gu, Jie; Wang, Hongye; Zhou, Linjun; Fan, Deling; Shi, Lili; Ji, Guixiang; Gu, Aihua",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408210/,520

People can be visually impaired from birth, childhood, early adulthood or later in life. Those with visual impairment are subject to health inequities and increased risk for patient safety incidents in comparison to the general population. They are also known to be at an increased risk of experiencing medication errors compared to those without visual impairment. In view of this, this review aims to understand the issues of medication safety for VI people. METHODS/DESIGN Four electronic bibliographic databases will be searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL. Our search strategy will include search combinations of two key blocks of terms. Studies will not be excluded based on design. Included studies will be empirical studies. They will include studies that relate to both medication safety and visual impairment. Two reviewers (SG and LR) will screen all the titles and abstracts. SG, LR, RM, SCS and PL will perform study selection and data extraction using standard forms. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or third party adjudication. Data to be collected will include study characteristics (year, objective, research method, setting, country), participant characteristics (number, age, gender, diagnoses), medication safety incident type and characteristics.

Association between RVI and continuous and categorical risk factors was assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact tests, respectively. Association between risk factors and outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Fifty-five subjects were followed for a mean of 674 days (range 14-1790). Twenty-eight (51%) developed 51 RVI at a median of 144 days post-transplant (mean 246; range 1-1276); 41% of infections were diagnosed within 90 days. Twenty-five subjects developed 39 LRI, and eight subjects had 11 URI. Organisms recovered included rhinovirus (n = 14), adenovirus (n = 10), parainfluenza (n = 10), influenza (n = 5), and RSV (n = 4). Three subjects expired secondary to their RVI (two adenovirus, one RSV). Younger age and prior CMV infection were risks for RVI (HR 2.4 95% CI 1.1-5.3 and 17.0; 3.0-96.2, respectively). RVI was not associated with the development of chronic allograft rejection (p = 0.25) or death during the study period. RVI occurs in the majority of pediatric lung transplant recipients, but was not associated with mortality or chronic allograft rejection.","Liu, M; Mallory, G B; Schecter, M G; Worley, S; Arrigain, S; Robertson, J; Elidemir, O; Danziger-Isakov, L A",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3046.2010.01296.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20214745/,520

AKI is part of a range of conditions summarized as acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), in which slow deterioration of kidney function or persistent kidney dysfunction is associated with an irreversible loss of kidney cells and nephrons, which can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). New biomarkers to identify injury before function loss await clinical implementation. AKI and AKD are a global concern. In low-income and middle-income countries, infections and hypovolaemic shock are the predominant causes of AKI. In high-income countries, AKI mostly occurs in elderly patients who are in hospital, and is related to sepsis, drugs or invasive procedures. Infection and trauma-related AKI and AKD are frequent in all regions. The large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. AKI management in critical care settings is challenging, including appropriate volume control, nephrotoxic drug management, and the timing and type of kidney support. Fluid and electrolyte management are essential. As AKI can be lethal, kidney replacement therapy is frequently required. AKI has a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Long-term consequences of AKI and AKD include CKD and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, prevention and early detection of AKI are essential.","Kellum, John A; Romagnani, Paola; Ashuntantang, Gloria; Ronco, Claudio; Zarbock, Alexander; Anders, Hans-Joachim",Nature reviews.

The use of cannabinoids for alleviation of motor symptoms has been extensively explored in pre-clinical studies. Objective We aim to systematically review and meta-analyze literature on the use of medical cannabis or its derivatives (MC) in PD patients to determine its effect on motor function and its safety profile. Methods We reviewed and analyzed original, full-text randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Primary outcomes were change in motor function and dyskinesia. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and side effects. All studies were analyzed for risk of bias. Results Fifteen studies, including six RCTs, were analyzed. Of these, 12/15 (80%) mention concomitant treatment with antiparkinsonian medications, most commonly levodopa. Primary outcomes were most often measured using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) among RCTs and patient self-report of symptom improvement was widely used among observational studies. Most of the observational data lacking appropriate controls had effect estimates favoring the intervention. However, the controlled studies demonstrated no significant motor symptom improvement overall. The meta-analysis of three RCTs, including a total of 83 patients, did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in UPDRS III score variation (MD -0.21, 95% CI -4.15 to 3.72; p = 0.92) with MC use. Only one study reported statistically significant improvement in dyskinesia (p < 0.05). The intervention was generally well tolerated. All RCTs had a high risk of bias. Conclusion Although observational studies establish subjective symptom alleviation and interest in MC among PD patients, there is insufficient evidence to support its integration into clinical practice for motor symptom treatment. This is primarily due to lack of good quality data.","Thanabalasingam, Susan J; Ranjith, Brandan; Jackson, Robyn; Wijeratne, Don Thiwanka",Therapeutic advances in neurological disorders,https://doi.org/10.1177/17562864211018561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104218/,520

In appropriately selected patients, circumferential liposuction is the procedure of choice. The objective of this study is to describe our experience with the four-position four-entry site circumferential arm liposuction technique. METHODS All consecutive circumferential liposuction procedures that took place at our ambulatory surgical facility from January 2015 to November 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The four-position four-entry site circumferential arm liposuction technique is described, and photographs as well as videos are presented. RESULTS A total of 35 patients underwent circumferential bilateral arm liposuction via the four-position four-entry site technique. All patients were female, and their average age was 43 years. The average BMI was 28.4 kg/m2, and the average follow-up was 481 days. The average volume of lipoaspirate was 1,514 ml per patient, and the average volume of aspirated fat was 1,052 ml per patient. There was no incident of infection, seroma, bleeding event or venous thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS For the right candidate, the four-entry site four-position circumferential arm liposuction is an efficient and reproducible technique, which produces predictable and pleasing results.

AIMS To describe the clinical characteristics, outcomes 30 days after onset of symptoms and in-hospital mortality of a cohort of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in a Swiss area. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we included all inpatients hospitalised with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March and 12 April 2020 in the public hospital network of a Swiss area (Fribourg). Demographic data, comorbidities and outcomes were recorded. Rate of potential hospital-acquired infection, outcomes 30 days after onset of symptoms and in-hospital mortality are reported. RESULTS One hundred ninety-six patients were included in the study. In our population, 119 (61%) were male and the median age was 70 years. Forty-nine patients (25%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The rate of potential hospital-acquired infection was 7%. Overall, 30 days after onset of symptoms 117 patients (60%) had returned home, 23 patients (12%) were in a rehabilitation facility, 18 patients (9%) in a medical ward, 6 patients (3%) in ICU and 32 (16%) patients had died. Among patients who returned home within 30 days, 73 patients (63%) reported persistent symptoms. The overall in-hospital mortality was 17%. CONCLUSION We report the first cohort of Swiss patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Thirty days after onset of the symptoms, 60% had returned home. Among them, 63% still presented symptoms. Studies with longer follow-up are needed to document long-term outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.","Pellaud, Charlotte; Grandmaison, Gael; Hoa Phong, Pham Huu Thien; Baumberger, Marine; Carrel, Guillaume; Ksouri, Hatem; Erard, Véronique; Chuard, Christian; Hayoz, Daniel; Sridharan, Govind",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662869/,520
84693,"The Effect of sevoflurane, desflurane and propofol on respiratory mechanics and integrated pulmonary index scores in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. A randomized trial.",2019-12-01,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was the evaluation of the clinical and radiologic outcomes of parallel grafts in the treatment of patients with failed prior endovascular aneurysm repair and type Ia endoleak. METHODS Prospectively collected clinical and radiologic data of consecutive patients with prior endovascular aneurysm repair and evidence of type Ia endoleak were analyzed. All patients were treated between January 2009 and November 2014 by use of parallel grafts, ie, chimney/snorkel or periscope grafts and abdominal endovascular devices. Primary outcome of the study was the technical success. Secondary outcomes were patency of the chimney grafts and shrinkage of aneurysm morphology. RESULTS Technical success was 94.4% (17 of 18). One patient showed evidence of persistent type Ia endoleak after triple chimney graft placement and treated by Onyx embolization (Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) successfully. The mean preoperative and postoperative aneurysm diameters were 7.1 ± 1.7 and 7.0 ± 2 cm. Primary patency of the chimney grafts was 96.7% and assisted patency was 100% after successful retrograde recanalization of an acute occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery from the celiac trunk and the gastroduodenal artery. One patient who had undergone the sandwich technique with transfemoral placement of the flexible Viabahn (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) due to impossible catheterization of the target vessel from the upper extremity presented with contained rupture caused by gutter-associated endoleak and underwent urgent embolization with Onyx successfully. No procedure-related death or open conversion was observed in the entire follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Use of parallel grafts showed midterm safety and feasibility with low incidence of persistent endoleaks requiring intervention or progression of aneurysm diameter. Reproducible results from other vascular centers will establish the chimney technique in the treatment of type I endoleaks as a viable endovascular modality.","Donas, Konstantinos P; Telve, Diego; Torsello, Giovanni; Pitoulias, Georgios; Schwindt, Arne; Austermann, Martin",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.04.395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26087878/,520

Method An eye and computer mouse-tracking visual-world paradigm was used to investigate how a listener's cognitive effort (local and global) and decision-making processes were affected by a speaker's use of ambiguity that led to a miscommunication. Results Experiments 1 and 2 found that an environmental cue that made a miscommunication more or less salient impacted listener language processing effort (eye-tracking). Experiment 2 also indicated that listeners may develop different processing heuristics dependent upon the speaker's use of ambiguity that led to a miscommunication, exerting a significant impact on cognition and decision making. We also found that perspective-taking effort and decision-making complexity metrics (computer mouse tracking) predict language processing effort, indicating that instances of miscommunication produced cognitive consequences of indecision, thinking, and cognitive pull. Conclusion Together, these results indicate that listeners behave both reciprocally and adaptively when miscommunications occur, but the way they respond is largely dependent upon the type of ambiguity and how often it is produced by the speaker.","Roche, Jennifer M; Zgonnikov, Arkady; Morett, Laura M","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_jslhr-20-00128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400552/,520
84782,Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) with gastric plication: short-term results and comparison with LAGB alone and sleeve gastrectomy.,2015,"Positive-strand RNA viruses induce the biogenesis of unique membranous organelles, called viral replication organelles (VROs), which perform virus replication in infected cells. Tombusviruses have been shown to rewire cellular trafficking and metabolic pathways, remodel host membranes and recruit multiple host factors to support viral replication. In this work, we demonstrate that tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and the closely-related carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) usurp Rab7 small GTPase to facilitate building VROs in the surrogate host yeast and in plants. Depletion of Rab7 small GTPase, which is needed for late endosome and retromer biogenesis, strongly inhibits TBSV and CIRV replication in yeast and in planta. The viral p33 replication protein interacts with Rab7 small GTPase, which results in relocalization of Rab7 into the large VROs. Similar to depletion of Rab7, deletion of either MON1 or CCZ1 heterodymeric GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) of Rab7, inhibited TBSV repRNA replication in yeast. This suggests that the activated Rab7 has pro-viral functions. We show that the pro-viral function of Rab7 is to facilitate the recruitment of the retromer complex and the endosomal sorting nexin-BAR proteins into VROs. We demonstrate that TBSV p33-driven retargeting Rab7 into VROs results in delivery of several retromer cargos with pro-viral functions. These proteins include lipid enzymes, such as Vps34 PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), PI4Kα-like Stt4 (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase) and Psd2 phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. In summary, based on these and previous findings, we propose that subversion of Rab7 into VROs allows tombusviruses to reroute endocytic and recycling trafficking to support virus replication. Importance: Replication of positive-strand RNA viruses depends on the biogenesis of viral replication organelles (VROs). However, formation of membranous VROs is not well understood yet. Using tombusviruses and the model host yeast, the authors discovered that the endosomal Rab7 small GTPase is critical for the formation of VROs. Interaction between Rab7 and the TBSV p33 replication protein leads to the recruitment of Rab7 into VROs. TBSV-driven usurping of Rab7 has pro-viral functions through facilitating the delivery of co-opted retromer complex, sorting nexin-BAR proteins and lipid enzymes into VROs to create optimal milieu for virus replication. These results open up the possibility that controlling cellular Rab7 activities in infected cells could be a target for new antiviral strategies.","Feng, Zhike; Inaba, Jun-Ichi; Nagy, Peter D",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01076-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406861/,520

The number of patients who required critical care quickly outpaced the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Consequently, health care systems had to creatively expand critical care services into alternative hospital locations with repurposed staff and equipment. Deploying anesthesia workstations to the ICU to serve as mechanical ventilators requires equipment preparation, multidisciplinary planning, and targeted education. We aim to contextualize this process, highlighting major differences between anesthesia workstations and ICU ventilators, and to share the insights gained from our experiences creating an anesthesia provider-based ventilator management team.","Canelli, Robert; Spence, Nicole; Kumar, Nisha; Rodriguez, Gerardo; Gonzalez, Mauricio",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620942097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677498/,520

This study investigated type I IFN antagonist mechanism of PLpro in human promonocytes. PLpro antagonized IFN-α-induced responses such as interferon-stimulated response element- and AP-1-driven promoter activation, protein kinase R, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 expression, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 (Tyr701), STAT1 (Ser727) and c-Jun phosphorylation. A proteomics approach demonstrated downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and upregulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) E2-25k as inhibitory mechanism of PLpro on IFN-α-induced responses. IFN-α treatment significantly induced mRNA expression of UBC E2-25k, but not ERK1, causing time-dependent decrease of ERK1, but not ERK2, in PLpro-expressing cells. Poly-ubiquitination of ERK1 showed a relationship between ERK1 and ubiquitin proteasome signalling pathways associated with IFN antagonism by PLpro. Combination treatment of IFN-α and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 showed a time-dependent restoration of ERK1 protein levels and significant increase of ERK1, STAT1 and c-Jun phosphorylation in PLpro-expressing cells. Importantly, PD098059 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) treatment significantly reduced IFN-α-induced ERK1 and STAT1 phosphorylation, inhibiting IFN-α-induced expression of 2'-5'-OAS in vector control cells and PLpro-expressing cells. Overall results proved downregulation of ERK1 by ubiquitin proteasomes and suppression of interaction between ERK1 and STAT1 as type I IFN antagonist function of SARS-CoV PLpro.","Li, Shih-Wein; Lai, Chien-Chen; Ping, Jia-Fong; Tsai, Fuu-Jen; Wan, Lei; Lin, Ying-Ju; Kung, Szu-Hao; Lin, Cheng-Wen",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.028936-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21270289/,520

86563,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)-a good bariatric option for failed laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB): a review of 90 patients.,2013,"We investigated the role of microRNA-21 in the macrophage response to peritonitis; microRNA-21 expression increases in peritoneal macrophages after lipopolysaccharide stimulation but is delayed until 48 hours after cecal ligation and puncture. MicroRNA-21-null mice and bone marrow-derived cell lines were exposed to cecal ligation and puncture or lipopolysaccharide, and survival, microRNA-21 levels, target messenger RNAs and proteins, and cytokines were assayed. Macrophages were also transfected with microRNA-21 mimics and antagomirs, and similar endpoints were measured. Survival in microRNA-21-null mice was significantly decreased after lipopolysaccharide-induced peritonitis but unchanged after cecal ligation and puncture compared with similarly treated wild-type mice. MicroRNA-21 expression, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, and programmed cell death protein 4 levels were increased after lipopolysaccharide addition in peritoneal cells. Pelino1 and sprouty (SPRY) messenger RNAs were similarly increased early, whereas programmed cell death protein 4 messenger RNA was decreased after lipopolysaccharide, and all microR-21 target messenger RNAs were subsequently decreased by 24 hours after lipopolysaccharide. Transfection with mimics and antagomirs led to appropriate responses in microRNA-21 and tumor necrosis factor-α. Knockdown of microRNA-21 in bone marrow-derived cells showed increased tumor necrosis factor-α and decreased interleukin 10 in response to lipopolysaccharide. Target proteins were unaffected by knockdown as was extracellular signal-regulated kinase; however, the nuclear factor κB p65 subunit was increased after lipopolysaccharide in the microRNA-21 knockout cells. In contrast, there was little change in these parameters after cecal ligation and puncture induction between null and wild-type mice. MicroRNA-21 is beneficial to survival in mice following lipopolysaccharide peritonitis. Overexpression of microRNA-21 decreased tumor necrosis factor-α secretion, whereas suppression of microRNA-21 expression increased tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 6, and decreased interleukin 10 levels after lipopolysaccharide. Protein targets of microRNA-21 were not different following suppression of microRNA-21. Nuclear factor κB was increased by suppression of microRNA-21. These findings demonstrate microRNA-21 is beneficial in modulating the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide peritonitis and an improved understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of microRNA-21 may result in novel, targeted therapy against peritonitis and sepsis.","Barnett, Rebecca Elise; Conklin, Daniel J; Ryan, Lindsey; Keskey, Robert C; Ramjee, Vikram; Sepulveda, Ernesto A; Srivastava, Sanjay; Bhatnagar, Aruni; Cheadle, William G",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.4a1014-489r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26382295/,520

Theoretically, acute treatment with a flow-diversion device may offer a reasonable treatment option to prevent future bleeding and to remodel the diseased vessel segment. The authors identified two patients who underwent emergent treatment with the placement of a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the setting of an acute rebleeding of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm previously treated with clip reconstruction. The first patient was a 50-year-old woman who underwent clip reconstruction for a broad-based right anterior choroidal artery aneurysm measuring approximately 2×8 mm. Clip reconstruction was achieved with a single fenestrated clip. On day 14, the patient experienced a rebleeding episode. She underwent emergent treatment with a single PED but experienced another rebleeding and died. The second patient was a 53-year-old woman who presented with a ruptured dorsal variant blister aneurysm, which was treated with clip reconstruction. On day 22, she experienced a rebleeding episode and underwent emergent treatment using two PEDs in a duplicative fashion. After the procedure, she experienced another acute rebleeding episode and died. The treatment of reruptured intracranial aneurysms in a salvage fashion with emergent placement of PEDs in two patients resulted in good technical placement of the device covering the neck of the aneurysm, yet both patients experienced additional rebleeding and did not survive. Future generations of flow diverters may have more appropriate properties that would allow their use as salvage treatment in the setting of acutely ruptured aneurysms.","Kilburg, Craig J; Park, Min S; Kalani, Yashar; Taussky, Philipp",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.6137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31737462/,520

The key to smoothly performing SPLS lies in understanding the formation in which the shaft conflict is minimized. However, there have been no reported studies on conflict reduction in SPLS from a shaft formation perspective. METHODS When performing SPLS, 3 instruments are passed into a narrow space, only 2 patterns of shaft formation can be obtained: a formation in which the 3 instruments rotate clockwise or counterclockwise (rotation formation) or a formation in which 1 instrument passes between the other 2 (cross formation). So motion spaces of the instruments in rotation formation compared with that in cross formation were tested using engineering methods. The range of the forceps' motion was assumed to be the space covered by the forceps till collision occurred between the moving forceps and either the other fixed forceps or the fixed scope. Examination of the range of movement of the scope was conducted in the same manner. The motion space with the area on the x-y horizontal is evaluated, as viewed from the peritoneal umbilicus port entry area. RESULTS The motion area of each instrument in rotation formation is 1.9 to 2.6 times wider than that in cross formation. CONCLUSIONS Rotation formation provides high degree of freedom of motion for SPLS.","Kawamura, Hideki; Ishii, Chiharu","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31825502a3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22874693/,520

The objectives of this review were to describe: 1) the contexts where bridging has occurred in relation to delivery of health services for adults aging with neurological or developmental conditions; and 2) characterize and map bridging tasks, stakeholders involved, and outcomes discussed in peer-reviewed literature. METHODS Seven databases were searched around the core concepts of ""bridging,"" ""aging,"" and ""disability."" In total, 10,819 articles were screened with 49 meeting the inclusion criteria of discussing aging with developmental or neurological disability, explicitly describing bridging tasks, published in English and a peer-reviewed publication. Bibliographic information, sample characteristics, and data on bridging was extracted and included in the qualitative synthesis. RESULTS Intellectual and/or Developmental disabilities were the most studied population (76% of articles), and most articles were published in the United States (57%). Twenty-two bridging tasks were identified, and categorized into three domains: health and social service delivery (e.g., care coordination tasks), policy (e.g., policy change), and research and training (e.g., mentoring). Stakeholders involved ranged from health care professionals to policy makers and organizations in aging and disability services. CONCLUSIONS The resulting matrix will assist in the specification of bridging in research and practice.

88268,Frequency distribution of weight loss percentage after gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding.,2008,"Background The study of climate and respiratory viral infections using big data may enable the recognition and interpretation of causal relationships between disease occurrence and climatic variables. Methods In this study, real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were used to identify Human respiratory coronaviruses (HCoV). infections in patients below 10 years of age with respiratory infections who visited Dankook University Hospital in Cheonan, South Korea, from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Out of the 9010 patients who underwent respiratory virus real-time reverse transcription qPCR test, 364 tested positive for HCoV infections. Among these 364 patients, 72.8% (n = 265) were below 10 years of age. Data regarding the frequency of infections was used to uncover the seasonal pattern of the two viral strains, which was then compared with local meteorological data for the same time period. Results HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 showed high infection rates in patients below 10 years of age. There was a negative relationship between HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections with air temperature and wind-chill temperatures.

88392,Fistula Following Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Proposed Classification and Algorithm for Optimal Management.,2018,"Motile cilia lining the nasal and bronchial passages beat synchronously to clear mucus and foreign matter from the respiratory tract. This mucociliary defense mechanism is essential for pulmonary health, because respiratory ciliary motion defects, such as those in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or congenital heart disease, can cause severe sinopulmonary disease necessitating organ transplant. The visual examination of nasal or bronchial biopsies is critical for the diagnosis of ciliary motion defects, but these analyses are highly subjective and error-prone. Although ciliary beat frequency can be computed, this metric cannot sensitively characterize ciliary motion defects. Furthermore, PCD can present without any ultrastructural defects, limiting the use of other detection methods, such as electron microscopy. Therefore, an unbiased, computational method for analyzing ciliary motion is clinically compelling. We present a computational pipeline using algorithms from computer vision and machine learning to decompose ciliary motion into quantitative elemental components. Using this framework, we constructed digital signatures for ciliary motion recognition and quantified specific properties of the ciliary motion that allowed high-throughput classification of ciliary motion as normal or abnormal. We achieved >90% classification accuracy in two independent data cohorts composed of patients with congenital heart disease, PCD, or heterotaxy, as well as healthy controls. Clinicians without specialized knowledge in machine learning or computer vision can operate this pipeline as a ""black box"" toolkit to evaluate ciliary motion.","Quinn, Shannon P; Zahid, Maliha J; Durkin, John R; Francis, Richard J; Lo, Cecilia W; Chennubhotla, S Chakra",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa1233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246169/,520

Although semiconductor/perovskite heterostructure holds great promise for enhancement in absorption, it has remained a serious challenge for synthesizing semiconductor/perovskite heterostructure. In this work, monodispersed Janus heterostructures composed of Cs4PbBr6 decorated with either multiple Ag or single Ag on its surface (named as mAg/Cs4PbBr6 and sAg/Cs4PbBr6) respectively), are successfully prepared. The size of Ag seeds has an important effect on the shape of the products. Small-sized Ag seeds lead to the formation of mAg/Cs4PbBr6 Janus NCs, while relatively large-sized Ag seeds produce sAg/Cs4PbBr6 Janus NCs. It is noted that this work not only provides a novel method for the modification of individual Cs4PbBr6 NCs, but also enhances the absorption of the Cs4PbBr6 in the visible region, indicating great potential for optoelectronic applications, such as photocatalysis and solar cells.","Su, Sijing; Shen, Jialin; Sun, Haochen; Tao, Jiaqi; Xu, Da; Wei, Tong; Fan, Chao; Wang, Ziying; Sun, Chun; Bi, Wengang",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/abb905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937614/,520

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 10) with naturally occurring splenic disease. METHODS Medical records (March 2012-March 2013) of dogs that had MLS were reviewed. Data retrieved included signalment, weight, clinical signs, physical examination findings, preoperative laboratory and ultrasonographic findings, port number, size, and location, patient positioning, additional procedures performed, surgical duration, histopathologic diagnosis, duration of hospitalization, and perioperative complications. RESULTS Ten dogs (median weight, 28.7 kg; range, 20.2-46.0 kg) had MLS using a 3 or 4 port technique and a vessel-sealing device for tissue dissection along the splenic hilus. Dog positioning varied because of additional laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted procedures including adrenalectomy (n = 2), ovariectomy (1), gastropexy (1), and intestinal resection and anastomosis (1). Conversion to an open approach was necessary in 1 dog because of inadequate visibility caused by omental adhesions. One dog had hemorrhage from an omental vessel, but open conversion was not required. CONCLUSIONS MLS was associated with little perioperative morbidity and few complications in this cohort of dogs and may be a reasonable option for surgical management of dogs requiring elective splenectomy.","Shaver, Stephanie L; Mayhew, Philipp D; Steffey, Michele A; Hunt, Geraldine B; Mayhew, Kelli N; Culp, William T N",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2014.12312.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25522804/,520

The aim of this study was to evaluate the duration of remission and predictors of relapse in UC patients who achieved clinical remission and mucosal healing by 6-week treatment with topical budesonide. METHODS This is a retrospective, observational, multicenter study with a 2-year follow-up period. UC patients who were treated with budesonide foam in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials and achieved both clinical remission and mucosal healing were enrolled. RESULTS Among 84 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 60 participated in the study. Eighteen of the 60 patients (30.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.9-43.2) experienced no relapse (i.e., maintenance of remission) during the 2-year follow-up period. The median relapse-free survival time was 0.82 years (95% CI: 0.51-1.52). Of 37 patients with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 after inducing remission with budesonide foam, 25 (67.6%) relapsed within 2 years. Patients with a disease duration of <1 year experienced a worse clinical outcome than patients with a disease duration of >5 years, and the hazard ratio was 2.38 (95% CI: 1.04-5.45). CONCLUSION This is the first study to evaluate the short- to middle-term prognosis in UC patients who achieved mucosal healing with topical preparations. After inducing remission by budesonide foam, treatment for maintaining remissions and strict follow-up may be needed for patients with shorter disease duration.","Naganuma, Makoto; Hirai, Fumihito; Kobayashi, Kiyonori; Watanabe, Kenji; Takeuchi, Ken; Aoyama, Nobuo; Nozawa, Hiroshi; Motoya, Satoshi; Ohmori, Toshihide; Harada, Akio; Nagai, Yushi; Abe, Takayuki; Yamada, Yoji; Inagaki, Katsutoshi; Shimizu, Naoki; Kanai, Takanori; Watanabe, Mamoru",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381615/,520

Comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted antiviral Ab response is critical for diagnosis, differentiation of severity, and characterization of long-term immunity, especially as COVID-19 vaccines become available. Severe disease is associated with early, massive plasmablast responses. We developed a multiplex immunoassay from serum/plasma of acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients and prepandemic and postpandemic healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike domain 1 (S1), S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1-N-terminal domain. For diagnosis, the combined [IgA + IgG + IgM] or IgG levels measured for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded area under the curve values ≥0.90. Virus-specific Ig levels were higher in patients with severe/critical compared with mild/moderate infections. A strong prozone effect was observed in sera from severe/critical patients-a possible source of underestimated Ab concentrations in previous studies. Mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared with severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 mo after symptom onset. Measurement of the Ab responses in sera from 18 COVID-19-vaccinated patients revealed specific responses for the S1-RBD Ag and none against the N protein. This highly sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific, multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity, and kinetics of the Ab response and can distinguish serum Ab responses from natural SARS-CoV-2 infections (mild or severe) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.","Haddad, Natalie S; Nguyen, Doan C; Kuruvilla, Merin E; Morrison-Porter, Andrea; Anam, Fabliha; Cashman, Kevin S; Ramonell, Richard P; Kyu, Shuya; Saini, Ankur Singh; Cabrera-Mora, Monica; Derrico, Andrew; Alter, David; Roback, John D; Horwath, Michael; O'Keefe, James B; Wu, Henry M; Wong, An-Kwok Ian; Dretler, Alexandra W; Gripaldo, Ria; Lane, Andrea N; Wu, Hao; Chu, Helen Y; Lee, Saeyun; Hernandez, Mindy; Engineer, Vanessa; Varghese, John; Patel, Rahul; Jalal, Anum; French, Victoria; Guysenov, Ilya; Lane, Christopher E; Mengistsu, Tesfaye; Normile, Katherine Elizabeth; Mnzava, Onike; Le, Sang; Sanz, Ignacio; Daiss, John L; Lee, F Eun-Hyung",ImmunoHorizons,https://doi.org/10.4049/immunohorizons.2100011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001652/,520

The diversity of current delivery materials remains limited, in part because of their slow, multi-step syntheses. Here we describe a new class of lipid-like delivery molecules, termed lipidoids, as delivery agents for RNAi therapeutics. Chemical methods were developed to allow the rapid synthesis of a large library of over 1,200 structurally diverse lipidoids. From this library, we identified lipidoids that facilitate high levels of specific silencing of endogenous gene transcripts when formulated with either double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) or single-stranded antisense 2'-O-methyl (2'-OMe) oligoribonucleotides targeting microRNA (miRNA). The safety and efficacy of lipidoids were evaluated in three animal models: mice, rats and nonhuman primates.

Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases of Cryptosporidium are probably involved in the regulation of invasion and egress process during the infection of the host cells. The previous study reported that after the Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 1 gene, Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 6 of Cryptosporidium parvum is expressed in all stages of the parasite (merozoites/schizonts as well as sexual stages) at a comparable level and makes it as a valid drug target. In this study, an attempt is made to address the similarity in sequences and phylogenetic study of Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 6 (CDPK6) among Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases of Apicomplexans. Further, the three-dimensional structure determination of CDPK6 of C. parvum was performed through a molecular modeling approach followed by virtual screening of small-molecule inhibitors from different datasets. The best inhibitor from Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set with ID 11730 reported a binding affinity of -8.2 kcal/mol against CDPK6 of C. parvum. Furthermore, the reliability of the binding mode of the inhibitor is validated through a complex molecular dynamics simulation study for a time interval of 100 ns. The simulation study advocates that the inhibitor Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set_11730 formed a stable interaction with the predicted active site residues and can be considered for industrial pharmaceutical research in future.

89920,"Randomized clinical trial of mesh fixation with ""double crown"" versus ""sutures and tackers"" in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.",2013,"BACKGROUND Observational series suggest a mortality benefit from metformin in the heart failure (HF) population. However, the benefit of metformin in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has yet to be explored. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify whether variation in EF impacts mortality outcomes in HF patients treated with metformin. METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to October 2019. Observational studies and randomised trials reporting mortality in HF patients and the proportion of patients with an EF > 50% at baseline were included. Other baseline variables were used to assess for heterogeneity in treatment outcomes between groups. Regression models were used to determine the interaction between metformin and subgroups on mortality. RESULTS Four studies reported the proportion of patients with a preserved EF and were analysed. Metformin reduced mortality in both preserved or reduced EF after adjustment with HF therapies such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers (β = - 0.2 [95% CI - 0.3 to - 0.1], p = 0.02). Significantly greater protective effects were seen with EF > 50% (p = 0.003). Metformin treatment with insulin, ACEi and beta-blocker therapy were also shown to have a reduction in mortality (insulin p = 0.002; ACEi p < 0.001; beta-blocker p = 0.017), whereas female gender was associated with worse outcomes (p < 0.001).

Occasionally, the traditional methods - such as pelvic gauze packing and the use of metallic thumbtacks - are not effective. When combined with their complications and difficulties, these failures have resulted in numerous creative procedures with which to control this complication. In 1994, the indirect electrocoagulation method, which is performed via a fragment of the rectus abdominis muscle of the abdomen, was introduced to control presacral venous bleeding. METHODS From January 2002 to December 2015, five of 872 patients with rectal cancer and one patient with rectal metastasis of gastric cancer developed presacral venous bleeding, and this technique was used in every case. RESULTS Haemostasis was permanent in all cases. There were no complications such as infection or rebleeding.

Liver impairment has been reported in up to 54% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on a preexisting chronic liver disease is an actively studied area of research. The contribution of our study is towards determining the predictors of severity and the outcome of liver injury among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with a preexisting liver disease and COVID-19. METHODS This single center retrospective cohort study included all patients ≥18 years, admitted in Sheba Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained using the MDClone platform and rechecked after data decryption using electronic health records. RESULTS Of 382 patients with COVID-19, 66.4% had increased liver biochemistry. Mild increase was observed in 76.7%. The higher level of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) at admission was independently associated with higher mortality rate. Preexisting liver disease was detected in 15.4% patients. Most common etiology was nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (78.7%). The mortality of hospitalized patients with preexisting liver disease was 16.7% compared to 6.8% in patients without preexisting liver disease (RR = 2.792, P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, liver disease adjusted to age and BMI was associated with mortality with high statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Patients with preexisting chronic liver disease were at a higher risk of mortality. The FIB-4 level at admission was associated with worse prognosis.

The resulting erythrocyte deformation causes mechanical obstruction of blood flow by sickled cells, hemolysis, anemia and end-organ injury. While pain is the hallmark symptom of SCD, chronic organ injury as a result of anemia, inflammation and progressive vasculopathy play a major role in morbidity and mortality. Due to the complex pathophysiology of SCD, the need for an individualized, multi-modal pharmacologic approach is apparent. Until 2018, hydroxyurea was the only disease-modifying pharmacologic therapy approved for use in SCD. Since then, three new agents have been approved including voxelotor, the subject of this review. Areas covered: Published pre-clinical and clinical data are reviewed. Voxelotor is a first-in-class small molecule agent that binds to Hb and increases oxygen affinity, preventing polymerization. Recent clinical trials have shown that it increases Hb concentration and reduces hemolysis in patients with SCD. This increase in Hb concentration may significantly impact morbidity and mortality from chronic organ injury. Expert opinion: The mechanism of action, published studies, and current opinions on the clinical use of voxelotor in SCD are presented.","Vissa, Madhav; Vichinsky, Elliott",Expert review of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2021.1893688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602029/,520

The quantity of grafted HSPG was in the nanogram range (11 nanograms per cm of capillary length). This is of significant importance when working with less available or expensive biological material. Other advantages of our miniaturized capillary column are as follows: (i) the immobilization process of HSPG onto the organic monolithic support was reliable and reproducible. (ii) The resultant affinity capillary column showed a strong resistance to changes in temperature and pH and a negligible non-specific interaction.

Whether infections with specific viral pathogens confer differential future asthma risk is incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES To define the relationship between specific viral illnesses and early childhood asthma development. METHODS A total of 259 children were followed prospectively from birth to 6 years of age. The etiology and timing of specific viral wheezing respiratory illnesses during early childhood were assessed using nasal lavage, culture, and multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The relationships of these virus-specific wheezing illnesses and other risk factors to the development of asthma were analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Viral etiologies were identified in 90% of wheezing illnesses. From birth to age 3 years, wheezing with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (odds ratio [OR], 2.6), rhinovirus (RV) (OR, 9.8), or both RV and RSV (OR , 10) was associated with increased asthma risk at age 6 years. In Year 1, both RV wheezing (OR, 2.8) and aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 3.6) independently increased asthma risk at age 6 years. By age 3 years, wheezing with RV (OR, 25.6) was more strongly associated with asthma at age 6 years than aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 3.4). Nearly 90% (26 of 30) of children who wheezed with RV in Year 3 had asthma at 6 years of age.

As such, new treatments are needed to protect the myocardium against the damaging effects of the acute ischaemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) that occurs in AMI, in order to reduce myocardial infarct (MI) size, preserve cardiac function, and improve patient outcomes. In this regard, cardiac mitochondria play a dual role as arbiters of cell survival and death following AMI. Therefore, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction induced by acute myocardial IRI is an important therapeutic strategy for cardioprotection. In this article, we review the role of mitochondria as key determinants of acute myocardial IRI, and we highlight their roles as therapeutic targets for reducing MI size and preventing HF following AMI. In addition, we discuss the challenges in translating mitoprotective strategies into the clinical setting for improving outcomes in AMI patients.","Ramachandra, Chrishan J A; Hernandez-Resendiz, Sauri; Crespo-Avilan, Gustavo E; Lin, Ying-Hsi; Hausenloy, Derek J",EBioMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32653860/,520
91279,Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in a Patient With Situs Inversus Totalis and Kartagener Syndrome.,2021-08-01,"PURPOSE Adolescents are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 quarantine periods and may be at risk for developing psychological distress symptoms that extend beyond a crisis, including depression. This study examined adolescents' postquarantine depressive symptoms associated with pandemic stressors. The primary aim was to identify potential protective factors that may buffer the association between the presence of COVID-19 cases in adolescents' communities and their postquarantine depressive symptoms. METHODS Adolescents from public schools were recruited from Zhengzhou city, Henan, China (N = 1,487, Mage=13.14 years, 50% girls). Adolescents reported the presence of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in their communities, their daily activities and routines during the 2-month quarantine period, and depressive symptoms after the quarantine period. RESULTS The presence of cases in adolescents' communities during the quarantine contributed to more depressive symptoms in adolescents after the quarantine. This association was buffered by adolescents' spending more time on physical activities and better maintenance of daily living routines during the quarantine period. The presence of community infection was also more strongly associated with depressive symptoms in older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS The presence of COVID-19 cases in communities contributed to adolescents' poorer mental health, and the association was stronger for older adolescents. Spending time on physical activities and maintaining daily living routines during the quarantine appear to be practical strategies that can be used by adolescents to mitigate the association between pandemic stressors and their diminishing mental health.","Ren, Huiguang; He, Xing; Bian, Xiaohua; Shang, Xinhua; Liu, Junsheng",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33121902/,520

92050,"Prospective, randomized-controlled trial comparing postoperative pain after plug and patch open repair with totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair.",2014,"The world is currently embroiled in a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The severity of COVID-19 disease ranges from asymptomatic to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In few patients, the disease undergoes phenotypic differentiation between 7-14 days of acute illness, either resulting in full recovery or symptom escalation. However, the mechanism of such variation is not clear, but the facts suggest that patient's immune status, co-morbidities, and the systemic effects of the viral infection (potentially depending on the SARS-CoV-2 strain involved) play a key role. Subsequently, patients with the most severe symptoms tend to have poor outcomes, manifest severe hypoxia, and possess elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) along with elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, marked lymphopenia, and elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios. Based on the available evidence, we propose a mechanism wherein SARS-CoV-2 infection induces direct organ damage while also fueling an IL-6-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and hypoxia, resulting in escalating systemic inflammation, multi-organ damage, and end-organ failure. Elevated IL-6 and hypoxia together predisposes patients to pulmonary hypertension, and the presence of asymptomatic hypoxia in COVID-19 further compounds this problem. Due to the similar downstream mediators, we discuss the potential synergistic effects and systemic ramifications of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus during co-infection, a phenomenon we have termed ""COVI-Flu."" Additionally, the differences between CRS and cytokine storm are highlighted. Finally, novel management approaches, clinical trials, and therapeutic strategies toward both SARS-CoV-2 and COVI-Flu infection are discussed, highlighting host response optimization and systemic inflammation reduction.","Leyfman, Yan; Erick, Timothy K; Reddy, Sandeep S; Galwankar, Sagar; Nanayakkara, Prabath W B; Di Somma, Salvatore; Sharma, Pushpa; Stawicki, Stanislaw P; Chaudry, Irshad H",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649367/,520

In addition to infecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 also has adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. COVID-19 causes acute myocardial injuries, as well as chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. AREAS COVERED The present review is aimed at providing current information on COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. PubMed, Scopus, Science direct and Google Scholar were searched. EXPERT OPINION It is suggested that heart injury caused by COVID-19 infection might be an important cause of severe clinical phenotypes or adverse events in affected patients. Myocardial damage is closely related to the severity of the disease and even the prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition to disorders that are caused by COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, more protection should be employed for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hence, it is very important that once relevant symptoms appear, patients with COVID-19 be rapidly treated to reduce mortality. Thus, early measurements of cardiac damage via biomarkers following hospitalization for COVID-19 infections in patient with pre-existing CVD is recommended, together with careful monitoring of any myocardial injury that might be caused by the infection.","Tajbakhsh, Amir; Gheibi Hayat, Seyed Mohammad; Taghizadeh, Hajar; Akbari, Ali; Einabadi, Masoumeh; Savardashtaki, Amir; Johnston, Thomas P; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1822737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921216/,520

METHODS One hundred and fifty-four male patients with unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized to undergo PP and TEP from 2005 to 2009. Pain assessment was conducted using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire preoperatively, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. All patients received the same analgesic regimen and documented pain in a NRS-based 4-week diary. RESULTS Of the 154 patients 77 underwent TEP and 77 PP. Median follow-up was 3.8 years. One recurrent hernia was observed in the TEP and two in the PP group (p = 0.56). Median preoperative NRS scores were 2 and 2, 0.3 and 0.4 at 6 months, 0.1 and 0.3 at 12 months, 0.2 and 0.1 at 24 months postoperatively in the PP and TEP groups, respectively (p > 0.05). Data from the 4-week pain diaries revealed significant differences in pain intensity between the two different techniques from the second postoperative week (p < 0.05). Patients in the PP group required more additional analgesics on day four and five postoperatively (p = 0.037 and 0.015, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our data favor the TEP technique concerning postoperative pain as primary endpoint between tension-free PP and TEP hernia repair.","Aigner, F; Augustin, F; Kaufmann, C; Schlager, A; Ulmer, H; Pratschke, J; Schmid, T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1123-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775532/,520

92477,Biologic mesh use practice patterns in abdominal wall reconstruction: a lack of consensus among surgeons.,2013,"INTRODUCTION A subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with malignant pleural effusion and/or malignant pleural nodules is now classified as stage IV and is generally considered a contraindication to surgery. However, several reports have demonstrated that the prognosis of patients with pleural carcinomatosis first detected at thoracotomy is relatively favorable. The aim of this study was to describe the results of surgical intervention in NSCLC patients with pleural carcinomatosis in Japan. METHODS In 2010, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry conducted a nationwide registration of lung cancer patients who underwent surgery in 2004. Using this database, we performed a retrospective study focused on pleural carcinomatosis. We examined the clinicopathological features, the current status of therapy, and surgical outcomes in patients with pleural carcinomatosis. RESULTS Among the 11,420 registered NSCLC patients, 329 (2.9%) patients had pleural carcinomatosis. The median survival time and 5-year survival rate of 313 patients without other metastatic disease were 34.0 months and 29.3%, respectively. Primary tumor resection was performed in 256 (81.8%) patients, and macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 152 (48.6%) patients, with 5-year survival rates of 33.1% and 37.1%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p < 0.001), best stage nodal status (p = 0.002), and the presence or absence of gross residual tumor (p = 0.013) were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSION In our surgical registry for NSCLC, patients with pleural carcinomatosis accounted for 2.9%, and macroscopic complete resection for them was associated with better survival.","Iida, Tomohiko; Shiba, Mitsutoshi; Yoshino, Ichiro; Miyaoka, Etsuo; Asamura, Hisao; Date, Hiroshi; Okumura, Meinoshin; Tada, Hirohito; Nakanishi, Yoichi; Dosaka-Akita, Hirotoshi; Kobayashi, Hideo; Takahashi, Kazuhisa; Inoue, Masayoshi; Yokoi, Kohei",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1097/jto.0000000000000554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26134225/,520
92496,Laparoscopic single-port sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity: preliminary series.,2010,"Single-port endo-laparoscopic surgery has gained support in the surgical community because it is perceived to offer a better postoperative outcome as it requires only a single incision. We write this prospective observational study to ascertain the feasibility and safety of this technique in patients otherwise requiring two operations. Five patients who underwent double procedures with a single-port device were reviewed: Case 1, a transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair and gastric wedge resection; Case 2, cholecystectomy and diaphragmatic hernia repair; Case 3, oophorectomy and incisional hernia repair; Case 4, anterior resection of the rectum and hepatic segmentectomy; and Case 5, left adrenalectomy and cholecystectomy. Patient demographics, type of port used, operative time, complications and incision length were collected. Mean operative time for the cases ranged from 100 to 315 min. Incision length for the single-port device was 2 cm. In Case 2, an additional 5-mm port was used and an intraoperative complication involving a laceration of the liver occurred during the suturing of the gallbladder fundus. An additional 8-cm lower abdominal incision (Pfannenstiel) was required in Case 4 to complete the colonic anastomosis and for specimen retrieval. Single-port endo-laparoscopic surgery is a feasible and safe technique for approaching double procedures. It drastically reduces the number of scars that a double procedure creates, and if difficulty arises, another port can always be added to ease the operation. It can also potentially reduce the number of admissions and anesthesia that a patient undergoes.","Kim, Guowei; Lomanto, Davide; Lawenko, Michael M; Lopez-Gutierrez, Javier; Lee-Ong, Alembert; Iyer, Shridhar Ganpathi; Cheah, Wei Keat; So, Jimmy Bok Yan; Tsang, Charles Bih Shiou; Fong, Yoke Fai",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23879412/,520

92717,The role of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as a treatment for morbid obesity; review of outcomes.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In personalised external aortic root support (PEARS), a custom-made, macroporous mesh is used to stabilise a dilated aortic root and prevent dissection, primarily in patients with genetically driven aortopathies. Data are needed on the safety and postoperative incidence of aortic events. METHODS We present a multicentre cohort study evaluating the first 200 consecutive patients (median age 33 years) undergoing surgery with an intention to perform PEARS for aortic root dilatation in 23 centres between 2004 and 2019. Perioperative outcomes were collected prospectively while clinical follow-up was retrieved retrospectively. Median follow-up was 21.2 months. RESULTS The main indication was Marfan syndrome (73.5%) and the most frequent concomitant procedure was mitral valve repair (10%). An intervention for myocardial ischaemia or coronary injury was needed in 11 patients, 1 case resulting in perioperative death. No ascending aortic dissections were observed in 596 documented postoperative patient years. Late reoperation was performed in 3 patients for operator failure to achieve complete mesh coverage. Among patients with at least mild aortic regurgitation (AR) preoperatively, 68% had no or trivial AR at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the clinical history of the first 200 patients to undergo PEARS. To date, aortic dissection has not been observed in the restrained part of the aorta, yet long-term follow-up is needed to confirm the potential of PEARS to prevent dissection. While operative mortality is low, the reported coronary complications reflect the learning curve of aortic root surgery in patients with connective tissue disease. PEARS may stabilise or reduce aortic regurgitation.","Van Hoof, Lucas; Rega, Filip; Golesworthy, Tal; Verbrugghe, Peter; Austin, Conal; Takkenberg, Johanna J M; Pepper, John R; Treasure, Tom",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-319300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326135/,520
92742,Preperitoneal onlay mesh repair for ventral abdominal wall and incisional hernia: a novel technique.,2016,"PURPOSE Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is an important postoperative complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and its incidence may be associated with the utilized surgical procedures. Compared with pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) after PD, it may be speculated that pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) is a risk factor for DGE, because it needs an anastomosis of the remnant pancreas to the back wall of the stomach. This study aimed to compare PG and PJ with regard to the incidence of DGE after PD. METHODS We performed a prospective open-label randomized clinical trial (RCT) including patients undergoing elective pancreaticoduodenectomy, who were randomly assigned PG or PJ the day before surgery. The primary endpoint was incidence of DGE. RESULTS The study included 60 patients (30 PG, 30 PJ), of whom seven were deemed unresectable, one was enucleated, and one was switched from PJ to PG during surgery according to the surgeon's decision. Thus, modified intention-to-treat analyses were performed in 27 PG patients and 26 PJ patients. DGE occurred in three patients in the PG group and six patients in the PJ group, which did not constitute a significant between-group difference (P = 0.42). In the PG group, two cases were ISGPS grade A DGE and one was grade C. In the PJ group, one case was grade A, two grade B, and three grade C. The two groups also did not significantly differ in the incidence of other morbidities or postoperative hospital stay.

92765,Long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of Lichtenstein repair vs the Valenti technique for inguinal hernia.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Materials utilized for the repair of hernias fall into 2 broad categories, synthetics and biologics. Each has its merits and drawbacks. The synthetics have a permanent, inherent strength but are associated with some incidence of chronic pain. The biologics rely on variable tissue regeneration to give strength to the repair, limiting their use to specific situations. However, thanks to their transient presence and tissue ingrowth, the biologics do not result in a significant incidence of chronic pain. We studied the use of a biomimetic (REVIVE, Biomerix Corporation, Fremont, CA) in this setting in an attempt to obviate the disadvantages of each material. METHODS Fourteen patients underwent laparoscopic repair by totally extraperitoneal and transabdominal preperitoneal techniques of 16 inguinal hernias. Follow-up was as long as 19 mo, and 8 patients were followed for > 12 mo. There were no recurrences and a 5% incidence of functionally insignificant discomfort. RESULTS REVIVE is shown in histology and in vivo to demonstrate regeneration and tissue ingrowth into the polycarbonate/polyuria matrix similar to that in the biologics rather than scarring or encapsulation. There were no recurrences, indicating its strength and resilience as a permanent repair similar to that in the synthetics. CONCLUSION This is proof of the concept that a biomimetic may bridge the gap between the biologics and synthetics and may be able to be utilized on a regular basis with the benefits of both materials and without their drawbacks.","Fine, Arthur",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680812x13462882737050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23484565/,520

The Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research (GEAR) Network was organized to identify and prioritize delirium clinical questions. METHODS GEAR identified and engaged 49 transdisciplinary stakeholders including emergency physicians, geriatricians, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and patient advocates. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews, clinical questions were derived, medical librarian electronic searches conducted, and applicable research evidence synthesized for ED delirium detection, prevention, and management. The scoping review served as the foundation for a consensus conference to identify the highest priority research foci. RESULTS In the scoping review, 27 delirium detection ""instruments"" were described in 48 ED studies and used variable criterion standards with the result of delirium prevalence ranging from 6% to 38%. Clinician gestalt was the most common ""instrument"" evaluated with sensitivity ranging from 0% to 81% and specificity from 65% to 100%. For delirium management 15 relevant studies were identified, including one randomized controlled trial. Some intervention studies targeted clinicians via education and others used clinical pathways. Three medications were evaluated to reduce or prevent ED delirium. No intervention consistently prevented or treated delirium. After reviewing the scoping review results, the GEAR stakeholders identified ED delirium prevention interventions not reliant upon additional nurse or physician effort as the highest priority research. CONCLUSIONS Transdisciplinary stakeholders prioritize ED delirium prevention studies that are not reliant upon healthcare worker tasks instead of alternative research directions such as defining etiologic delirium phenotypes to target prevention or intervention strategies.","Carpenter, Christopher R; Hammouda, Nada; Linton, Elizabeth A; Doering, Michelle; Ohuabunwa, Ugochi K; Ko, Kelly J; Hung, William W; Shah, Manish; Lindquist, Lee A; Biese, Kevin; Wei, Daniel; Hoy, Libby; Nerbonne, Lori; Hwang, Ula; Dresden, Scott M",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135274/,520

Due to its coordinatively unsaturated [Cu(Phen)](+) sites the dimeric iron complex is able to serve as a catalyst in the cyclopropanation of Z-cyclooctene using ethyl diazoacetate.","De, Soumen; Pramanik, Susnata; Schmittel, Michael",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/c4dt01508h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905480/,520
93530,Completely intracorporeal retraction of the gallbladder for laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgery.,2011,"Cost effectiveness of different visual screening modalities cannot be calculated without long-term outcome data. This paper reports detailed outcomes from a gold-standard UK recommended orthoptist-delivered screening (ODS) at 4-5 years in school, compared to a neighboring school-nurse delivered screening (SNDS), both feeding into the same treatment pathway. The target condition was reduced visual acuity (VA) of worse than logMAR 0.2 in either eye.Available records from screening databases and hospital records were analyzed, comparing the two services wherever possible.More screening data was available from the ODS. ODS: 5706 screened, 3.5% referred. False positives 6.5%, PPV 91.4%, sensitivity 97.9%, and specificity 99.8% for reduced VA. Cost per child with reduced vision detected £195.22, and per amblyope detected £683.28. The mean treatment cost per child with reduced VA was £331.68 and for amblyopia treatment was £458.65.SNDS: 5630 screened and 3.8% referred (plus some referrals to local optometrists lost to follow up). False positives 34%, PPV 53.2%, sensitivity and specificity estimated as 89.3% and 98.67%. Costs to secondary services of false positives were seven times greater. The cost per child with confirmed reduced vision seen at the hospital was 46% more; and per amblyope detected was 39% more.Outcomes for treatment post referral in both groups were similar and excellent. 86% of genuine referrals improved to within normal limits with glasses alone. Of 221 genuine referrals with final outcome data, all now have better than 0.2logMAR acuity in the better eye and only two (0.9%) have residual amblyopia in one eye worse than 0.4logMAR.About 14-18% of children with reduced VA would have passed AAPOS photoscreening referral criteria.An orthoptist-delivered single VA screen at 4-5 years is highly cost effective with good outcomes. The main contributing factors to success appear to be training and experience in accurate VA testing, the opportunity to rescreen equivocal results, and monitoring, audit, and feedback of outcomes.","Horwood, Anna; Lysons, Deborah; Sandford, Victoria; Richardson, Greg",Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273972.2021.1948074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224304/,520

A previously validated finite element model of the intact L1-S1 segments was used. Three different anterior and one posterior surgical fixation approaches for tuberculosis were performed in L3-L5. Three different anterior surgical models were constructed according to the anterior approaches involving debridement, bone graft with or without titanium mesh, and internal fixation with different number of screws and rods. The posterior surgical approach involved transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement, bone graft, and internal fixation. Range of motion and intradiscal pressure of segments adjacent to the fusion were assessed, and biomechanical influences were compared. Intradiscal pressure and range of motion of the adjacent L2/3 and L5/S1 increased during different physiological movements after anterior and/or posterior surgical approaches as compared to baseline values. Comparison between the biomechanical values assessed after different anterior surgical approaches yielded no significant difference. After anterior and posterior surgical approaches were performed on the same model, there were no significant differences in intradiscal pressure and range of motion of the adjacent L2/3 and L5/S1. Anterior and/or posterior lumbar surgical approaches increased range of motion and intradiscal pressure in L2/3 and L5/S1, suggesting each lumbar surgical approach assessed has the potential risk of adjacent segment degeneration. However, there were no significant differences between the biomechanical measurements across the different surgical approaches evaluated.","Wang, Bingjin; Ke, Wencan; Hua, Wenbin; Lu, Saideng; Zeng, Xianlin; Yang, Cao",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2020.1789605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633569/,520

94174,Lichtenstein technique for inguinal hernia repair using polypropylene mesh fixed with sutures vs. self-fixating polypropylene mesh: a prospective randomized comparative study.,2014,"Expression of receptor tyrosine-kinase (RTK) EGFR is low in normal prostate, but increases in prostate cancer. This receptor is significantly up-regulated as tumors progress into higher grade, androgen-insensitive and metastatic lesions. The up-regulated receptors could serve as targets for novel selective anti-cancer drugs, e.g. antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Radionuclide imaging of RTK can facilitate patient stratification and monitoring of anti-RTK therapy of prostate cancer. The goal of the study was to evaluate binding and cellar processing of radiolabeled EGFR-targeting conjugates by prostate cancer cell lines. Receptor expression of EGFR was studied in three prostate cancer cell lines: DU145 (brain metastasis of PC, hormone insensitive), PC3 (bone metastasis of PC) and LNCaP (lymph node metastasis of PC, androgen and estrogen receptor positive). Uptake and internalization of anti-EGFR mAbs (cetuximab) and affibody molecule (Z2377) labeled with indium-111 was investigated. EGFR expression on prostate cancer cell lines was clearly demonstrated. Both labelled conjugates 111In-Z2377 and 111In-cetuximab bound to prostate cancer cells in the receptor mediated model. Expression levels were modest but correlate with degree of hormone independence. Internalization of Affibody molecules was relatively slow in all cell lines. Internalization of mAbs was more rapid. The level of EGFR expression in these cell lines is sufficient for in vivo molecular imaging. Slow internalization indicates possibility of the use of non-residualizing labels for affibody molecules.","Malmberg, Jennie; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Orlova, Anna",International journal of oncology,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2011.915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21253675/,520

The well-established coordination chemistry of copper allows for its reaction with a wide variety of chelator systems that can potentially be linked to peptides and other biologically relevant small molecules, antibodies, proteins, and nanoparticles. The 12.7-hours half-life of 64Cu provides the flexibility to image both smaller molecules and larger, slower clearing proteins and nanoparticles. In a practical sense, the radionuclide or the 64Cu-radiopharmaceuticals can be easily shipped for PET imaging studies at sites remote to the production facility. Due to the versatility of 64Cu, there has been an abundance of novel research in this area over the past 20 years, primarily in the area of PET imaging, but also for the targeted radiotherapy of cancer. The biologic activity of the hypoxia imaging agent, 60/64Cu-ATSM, has been described in great detail in animal models and in clinical PET studies. An investigational new drug application for 64Cu-ATSM was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, paving the way for a multicenter trial to validate the utility of this agent, with the hopeful result being FDA approval for routine clinical use. This article discusses state-of-the-art cancer imaging with 64Cu radiopharmaceuticals, including 64Cu-ATSM for imaging hypoxia, 64Cu-labeled peptides for tumor-receptor targeting, (64)Cu-labeled monoclonal antibodies for targeting tumor antigens, and 64Cu-labeled nanoparticles for cancer targeting.

Such aerosols may be produced during normal activities by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. The schlieren optical method, previously applied mostly in engineering and physics, can be effectively used here to visualize airflows around human subjects in such indoor situations, non-intrusively and without the need for either tracer gas or airborne particles. It accomplishes this by rendering visible the optical phase gradients owing to real-time changes in air temperature. In this study, schlieren video records are obtained of human volunteers coughing with and without wearing standard surgical and N95 masks. The object is to characterize the exhaled airflows and evaluate the effect of these commonly used masks on the fluid-dynamic mechanisms that spread infection by coughing. Further, a high-speed schlieren video of a single cough is analysed by a computerized method of tracking individual turbulent eddies, demonstrating the non-intrusive velocimetry of the expelled airflow. Results show that human coughing projects a rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air, but that wearing a surgical or N95 mask thwarts this natural mechanism of transmitting airborne infection, either by blocking the formation of the jet (N95 mask), or by redirecting it in a less harmful direction (surgical mask).","Tang, Julian W; Liebner, Thomas J; Craven, Brent A; Settles, Gary S","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2009.0295.focus; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19815575/,520

Previously we documented our initial experience of this device both alone and in combination with other devices including flow diverter stents (FDS). We sought to determine the effect of the MED + FDS strategy for the treatment of selected aneurysms. Materials and Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data to identify all patients with aneurysms treated using both the MED and intraluminal FDS. We present our technical success rate, early and mid-term angiographic follow-up, and clinical outcome data. Results We identified 25 non-consecutive patients. The treatment was staged in 9 patients and in a single session 16 patients. The average age was 61±12.8 years (range 40-82). The average fundus height was 11±3.6 mm and average fundus width was 10.1±3.4 mm. In the staged cohort (n=9) at delayed angiography (mean 10 mths) 8 aneurysms (89%) showed complete exclusion (mRRC 1) and in one patient there was a parent vessel occlusion. In the simultaneous cohort delayed angiography (n=10, mean 8.1 months) demonstrated complete occlusion (mRRC 1) in 6 aneurysms (60%), 3 neck remnants (mRRC 2) (30%) and 1 patient (10%) showed persistent aneurysmal filling (mRRC 3a). There were 5 complications with permanent morbidity (mRS >2) in two patients. There were no mortalities. Conclusion The MED can be successfully used in combination with intraluminal FDS and in selected aneurysms this may represent an alternative to FDS and adjunctive coiling.","Bhogal, Pervinder; AlMatter, Muhammad; Hellstern, Victoria; Ganslandt, Oliver; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans; Aguilar-Pérez, Marta",Neurointervention,https://doi.org/10.5469/neuroint.2018.13.1.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29535895/,520

The mortality rates and detailed clinical characteristics of natives and migrants dying with COVID-19 were explored by considering the medical charts of a representative sample of patients deceased in Italian hospitals (n = 2,687) between February 21st and April 29th, 2020. The migrant or native status was assigned based on the individual's country of birth. The expected all-cause mortality among natives and migrants living in Italy was derived by the last available (2018) dataset provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. Overall, 68 individuals with a migration background were identified. The proportions of natives and migrants among the COVID-19-related deaths (97.5% and 2.5%, respectively) were similar to the relative all-cause mortality rates estimated in Italy in 2018 (97.4% and 2.6%, respectively). The clinical phenotype of migrants dying with COVID-19 was similar to that of natives except for the younger age at death. International migrants living in Italy do not have a mortality advantage for COVID-19 and are exposed to the risk of poor outcomes as their native counterparts.","Canevelli, Marco; Palmieri, Luigi; Raparelli, Valeria; Punzo, Ornella; Donfrancesco, Chiara; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Vanacore, Nicola; Brusaferro, Silvio; Onder, Graziano",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,https://doi.org/10.4415/ann_20_03_16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959804/,520

Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are composed of non-structural proteins, structural proteins, accessory proteins and ribonucleic acid. Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response. Highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates. Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes. This review discusses the mechanisms of replication and transmission of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses providing basis for future studies on interrupting the transmission and pathogenicity of these pathogenic viruses.","He, Yeyan; Zheng, Chanying",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

We sought to determine whether racial and insurance based disparities existed in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. METHODS Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, hospitalizations for carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 2005 to 2011 were identified. We calculated χ(2) tests, and bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were fit to assess differences in the characteristics of patients receiving carotid revascularization for asymptomatic compared with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Demographic characteristics studied included race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander) and primary payer status (Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay and no charge). RESULTS Between 2005 and 2011, 890 680 patients underwent carotid revascularization for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis (92.1% asymptomatic and 7.9% symptomatic). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Medicaid (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.92, p<0.0001) and self-pay patients (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.51, p<0.0001) had a lower odds of being revascularized for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis compared with private insurance patients. Black (OR=0.81, 95% CI -0.77 to 0.84, p<0.0001) and Hispanic (OR=0.86, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.90, p<0.0001) patients had significantly lower odds of revascularization for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis compared with white patients. CONCLUSIONS Minorities and self-pay/Medicaid patients were less likely to receive carotid revascularization when asymptomatic-rather they were more likely to have treatment only after symptoms had developed. These findings suggest possible disparities in the degree of morbidity related to carotid artery stenosis, the likelihood of early detection, and/or the likelihood of treatment conditional on indication.","Brinjikji, Waleed; El-Sayed, Abdulrahman M; Kallmes, David F; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Cloft, Harry J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015114/,520

In this work, we selected drug-receptor pairs (DRPs) of affinity/nonaffinity drugs to similar/dissimilar receptors and we represented them as a large network, which may be used to identify drugs that can act on a receptor. Computational chemistry prediction of the biological activity based on quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) substantially increases the potentialities of this kind of networks avoiding time- and resource-consuming experiments. Unfortunately, most QSAR models are unspecific or predict activity against only one receptor. To solve this problem, we developed here a multitarget QSAR (mt-QSAR) classification model. Overall model classification accuracy was 72.25% (1390/1924 compounds) in training, 72.28% (459/635) in cross-validation. Outputs of this mt-QSAR model were used as inputs to construct a network. The observed network has 1735 nodes (DRPs), 1754 edges or pairs of DRPs with similar drug-target affinity (sPDRPs), and low coverage density d = 0.12%. The predicted network has 1735 DRPs, 1857 sPDRPs, and also low coverage density d = 0.12%.

Exposure to these ecologically relevant toxicants is prominent in Northern Canadian populations. Previous work focused on toxicant exposure during pregnancy as a threat to fetal neurodevelopment. However, little is known about the individual and combined effects of these toxicants on maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to synthesize the current knowledge regarding individual and combined effects of methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, and organochlorine pesticides on maternal behaviour and the maternal brain. Relevant studies were identified through the PubMed, Embase, and Toxline databases. Literature involving animal models and one human cohort were included in the review. Results: Research findings indicate that exposures to these environmental toxicants are associated with neurochemical changes in rodent models. Animal models provided the majority of information on toxicant-induced alterations in maternal care behaviours. Molecular and hormonal changes hypothesized to underlie these alterations were also addressed, although studies assessing toxicant co-exposure were limited. Conclusion: This review speaks to the limited knowledge regarding effects of these persistent organic pollutants on the maternal brain and related behavioural outcomes. Further research is required to better comprehend any such effects on maternal brain and behaviour, as maternal care is an important contributor to offspring neurodevelopment.","Fong-McMaster, Claire; Konji, Sandra; Nitschke, Amanda; Konkle, Anne Tm",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17030926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024308/,520

The three-dimensional virtual models of mandible and implant surgery tools were established, and the virtual reality software (Unity 3D 5.5.1) was imported. Combined with the virtual reality head mounted display, a virtual reality training system simulating the dental implant treatment process was independently developed. Ten refresher doctors and 20 graduate students in Department of Implantology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Fujian Medical University from September 2018 to December 2019 were recruited as the experimental objects (no clinical experience was found). According to the level and seniority of doctors, they were randomly divided into virtual training group and conventional training control group, which made the two groups comparable, with 15 in each group. Subjective scores (including anatomical structure, surgical field of vision, cavity preparation, implant placement and process mastery) were given after the corresponding training in the two groups, and the virtual reality training system was used to test. The mesial and distal direction, buccolingual direction, depth and angle deviation of implants before and after the training were analyzed, and the differences between the two groups were compared. Results: The subjective scores of five dimensions in the virtual training group were significantly higher than those in the conventional training control group (P<0.05). In the virtual training group, the mesial and distal, buccolingual, depth and angle deviation of implants were (0.73±0.33), (0.78±0.41), (0.61±0.32) mm and 6.66°±3.87°. All of them were significantly lower than those in the control group [(0.85±0.32), (1.12±0.38), (0.89±0.24) mm and 9.68°±3.74°] (P<0.05).

96561,Hiatal hernia repair with mesh: a survey of SAGES members.,2010,"Long-term cognitive impairment is common in survivors of critical illness. Little is known about the etiology of this serious complication. We sought to summarize current scientific knowledge about potentially modifiable risk factors during intensive care unit (ICU) treatment that may play a substantial role in the development of long-term cognitive impairment. All searches were run on October 1, 2017. The search strategy included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid CDR, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect, Scopus, and Web of Science, and included MeSH headings and keywords related to intensive care, critical care, and cognitive disorders. Searches were restricted to adult subjects. Inclusion required follow-up cognitive evaluation at least 2 months after ICU discharge. Studies assessing patients with cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, and cardiac surgery history were excluded. The search strategy resulted in 3180 studies. Of these, 28 studies (.88%) met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Delirium and duration of delirium were associated with long-term cognitive impairment after ICU admission in 6 of 9 studies in which this factor was analyzed. Weaker and more inconsistent associations have been reported with hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, fluctuations in serum glucose levels, and in-hospital acute stress symptoms. Instead, most of the studies did not find significant associations between long-term cognitive impairment and mechanical ventilation; use of sedatives, vasopressors, or analgesic medications; enteral feeding; hypoxia; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; systolic blood pressure; pulse rate; or length of ICU stay. Prolonged delirium may be a risk factor for long-term cognitive impairment after critical illness, though this association has not been entirely consistent across studies. Other potentially preventable factors have not been shown to have strong or consistent associations with long-term cognitive dysfunction in survivors of critical illness.","Sakusic, Amra; O'Horo, John C; Dziadzko, Mikhail; Volha, Dziadzko; Ali, Rashid; Singh, Tarun D; Kashyap, Rahul; Farrell, Ann M; Fryer, John D; Petersen, Ronald; Gajic, Ognjen; Rabinstein, Alejandro A",Mayo Clinic proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304923/,520

Programmed cell death and regulation of apoptosis in response to a viral infection are important factors for host or virus survival. It is not known whether Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection regulates the apoptosis process in vitro. This study for the first time suggests that CCHFV induces apoptosis, which may be dependent on caspase-3 activation. This study also shows that the coding sequence of the S segment of CCHFV contains a proteolytic cleavage site, DEVD, which is conserved in all CCHFV strains. By using different recombinant expression systems and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that this motif is subject to caspase cleavage. We also demonstrate that CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (NP) is cleaved into a 30-kDa fragment at the same time as caspase activity is induced during infection. Using caspase inhibitors and cells lacking caspase-3, we clearly demonstrate that the cleavage of NP is caspase-3-dependent. We also show that the inhibition of apoptosis induced progeny viral titers of ∼80-90%. Thus, caspase-3-dependent cleavage of NP may represent a host defense mechanism against lytic CCHFV infection. Taken together, these data suggest that the most abundant protein of CCHFV, which has several essential functions such as protection of viral RNA and participation in various processes in the replication cycle, can be subjected to cleavage by host cell caspases.","Karlberg, Helen; Tan, Yee-Joo; Mirazimi, Ali",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m110.149369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21123175/,520

We previously found that a large increase in sunlight in springtime was associated with a lower age of onset. This study extends this analysis with more collection sites at diverse locations, and includes family history and polarity of first episode. METHODS Data from 4037 patients with bipolar I disorder were collected at 36 collection sites in 23 countries at latitudes spanning 3.2 north (N) to 63.4 N and 38.2 south (S) of the equator. The age of onset of the first episode, onset location, family history of mood disorders, and polarity of first episode were obtained retrospectively, from patient records and/or direct interview. Solar insolation data were obtained for the onset locations. RESULTS There was a large, significant inverse relationship between maximum monthly increase in solar insolation and age of onset, controlling for the country median age and the birth cohort. The effect was reduced by half if there was no family history. The maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in springtime. The effect was one-third smaller for initial episodes of mania than depression. The largest maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in northern latitudes such as Oslo, Norway, and warm and dry areas such as Los Angeles, California. LIMITATIONS Recall bias for onset and family history data. CONCLUSIONS A large springtime increase in sunlight may have an important influence on the onset of bipolar disorder, especially in those with a family history of mood disorders.","Bauer, Michael; Glenn, Tasha; Alda, Martin; Andreassen, Ole A; Angelopoulos, Elias; Ardau, Raffaella; Baethge, Christopher; Bauer, Rita; Bellivier, Frank; Belmaker, Robert H; Berk, Michael; Bjella, Thomas D; Bossini, Letizia; Bersudsky, Yuly; Cheung, Eric Yat Wo; Conell, Jörn; Del Zompo, Maria; Dodd, Seetal; Etain, Bruno; Fagiolini, Andrea; Frye, Mark A; Fountoulakis, Kostas N; Garneau-Fournier, Jade; González-Pinto, Ana; Harima, Hirohiko; Hassel, Stefanie; Henry, Chantal; Iacovides, Apostolos; Isometsä, Erkki T; Kapczinski, Flávio; Kliwicki, Sebastian; König, Barbara; Krogh, Rikke; Kunz, Mauricio; Lafer, Beny; Larsen, Erik R; Lewitzka, Ute; Lopez-Jaramillo, Carlos; MacQueen, Glenda; Manchia, Mirko; Marsh, Wendy; Martinez-Cengotitabengoa, Mónica; Melle, Ingrid; Monteith, Scott; Morken, Gunnar; Munoz, Rodrigo; Nery, Fabiano G; O'Donovan, Claire; Osher, Yamima; Pfennig, Andrea; Quiroz, Danilo; Ramesar, Raj; Rasgon, Natalie; Reif, Andreas; Ritter, Philipp; Rybakowski, Janusz K; Sagduyu, Kemal; Scippa, Ângela M; Severus, Emanuel; Simhandl, Christian; Stein, Dan J; Strejilevich, Sergio; Sulaiman, Ahmad Hatim; Suominen, Kirsi; Tagata, Hiromi; Tatebayashi, Yoshitaka; Torrent, Carla; Vieta, Eduard; Viswanath, Biju; Wanchoo, Mihir J; Zetin, Mark; Whybrow, Peter C",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2014.05.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953482/,520

We evaluated the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score and possible predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), aiming to test if the CCI is a valid in-hospital prognostic indicator. Patients older than 14 years, hospitalized from 2010 to 2016 due to SARI by viral infection, and who were submitted to respiratory virus testing were included. We assessed comorbidity retrospectively through chart review, and calculated 4 variants of the CCI. Of the 291 patients assessed, 72.8% (n=212) presented comorbidities and 24% died (n=70). The most recurrent comorbidities were Chronic Pulmonary Disease (n=76/212, 36%) and HIV (n=50/212, 23.6%). The 1994 Age-adjusted CCI predicted in-hospital mortality in SARI patients (p=0.04), and HIV was associated with in-hospital mortality (p=0.032). The comorbidity scores used to assess mortality risk in hospitalized patients with SARI displayed poor results, but HIV infection was considered a marker of severity. However, other factors should be considered in order to compose a score system that allows us to specifically assess the risk of mortality in patients with SARI.

However, it is imperative to establish the safety of outpatient TSA. The purpose of this systematic review was to define complication, readmission, and reoperation rates and patient-reported outcomes after outpatient TSA. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using three databases (PubMed, Ovid, and Embase). English-language publications describing results on complication rates in patients who underwent TSA in an outpatient or ambulatory setting were included. All nonclinical and deidentified database studies were excluded. Bias assessment was conducted with the methodologic index for nonrandomized studies criteria. Results Seven studies describing outcomes in outpatient TSA were identified for inclusion. The included studies used varying criteria for selecting patients for an outpatient procedure. The total outpatient 90-day complication rate (commonly including hematomas, wound issues, and nerve palsies) ranged from 7.1%-11.5%. Readmission rates ranged from 0%-3.7%, and emergency and urgent care visits ranged from 2.4%-16.1%. Patient-reported outcomes improved significantly after outpatient TSA in all studies. Two studies found a higher complication rate in the comparative inpatient cohort (P = .023-.027). Methodologic index for nonrandomized studies scores ranged from 9 to 11 (of 16) for noncomparative studies (n = 3), while all comparative studies received a score of a 16 (of 24). Conclusion Outpatient TSA in properly selected patients results in a similar complication rate to inpatient TSA. Further studies are needed to aid in determining proper risk stratification to direct patients to inpatient or outpatient shoulder arthroplasty.","Huddleston, Hailey P; Mehta, Nabil; Polce, Evan M; Williams, Brady T; Fu, Michael C; Yanke, Adam B; Verma, Nikhil N",JSES international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jseint.2020.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136848/,520

As neoadjuvant therapy has become a standard for triple negative and HER2+ EBC, it focusses on luminal EBC. RECENT FINDINGS Gene expression assays have become standard of care in luminal EBC, at least for patients with node negative disease. Two prospective randomized clinical trials, TAILORx (Oncotype DX) and MINDACT (MammaPrint) have presented additional analyses underlining the clinical utility of the tests. In times of COVID-19, immunohistochemically determined ER, PR, and Ki67 and early Ki67 response to endocrine therapy can be used to safely allocate patients for preoperative endocrine therapy and delay surgeries if resources are scarce. In patients with luminal high-risk disease, adding a CDK 4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib) improves patient outcome already after short-term follow-up. SUMMARY Determination of recurrence risk will remain important in luminal EBC for optimal therapy decisions. In the future, risk-adapted treatment concepts will include decision making for chemotherapy but also for endocrine-based approaches.","Harbeck, Nadia",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337614/,520

We demonstrate that the absence of rural attorneys has significant impacts on public health-impacts that are rapidly exacerbated by COVID-19.Our work builds on recent scholarship that underscores the public health relevance of attorneys in civil and criminal contexts. It recognizes attorneys as crucial to interprofessional health care teams and to establishing equitable health-related laws and policies. Attorney interventions transform institutional practices and help facilitate the stability necessary for health maintenance and recovery. Yet, critically, many rural residents cannot access legal supports.As more individuals experience unemployment, eviction, and insecure benefits amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for attorneys to address these social determinants of health as legal needs. Accordingly, the growing absence of attorneys in the rural United States proves particularly consequential-because of this pandemic context but also because of rural health disparities. We argue that unless a collaborative understanding of these interrelated phenomena is adopted, justice gaps will continue to compound rural health inequities. (Am J Public Health.

OBJECTIVE To date, there is no selective antiviral agent for the management of pathologies associated with covid-19 and the need for an effective agent against it is essential. METHOD In this work two home-made databases from synthetic quinolines and coumarins were virtually docked against viral proteases (3CL and PL), human cell surface proteases (TMPRSS2 and furin) and spike proteins (S1 and S2). Chloroquine, a reference drug without a clear mechanism against coronavirus was also docked on mentioned targets and the binding affinities compared with title compounds. RESULT The best compounds of synthetic coumarins and quinolines for each target were determined. All compounds against all targets showed binding affinity between -5.80 to -8.99 kcal/mol in comparison with the FDA-approved drug, Chloroquine, with binding affinity of -5.7 to -7.98 kcal/mol. Two compounds, quinoline-1 and coumarin-24, were found to be effective on three targets - S2, TMPRSS2 and furin - simultaneously, with good predicted affinity between -7.54 to -8.85 kcal/mol. In silico ADME studies also confirmed good oral absorption for them. Furthermore, PASS prediction was calculated and coumarin-24 had higher probable activity (Pa) than probable inactivity (Pi) with acceptable protease inhibitory as well as good antiviral activity against Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza. CONCLUSION Quinoline-1 and Coumarin-24 have the potential to be used against Covid-19. Hence these agents could be useful in combating covid-19 infection after further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Nejabat, Mojgan; Ghodsi, Razieh; Hadizadeh, Farzin",Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),https://doi.org/10.2174/1573406417666210208223924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563156/,520

However, available data may not be representative of developing countries, such as Ecuador. In this study, the incidence of CPE in Ecuador and risk factors for infection/colonisation were evaluated. METHODOLOGY A prospective cohort study was performed from February to April 2016 in seven intensive-care units of Guayaquil, Ecuador. Samples were processed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory protocol and the CHROMagar mSuper CARBA agar method. Resistance to carbapenems was defined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. A modified carbapenemase inactivation method was used to identify carbapenamase production phenotypically with molecular confirmation by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS In total, 640 patients were enrolled. The incidence of CPE was 36.4% (N = 233). A multivariate analysis indicated that several factors were associated with CPE acquisition, included a long intensive care unit stay (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.03-1.08; p < 0.01), tracheostomy (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.90-6.75; p < 0.01), hospitalisation 3 months prior to admission (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.17-3.71; p < 0.01), vancomycin use (OR 3.31; 95% CI 2.02-5.18; p < 0.01), and macrolide use (OR 3.31; 95% CI 1.43-7.76; p < 0.01).

First, the role of ACE2 itself is still a matter of investigation, and no specific drugs are available targeting ACE2. Second, as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2, there is an impairment of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) involved in the functioning of vital organs like the heart, kidney, brain, and lungs. In developing antiviral drugs for COVID-19, ACE2, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the specific enzymes involved in the viral and cellular gene expression have been the primary targets. SARS-CoV-2 being a new virus with unusually high mortality, there has been a need to get medicines in an emergency, and the drug repurposing has been a primary strategy. Considering extensive mortality and morbidity throughout the world, we have made a maiden attempt to discover the drugs interacting with RAS and identify the lead compounds from herbal plants using molecular docking. Both host ACE2 and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and ORF8 appear to be the primary targets for the treatment of COVID-19. While the drug repurposing of currently approved drugs seems to be one strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, purposing phytochemicals may be another essential strategy for discovering lead compounds. Using in silico molecular docking, we have identified a few phytochemicals that may provide insights into designing herbal and synthetic therapeutics to treat COVID-19.","Goyal, Ramesh K; Majeed, Jaseela; Tonk, Rajiv; Dhobi, Mahaveer; Patel, Bhoomika; Sharma, Kalicharan; Apparsundaram, Subbu",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2020.03.118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070542/,520

METHODS A survey was administered in a Singapore ED (June 2016-June 2017). A convenience sample of parents/carers accompanying pediatric patients completed a self-administered questionnaire. The primary outcome measures were prevalence of CAM use and perceptions of CAM. RESULTS Parents/carers of 610 patients participated. Four hundred seventy-five (78.0%, 95% confidence interval, 74.5-81.0) had taken a CAM within the previous 12 months and 110 (18.1%; 95% confidence interval, 14.8-21.0) had taken a CAM on the day of presentation. There were no sex differences between CAM users and nonusers (P = 0.691). The use of CAM was more common among preschool children and younger (62.9%). There was no difference in CAM use among those with and without chronic disease (P = 0.878). Vitamins/supplements, cod liver oil, and probiotics were the most commonly used CAM. A total of 0.7% of CAM use was reported to the ED doctor. There were no adverse effects reported. The perception that CAMs are safe was more common among parents or caregivers who had administered CAM (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Complementary and alternative medicine use is very common among pediatric ED patients in Singapore and is more prevalent than in Australia and the United Kingdom. However, it is not always reported to the doctor. Parents or caregivers who administer CAM are more likely to perceive CAMs to be safe.","Sathiyan, Jayapriya; Faeyza, Noorul; Ramasamy, Krishnapriya; Ng, Wei Sheng; Ganapathy, Sashikumar",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530833/,520

It is therefore important to reveal the evolutionary processes that underpin their ability to jump species boundaries and establish themselves in new hosts. Here, I discuss how comparative genomics can contribute to this endeavor. Arguably the most important evolutionary process in RNA virus evolution, abundant mutation, may even open up avenues for their control through ""lethal mutagenesis."" Despite this remarkable mutational power, adaptation to diverse host species remains a major adaptive challenge, such that the most common outcome of host jumps are short-term ""spillover"" infections. A powerful case study of the utility of genomic approaches to studies of viral evolution and emergence is provided by influenza virus and brought into sharp focus by the ongoing epidemic of swine-origin H1N1 influenza A virus (A/H1N1pdm). Research here reveals a marked lack of surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs, coupled with the possibility of cryptic transmission before the first reported human cases, such that the exact genesis of A/H1N1pdm (where, when, how) is uncertain.","Holmes, Edward C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0906193106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19858482/,520

The Influence on Weight Loss.,2018,"Estimating detailed transmission trees that reflect the relationships between infected individuals or populations during a disease outbreak often provides valuable insights into both the nature of disease transmission and the overall dynamics of the underlying epidemiological process. These trees may be based on epidemiological data that relate to the timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected individuals. Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their inherently high mutation rate. Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees. We apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences from each infected farm and information on when farms were first estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on these farms were culled. Incorporating known infection links due to animal movement prior to imposition of the national movement ban results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41472 that are consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent more than 95% of the total likelihood calculated using a model that accounts for the epidemiological data. These trees differ in several ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic data.","Cottam, Eleanor M; Thébaud, Gaël; Wadsworth, Jemma; Gloster, John; Mansley, Leonard; Paton, David J; King, Donald P; Haydon, Daniel T",Proceedings.

Little research has examined the joint effects and interactions of multiple elements. This study examined 273 women with NTD-affected pregnancies and 477 controls. Cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, lead, and zinc were quantified in maternal serum. Single and mixed effects of these elements on NTD risk were evaluated with Bayesian kernel machine regression, and the effects of individual elements were validated using logistic regression. As a result, NTD risk increased with the concentration of the mixture of the 10 elements. NTD risk rose as the levels of the five toxic elements increased, with effect sizes larger than the overall analyses, but they decreased, albeit non-significantly, as the levels of the five essential elements increased. Lead and manganese showed risk effects on NTDs, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.94 (1.76-2.13) and 1.25 (1.14-1.38), respectively, with the remaining nine elements remaining at their median. Molybdenum showed a protective effect against NTDs with an OR 0.87 (0.90-0.94). The single-element results were validated using logistic regression. In conclusion, NTD risk increased with concentrations of the five toxic elements, with lead and manganese being the major contributors. Essential elements showed protective effects against NTD risk.","Tian, Tian; Yin, Shengju; Jin, Lei; Liu, Jufen; Wang, Chengrong; Wei, Jing; Liu, Mengyuan; Li, Zhiwen; Wang, Linlin; Yin, Chenghong; Ren, Aiguo",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932758/,520

The phenotypes that reside in biofilm, overproduce exopolymers, and show increased motility often exhibit drug-tolerance and drug-persistence. In this work, we describe a class of small molecules that delay and inhibit the overproduction of alginate by a non-swarming mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Among these molecules, selected benzophenone-derived alkyl disaccharides cause the mucoid bacteria to swarm on hydrated soft agar gel and revert the mucoid to non-mucoid phenotype. The sessile (biofilm) and motile (swarming) phenotypes are controlled by opposing signaling pathways with high and low intracellular levels of bis-(3',5')-cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cdG), respectively. As our molecules control multiple of these phenotypes, we hypothesized and explored a protein receptor, pilin of the pili appendages, that are consistent with controlling these bioactivities and signaling pathways. To test this binding hypothesis, we developed a bacterial motility enabled binding assay that utilizes the interfacial properties of hydrated gels and bacterial motility to conduct label-free ligand-receptor binding studies. The structure activity correlation and the receptor identification reveal a plausible mechanism for reverting mucoid to nonmucoid phenotypes by binding pili appendages with ligands capable of sequestering and neutralizing reactive oxygen species.","Burns, Felicia N; Alila, Mercy A; Zheng, Hewen; Patil, Pankaj D; Ibanez, Arizza Chiara S; Luk, Yan-Yeung",ChemMedChem,https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202100121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666373/,520

TLR8 is activated by uridine- and guanosine-rich ssRNA as well as by certain synthetic chemicals; however, the molecular basis for ssRNA recognition has remained unknown. In this study, to elucidate the recognition mechanism of ssRNA, we determined the crystal structures of human TLR8 in complex with ssRNA. TLR8 recognized two degradation products of ssRNA—uridine and a short oligonucleotide—at two distinct sites: uridine bound the site on the dimerization interface where small chemical ligands are recognized, whereas short oligonucleotides bound a newly identified site on the concave surface of the TLR8 horseshoe structure. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that both binding sites were essential for activation of TLR8 by ssRNA. These results demonstrate that TLR8 is a sensor for both uridine and a short oligonucleotide derived from RNA.","Tanji, Hiromi; Ohto, Umeharu; Shibata, Takuma; Taoka, Masato; Yamauchi, Yoshio; Isobe, Toshiaki; Miyake, Kensuke; Shimizu, Toshiyuki",Nature structural & molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599397/,520

We empirically investigate its benefit for the group-level statistical outcome in task-evoked fMRI. METHODS Three visual fMRI data sets were collected from 17 healthy adult participants. Multi-band acquisition helped vary the TR (2000/1000/410 ms, respectively). Because these data sets capture different temporal aspects of the haemodynamic response (HRF), we tested several HRF models. We computed a composite descriptive statistic, H, from β's of each first-level model fit and carried it to the group-level analysis. The number of activated voxels and the t value of the group-level analysis as well as a goodness-of-fit measure were used as surrogate markers of data quality for comparison. RESULTS Increasing the temporal sampling rate did not provide a universal improvement in the group-level statistical outcome. Rather, both the voxel-wise and ROI-averaged group-level results varied widely with anatomical location, choice of HRF and the setting of the TR. Correspondingly, the goodness-of-fit of HRFs became worse with increasing the sampling frequency. CONCLUSION Rather than universally increasing the temporal sampling rate in cognitive fMRI experiments, these results advocate the performance of a pilot study for the specific ROIs of interest to identify the appropriate temporal sampling rate for the acquisition and the correspondingly suitable HRF for the analysis of the data.","Darányi, Virág; Hermann, Petra; Homolya, István; Vidnyánszky, Zoltán; Nagy, Zoltan",Magma,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10334-021-00918-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763764/,520

This study examines if the program was effective by studying relationship between strengthening of COs, vulnerability reduction, and sustaining of consistent condom use behavior among FSWs. METHODS We used a longitudinal study design to assess the change in outcomes. A three-stage sampling design was used to select FSWs for the study. Panel data of 2085 FSWs selected from 38 COs across five states of India was used to examine the change in various outcomes from 2015 (Survey Round 1) to 2017 (Survey Round 2). The CO level program pillar measuring institutional development assessed performance of COs in six domains critical for any organization's functionality and sustainability: governance, project management, financial management, program monitoring, advocacy and networking, and resource mobilization. Overall, 32 indicators from all these domains were used to compute the CO strength score. A score was computed by taking mean of average dimension scores. The overall score was divided into two groups based on the median cutoff; COs which scored below the median were considered to have low CO strength, while COs which scored above or equal to median were considered to have high CO strength. Multivariable regression modeling techniques were used to examine the effect of program pillars on outcome measures. RESULTS Analyses showed a significant improvement in the strength of the COs over time; percentage of COs having high strength improved from 50% in 2015 to 87% in Round 2. The improvement in CO's strength increased financial security (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.18, p<0.01), social welfare security (AOR: 1.71, p<0.01), and socio-legal security (AOR: 2.20, p<0.01) among FSWs. Further, improvement in financial security led to significant increase in consistent condom use with client among FSWs (AOR: 1.69, p<0.01) who were members of COs having high strength. Sustained consistent condom use was positively associated with young age (<30 years), ability to negotiate with clients for condom use, membership in self-help groups, high self-efficacy, self-confidence, and client solicitation in streets and brothels. CONCLUSIONS Improving financial security and strengthening FSW led CO can improve sustained and consistent condom use. In addition, the program should focus on enhancing ability of FSWs to negotiate with clients for condom use, promote membership in self-help groups and target FSWs who are 30 years or older, and soliciting from homes to sustain consistent condom use across all FSWs.","Mahapatra, Bidhubhusan; Walia, Monika; Patel, Sangram Kishor; Battala, Madhusudana; Mukherjee, Saradiya; Patel, Prachi; Subramanium, Balakrishnan; Atmavilas, Yamini; Saggurti, Niranjan",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609731/,520

100766,Evaluating the Patient and Setting-Specific Factors That Influenced the Quality of Informed Consent in a Retrospective Cohort of Subtotal Cholecystectomy Patients.,2020-07-13,"INTRODUCTION Single-incision approaches to laparoscopic cholecystectomy typically involve increasing the size of the umbilical incision and eliminating three smaller incisions, but it is not intuitive that patients would view this as a benefit. We hypothesize that when patient satisfaction with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy is assessed, most dissatisfaction will be linked to the umbilical incision and, given the option, patients would actually wish to eliminate this incision. METHODS Two hundred eighty-one female patients aged 18 to 40 years who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy over a 2-year period were identified, and data were collected on 125 patients. RESULTS Fewer than half of patients correctly remembered the number of incisions they had, with 57 patients (45.6%) recalling fewer incisions than were present. Of 58 patients reporting one site to be more painful, 38 (65.5%) cited the umbilical site as the most painful. Eighty-one patients (68.6%) would have preferred to eliminate an incision, with 51 of these (63.0%) choosing to eliminate the umbilical incision. CONCLUSION As single-incision cholecystectomy enlarges what is already a painful and undesirable incision, and since patients often do not recall the smaller incisions, we should ask ourselves whether surgeons and industry care more about this technique than do the patients to whom we offer it.","Bencsath, Kalman P; Falk, Gavin; Morris-Stiff, Gareth; Kroh, Matthew; Walsh, R Matthew; Chalikonda, Sricharan",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1785-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125172/,520

DESIGN Longitudinal study of patients discharged from hospitals to post-acute care organizations. SETTING 12 hospitals and 14 PACO Portuguese organizations. PARTICIPANTS 181 patients participated in the both stages of data gathering. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patients' physical and mental health status was measured through the SF-36 scale. The experience of transition from hospital to post-acute care organizations was measured with the Care Transition Measure. The Picker Adult In-Patient Questionnaire was used to measure patients' experience in these organizations. RESULTS Patients reporting better physical condition in post-acute care organizations had a better experience on discharge [b = 0.21, 95% CI (0.10, 0.31)] and perceive fewer problems inside facilities [b = -0.19, 95% CI (-0.31, 0.08)]. The experience in post-acute care organizations is significantly related to patients' mental health status [b = -0.47, 95% CI (-0.59, -0.36)].

Pancreatic lesions are detected in approximately two-thirds of patients with VHL disease at some point during their lifetime. In these patients, cystic pancreatic lesions are almost exclusively benign and, unless symptomatic, do not require surgical or endoscopic intervention; however, solid pancreatic lesions can often be recognized through imaging screens, and are commonly found to be nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) with malignant potential. The natural history of these VHL-associated pNETs is variable, and lacks clinical or imaging features that predict disease progression or metastatic potential, and generally needs to be managed more conservatively than their sporadic counterparts. Treatment options for such lesions, which range from active surveillance to surgical intervention, can nevertheless be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality. Of note, although several guidelines have been established for the management of tumours associated with VHL syndrome, none of these have specifically focused on pancreatic lesions. Thus, we aim to characterize the types of pancreatic lesions associated with VHL disease and their natural history, to identify particular lesions that necessitate treatment, and to define what forms of treatment should be undertaken.","Keutgen, Xavier M; Hammel, Pascal; Choyke, Peter L; Libutti, Steven K; Jonasch, Eric; Kebebew, Electron",Nature reviews.

Although drastically reduced, our institution has maintained a significant level of cardiac surgical activity during the pandemic. Rigorous COVID-19 guidelines have been instituted to mitigate the risk of viral transmission. We observed a reduction in sternal wound infections since the institution of new perioperative surgical guidelines. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution since a national lockdown was declared in March 2020. A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the 12 months preceding the national lockdown, as a baseline cohort group, was also performed. RESULTS A total of 2600 patients (493 during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in this study. Urgent/emergency procedures accounted for more than 60% of procedures performed during the lockdown compared to 39% previously. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 4 sternal wound infections with an overall incidence of 0.8%. In comparison, the incidence of sternal wound infections was significantly higher at 3.0% in the 12-month period prior to lockdown with 63 sternal wound infections (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION This report suggests a significant role of iatrogenic causes in sternal wound infections prior to the pandemic. The strict implementation of guidelines in the perioperative period suggests that sternal wound infections can be prevented. We propose that the now widespread COVID-19 guidelines to reduce transmission risk be adapted to help reduce the incidence of sternal wound infections.","Hussain, Azhar; Ike, David I; Durand-Hill, Matthieu; Ibrahim, Sammra; Roberts, Neil",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,https://doi.org/10.1177/0218492320977633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241715/,520

This is aimed at sensitizing the population of annihilating optically dark triplets that generates the high energy photoluminescence. A large resonance between the involved triplets is usually recommended because it increases the energy gain between absorbed and emitted upconverted photons. However, it also enables efficient back-ET from acceptor to donor triplets, with potential detrimental consequences on the system performance. Here, we analyze a model system, where the energy difference between donor and acceptor triplets is lower than kBT at room temperature by means of time resolved and steady state photoluminescence spectroscopy, and develop a kinetic model, which describes the iterative loop that transfers the triplet exciton between the donor and acceptor molecules. In such a way, we obtained the guidelines for the optimization of the system composition required to overcome the back-ET effect and maximize the upconversion quantum yield.","Meroni, Diletta; Monguzzi, Angelo; Meinardi, Francesco",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0021253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962369/,520

METHODS Retrospectively, 48 consecutive patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 71.0 ± 11.9 years; 24 women) treated for acute MCA occlusion using pREset solely or in combination with other MT devices were identified. Recanalization success was evaluated using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score (TICI), and complications were detected by 24-h follow-up computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. MCA anatomy was assessed in angiograms. Clinical outcome was evaluated with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission and discharge, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge and follow-up. RESULTS Successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3) was achieved in 39 patients (81.3 %). Rate of procedure-related complications was 8.3 %. In four patients, a subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred (8.3 %), and parenchymal hematoma was detected in four patients (8.3 %). None of those events was associated with clinical deterioration. MCA curvature significantly influenced recanalization success (P < 0.005). Successful recanalization correlated significantly with lower NIHSS scores and favorable clinical outcome (mRS score 0-2) at discharge (P < 0.05). Mortality within 90 days was significantly lower in patients with TICI 2b/3 (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS High recanalization rates, low complication rates, and a significantly improved outcome after successful recanalization strongly suggest that MT with pREset is an adequate therapy for AIS after MCA occlusion. Vessel curvature is a significant determining factor for recanalization success.","Schwaiger, B J; Kober, F; Gersing, A S; Kleine, J F; Wunderlich, S; Zimmer, C; Poppert, H; Prothmann, S",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-014-0329-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112831/,520

The constitutive expression of ISGs was mediated by the unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) complex, consisting of IRF9 together with unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2. Under homeostatic conditions, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 were found in the nucleus. Analysis of a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set revealed that STAT1 specifically bound to the promoters of ISGs even in the absence of IFNs. Knockdown of STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 by RNA interference led to the decreased expression of various ISGs in Huh7.5 human liver cells, which was confirmed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from STAT1-/-, STAT2-/-, or IRF9-/- mice. Furthermore, decreased ISG expression was accompanied by increased replication of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus. Conversely, simultaneous overexpression of all ISGF3 components, but not any single factor, induced the expression of ISGs and inhibited viral replication; however, no phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 were detected. A phosphorylation-deficient STAT1 mutant was comparable to the wild-type protein in mediating the IFN-independent expression of ISGs and antiviral activity, suggesting that ISGF3 works in a phosphorylation-independent manner. These data suggest that the U-ISGF3 complex is both necessary and sufficient for constitutive ISG expression and antiviral immunity under homeostatic conditions.","Wang, Wenshi; Yin, Yuebang; Xu, Lei; Su, Junhong; Huang, Fen; Wang, Yijin; Boor, Patrick P C; Chen, Kan; Wang, Wenhui; Cao, Wanlu; Zhou, Xinying; Liu, Pengyu; van der Laan, Luc J W; Kwekkeboom, Jaap; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P; Pan, Qiuwei",Science signaling,https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aah4248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28442624/,520

This proportion is significantly better in similar countries (e.g. England, Germany, the USA). Nephrologists are particularly concerned since although more than 90 % of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4 patients are hypertensive, the CKD-REIN cohort shows that in France more than 1 out of 2 patients with CKD remains with a blood pressure above 140/90mmHg.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is considered to be a salvage strategy for severe ARDS. However, the effect of ECMO therapy on severe ARDS remains inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate the effects of ECMO for adults with severe ARDS. METHODS We searched six databases (EMBASE, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wanfang databases and CNKI) from inception to May 2020 to screen relevant high-quality observational studies and randomized controlled trials. We used the random effects model for outcome calculation. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were explored. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. RESULTS Seven studies (two RCTs and five observational studies) with a total of 867 patients were included. Compared with MV therapy alone, ECMO therapy significantly reduced the mortality at 90 days (based on RCT studies, Risk Ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.59-0.93, P=0.01, I2 =0%, moderate quality; based on observational studies, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.81, P<0.001, I2 =0%, low quality) and at 30 and 60 days. TSA results were consistent with the primary outcome. Furthermore, device-related adverse events were similar between the ECMO group and MV alone group (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 0.27-16.03, P=0.48, I2 =0%, moderate quality). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that the ECMO group exhibited a significantly lower mortality rate compared with the MV alone group at 90, 30 and 60 days for severe ARDS patients.","Zhu, Youfeng; Zhang, Min; Zhang, Rui; Ye, Xiaoling; Wei, Jianrui",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33486824/,520

The systems include vectors based on both full-length and deleted versions of RNA-2. In both cases, the modified RNA-2 is replicated by coinoculation with RNA-1. The constructs based on full-length RNA-2 retain the ability to spread systemically throughout an inoculated plant and the infection can be passaged. The vector based on a deleted version of RNA-2 can stably incorporate larger inserts but lacks the ability to move systemically. However, it has the added advantage of biocontainment. In both cases, vector constructs modified to contain a foreign gene of interest can be delivered by agroinfiltration to obtain transient expression of the foreign protein. If required, the same constructs can also be used for stable nuclear transformation. Both types of vector have proved effective for the production in plants of a diverse range of proteins including antigens and antibodies.","Sainsbury, Frank; Liu, Li; Lomonossoff, George P",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-407-0_2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19183891/,520

We aimed to describe ancillary findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT, to define their prevalence, and investigate their association with clinical data. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our CT chest cases with coupled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Patients with negative rt-PCR or without admission chest CT were excluded. Ancillary findings included: vessel enlargement, subpleural curvilinear lines, dependent subpleural atelectasis, centrilobular solid nodules, pleural and/or pericardial effusions, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Continuous data were expressed as median and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and tested by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Ancillary findings were represented by 106/252 (42.1%, 36.1 to 48.2) vessel enlargement, 50/252 (19.8%, 15.4 to 25.2) subpleural curvilinear lines, 26/252 (10.1%, 7.1 to 14.7) dependent subpleural atelectasis, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) pleural effusion, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement, 13/252 (5.2%, 3 to 8.6) centrilobular solid nodules, and 6/252 (2.4%, 1.1 to 5.1) pericardial effusion. Air space disease was more extensive in patients with vessel enlargement or centrilobular solid nodules (p < 0.001). Vessel enlargement was associated with longer history of fever (p = 0.035) and lower admission oxygen saturation (p = 0.014); dependent subpleural atelectasis with lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001) and higher respiratory rate (p < 0.001); mediastinal lymph nodes with shorter history of cough (p = 0.046); centrilobular solid nodules with lower prevalence of cough (p = 0.023), lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001), and higher respiratory rate (p = 0.032), and pericardial effusion with shorter history of cough (p = 0.015). Ancillary findings associated with longer hospital stay were subpleural curvilinear lines (p = 0.02), whereas centrilobular solid nodules were associated with higher rate of intensive care unit admission (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION Typical high-resolution CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are frequently associated with ancillary findings that variably associate with disease extent, clinical parameters, and disease severity. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Ancillary findings might reflect the broad range of heterogeneous mechanisms in severe acute respiratory syndrome from viral pneumonia, and potentially help disease phenotyping.","Silva, Mario; Ledda, Roberta Eufrasia; Schiebler, Mark; Balbi, Maurizio; Sironi, Sandro; Milone, Francesca; Affanni, Paola; Milanese, Gianluca; Sverzellati, Nicola",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471553/,520

Rather than resection of the costal cartilages and sternal fracture, which had been standard practice for decades, he advocated using a metal bar to push the sternum into position. Reasoning that the chest wall of children is very flexible, he felt that resection was unnecessary. Since that time, medical centers from around the world have reported their experience with the procedure. There is now robust evidence of its safety and efficacy. As the Nuss procedure has become a standard treatment, indications for operation have expanded, and numerous modifications have been introduced. Some of these were intended to improve upon the original procedure, and others to adapt it to new circumstances, such as use in adults whose chest is not as flexible.

Our purpose was to evaluate the effects of KDT in children with refractory epilepsy (effectiveness, side effects, impact on nutritional status and growth). METHODS A retrospective and prospective observational descriptive study was conducted in a Spanish tertiary hospital (January 2000 to December 2018). One hundred sixty pediatric patients with epilepsy were treated with KDT (82 males; mean age 5 years 9 months). Seizures, anti-epileptic drugs, anthropometric measures, side effects, and laboratory assessment were monitored baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the onset of KDT. RESULTS In these time intervals, the seizure-free patients were: 13.7, 12.5, 14.4 and 10.6%, respectively, and a reduction of seizures≥50% was achieved in 41.9, 37.5, 28.7 and 16.2%. Side effects were frequent, especially digestive disorders, hypercalciuria, hypoglycemia, hepatic dysfunction and dyslipidemia. Prealbumin, retinol binding protein, vitamin A and magnesium decreased significantly. Height was affected, especially in children below 2 years.

Underserved communities already battling the opioid epidemic had new challenges in accessing medication assisted treatment (MAT). The investigators sought to determine if patients were retaining access to their opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and maintaining sobriety during the pandemic, with the intention of using this information to improve subsequent patient care while the pandemic continues. METHODS In the assessment, seventy-five patient Epic EMR (electronic medical record) charts were reviewed to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic factors, healthcare access and sobriety during the pandemic period between March 1st, 2020 and June 15th, 2020. Patient charts were selected based on those receiving office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) for OUD at an urban healthcare center. RESULTS 98.7% of patients accessed the healthcare center in some form since March 1st, 2020. The most common form of communication was through telemedicine with 94.6% of calls over audio. Out of the 21 toxicology screens performed during the pandemic period, 16 (76%) patients were found to be adhering to their buprenorphine treatment. Only 78.7% had documented they had Narcan at their disposal. Among all patients, 11 (14.6%) reoccurrences in opioid use were documented during the pandemic period. Few patients (76%) were adhering to their prescribed buprenorphine treatment, revealing that patients may not be receiving needed MAT support amid the pandemic. CONCLUSION This assessment reveals short-comings of patient education in managing craving and the maintenance of support systems amid social-isolating conditions.","Rahman, Fatima; Evans, NaKiera; Bernhardt, Jean",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1901935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754956/,520

To gain some additional information on brain metabolism, we examined the impact of systemic injections of lactate and fructose on the brain extracellular glucose and lactate changes observed during visual stimulation. We found that simple stimulation using a flashlight produced a decrease in visual cortex extracellular glucose and an increase in extracellular lactate. Similar results were observed following visual stimulation with an animated movie without soundtrack or the presentation of a novel object. Specificity of these observations was confirmed by the absence of extracellular glucose and lactate changes when the mice were presented a second time with the same object. Previous experiments have shown that systemic injections of fructose and lactate lead to an increase in blood lactate but no change in blood glucose while they both increase brain extracellular glucose but they do not increase brain extracellular lactate. When mice were visually stimulated after they had received these injections, we found that lactate, and to a slightly lesser degree fructose, both reduced the amplitude of the changes in extracellular glucose and lactate that accompanied visual stimulation. Thus, neural activation leads to an increase in extracellular lactate and a decrease in extracellular glucose. Novelty, attentional resources and availability of metabolic fuels modulate these fluctuations. The observations are consistent with a modified view of brain metabolism that takes into account the blood and brain glucose availability.","Béland-Millar, Alexandria; Messier, Claude",Behavioural brain research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2018.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458067/,520
104328,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in ethnic obese Chinese.,2008,"PURPOSE/AIM The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of a bupivacaine mandibular nerve block on intraoperative blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in response to surgical stimulation and the need for systemic analgesics postoperatively. We hypothesized that a mandibular nerve block would decrease the need for systemic analgesics both intraoperatively and postoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fourteen adult male Yucatan pigs were purchased. Pigs were chemically restrained with ketamine, midazolam, and dexmedetomidine and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane inhalant anesthesia. Pigs were randomized to receive a mandibular block with either bupivacaine (bupivacaine group) or saline (control group). A nerve stimulator was used for administration of the block with observation of masseter muscle twitch to indicate the injection site. Invasive BP and HR were measured with the aid of an arterial catheter in eight pigs. A rescue analgesic protocol consisting of fentanyl and lidocaine was administered if HR or BP values increased 20% from baseline. Postoperative pain was quantified with a customized ethogram. HR and BP were evaluated at base line, pre-rescue, 10 and 20 min post-rescue. RESULTS Pre-rescue mean BP was significantly increased (p = .001) for the bupivacaine group. Mean intraoperative HR was significantly lower (p = .044) in the bupivacaine versus saline group. All other parameters were not significant. CONCLUSION Addition of a mandibular nerve block to the anesthetic regimen in the miniature pig condylectomy model may improve variations in intraoperative BP and HR. This study establishes the foundation for future studies with larger animal numbers to confirm these preliminary findings.","Bova, Jonathan F; da Cunha, Anderson F; Stout, Rhett W; Bhumiratana, Sarindr; Alfi, David M; Eisig, Sidney B; Vunjak-Novakovic, Gordana; Lopez, Mandi J",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.3109/08941939.2014.971207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394295/,520
104469,Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding In Patients with Unexpected Cirrhosis: Safety and Outcomes.,2015,"Network concepts are often used to characterize the features of a social context. For example, past work has asked if individuals in more socially cohesive neighborhoods have better mental health outcomes. Despite the ubiquity of use, it is relatively rare for contextual studies to employ the methods of network analysis. This is the case, in part, because network data are difficult to collect, requiring information on all ties between all actors. This paper asks whether it is possible to avoid such heavy data collection while still retaining the best features of a contextual-network study. The basic idea is to apply network sampling to the problem of contextual models, where one uses sampled ego network data to infer the network features of each context, and then uses the inferred network features as second-level predictors in a hierarchical linear model. We test the validity of this idea in the case of network cohesion. Using two complete datasets as a test, we find that ego network data are sufficient to capture the relationship between cohesion and important outcomes, like attachment and deviance. The hope, going forward, is that researchers will find it easier to incorporate holistic network measures into traditional regression models.","Smith, Jeffrey A; Gauthier, G Robin",Sociological methodology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0081175020922879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831423/,520

104488,Transanal endoscopic microsurgery for rectal neoplasms. How I do it.,2013,"Background - His bundle pacing (HBP) is the most physiologic pacing modality. However, HBP has longer procedure times with frequent high capture thresholds, which likely contributes to the low adoption of this approach. The aim of this study is to compare HBP implantation with a novel imaging technique versus the standard implantation technique. Methods - This study included 50 patients with standard pacing indications randomized to HBP with visualization of the tricuspid valve annulus (TVA, N=25, the visualization group) or with the standard method (N=25, the control group). In the visualization group, the TVA was imaged by contrast injection in the right ventricle during fluoroscopy. The site for HBP was identified in relationship to the tricuspid septal leaflet and interventricular septum. Results - Permanent HBP was successful in 92% in the visualization group and 88% in the control group. The fluoroscopic time for HBP lead placement was significantly shorter in the visualization group (7.1±3.3min) compared with the control group (10.1±5.6min, P=0.03). Total procedural and fluoroscopic times were also significantly shorter in the visualization group (91.0±15.7min and 9.6±3.8min) than the control group (104.4±17.8min and 12.7±6.2min, P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in capture threshold between groups. In the visualization group, there was a quantitative association between the HBP site and the TVA. Conclusions - The visualization technique shortens the procedural and fluoroscopic times for HBP implantation. Moreover, anatomic localization of HBP sites is strongly associated with physiologic characteristics of pacing, which can help guide optimal lead placement.","Gu, Min; Niu, Hongxia; Hu, Yiran; Liu, Xi; Zhang, Nixiao; Cai, Minsi; Chen, Xuhua; Zhou, Xiaohong; Gold, Michael R; Hua, Wei; Zhang, Shu",Circulation.

Because there are no disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis, relief of symptoms and maintenance of quality of life through improving joint function become the focus of management. Although highly effective for pain relief, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with systemic adverse reactions that are sometimes treatment limiting, especially for older patients. Thus, osteoarthritis management in elderly populations is shifting away from traditional NSAIDs to therapies that provide comparable pain relief with improved safety. Since the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of the use of topical NSAIDs to manage osteoarthritis pain, current treatment guidelines put forth by several professional societies have begun to recommend topical NSAIDs as an alternative therapy and, most recently, as first-line therapy for osteoarthritis management in the elderly.

Such integration creates a Schottky junction depth that is larger than the UV absorption depth to sufficiently separate the photoinduced electron/hole pairs, boosting the peak internal quantum efficiency over the unity and the external quantum efficiency over 99% under weak UV light without bias. The proposed Ti3 C2 Tx /GaN vdWH UV photodiode demonstrates pronounced photoelectric performances working in self-powered mode, including a large responsivity (284 mA W-1 ), a high specific detectivity (7.06 × 1013 Jones), and fast response speed (rise/decay time of 7.55 µs/1.67 ms). Furthermore, the remarkable photovoltaic behavior leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.33% under 355 nm UV light illumination. Additionally, this work presents an easy-processing spray-deposition route for the fabrication of large-area UV photodiode arrays that exhibit highly uniform cell-to-cell performance.

Experimentally measured structure factors have been used to determine and characterize charge density via the multipole model (MM) and the maximum entropy method (MEM). Theoretical investigation of the electron density and the electronic structure has been performed in the finite basis set density functional theory (DFT) framework. Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM), deformation densities and Laplacians maps have been used to compare theoretical and experimental results. MM experimental results and predictions from theory differ with respect to the sign and/or magnitude of the Laplacian at the N-O bond critical point (BCP), depending on the treatment of n values of the MM radial functions. Such Laplacian differences in the N-O bond case are discussed with respect to a lack of flexibility in the MM radial functions also reported by Rykounov et al. [Acta Cryst. (2011), B67, 425-436]. BCP Hessian eigenvalues show qualitatively matching results between MM and DFT. In addition, the theoretical analysis used domain-averaged fermi holes (DAFH), natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and localized (LOC) orbitals to characterize the N-O bond as a single σ bond with marginal π character. Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) has been employed to compare to the MM refinement results and/or neutron dataset C-H bond lengths and to crystal or single molecule geometry optimizations, including considerations of anisotropy of H atoms. Our findings help to understand properties of molecules like MTTOTHP as progenitors of free oxygen radicals.","Vénosová, Barbora; Koziskova, Julia; Kožíšek, Jozef; Herich, Peter; Lušpai, Karol; Petricek, Vaclav; Hartung, Jens; Müller, Mike; Hübschle, Christian B; van Smaalen, Sander; Bucinsky, Lukas","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620005533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831263/,520

However, quality of life after either total or proximal gastrectomy is not so satisfactory. The authors report a novel surgical procedure, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy (LAsTG), by which a very small remnant stomach is preserved, for the surgery of selected EGCs in the upper stomach. Twenty-three patients with EGC in the upper stomach underwent LAsTG. After lymph node dissection and mobilization of the stomach, the stomach was transected about 2 cm proximal to the tumor and a very small remnant stomach was preserved. An anvil was inserted transorally into the remnant stomach by using the OrVil system. The reconstruction method was Roux-en-Y, and hemidouble-stapling gastrojejunostomy with a circular stapler was performed intracorporeally. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Mean operation time and blood loss were 266.7 min and 54.6 ml, respectively. The overall incidence of early postoperative complications was 17.4%, and two patients underwent reoperation because of duodenal stump leakage and stenosis of the Y-anastomosis, respectively. During the follow-up period, two patients experienced gastrojejunostomy stenosis and both were treated successfully by endoscopic balloon dilation. LAsTG may be performed in selected patients with EGC in the upper stomach. With the described method, a very small remnant stomach can be preserved.","Jiang, Xiaohua; Hiki, Naoki; Nunobe, Souya; Nohara, Kyoko; Kumagai, Koshi; Sano, Takeshi; Yamaguchi, Toshiharu",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-011-0023-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347820/,520

Healthcare faculty therefore have to educate the rising generation of health professionals in subjects unfamiliar to themselves, such as planetary health and sustainable healthcare. This creates a new paradigm where faculty have to learn a new subject area and incorporate and teach it within their own material. It is important to develop faculty knowledge and confidence to integrate education for sustainable healthcare into their educational practice, as faculty can rapidly acquire and build on these skills. Partnership between students and faculty can enhance this faculty development as students bring fresh ideas and possibly greater knowledge of the climate and ecological crisis. Under supervision, they can co-create the necessary new learning. Students can also act as partners in advocating for social and environmental fairness and systemic change toward a sustainable healthcare system. We summarize the impact of various activities of health professions students around the world which advocate for institutional change and enhance faculty development in education for sustainable healthcare.

In 2012, we initiated a performance improvement (PI) project focusing on the implementation of PGDT during high-risk abdominal surgeries. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. METHODS This is a historical prospective quality improvement study. The goal of this initiative was to standardize the way fluid management and hemodynamic optimization are conducted during high-risk abdominal surgery in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Surgery at the University of California Irvine. For fluid management, the protocol consisted in standardized baseline crystalloid administration of 3 ml/kg/hour and any additional boluses based on PGDT. The impact of the intervention was assessed on the length of stay in the hospital (LOS) and post-operative complications (NSQIP database). RESULTS In the 1 year pre- and post-implementation periods, 128 and 202 patients were included. The average volume of fluid administered during the case was 9.9 (7.1-13.0) ml/kg/hour in the pre-implementation period and 6.6 (4.7-9.5) ml/kg/hour in the post-implementation period (p < 0.01). LOS decreased from 10 (6-16) days to 7 (5-11) days (p = 0.0001). Based on the multiple linear regression analysis, the estimated coefficient for intervention was 0.203 (SE = 0.054, p = 0.0002) indicating that, with the other conditions being held the same, introducing intervention reduced LOS by 18% (95% confidence interval 9-27%). The incidence of NSQIP complications decreased from 39% to 25% (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION These results suggest that the implementation of a PI program focusing on the implementation of PGDT can transform fluid administration patterns and improve postoperative outcome in patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgeries.

However, in the field of oral cancer surgery, the efficacy and safety of VSS use have not been clarified. METHODS One hundred and fifty-one patients underwent oral cancer resection and reconstructive surgery. They were divided into two groups: Ligasure vessel sealing system (LVSS) group and conventional surgery (CS) as control. Intra-operative blood loss, operating time, and incidence of post-operative complications and recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS LVSS use significantly reduced intra-operative blood loss. The operating time was shortened only in mandibular gingiva cancer surgery. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to the incidence of post-operative complications and recurrence.

Socio-spatial inequality is defined as a process and structural condition of a territory marked by inherited and updated vulnerabilities, resulting from a relationship of exploitation, spoliation, and oppression in the current period of globalization. The authors argue that the COVID-19 pandemic can have more serious repercussions in contexts of greater socio-spatial inequality, with systemic and chronic deepening of the economic and social crises in places. Still, actions matter, including collaboration between different groups, institutions, and sectors. The analysis of geographic situation contributes to understanding the inherited territory and different experiences with COVID-19, inextricably linked to the conditions and meanings of action in the face of the pandemic in each place. Geographic situation expresses the tension between freedom and the condition for action. The crisis is not only a health crisis, but a manifestation of the current time, and inequality proves to be the most serious emergency of the 21st century.","Albuquerque, Mariana Vercesi de; Ribeiro, Luis Henrique Leandro",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00208720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440421/,520

Current guidelines for the management of septic shock and guidelines for managing other critical illnesses suggest intra-arterial blood pressure measurement is preferred over automated oscillometric noninvasive blood pressure measurement. Despite these recommendations, anecdotal experience suggested that the use of noninvasive blood pressure measurement in our institution and others in preference to intra-arterial blood pressure measurement remained prevalent. DESIGN We designed an online survey and sent it by e-mail. SETTING Intensive care units. PATIENTS AND SUBJECTS A randomly selected group from the membership of the Society for Critical Care Medicine. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Use of non-invasive and invasive blood pressure devices. Eight hundred eighty individuals received an invitation to complete the survey and 149 responded. We found that 71% (105 of 149) of intensivists estimated the correct cuff size rather than measuring arm circumference directly. In hypotensive patients, 73% of respondents (108 of 149) reported using noninvasive blood pressure measurement measurements for patient management. In patients on a vasopressor medication, 47% (70 of 149) of respondents reported using noninvasive blood pressure measurement for management. CONCLUSIONS The use of noninvasive blood pressure measurement measurements in critically ill patients is common despite the paucity of evidence validating its accuracy in critically ill patients. Given this widespread use, accuracy and precision validation studies comparing noninvasive blood pressure measurement with intra-arterial blood pressure measurement in critically ill patients should be performed.","Chatterjee, Arjun; DePriest, Kirk; Blair, Russell; Bowton, David; Chin, Robert",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181fa057f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20890190/,520

The present article addresses three aims in understanding the challenges and opportunities faced by the HSP education and training community. First, it describes challenges to HSP education and training created by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the need to maintain the integrity of training; facilitate trainee progress; continue clinical service delivery; manage the safety and wellbeing of trainees, faculty, staff, and clients/patients; and adhere to national and local emergency orders. Second, the article summarizes guidance from training organization leadership regarding training program and clinical site responses to these challenges. Several principle-based recommendations called upon training programs to prioritize trainees and their training needs, while urging balance and flexibility in meeting the multiple demands of training programs, institutions, and the public. Third, the article discusses key opportunities for improvement in HSP education and training, including more effective use of competency evaluations; distance technologies in therapy, supervision, and admissions; and reconsideration of internship and degree timing and HSP's identity as a health care profession; and the potential for comprehensive review and redesign of HSP education and training. Embracing these opportunities may help ensure that HSP education and training is preparing its graduates to meet the psychological health care needs of the future.

108569,A pilot study for one-stop endoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair.,2010,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure to delay inpatient elective surgery to increase US health care capacity. This study examined the extent to which common inpatient elective operations consume acute care resources. METHODS This cross-sectional study used the Premier Healthcare Database to examine the distribution of inpatient elective operations in the United States from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2018. Primary outcomes were measures of acute care use after 4 common elective operations: joint replacement, spinal fusion, bariatric surgery, and coronary artery bypass grafting. A framework for matching changing demand with changes in supply was created by overlaying acute care data with publicly available outbreak capacity data. RESULTS Elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 117 423) had the highest acute care use: 92.8% of patients used intensive care unit beds, 89.1% required postoperative mechanical ventilation, 41.0% required red blood cell transfusions, and 13.3% were readmitted within 90 days of surgery. Acute care use was also substantial after spinal fusion (n = 203 789): 8.3% of patients used intensive care unit beds, 2.2% required postoperative mechanical ventilation, 9.2% required red blood cell transfusions, and 9.3% were readmitted within 90 days of surgery. An example of a framework for matching hospital demand with elective surgery supply is provided. CONCLUSIONS Acute care needs after elective surgery in the United States are consistent and predictable. When these data are overlaid with national hospital capacity models, rational decisions regarding matching supply to demand can be achieved to meet changing needs.","Krishnamoorthy, Vijay; Ohnuma, Tetsu; Bartz, Raquel; Fuller, Matthew; Khandelwal, Nita; Haines, Krista; Scales, Charles; Raghunathan, Karthik","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2021818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912897/,520

However, studies on the improvement of stapling technology are limited. This study aimed to investigate whether linear triple-row staples (tri-staples) had any advantage over double-row staples. METHODS This is a retrospective review of all cases of functional end-to-end anastomoses with linear staplers performed at two centers between 2005 and 2015. Data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Cases of anastomoses performed with double-row (DS) and triple-row (TS) staples were matched according to propensity scores. The rates of anastomotic leakage, bleeding, reoperation, and 30-day mortality were compared. RESULTS Functional end-to-end ileocolic anastomoses were performed in 563 consecutive patients during the study period. Double- and triple-row stapling devices were used in 389 and 174 anastomoses, respectively. With propensity score matching, 170 cases were chosen from each group. Both groups showed comparable baseline characteristics. The anastomotic leakage, anastomotic bleeding, and intra-abdominal collection rates were 2.4 and 0% (p = 0.123), 1.2 and 0% (p = 0.499), and 3.5 and 1.2% (p = 0.283) for DS and TS, respectively. The reoperation and 30-day mortality rates were 5.9 and 1.8% (p = 0.048) and 0.6 and 1.2% (p = 1.000) for DS and TS, respectively. The median lengths of stay were 5 and 6 days (p = 0.072) for DS and TS, respectively. CONCLUSION Anastomoses with triple-row staples tended to have a lower morbidity rate, but a significant advantage over double-row staples was not demonstrated in this study.","Foo, Chi Chung; Chiu, Alston Ho On; Yip, Jeremy; Law, Wai Lun",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6027-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29340808/,520

109196,Abnormal glucose tolerance testing following gastric bypass demonstrates reactive hypoglycemia.,2011,"BACKGROUND Melatonin, a potent free radical scavenger, plays an important role in homeostasis of cell and organ physiology. The increased demand and synthesis from the pineal gland during times of oxidative stress suggests a potential benefit of melatonin supplementation during hospitalization for acute illness. Yet, the paucity of clinical studies for non-anesthetic-associated indications in pediatric populations hampers the safe, effective, and consistent use of melatonin. OBJECTIVE To systematically review published studies of melatonin use for non-sedative and non-analgesic indications in hospitalized pediatric patients. DATA SOURCES A search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Scopus databases was conducted for articles on the use of melatonin for pediatric patients in a hospital setting. RESULTS Thirteen eligible studies, all in neonates, were identified. Data elements extracted included study design, number of study subjects, indication for melatonin therapy, and melatonin regimen (formulation, dosage, and duration). Because study methodologies were very heterogeneous, a quantitative synthesis of the published findings was not possible. The identified studies were therefore categorized by the indication of melatonin (adjuvant-antioxidant or anti-inflammatory therapy) in the following specific disease states: 1) acute infections, 2) respiratory distress syndrome, 3) neurologic injury, and 4) jaundice. CONCLUSIONS The current data suggest that melatonin is safe for use in hospitalized neonates. Melatonin may be beneficial for reducing inflammatory markers in neonatal patients with disease states and clinical sequelae that are associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Melatonin, in conjunction with phototherapy, is not superior to use of vitamin D with phototherapy for treatment of neonatal jaundice. Studies in other pediatric populations are warranted.","Procaccini, David; Lobner, Katie; Anton, Blair; Kudchadkar, Sapna R",Pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.2408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342515/,520

No early imaging biomarkers currently differentiate these disorders. METHODS Simple visual imaging analysis of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus in neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging and nigrosome 1 in susceptibility-weighted sequences was performed in thirty patients with parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy fulfilling possible/probable second consensus diagnostic criteria. The neuromelanin visual pattern was compared to patients with Parkinson's disease with the same disease duration (n = 10) and healthy controls (n = 10). Substantia nigra semi-automated neuromelanin area/signal intensity was compared to the visual data. RESULTS Groups were similar in age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent dose. Hoehn & Yahr stage was higher in parkinsonian multiple system atrophy patients, 69% of whom had normal neuromelanin size/signal, significantly different from Parkinson's disease patients, and similar to controls. Nigrosome 1 signal was lost in 74% of parkinsonian multiple system atrophy patients. Semi-automated neuromelanin substantia nigra signal, but not area, measurements were able to differentiate groups. CONCLUSIONS In patients with parkinsonism, simple visual magnetic resonance imaging analysis showing normal neuromelanin substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, combined with nigrosome 1 loss, allowed the distinction of the parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy from Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. This easy and widely available method was superior to semi-automated measurements in identifying specific imaging changes in substantia nigra and locus coeruleus.","Simões, Rita Moiron; Castro Caldas, Ana; Grilo, Joana; Correia, Daisy; Guerreiro, Carla; Pita Lobo, Patrícia; Valadas, Anabela; Fabbri, Marguerita; Correia Guedes, Leonor; Coelho, Miguel; Rosa, Mario Miguel; Ferreira, Joaquim J; Reimão, Sofia",BMC neurology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-02007-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243166/,520

A review of the literature and clinical experiences.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although the recently marketed stent retriever thrombectomy devices have demonstrated a high recanalization rate and favorable clinical outcomes, there is a concern about the risks of intimal injuries when pulling out the stent in the unfolded position. In this study, the Solitaire Flow Restoration System and the Trevo retriever were used in a histopathological comparison of vascular injuries caused by stent retriever thrombectomy devices. METHODS Rabbit carotid arteries were used in the experiments with stent retriever thrombectomy devices. Carotid artery samples were harvested either 1 or 2 weeks postoperatively for histological examination. RESULTS Histological changes caused by the use of stent retriever thrombectomy devices were observed from the intimal to medial layers. With the Solitaire FR 4 mm, intimal and medial thickening was observed 1 week postoperatively, and progression of intimal thickening was observed 2 weeks postoperatively. The extent of intimal thickening tended to be greater with the Solitaire FR 6 mm than with the Solitaire FR 4 mm, but this difference was not significant. Compared with the Solitaire FR 4 mm, the Trevo had a significantly smaller area of intimal thickening. CONCLUSIONS Although there are some differences among devices, results from this study indicate that stent retriever thrombectomy devices induce vascular damage that extends to the medial layer.","Arai, Daisuke; Ishii, Akira; Chihara, Hideo; Ikeda, Hiroyuki; Miyamoto, Susumu",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26508129/,520

With new findings suggesting that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, impacting the respiratory system and beyond in some individuals, we need new molecular targets for therapeutics innovation more than ever. We argue that the current pandemic will likely strip the limited resources from other diseases such as malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and among others affecting the African continent. Hence, we need to address not only COVID-19 but also its broader health care and societal impacts in Africa. Extensive diagnostic testing to trace and isolate the COVID-19 cases as well as basic income and economic support for those who are unable to work will be needed. A critically informed and democratic governance that builds on transparency and trust for the elected leaders is crucial. Finally, the pandemic offers a silver lining for Africa: the prospects to integrate omics research with long-standing expertise in herbal medicine in Africa, thus accelerating the advances toward novel molecular therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and precision herbal medicine worldwide.","Dandara, Collet; Dzobo, Kevin; Chirikure, Shadreck",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2020.0099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654634/,520

INTRODUCTION The lock-down due to COVID-19 has caused hard times to everybody, but especially for women victim of domestic violence, locked up in their own home with violent partners. OBJECTIVE To describe how and to what extent the lockdown caused by the first wave of COVID-19 influenced the domestic violence in Val Camonica. METHOD Using the informatic system of the Esine Emergency Department, accesses for domestic, psychological and/or physical violence in the years 2017-2020 were analyzed. RESULTS In 2020, following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the observed accesses for domestic violence and aggressions displayed during violent episodes was. As in previous years, women victims of domestic violence were between 30 and 40 years old and of Italian nationality; men were also victims of domestic violence.

110185,Comment on: comparison of endostapler performance in challenging tissue applications.,2013,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to systematically review and meta-analyze the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT in detecting coronavirus disease (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS. MEDLINE was systematically searched for publications on the diagnostic performance of chest CT in detecting COVID-19. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model. RESULTS. Six studies were included, comprising 1431 patients. All six studies included patients at high risk of COVID-19, and five studies explicitly reported that they included only symptomatic patients. Mean prevalence of COVID-19 was 47.9% (range, 27.6-85.4%). High or potential risk of bias was present throughout all QUADAS-2 domains in all six studies. Sensitivity ranged from 92.9% to 97.0%, and specificity ranged from 25.0% to 71.9%, with pooled estimates of 94.6% (95% CI, 91.9-96.4%) and 46.0% (95% CI, 31.9-60.7%), respectively. The included studies were statistically homogeneous in their estimates of sensitivity (p = 0.578) and statistically heterogeneous in their estimates of specificity (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. Diagnostic accuracy studies on chest CT in COVID-19 suffer from methodologic quality issues. Chest CT appears to have a relatively high sensitivity in symptomatic patients at high risk of COVID-19, but it cannot exclude COVID-19. Specificity is poor. These data, along with other local factors such as COVID-19 prevalence, available real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests, staff, hospital, and CT scanning capacity, can be useful to healthcare professionals and policy makers to decide on the utility of chest CT for COVID-19 detection in the hospital setting.","Adams, Hugo J A; Kwee, Thomas C; Yakar, Derya; Hope, Michael D; Kwee, Robert M",AJR.

It is becoming increasingly appreciated that IgA+ PC are not constrained to mucosal barrier sites. Rather, IgA+ PC may leave these sites where they provide both host defense and immunoregulatory function. In this review, we will outline how IgA+ PC are generated within the mucosae and how they subsequently migrate to their ""classical"" effector site, the gut lamina propria. From there we provide examples of IgA+ PC displacement from the gut to other parts of the body, referencing examples during homeostasis and inflammation. Lastly, we will speculate on mechanisms of IgA+ PC displacement to other tissues. Our aim is to provide a new perspective on how IgA+ PC are truly fantastic beasts of the immune system and identify new places to find them.","Isho, Baweleta; Florescu, Alexandra; Wang, Angela A; Gommerman, Jennifer L",Immunological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046908/,520

Since its first report, a number of studies have been published as we continue to learn, not only about modes of transmission, but also clinical manifestations, risk of congenital anomalies, including microcephaly and neurological malformations in fetuses born from mothers infected during pregnancy. Interventions to reduce the burden of ZIKV infection are restricted to mosquito control, and for Aedes spp mosquitoes the strategies implemented to that end proved to be unsuccessful so far. Hence the lessons we can learn following the ZIKV epidemics become of paramount importance in the development of drug treatments and in search for a vaccine.","Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Almeida, Flavia J; de Ávila Kfouri, Renato",Anatomical record,https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.24622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834635/,520

METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary Hospital in Madrid, including children of HCW who suffered from SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. Children underwent enzyme-linked immunosorbent serological study for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: VIRCELL IgG assay. RESULTS One hundred thirteen children from 69 HCWs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited: 47 children had positive IgG (41.6%). Children secondary attack rate was 43.7% (25% if both parents have had asymptomatic infection; 39.5% if one parent was symptomatic; and 47% when both parents had symptoms). Having a positive sibling was associated with a positive IgG result (odds ratio = 12.2; 95% confidence interval: 4.4-33.7, P < 0.001). Median age was higher in IgG positive children (P = 0.022). Children who referred anosmia presented higher IgG titles (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS We observed a very high SARS-CoV-2 transmission in children of HCW during the first pandemic wave, especially when both parents were symptomatic. Having a positive sibling was associated with seroconversion, supporting the important role of family clusters in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Méndez-Echevarría, Ana; Sainz, Talía; de Felipe, Beatriz; Alcolea, Sonia; Olbrich, Peter; Goycochea-Valdivia, Walter A; Escosa-García, Luis; Cobo, Lorena; Calvo, Cristina; Neth, Olaf",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591078/,520

With an average size of 16-18 nm, the hydrogel nano-silver particle composite (AgNPs@C_MA_O) was synthesized using a soft white LED approach and analyzed by UV-Vis, DLS, FTIR, X-ray, SEM-EDX and TEM techniques. The anticancer activity of the obtained novel functionalized AgNPs@C_MA_O was tested in-vitro in the A375 melanoma cell line. Dose-response analysis showed that AgNPs at 0.01 mg/mL and 0.005 mg/mL doses reduced the viability of A375 cells by 50% at 24 and 48-h time-points, respectively. A375 cells treated with AgNPs@C_MA_O for 24 h at IC50 displayed abnormal morphology such as detachment edges and feet, shrinkage, membrane damage, and the loss of contact with adjacent cells. Our work is the first study showing that non-ionizing radiation mediated biofunctionalized AgNPs have an anti-tumoral effect at such a low concentration of 0.01 mg/mL. Our approach of using harmless wLED increased synergy between soft biopolymer compounds and AgNPs, and enhanced anticancer efficiency of the AgNPs@C_MA_O biohydrogel. Ultimately, the AgNPs accessed through the use of the wLED approach in colloidal syntheses can open new applications and combinatorial advanced cancer treatments and diagnostics.","Bunyatova, Ulviye; Hammouda, Manel Ben; Zhang, Jennifer",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92689-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168242/,520

Staphylococci are the most prevalent etiological agents of orthopedic infections. After an initial adhesin-mediated implant colonization, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis produce biofilm. Biofilm formation proceeds as a four-step process: (1) initial attachment of bacterial cells; (2) cell aggregation and accumulation in multiple cell layers; (3) biofilm maturation and (4) detachment of cells from the biofilm into a planktonic state to initiate a new cycle of biofilm formation elsewhere. The encasing of bacteria in biofilms gives rise to insuperable difficulties not only in the treatment of the infection, but also in assessing the state and the nature of the infection using traditional cultural methods. Therefore, DNA-based molecular methods have been developed to provide rapid identification of all microbial pathogens. To combat biofilm-centered implant infections, new strategies are being developed, among which anti-infective or infective-resistant materials are at the forefront. Infection-resistant materials can be based on different approaches: (i) modifying the biomaterial surface to give anti-adhesive properties, (ii) doping the material with antimicrobial substances, (iii) combining anti-adhesive and antimicrobial effects in the same coating, (iv) designing materials able to oppose biofilm formation and support bone repair.","Arciola, Carla Renata; Campoccia, Davide; Ehrlich, Garth D; Montanaro, Lucio",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11038-7_2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366219/,520

Accumulating evidence identifies the prevalence of M. genitalium similar to long recognized pathogens, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and epidemiology of M. genitalium in a mid-Pacific military population. METHODS A prospective analysis was conducted from routine specimens collected as standard of care for STI testing at Tripler Army Medical Center on Oahu, HI. The prevalence of M. genitalium was determined using the Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium assay, a transcription-mediated amplification test. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the associations for this infection with other STIs and demographic factors. RESULTS A total of 1,876 specimens were tested in a six-month period including 6 sample types from 1,158 females and 718 males. Subject ages ranged from 18-76 years old, with a median of 24 (IQR=21-29). Prevalence of M. genitalium was 8.8% overall (n = 165), 7.1% in females and 11.6% in males. Coinfection with M. genitalium occurred with another sexually-transmitted pathogen in 43 patients (18.3%), with C. trachomatis as the most common organism (n = 38).

Surgical skills training in specifically designed simulation laboratories allows practice of procedures in a risk-free environment before they are performed in the operating room. The transferability of acquired skills to performance with patients is the most effective measure of the predictive validity of simulation-based training. Retention of the skills transferred to clinical situations is also critical. However, evidence of simulation-based skill retention in the orthopaedic literature is limited, and concerns about sustainability exist. Solutions for skill decay include repeated practice of the tasks learned on simulators and reinforcement of areas that are sensitive to decline. Further research is required to determine the retention rates of surgical skills acquired in simulation-based training as well as the success of proposed solutions for skill decay.","Atesok, Kivanc; Satava, Richard M; Van Heest, Ann; Hogan, MaCalus V; Pedowitz, Robert A; Fu, Freddie H; Sitnikov, Irena; Marsh, J Lawrence; Hurwitz, Shepard R",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.5435/jaaos-d-15-00440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27348146/,520

This phenomenon is referred to as transfusion-related acute gut injury (TRAGI). One theory as to a pathophysiological mechanism is that transfusion may result in an ischemia-reperfusion injury to intestinal tissue. We tested the hypothesis that there is significantly greater variability during transfusion in splanchnic tissue oxygen saturation (SrSO2) than in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (CrSO2). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, observational study using near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor SrSO2 and CrSO2 in preterm neonates undergoing RBC transfusion for symptomatic anaemia. Mean, standard deviation, highest and lowest SrSO2 and CrSO2 values during each transfusion were determined. The greatest difference in SrSO2 and CrSO2 during each transfusion was calculated, along with the coefficient of variation. RESULTS We studied 37 subjects. Throughout all transfusions, the mean SrSO2 was 45.6% ±13.8 and the mean CrSO2 was 65.4% ±6.9 (p<0.001). The variability of SrSO2 was significantly greater than that of CrSO2. Averaging data from all subjects, the greatest difference in SrSO2 was 43.8% ±13.4 compared with 23.3% ±7.6 for CrSO2 (p<0.001). The mean coefficient of variation in all transfusions was 20.5% for SrSO2 and 6.0% for CrSO2 (p<0.001). Increasing post-conceptional age did not affect SrSO2 variability (R(2) =0.022; p=0.379), whereas CrSO2 variability during transfusion decreased with increasing post-conceptional age (R(2)=0.209; p=0.004). DISCUSSION In preterm infants, there is a large degree of tissue oxygenation variability in splanchnic tissue during RBC transfusion and this does not change with increasing maturity. We speculate that these findings, combined with lower average tissue oxygenation, may demonstrate susceptibility of the preterm gut to TRAGI.","Bailey, Sean M; Hendricks-Muñoz, Karen D; Mally, Pradeep V",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2015.0212-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761320/,520

This article identifies key principles for each of these three aspects and provides practical tips for how leaders can use the lessons learned from the pandemic in their own contexts.","Paixão, Graça; Mills, Chloe; McKimm, Judy; Hassanien, Mohammed A; Al-Hayani, Abdulmonem A",British journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12968/hmed.2020.0611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263482/,520
112591,"Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Biliopancreatic Diversion, Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy with Traditional Roux-en-Y Duodenal Switch.",2017,"A diversity of strategies is evolved by RNA viruses to manipulate the host translation machinery in order to create an optimal environment for viral replication and progeny production. One of the common viral targets is the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha). In this report, we show that phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha was severely suppressed in human and animal cells infected with the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). To understand whether this suppression is through inhibition of protein kinase R (PKR), the double-stranded-RNA-dependent kinase that is one of the main kinases responsible for phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha, cells infected with IBV were analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that the level of phosphorylated PKR was greatly reduced in IBV-infected cells. Overexpression of IBV structural and nonstructural proteins (nsp) demonstrated that nsp2 is a weak PKR antagonist. Furthermore, GADD34, a component of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which dephosphorylates eIF-2alpha, was significantly induced in IBV-infected cells. Inhibition of the PP1 activity by okadaic acid and overexpression of GADD34, eIF-2alpha, and PKR, as well as their mutant constructs in virus-infected cells, showed that these viral regulatory strategies played a synergistic role in facilitating coronavirus replication. Taken together, these results confirm that IBV has developed a combination of two mechanisms, i.e., blocking PKR activation and inducing GADD34 expression, to maintain de novo protein synthesis in IBV-infected cells and, meanwhile, to enhance viral replication.","Wang, Xiaoxing; Liao, Ying; Yap, Pei Ling; Png, Kim J; Tam, James P; Liu, Ding Xiang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01546-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19776135/,520
112615,Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair of recurrent inguinal hernias.,2010,"Background Pulpal pain is amongst the most severe pains experienced by humans. Various chemical agents are used routinely to devitalize the severely inflamed pulpal tissue. Most of these agents are harmful and have detrimental effects. This questionnaire-based study evaluated the awareness and perception of dental practitioners regarding the use of devitalizing agents during endodontic procedures, and various alternatives to minimize the use of these agents. Methods An open questionnaire was distributed to a total of 250 dental practitioners. It carried detailed information about the most common devitalizing agent used, the purpose of use, method, and duration of application, recommendations, complications encountered, awareness of complications, and various alternatives. The collected data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 17.0 (IBM Statistics, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics were drawn with respective percentages to have a comparative overview. Results 209 responses to 250 questionnaires circulated gave a response rate of 83.6%. Amongst them, 63.15% of dentists were using devitalizing agents. The most widely and frequently used devitalizing agent was Devitec (PD Swiss, Vevey, Switzerland) (36.3%), followed by Caustinerf forte (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, France) (29.5%). A total of 32.9% dentists were aware of the recommendations, and 66.02% were aware of the complications of devitalizing agents; 16.26% of dental practitioners encountered complications due to the use of devitalizing agents. The dentists listed the alternate methods regarding the use of pulp devitalizing agents. Conclusion Although most of the dentists were aware of the harmful effects and few encountered complications with the use of devitalizers, they continued to use these agents because of the lack of an effective alternative.","Kaushik, Pratyasha; Kaushik, Mamta; Soujanya, Elkanti; Roshni, Roshni; Mehra, Neha; Prasad, Lokam Karthik",Medicine and pharmacy reports,https://doi.org/10.15386/mpr-1820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430857/,520

Combating the threat of an impending H5N1 influenza pandemic will require a combination of pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies. The emergence of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 emphasised the unpredictable nature of a pandemic influenza. Undoubtedly, vaccines offer the most viable means to combat a pandemic threat. Current egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing strategies are unlikely to be able to cater to the huge, rapid global demand because of the anticipated scarcity of embryonated eggs in an avian influenza pandemic and other factors associated with the vaccine production process. Therefore, alternative, egg-independent vaccine manufacturing strategies should be evaluated to supplement the traditional egg-derived influenza vaccine manufacturing. Furthermore, evaluation of dose-sparing strategies that offer protection with a reduced antigen dose will be critical for pandemic influenza preparedness. Development of new antiviral therapeutics and other, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies will further supplement pandemic preparedness. This review highlights the current status of egg-dependent and egg-independent strategies against an avian influenza pandemic.","Singh, Neetu; Pandey, Aseem; Mittal, Suresh K",Expert reviews in molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1462399410001432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20426889/,520
112806,Subcutaneous switching suture technique for hernia defect closure during laparoscopic ventral and incisional hernia repair.,2020-07-28,"Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations of nucleic acid are leading vaccine candidates for COVID-19, and enabled the first approved RNAi therapeutic, Onpattro. LNPs are composed of ionizable cationic lipids, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids, and are produced using rapid-mixing techniques. These procedures involve dissolution of the lipid components in an organic phase and the nucleic acid in an acidic aqueous buffer (pH 4). These solutions are then combined using a continuous mixing device such as a T-mixer or microfluidic device. In this mixing step, particle formation and nucleic acid entrapment occur. Previous work from our group has shown that, in the absence of nucleic acid, the particles formed at pH 4 are vesicular in structure, a portion of these particles are converted to electron-dense structures in the presence of nucleic acid, and the proportion of electron-dense structures increases with nucleic acid content. What remained unclear from previous work was the mechanism by which vesicles form electron-dense structures. In this study, we use cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering to show that efficient siRNA entrapment occurs in the absence of ethanol (contrary to the established paradigm), and suggest that nucleic acid entrapment occurs through inversion of preformed vesicles. We also leverage this phenomenon to show that specialized mixers are not required for siRNA entrapment, and that preformed particles at pH 4 can be used for in vitro transfection.","Kulkarni, Jayesh A; Thomson, Sarah B; Zaifman, Josh; Leung, Jerry; Wagner, Pamela K; Hill, Austin; Tam, Yuen Yi C; Cullis, Pieter R; Petkau, Terri L; Leavitt, Blair R",Nanoscale,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0nr06816k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241838/,520

FECV and feline parvovirus (FPV) can cause similar clinical symptoms in cats, such as diarrhea. The objective of this study was to establish a duplex SYBR Green I-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of FPV and FCoV. Two pairs of specific PCR primers were designed to target fragments of the VP2 gene of FPV and of the 5' UTR gene of FCoV, respectively. The assay distinguished between the two viruses based on the melting curves (melting temperatures 77.0 ± 0.5 °C [FPV] and 80.5 ± 0.5 °C [FCoV]). The minimum limits of FPV and FCoV detection were 4.74 × 101 copies/μL and 7.77 × 101 copies/μL, respectively. The assay showed excellent reproducibility and reliability, based on the mean coefficient of variation. In conclusion, this novel duplex SYBR Green I-based qPCR assay is sensitive and can specifically, reliably, and rapidly detect FPV and FCoV (co-)infections.","Sun, Liting; Xu, Zhiqing; Wu, Junhuang; Cui, Yongqiu; Guo, Xu; Xu, Fazhi; Li, Yongdong; Wang, Yong",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547343/,520

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has led to sheltering-in-place and telework. While necessary, these strategies may lead to negative consequences such as social isolation and worse performance. However, nature environments have been shown to have a variety of positive effects in several different settings, including improved attention, positive affect, and increased job satisfaction, and these may be translated to the home workspace setting. METHOD This provides a narrative review of the environmental psychology literature, describing articles involving nature in a task performance or stress context and how it has been applied. It then moves on to discuss how these findings could possibly be applied in the context of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Although beneficial results are mixed, the review found a variety of relatively simple and cost-effective methods that could assist workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including taking a break in nature and implementing nature in the workspace. APPLICATION The application of restorative environment research could be an efficient way of mitigating the negative psychological effects due to at-home sheltering and telework in order to combat COVID-19.","Craig, Curtis M; Neilson, Brittany N; Altman, George C; Travis, Alexandra T; Vance, Joseph A",Human factors,https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720820984286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410358/,520

This was done in order to identify pathogens that have been well-documented and recognize those that have not been properly studied, determine the number of articles that have been published annually about this topic and identify regions in Chile that concentrate the highest and lowest number of studies concerning viral and bacterial pathogens. A total of 67 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 1951 to 2018 were selected for revision. Results indicate that the number of publications has increased per decade but there are years in which no articles were published. Most studies addressed Leptospira, rabies, hantavirus, Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) and distemper. Rodentia, Carnivora, Chiroptera and Cetartiodactyla were the most studied mammal orders. Information about presence/absence of pathogens was found for 44 wild mammal species. Research was mainly carried out in central and southern Chile and the most commonly employed methods for pathogen diagnosis were serology and molecular techniques. Overall, research in wild mammals has been directed towards the evaluation of zoonotic diseases, while vector-borne and non-zoonotic diseases have been mostly neglected by the scientific community over the years.","Llanos-Soto, Sebastián; González-Acuña, Daniel",Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0716-10182019000200195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344156/,520

Controversy exists as to whether infants suffer from virus-induced lung pathology or from excessive immune responses. Furthermore, detailed knowledge about the development of primary T-cell responses to viral infections in infants is lacking. We studied the dynamics of innate neutrophil and adaptive T-cell responses in peripheral blood in relation to the viral load and parameters of disease in infants admitted to the intensive care unit with severe RSV infection. Analysis of primary T-cell responses showed substantial CD8(+) T-cell activation, which peaked during convalescence. A strong neutrophil response, characterized by mobilization of bone marrow-derived neutrophil precursors, preceded the peak in T-cell activation. The kinetics of this neutrophil response followed the peak of clinical symptoms and the viral load with a 2- to 3-day delay. From the sequence of events, we conclude that CD8(+) T-cell responses, initiated during primary RSV infections, are unlikely to contribute to disease when it is most severe. The mobilization of precursor neutrophils might reflect the strong neutrophil influx into the airways, which is a characteristic feature during RSV infections and might be an integral pathogenic process in the disease.","Lukens, Michaël V; van de Pol, Alma C; Coenjaerts, Frank E J; Jansen, Nicolaas J G; Kamp, Vera M; Kimpen, Jan L L; Rossen, John W A; Ulfman, Laurien H; Tacke, Carline E A; Viveen, Marco C; Koenderman, Leo; Wolfs, Tom F W; van Bleek, Grada M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01807-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015982/,520

The UN and WHO encourage countries to make health facility location data open, to encourage use and improvement. We provide a summary of open access health facility location data in Africa using re-useable R code. We aim to support data analysts developing software tools to address COVID-19 response in individual countries. In Africa there are currently three main sources of such open data; 1) direct from national ministries of health, 2) a database for sub-Saharan Africa collated and published by a team from KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme and now hosted by WHO, and 3) The Global Healthsites Mapping Project in collaboration with OpenStreetMap. Methods: We searched for and documented official national facility location data that were openly available. We developed re-useable open-source R code to summarise and visualise facility location data by country from the three sources. This re-useable code is used to provide a web user interface allowing data exploration through maps and plots of facility type. Results: Out of 52 African countries, seven currently provide an official open facility list that can be downloaded and analysed reproducibly. Considering all three sources, there are over 185,000 health facility locations available for Africa. However, there are differences and overlaps between sources and a lack of data on capacities and service provision. Conclusions: These summaries and software tools can be used to encourage greater use of existing health facility location data, incentivise further improvements in the provision of those data by national suppliers, and encourage collaboration within wider data communities. The tools are a part of the afrimapr project, actively developing R building blocks to facilitate the use of health data in Africa.","South, Andy; Dicko, Ahmadou; Herringer, Mark; Macharia, Peter M; Maina, Joseph; Okiro, Emelda A; Snow, Robert W; van der Walt, Anelda",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16075.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437875/,520

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 424 patients who underwent LADG for cT1, cN0 gastric cancer. Patient characteristics, surgical outcomes, postoperative complications including severity assessment using the Clavien-Dindo classification, and risk factors related to postoperative complications were analyzed. RESULTS B-I and R-Y were performed in 329 and 95 patients, respectively. Total time in hospital was longer in R-Y (15.2 ± 10.5 days) than in B-I (12.8 ± 6.4 days; P = 0.034). The incidence of severe complications was higher in R-Y (13.7%) than in B-I (5.2%; P = 0.009). Three cases of internal hernia and three cases of duodenal stump leakage were observed in R-Y. Univariate analysis revealed the method of reconstruction was a risk factor for severe postoperative complications after LADG (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS The features of postoperative complications are quite different between B-I and R-Y after LADG. Complications after R-Y were more severe than those after B-I. To avoid these severe complications in R-Y, it is necessary to understand these different features.","Kumagai, Koshi; Hiki, Naoki; Nunobe, Souya; Jiang, Xiaohua; Kubota, Takeshi; Aikou, Susumu; Watanabe, Ryohei; Tanimura, Shinya; Sano, Takeshi; Kitagawa, Yuko; Yamaguchi, Toshiharu",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1683-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21948148/,520

With improvements in endovascular techniques, several series have detailed the results and complications of endovascular treatment of aneurysms at this location. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published series on the endovascular treatment of ICA bifurcation aneurysms, including a tertiary referral center experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search for reports on contemporary endovascular treatment of ICA bifurcation aneurysms from 2000 to 2013, and we reviewed our experience. We extracted information regarding periprocedural complications, procedure-related morbidity and mortality, immediate angiographic outcome, long-term clinical and angiographic outcome, and retreatment rate. Event rates were pooled across studies by using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS Including our series of 37 patients, 6 studies with 158 patients were analyzed. Approximately 60% of the aneurysms presented as unruptured; 88.0% (95% CI, 68.0%-96.0%) of aneurysms showed complete or near-complete occlusion at immediate postoperative angiography compared with 82.0% (95% CI, 73.0%-88.0%) at last follow-up. The procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 3.0% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.0%) and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.0%-8.0%), respectively. The retreatment rate was 14.0% (95% CI, 8.0%-25.0%). Good neurologic outcome was achieved in 93.0% (95% CI, 86.0%-97.0%) of patients. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of ICA bifurcation aneurysms is feasible and effective and is associated with high immediate angiographic occlusion rates.

113956,Efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass compared to medically managed controls in meeting the American Diabetes Association composite end point goals for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,2012,"BACKGROUND Advance care planning (ACP) is a process with the overall aim to enhance care in concordance with patients' preferences. Key elements of ACP are to enable persons to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these with family and health care professionals, and to document and review these if appropriate. ACP is usually conducted through personal conversations between a health care professional, a patient, and-if appropriate-family members. Although Web-based ACP programs have the potential to support patients in ACP, their effectiveness is unknown. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs. METHODS We systematically searched for quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs in seven databases including EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central and Google Scholar. Data on the characteristics of the ACP programs' content (using a predefined list of 10 key elements of ACP), feasibility, and effectiveness were extracted using a predesigned form. RESULTS Of 3434 titles and abstracts, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, evaluating 11 Web-based ACP programs-10 were developed in the United States and one in Ireland. Studied populations ranged from healthy adults to patients with serious conditions. Programs typically contained the exploration of goals and values (8 programs), exploration of preferences for treatment and care (11 programs), guidance for communication about these preferences with health care professionals or relatives (10 programs), and the possibility to generate a document in which preferences can be recorded (8 programs). Reportedly, participants were satisfied with the ACP programs (11/11 studies), considering them as easy to use (8/8 studies) and not burdensome (7/8 studies). Designs of 13 studies allowed evaluating the effectiveness of five programs. They showed that ACP programs significantly increased ACP knowledge (8/8 studies), improved communication between patients and their relatives or health care professionals (6/6 studies), increased ACP documentation (6/6 studies), and improved concordance between care as preferred by the patients and the decisions of clinicians and health care representatives (2/3 studies). CONCLUSIONS Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs were mainly developed and evaluated in the United States. They contained the key elements of ACP, such as discussing and documenting goals and preferences for future care. As participants considered programs as easy to use and not burdensome, they appeared to be feasible. Among the 13 studies that measured the effectiveness of programs, improvement in ACP knowledge, communication, and documentation was reported. The concordance between preferred and received care is yet understudied. Studies with high-quality study designs in different health care settings are warranted to further establish the feasibility and effectiveness of Web-based ACP programs.","van der Smissen, Doris; Overbeek, Anouk; van Dulmen, Sandra; van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette; van der Heide, Agnes; Rietjens, Judith Ac; Korfage, Ida J",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/15578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32181750/,520

Also, intravenous IG may be capable of suppressing the high expression of IL-6 by the CoV-19 resulting in lessen disease burden. Anti-inflammatory medications like, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, glycyrrhetinic acid, as well as etoposide may be very advantageous in decreasing the COVID-19 burden because, their mode of action targets the cytokine storms initiated by the CoV-19. It is important to indicate that, these medication does not target the virus itself. Therefore, potent CoV-19 anti-viral medications are needed to completely cure patients with COVID-19. Also, a vaccine is urgently needed to stop the spread of the virus. This review therefore elucidates the immune players in the management of COVID-19; focusing principally on MSCs and inflammatory mediators.","Richard, Seidu A; Kampo, Sylvanus; Sackey, Marian; Hechavarria, Maite Esquijarosa; Buunaaim, Alexis D B; Kuugbee, Eugene Dogkotenge; Anabah, Thomas Winsum",Current stem cell research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574888x15666200705213751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628591/,520

115335,The Use of Unidirectional Knotless Barbed Suture for Enterotomy Closure in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Comparative Study.,2017,"BHV-1 is an important pathogen of cattle. The infected cell protein 0 (bICP0) encoded by BHV-1 is an important regulatory protein because it is constitutively expressed and can activate all viral promoters. The mechanism by which bICP0 activates viral promoters is not well understood because bICP0 does not appear to be a sequence specific binding protein. A C(3)HC(4) zinc RING (really interesting novel gene) motif at the N-terminus of bICP0 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is important for activating viral gene expression and inhibiting interferon dependent transcription. Like other alpha-herpesvirinae ICP0 homologues, bICP0 is associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein-containing nuclear domains. During productive infection of cultured cells, BHV-1 induces degradation of the PML protein, which correlates with efficient productive infection. In this study, we demonstrated that a plasmid expressing bICP0 reduces steady state levels of the PML protein, and the C(3)HC(4) zinc RING finger is important for PML degradation. Surprisingly, bICP0 mutants with an intact C(3)HC(4) zinc RING finger that lack a nuclear localization signal also reduces steady PML protein levels. In addition, mutant bICP0 proteins that primarily localize to the cytoplasm induced morphological changes in transfected cells. During productive infection, bICP0 was detected in the cytoplasm of low-passage bovine kidney, but not established bovine kidney cells. These studies demonstrated that bICP0, even when not able to efficiently localize to the nucleus, was able to induce degradation of the PML protein and alter the morphology of transfected cells.","Gaudreault, Natasha; Jones, Clinton",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21215282/,520

Two luminescent Eu(III) complexes with three tetramethylheptadionates (tmh) and pyridine (py), [Eu(tmh)3(py)1] (seven-coordinated monocapped-octahedral structure) and [Eu(tmh)3(py)2] (eight-coordinated square antiprismatic structure), were synthesized for geometrical-induced LMCT level control. Distances between Eu(III) and oxygen atoms of tmh ligands were estimated using single-crystal X-ray analyses. The contribution percentages of π-4f mixing in HOMO and LUMO at the optimized structure in the ground state were calculated using DFT (LC-BLYP). The Eu-O distances and their π-4f mixed orbitals affect the energy level of LMCT states in Eu(III) complexes. The LMCT energy level of an eight-coordinated Eu(III) complex was higher than that of a seven-coordinated Eu(III) complex. The energy transfer processes between LMCT and Eu(III) ion were investigated using temperature-dependent and time-resolved emission lifetime measurements of 5D0 → 7FJ transitions of Eu(III) ions.

115688,"Comparison between orogastric tube/bougie and a suction calibration system for effects on operative duration, staple-line corkscrewing, and esophageal perforation during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.",2016,"BACKGROUND Immunoassays designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens are now commercially available. The most widely used tests are rapid lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) assays have also been developed. The overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests, however, is not well defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is the third in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by IDSA. OBJECTIVE IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and non-medical settings. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS The panel agreed on five diagnostic recommendations. These recommendations address antigen testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as well as assess single versus repeat testing strategies. CONCLUSIONS Data on the clinical performance of U.S. Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization is mostly limited to single, one-time testing versus standard nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) as the reference standard. Rapid Ag tests have high specificity and low to modest sensitivity compared to reference NAAT methods. Antigen test sensitivity is heavily dependent on viral load, with differences observed between symptomatic compared to asymptomatic individuals and the time of testing post onset of symptoms. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the diagnostic methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing can help identify some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Altayar, Osama; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Hayden, Mary K; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; El Alayli, Abdallah; Sultan, Shahnaz; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valery; Mansour, Razan; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Patel, Payal; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160592/,520
115731,Outcomes of redo-transversus abdominis release for abdominal wall reconstruction.,2021-07-21,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to determine if right arm peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) experienced fewer complications while controlling for gender, hand dominance, history of malignancy, dwell time and catheter size. METHODS This was an intention-to-treat randomized controlled trial conducted in an academic medical center on two different sites between September 2012 and September 2015. All patients older than 18 years or age without known history of previous central line, contraindication to the use of a specific arm or hospitalized in the intensive care unit regardless of coagulation status, were considered for the study. Participants were randomized to the left or right arm group and were followed until catheter removal. Data collected included: PICC characteristics, insertion details, gender, arm dominance, history of malignancy, reason for insertion/removal, incidence of a complication and total dwell time. One-tailed hypothesis testing using a univariate logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) calculation was used to analyze the results. There were 202 patients randomly assigned, totaling 7657 catheter-days; 103 patients to the right-side group and 99 patients to the left-side group. RESULTS Participants in both groups were statistically equivalent for right handedness, gender, oncologic status, average dwell time and total catheter days. The overall incidence of complications on the right side was 23% versus 34% on the left side, confirming the hypothesis that right-sided insertions led to fewer complications (p = 0.046). The risk of a complication was reduced by 40% with right-sided insertion (OR 0.58 (CI: 0.31-1.09). CONCLUSIONS This study indicated fewer complications with right-sided insertion irrespective of hand dominance.","Paquet, France; Boucher, Louis-Martin; Valenti, David; Lindsay, Richard",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28665468/,520

116508,Total extraperitoneal laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair without mesh fixation: prospective study with 1-year follow-up results.,2010,"Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV-1. IFITM proteins deter HIV-1 entry when expressed in target cells and also impair HIV-1 infectivity when expressed in virus producer cells. However, little is known about how viruses resist IFITM inhibition. In this study, we have investigated the susceptibilities of different primary isolates of HIV-1 to the inhibition of viral infectivity by IFITMs. Our results demonstrate that the infectivity of different HIV-1 primary isolates, including transmitted founder viruses, is diminished by IFITM3 to various levels, with strain AD8-1 exhibiting strong resistance. Further mutagenesis studies revealed that HIV-1 Env, and the V3 loop sequence in particular, determines the extent of inhibition of viral infectivity by IFITM3. IFITM3-sensitive Env proteins are also more susceptible to neutralization by soluble CD4 or the 17b antibody than are IFITM3-resistant Env proteins. Together, data from our study suggest that the propensity of HIV-1 Env to sample CD4-bound-like conformations modulates viral sensitivity to IFITM3 inhibition.IMPORTANCE Results of our study have revealed the key features of the HIV-1 envelope protein that are associated with viral resistance to the IFITM3 protein. IFITM proteins are important effectors in interferon-mediated antiviral defense. A variety of viruses are inhibited by IFITMs at the virus entry step. Although it is known that envelope proteins of several different viruses resist IFITM inhibition, the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. Taking advantage of the fact that envelope proteins of different HIV-1 strains exhibit different degrees of resistance to IFITM3 and that these HIV-1 envelope proteins share the same domain structure and similar sequences, we performed mutagenesis studies and determined the key role of the V3 loop in this viral resistance phenotype. We were also able to associate viral resistance to IFITM3 inhibition with the susceptibility of HIV-1 to inhibition by soluble CD4 and the 17b antibody that recognizes CD4-binding-induced epitopes.","Wang, Yimeng; Pan, Qinghua; Ding, Shilei; Wang, Zhen; Yu, Jingyou; Finzi, Andrés; Liu, Shan-Lu; Liang, Chen",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02441-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28100616/,520

DESIGN Disease activity was assessed in biopsies collected in a phase II placebo-controlled ozanimod trial by four blinded pathologists using the Geboes (GS) and modified Riley (MRS) scores, the Robarts Histopathology (RHI) and Nancy Histological (NHI) indices and a Visual Analogue Scale. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Index responsiveness was evaluated by assessing longitudinal validity (Pearson correlations of changes in index scores and other disease measures), and effect size estimates (standardised effect size (SES)) using two criteria for change (treatment assignment and >2 point decrease in total Mayo Clinic score). Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve estimates evaluated the probability of the indices to discriminate between treatment and placebo. RESULTS Inter-rater reliability of the histological indices was substantial to almost perfect (ICC>0.61), and responsiveness was moderate to large (SES estimates>0.5); 0.81 (0.52, 1.10), 0.87 (0.58, 1.17), 0.57 (0.30, 0.84) and 0.81 (0.52, 1.09) when treatment assignment was the criterion for change and 1.05 (0.80, 1.31), 1.13 (0.87, 1.39), 0.88 (0.64, 1.12) and 1.06 (0.80, 1.31) for the change in Mayo score criterion for the GS, MRS, RHI and NHI, respectively.

116980,Randomized comparison of the feasibility of three anesthetic techniques for day-case open inguinal hernia repair.,2016,"Non-human primate (NHP) studies are often an essential component of antibody development efforts before human trials. Because the efficacy or toxicity of candidate antibodies may depend on their interactions with Fcγ receptors (FcγR) and their resulting ability to induce FcγR-mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-meditated cytotoxicity and phagocytosis (ADCP), the evaluation of human IgG variants with modulated affinity toward human FcγR is becoming more prevalent in both infectious disease and oncology studies in NHP. Reliable translation of these results necessitates analysis of the cross-reactivity of these human Fc variants with NHP FcγR. We report evaluation of the binding affinities of a panel of human IgG subclasses, Fc amino acid point mutants and Fc glycosylation variants against the common allotypes of human and rhesus macaque FcγR by applying a high-throughput array-based surface plasmon resonance platform. The resulting data indicate that amino acid variation present in rhesus FcγRs can result in disrupted, matched, or even increased affinity of IgG Fc variants compared with human FcγR orthologs. These observations emphasize the importance of evaluating species cross-reactivity and developing an understanding of the potential limitations or suitability of representative in vitro and in vivo models before human clinical studies when either efficacy or toxicity may be associated with FcγR engagement.","Boesch, Austin W; Miles, Adam R; Chan, Ying N; Osei-Owusu, Nana Y; Ackerman, Margaret E",mAbs,https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2016.1274845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28055295/,520
117060,Trocar site hernia after laparoscopic surgery: a qualitative systematic review.,2011,"INTRODUCTION Asthma is an important healthcare problem affecting millions in the United States. Additionally, a large proportion of patients with asthma suffer from obesity. These patients exhibit poor asthma control and reduced therapy response, increasing utilization of healthcare resources. Pulmonary symptoms improve after bariatric surgery (BS), and we hypothesized that asthma medication usage would decrease following BS. METHODS A retrospective data analysis was performed in adult patients from a single institution's database. Patients with obesity using at least one asthma medication pre-operatively who underwent BS were studied for up to 3-years post-operation. Poisson generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to evaluate the effects of time and procedure type on the number of asthma medication. RESULTS Bariatric patients with at least one prescribed asthma medication (mean 1.4 ± 0.6) were included (n = 751). The mean age at time of operation was 46.8 ± 11.6 years, mean weight was 295.9 ± 57 lbs, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 49 ± 8.2 kg/m2; 87.7% were female, 33.4% had diabetes, 44.2% used gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) medication, and 64.4% used hypertension medication. The most common procedure was Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (79%), followed by sleeve gastrectomy (10.7%), adjustable gastric banding (8.1%), and duodenal switch (2.3%). The mean number of prescribed asthma medications among all procedures decreased by 27% at 30 days post-operation (p < 0.0001), 37% at 6 months (p < 0.0001), 44% at 1 year (p < 0.0001), and 46% at 3 years (p < 0.0001) after adjusting for risk factors. No significant differences in medication use over time between procedure types were observed. In the adjusted analysis, the mean number of asthma medications was 12% higher in patients using at least one GERD medication (p = 0.015) and 8% higher with 10-unit increase in pre-operative BMI (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION BS significantly decreases asthma medication use starting 30 days post-operation with a sustained reduction for up to 3 years.","Guerron, Alfredo D; Ortega, Camila B; Lee, Hui-Jie; Davalos, Gerardo; Ingram, Jennifer; Portenier, Dana",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6500-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334159/,520

The methodology is based on State Space Advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (AFCMs), an evolution of the traditional Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Also, a rule-based mechanism is incorporated, to further increase the knowledge of the proposed system and the interpretability of the decision mechanism. The proposed method is evaluated utilizing a CAD dataset from the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the University Hospital of Patras, in Greece. Several experiments are conducted to define the optimal parameters of the proposed AFCM. Furthermore, the proposed AFCM is compared with the traditional FCM approach and the literature. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of the AFCM approach, obtaining 85.47% accuracy in CAD diagnosis, showing an improvement of +7% over the traditional approach. It is demonstrated that the AFCM approach in developing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps outperforms the conventional approach, while it constitutes a reliable method for the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease.","Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D; Groumpos, Peter P; Apostolopoulos, Dimitris I",Biomedical physics & engineering express,https://doi.org/10.1088/2057-1976/abfd83; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930876/,520

METHODS In a pilot study, 30 Wistar rats underwent laparoscopic caecum resection (as rats do not have an appendix vermiformis), to optimize the instrumental and surgical parameters. A subsequent test study was performed in another 30 rats to compare three different techniques for caecum resection and bowel closure. RESULTS Bipolar coagulation led to an insufficiency of caecal stump closure in all operated rats (Group 1, n = 10). Endoloop ligation followed by bipolar coagulation and resection (Group 2, n = 10) or resection with a LigaSure™ device (Group 3, n = 10) resulted in sufficient caecal stump closure. CONCLUSIONS We developed a LA model enabling us to compare three different caecum resection techniques in rats.

METHODS In this retrospective 44-hospital observational study, we used the Pediatric Health Information System database to identify infants aged ≤60 days evaluated for fever in emergency departments from January 2016 through December 2017. We described hospital-level variation in laboratory testing, including HSV, imaging and other diagnostic evaluations, acyclovir use, and LOS. We assessed the relationship between HSV testing and LOS using generalized linear mixed effects models adjusted for age and illness severity. RESULTS In 24 535 encounters for fever, the median HSV testing frequency across hospitals was 35.6% (interquartile range [IQR]: 28.5%-53.5%) for infants aged 0 to 21 days and 12% (IQR: 8.6%-15.7%) for infants aged 22 to 60 days. Among HSV-tested patients, median acyclovir use across hospitals was 79.2% (IQR: 68.1%-89.7%) for those aged 0 to 21 days and 63.6% (IQR: 44.1%-73%) for those aged 22 to 60 days. The prevalence of additional testing varied substantially by hospital and age group. Risk-adjusted LOS for HSV-tested infants was significantly longer than risk-adjusted LOS for those not tested (2.6 vs 1.9 days, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Substantial variation exists in diagnostic evaluation and acyclovir use, and infants who received HSV testing had a longer LOS than infants who did not. This variability supports the need for further studies to help clinicians better risk-stratify febrile infants and to guide HSV testing and treatment decisions.","Treasure, Jennifer D; Shah, Samir S; Hall, Matt; Mahant, Sanjay; Berry, Jay G; Kimberlin, David W; Schondelmeyer, Amanda C",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2020-003129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400513/,520

Materials and methods Synergy testing by E-test was performed with various antibiotic combinations in 10 S. maltophilia isolates identified as a cause of infection. The antibiotics used in the study included tigecycline (TGC), cefoperazone-sulbactam (CPS), ceftazidime (TZ), levofloxacin (LEV), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) (TS). Four different combinations (TGCCPS, TGC-TZ, TGC-LEV, TGC-TS) were studied with the E-test synergy method. Results S. maltophilia isolates were found to have the highest level of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, and levofloxacin. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index was calculated as FIC = MICAB/MICA + MICBA/MICB. The FIC index values were calculated and classified as synergistic (FIC < 0.5), additive (FIC = 0.5–1), indifferent (FIC = 1–4), and antagonistic (FIC > 4). According to FIC index values, synergy was found with the highest rate with TGC-CPS and TGC-LEV combinations (20%). Antagonistic activity was not found in any combination. Conclusion When trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole cannot be used because of resistance or allergy, tigecycline alone or in combination may be included as an alternative option. Although in vitro results are promising, clinical data are required.","Karamanlıoğlu, Dilek; Dizbay, Murat",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-1808-55; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866602/,520

We explored the application of the natural polymer hyaluronan (HA) as a promising immunological adjuvant for protein-based vaccines. Chemical conjugation of HA to antigens strongly increased their immunogenicity, reduced booster requirements, and allowed antigen dose sparing. HA-based bioconjugates stimulated robust and long-lasting humoral responses without the addition of other immunostimulatory compounds and proved highly efficient when compared to other adjuvants. Due to its intrinsic biocompatibility, HA allowed the exploitation of different injection routes and did not induce inflammation at the inoculation site. This polymer promoted rapid translocation of the antigen to draining lymph nodes, thus facilitating encounters with antigen-presenting cells. Overall, HA can be regarded as an effective and biocompatible adjuvant to be exploited for the design of a wide variety of vaccines.","Dalla Pietà, Anna; Carpanese, Debora; Grigoletto, Antonella; Tosi, Anna; Dalla Santa, Silvia; Pedersen, Gabriel Kristian; Christensen, Dennis; Meléndez-Alafort, Laura; Barbieri, Vito; De Benedictis, Paola; Pasut, Gianfranco; Montagner, Isabella Monia; Rosato, Antonio",Cellular & molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-021-00667-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762685/,520
119823,Extraumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with standard laparoscopic instruments.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly described virus responsible for the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), named by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February/2020. Patients with Covid-19 have an incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of 15.9-29% and sepsis is observed in all deceased patients. Moreover, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is one of the major underlying causes of death among these patients. In patients with DIC, there is a decrease in fibrinogen and an increase in D-dimer levels. Some studies have shown that fibrinogen and one of its end products, D-dimer, might have a predictive value for mortality in patients with non-Covid sepsis secondary to complications of DIC. Therefore, anticoagulation, considering its mortality benefits in cases of non-Covid sepsis, may also have an important role in the treatment of Covid-19. METHODS We reviewed the literature of all studies published by April 2020 on patients infected with Covid-19. Our review was limited to D-dimer and fibrinogen changes and anticoagulation recommendations. RESULTS Anticoagulation therapy can be started following the DIC diagnosis in Covid-19 patients despite the bleeding risks. In addition, the current evidence suggests a routine use of anticoagulation, particularly in patients with higher D-dimer levels (> 3.0 μg/mL). CONCLUSION Covid-19 is a systemic, hypercoagulable disease requiring more studies concerning treatment. Aanticoagulation is still an issue to be studied, but D-dimer rise and disease severity are the indicative factors to start treatment as soon as possible.","Hayıroğlu, Mert İlker; Çınar, Tufan; Tekkeşin, Ahmet İlker",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.6.842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696883/,520

We aimed to determine whether DNT improved over time in the Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Acute Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) and the clinical predictors of DNT. Temporal trends in DNT were assessed across fourths of time since activation of study centers using generalized linear model. Predictors of long DNT (>60 min) were determined in logistic regression models. Overall mean DNT (min) was 71.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 70.4-73.2), but decreased significantly over time (fourths): 77.9 (74.9-80.9), 69.3 (66.7-72.0), 69.1 (66.5-71.8) and 71.4 (68.7-74.2) (P for trend, 0.003). The reduction in DNT was particularly marked in China (P for trend, 0.001), but was not significant across the other participating countries (P for trend, 0.065). Independent predictors of long DNT were recruitment from China, short onset-to-door time, lower numbers of patients treated per center, higher diastolic blood pressure, off-hour admission, and absence of proximal clot occlusion. DNT in ENCHANTED declined progressively during the trial, especially in China. However, DNT in China is still longer than the key performance parameter of ≤60 minutes recommended in guidelines. Effective national programs are needed to improve DNT in China.","Yang, Jie; Wang, Xia; Yu, Jian Ping; Hang, Jing; Lavados, Pablo; Robinson, Thompson; Arima, Hisatomi; Lindley, Richard I; Anderson, Craig S; Chalmers, John",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-14164-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29074964/,520

120864,Techniques and pitfalls of laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients.,2018,"OBJECTIVES This study assessed the feasibility and efficacy of a new sutureless connector for end-to-end arterial anastomosis. METHODS The anastomotic device is a connector consisting of a bare-metal stent with spikes covering its outer surface, which is introduced through the prosthesis. The seal of the anastomosis is obtained by inflating a balloon anchoring the stent with the spikes in the prosthesis and in the receiving artery. This experiment was conducted in three phases: (1) A feasibility study was done on four cadaveric femoral arteries using a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis, with measurement of the penetration of the spikes into the layers of the arterial wall. (2) Bench tests were conducted in seven automated and in seven sutured anastomoses. Anastomosis sealing was tested using a pump system (≤250 mm Hg) in a water-filled closed circuit. (3) The infrarenal aorta of seven pigs was replaced with a 6- to 8-mm diameter prosthesis, using this automated device for the proximal anastomosis. The distal anastomosis was handsewn on the aortic bifurcation. After completion angiography, animals were euthanized for macroscopic and histologic studies of the aorta, connector, and prosthesis. Explantations were done immediately (2 pigs), and at 15 (2 pigs), at 30 (2 pigs), and 42 days (1 pig). Study end points were the automated anastomosis time compared with manual suturing, leakage, mechanical strength, and patency of the anastomosis together with the histologic changes of the aortic wall in contact with the spiked stent. RESULTS Tests performed on four cadaveric arteries showed complete penetration of the spikes into the arterial wall layers without metal fracture. Tests of traction showed that the median force needed to rupture the automated anastomosis was 18.3 N (interquartile range [IQR], 17.7-19.9 N), with no significant difference from the handmade anastomosis (19.5 N; IQR, 17.9-20.2 N, P = .33). No leakage was demonstrated in vitro with a pulsatile flow and a pressure up to 250 mm Hg. The median automated anastomosis time on pig aorta was 2.4 minutes (IQR, 1.4-3.3 min) vs 17.0 minutes (IQR, 15.1-17.2 minutes) for the handmade aortic anastomosis performed on the same animals (P = .002). There was no anastomotic leak. Histology showed incorporation of the connector spikes in the aortic wall, without intimal hyperplasia or false aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study confirms the feasibility of this sutureless system, suggesting its usefulness for a faster and simpler anastomosis in hybrid arterial surgery.","Abou Taam, Salam; Garbé, Jean-François; Boufi, Mourad; Bossavy, Jean-Pierre; Ricco, Jean-Baptiste",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2011.07.082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22136752/,520
120998,Single-port Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: toward a less invasive procedure with the same surgical results and a better cosmesis.,2013,"BACKGROUND Mechanical ventilation is a well-known trigger for lung inflammation. Research focuses on tidal volume reduction to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. Mechanical ventilation is usually applied with higher than physiological oxygen fractions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the after effect of oxygen supplementation during a spontaneous ventilation set up, in order to avoid the inflammatory response linked to mechanical ventilation. METHODS A prospective randomised study using New Zealand rabbits in a university research laboratory was carried out. Rabbits (n = 20) were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 5 each group). Groups 1 and 2 were submitted to 0.5 L/min oxygen supplementation, for 20 or 75 minutes, respectively; groups 3 and 4 were left at room air for 20 or 75 minutes. Ketamine/xylazine was administered for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Lungs were obtained for histological examination in light microscopy. RESULTS All animals survived the complete experiment. Procedure duration did not influence the degree of inflammatory response. The hyperoxic environment was confirmed by blood gas analyses in animals that were subjected to oxygen supplementation, and was accompanied with lower mean respiratory rates. The non-oxygen supplemented group had lower mean oxygen arterial partial pressures and higher mean respiratory rates during the procedure. All animals showed some inflammatory lung response. However, rabbits submitted to oxygen supplementation showed significant more lung inflammation (Odds ratio = 16), characterized by more infiltrates and with higher cell counts; the acute inflammatory response cells was mainly constituted by eosinophils and neutrophils, with a relative proportion of 80 to 20% respectively. This cellular observation in lung tissue did not correlate with a similar increase in peripheral blood analysis. CONCLUSIONS Oxygen supplementation in spontaneous breathing is associated with an increased inflammatory response when compared to breathing normal room air. This inflammatory response was mainly constituted with polymorphonuclear cells (eosinophils and neutrophils). As confirmed in all animals by peripheral blood analyses, the eosinophilic inflammatory response was a local organ event.","Machado, Humberto S; Nunes, Catarina S; Sá, Paula; Couceiro, Antonio; da Silva, Álvaro Moreira; Águas, Artur",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2253-14-86; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320562/,520

Urease, in combination with TRGO, allowed us to create a mediator-free amperometric biosensor with the intention of precise detection of urea in clinical trials. Beyond simplicity of the technology, the biosensor exhibited high sensitivity (2.3 ± 0.1 µA cm-2 mM-1), great operational and storage stabilities (up to seven months), and appropriate reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD) about 2%). The analytical recovery of the TRGO-based biosensor in urine of 101 ÷ 104% with RSD of 1.2 ÷ 1.7% and in blood of 92.7 ÷ 96.4%, RSD of 1.0 ÷ 2.5%, confirmed that the biosensor is acceptable and reliable. These properties allowed us to apply the biosensor in the monitoring of urea levels in samples of urine, blood, and spent dialysate collected during hemodialysis. Accuracy of the biosensor was validated by good correlation (R = 0.9898 and R = 0.9982) for dialysate and blood, utilizing approved methods. The advantages of the proposed biosensing technology could benefit the development of point-of-care and non-invasive medical instruments.","Razumiene, Julija; Gureviciene, Vidute; Sakinyte, Ieva; Rimsevicius, Laurynas; Laurinavicius, Valdas",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20164496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796728/,520

Intestinal ischemic injury plays prominent role in chemotherapeutic enteritis clinically. However, mechanism is not clear. In this article, irinotecan (CPT-11) was used to establish chemotherapeutic enteritis mice model. Western blotting, gelatin zymography, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) were used to detect the pathogenesis of ischemia-hypoxia injury. CPT-11 increased levels of tissue factor (TF) both in the blood and in intestines, and decreased the intestinal blood flow in mice. Interestingly, the elevation of TF in the blood displayed ""double-peak,"" which was consistent with the intestinal mucosal ""double-strike"" injury trend. Intestinal microthrombus and mixed thrombus formation were detectable in chemotherapeutic enteritis. Furthermore, ozone therapy relieved chemotherapeutic enteritis in mice. Ozone inhibited TF expression induced by CPT-11 via activating AMPK/SOCS3, and effectively ameliorated the intestinal mucosal injury in mice. Moreover, ozone autotransfusion therapy effectively attenuated chemotherapeutic enteritis and the blood hypercoagulability in patients. For the first time, we proposed that TF-induced thrombotic intestinal ischemic injury is a core trigger pathological mechanism of chemotherapeutic enteritis, and provided a new treatment strategy, ozone therapy, to suppress TF expression and treat chemotherapeutic enteritis.","Yu, Qingqing; Yang, Xing; Zhang, Chen; Zhang, Xiaotao; Wang, Chaoyu; Chen, Lu; Liu, Xiaolin; Gu, Yufeng; He, Xueming; Hu, Liang; Liu, Wen-Tao; Li, Yan",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.201902717rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776374/,520

Currently, only few antiviral agents are available for the treatment of MERS, but their effects have been greatly impaired by low antiviral activity, poor metabolic stability, and serious adverse effects. Therefore, the development of effective treatment for MERS is urgently needed. In this study, a series of heptad repeat 1 (HR1) peptide inhibitors have been developed to inhibit HR1/HR2-mediated membrane fusion between MERS-CoV and host cells, which is the major pathway of MERS-CoV-induced host infections. Particularly, peptide pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) exhibits potent inhibitory activity with IC50 of 1.171 μM, and its inhibitory effects can be further increased to 10-fold by forming a gold nanorod complex (PIH-AuNRs). In addition, PIH-AuNRs display enhanced metabolic stability and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, effectively prevent MERS-CoV-associated membrane fusion. In summary, PIH-AuNRs represent a novel class of antiviral agents and have a great potential in treating MERS in the clinic.","Huang, Xinyu; Li, Meng; Xu, Yurui; Zhang, Jikang; Meng, Xia; An, Xueying; Sun, Lei; Guo, Leilei; Shan, Xue; Ge, Junliang; Chen, Jiao; Luo, Yadong; Wu, Heming; Zhang, Yu; Jiang, Qing; Ning, Xinghai",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b04240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099550/,520

The aim of this study was to share our experiences with hybrid PD in laparoscopic and robotic surgery. METHODS Sixty-four patients underwent hybrid PD in which specimen resection and gastrojejunostomy were performed through the laparoscopic route and pancreatojejunostomy and hepaticojejunostomy were performed via a robotic approach by the same surgeon at a single institution between July 2016 and June 2019. The primary endpoint was complications; secondary endpoints were operative time (OT), the length of hospital stay, and blood loss. The data for the patients were retrospectively obtained from electrical medical records. RESULTS All patients underwent surgery with the hybrid procedure. The mean OTs and estimated blood loss (EBL) were 309.7 ± 77.6 min (range 17-620 min), 160 ± 31.7 mL (range 50-800 mL). The mean number of lymph nodes retrieved was 7.3 ± 6.7 (range 0-37), and that among 45 malignant cases was 8.42 ± 6.7 (range 1-37). The average length of postoperative stay in the hospital was 11.14 ± 7.03 days (range 6-47 days). Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistulas (POPFs) occurred in 39 (60.9%) cases, and most were biochemical leak POPF (29 cases, 45.3%); only 10 (15.6%) cases were grade B/C (8 cases were Grade B and 2 cases were Grade C treated with digital subtraction angiography). Bile leakage occurred in 2 (3.1%) patients. One (1.5%) patient had a gastric fistula, and 3 (4.7%) developed postoperative delayed gastric emptying categorized as International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) Grade A. Three (4.7%) patients were readmitted for postoperative bleeding, and 2 (3.1%) died within 30 days. CONCLUSION Hybrid PD with laparoscopic and robot surgery is safe and feasible.

A. baumannii has emerged as a nosocomial pathogen that exhibits high levels of resistance to antibiotics, and remains resilient against traditional cleaning measures with resistance to Colistin increasingly reported. Given the magnitude and costs associated with hospital acquired infections, and the increase in multidrug-resistant organisms, it is worth re-evaluating our current approaches and looking for alternatives or adjuncts to traditional antibiotics therapies.

The virus binds to target cells by use of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and interacts with the ACE2 protein. Subsequent events, including virus internalization and trafficking, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we mapped the process of HCoV-NL63 entry into the LLC-Mk2 cell line and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) tracheobronchial tissue. Using a variety of techniques, we have shown that HCoV-NL63 virions require endocytosis for successful entry into the LLC-MK2 cells, and interaction between the virus and the ACE2 molecule triggers recruitment of clathrin. Subsequent vesicle scission by dynamin results in virus internalization, and the newly formed vesicle passes the actin cortex, which requires active cytoskeleton rearrangement. Finally, acidification of the endosomal microenvironment is required for successful fusion and release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For 3D tracheobronchial tissue cultures, we also observed that the virus enters the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but we obtained results suggesting that this pathway may be bypassed.IMPORTANCE Available data on coronavirus entry frequently originate from studies employing immortalized cell lines or undifferentiated cells. Here, using the most advanced 3D tissue culture system mimicking the epithelium of conductive airways, we systematically mapped HCoV-NL63 entry into susceptible cells.

To this end, lower limb functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling holds promise. OBJECTIVE To investigate pain reduction in a sample of patients with SCI by means of lower limb rehabilitation using FES cycling. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Sixteen patients with incomplete and complete SCIs, attending the Neurorobotic Unit of our research institute and reporting pain at or below the level of their SCI were recruited to this exploratory study. INTERVENTIONS Patients undertook two daily sessions of FES cycling, six times weekly, for 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES Pain outcomes were measured using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), the Multidimensional Pain Inventory for SCI (MPI-SCI), and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Finally, we assessed the features of dorsal laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to objectively evaluate Aδ ﬁber pathways. RESULTS All participants tolerated the intervention well, and completed the training without side effects. Statistically significant changes were found in pain-NRS, MPI-SCI, and SF-36 scores, and LEP amplitudes. Following treatment, we found that three patients experienced high pain relief (an NRS decrease of at least 80%), six individuals achieved moderate pain relief (an NRS decrease of about 30-70%), and five participants had mild pain relief (an NRS decrease of less than 30%). CONCLUSION Our preliminary results suggest that FES cycling training is capable of reducing the pain reported by patients with SCI, regardless of American Spinal Injury Association scoring, pain level, or the neurological level of injury.

123156,Bikini Line Sleeve Gastrectomy: Initial Report.,2017,"Amidst the growing literature on global health, much has been written recently about the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) countries and their involvement and potential impact in global health, particularly in relation to development assistance. Rather less has been said about countries' motivations for involvement in global health negotiations, and there is a notable absence of evidence when their motivations are speculated on. This article uses an existing framework linking engagement in global health to foreign policy to explore differing levels of engagement by BRICS countries in the global health arena, with a particular focus on access to medicines. It concludes that countries' differing and complex motivations reinforce the need for realistic, pragmatic approaches to global health debates and their analysis. It also underlines that these analyses should be informed by analysis from other areas of foreign policy.","Watt, Nicola F; Gomez, Eduardo J; McKee, Martin",Health policy and planning,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czt063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24072881/,520
123377,The Superior Inguinal Ligament Approach of Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery for Total Extraperitoneal Inguinal Hernia Repair.,2017,"BACKGROUND Exome sequencing has become a commonly used clinical diagnostic test. Multiple studies have examined the diagnostic utility and individual laboratory performance of exome testing; however, no previous study has surveyed and compared the data quality from multiple clinical laboratories. METHODS We examined sequencing data from 36 clinical exome tests from 3 clinical laboratories. Exome data were compared in terms of overall characteristics and coverage of specific genes and nucleotide positions. The sets of genes examined included genes in Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) (n = 17723), a subset of genes clinically relevant to epilepsy (n = 108), and genes that are recommended for reporting of secondary findings (n = 57; excludes X-linked genes). RESULTS The average exome nucleotide coverage (≥20×) of each laboratory varied at 96.49% (CV = 3%), 96.54% (CV = 1%), and 91.68% (CV = 4%), for laboratories A, B, and C, respectively. For CCDS genes, the average number of completely covered genes varied at 12184 (CV = 29%), 11687 (CV = 13%), and 5989 (CV = 37%), for laboratories A, B, and C, respectively. With smaller subsets of genes related to epilepsy and secondary findings, the CV revealed low consistency, with a maximum CV seen in laboratory C for both epilepsy genes (CV = 60%) and secondary findings genes (CV = 71%). CONCLUSIONS Poor consistency in complete gene coverage was seen in the clinical exome laboratories surveyed. The degree of consistency varied widely between the laboratories.","Gotway, Garrett; Crossley, Eric; Kozlitina, Julia; Xing, Chao; Fan, Judy; Hornbuckle, Callie; Thies, Jenny; Michel, Donnice; Quinn, Christine; Scheuerle, Angela E; Umana, Luis A; Uhles, Crescenda L; Park, Jason Y",Clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem.2019.306795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609854/,520
123989,Is prophylactic laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair on the contralateral side justified in less developed regions? A comparative study of bilateral to unilateral repair.,2010,"BACKGROUND Studies on medication-related problems (MRPs) among pregnant women are scarce, despite the potential consequences for both mother and child. This study aimed to describe the prevalence, clinical significance, and risk factors for MRPs among hospitalized pregnant or postpartum women at Jimma University Medical Centre (JUMC) in Ethiopia. METHODS A prospective follow-up and clinical audit of 1117 hospitalized pregnant or postpartum women in the maternity and gynaecology wards at JUMC was carried out between February and June 2017. Patients were followed throughout their stay in the hospital to assess the presence and development of MRPs. Pre-tested data extraction form and an interview-guided structured questionnaire were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics were used to describe MRPs. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with MRPs. RESULTS One or more MRPs occurred among 323 (28.9%) study participants, mostly in relation to lack of iron supplementation. A total of 278 (70.6%) of all MRPs were considered to be of moderate to high clinical significance. When excluding MRPs due to iron from the analysis, chronic disease (adjusted OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.02, 3.58), medication use prior to admission (adjusted OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.24, 4.56), nulliparity (adjusted OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.22, 3.24) and multiparity (adjusted OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.17, 3.12) were significantly associated with experiencing an MRP. CONCLUSIONS Nearly 3 out of 10 hospitalized pregnant women at JUMC had one or more MRPs. The need for additional iron therapy was by far the most common type of MRP. Improved adherence to guidelines on iron supplementation are required. Multidisciplinary approaches including physicians, nurses, anesthesia professionals and clinical pharmacists in the maternity and gynaecology wards could possibly prevent MRPs and promote patient safety for women and children.","Ahmed, Seid Mussa; Sundby, Johanne; Aragaw, Yesuf Ahmed; Nordeng, Hedvig",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-03433-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243156/,520
124005,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy compared to a multidisciplinary weight loss program for obesity--effects on body composition and protein status.,2013,"Background In several anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ASB-ACLR) procedures, the femoral and tibial tunnel apertures are created at different locations within the native ACL attachment area. Hypothesis Graft length changes during knee motion will be different among ASB-ACLR procedures with different femoral and tibial tunnel aperture locations. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods A total of 12 cadaveric knees were used in this study. In each knee, 4 and 3 thin tunnels were created within the ACL attachment area on the femur and the tibia, respectively. Using 1 of 5 different combinations of femoral and tibial tunnel aperture location, 5 ASB-ACLRs were performed on each knee. In each reconstruction approach, a strong thread was used in place of the tendon graft, and the tibial graft end was tethered to a custom-made isometric positioner at 0° of knee flexion, with an approximately 12-N load applied to the thread. Then, each specimen underwent 5 cycles of knee flexion-extension motion in a range between 0° and 120°, and graft length changes were determined for each SB-ACLR approach. Results The length changes of the graft were significantly different among the 5 ASB-ACLRs. The maximum length change values of the 3 grafts that were implanted between the femoral and tibial centers of the posterolateral bundle attachments or implanted into the femoral tunnel created at the center of the fanlike extension fiber attachment were significantly greater than those of the graft implanted between the centers of the anteromedial bundle attachments (P < .0001) and of the graft implanted between the centers of the whole ACL attachments (P < .0001). Conclusion The length changes of the graft during knee motion were significantly different among the 5 ASB-ACLR approaches, even though all of the tunnel apertures were created within the femoral and tibial attachments of the native ACL. Clinical Relevance The grafts in the first 3 graft locations may be so relaxed during knee flexion that they cannot resist anterior drawer loads exerted on the tibia.","Tanabe, Yoshie; Yasuda, Kazunori; Kondo, Eiji; Kawaguchi, Yasuyuki; Akita, Keiichi; Yagi, Tomonori",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967119834933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937322/,520
124046,Safety and effectiveness of bariatric surgery: Roux-en-y gastric bypass is superior to gastric banding in the management of morbidly obese patients: a response.,2009,"Background Dexmedetomidine, a selective α 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist, has unique characteristics, such as maintained respiratory drive and production of arousable sedation. We describe development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine, taking into account the effect of stimulation on its sedative properties. Methods In a two-period, randomized study in 18 healthy volunteers, dexmedetomidine was delivered in a step-up fashion by means of target-controlled infusion using the Dyck model. Volunteers were randomized to a session without background noise and a session with pre-recorded looped operating room background noise. Exploratory pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and covariate analysis were conducted in NONMEM using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring of processed EEG. Results We found that both stimulation at the time of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale scoring and the presence or absence of ambient noise had an effect on the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine. The stimuli associated with MOAA/S scoring increased the BIS of sedated volunteers because of a transient 170% increase in the effect-site concentration necessary to reach half of the maximal effect. In contrast, volunteers deprived of ambient noise were more resistant to dexmedetomidine and required, on average, 32% higher effect-site concentrations for the same effect as subjects who were exposed to background operating room noise. Conclusions The new pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models might be used for effect-site rather than plasma concentration target-controlled infusion for dexmedetomidine in clinical practice, thereby allowing tighter control over the desired level of sedation.

We describe a simple modification that substantially facilitates insertion of the anvil into the esophagus and avoids oral injuries and complications. After mobilization of the stomach and esophagus, a semicircumferential esophagotomy is made at the anterior esophageal wall. An OrVil anvil (Orvil, Covidien, Norwalk, CT, USA) is delivered laparoscopically and secured with a POLYSORB (Covidien) suture to the esophagus. The suture is advanced anteriorly so that the center rod penetrates the esophageal wall. The esophagus is transected with the stapler at this point. A circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy is then performed using the hemidouble stapling technique. Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomies were performed for 40 patients with gastric cancers (T1N0M0). All procedures were completed laparoscopically without any complications. The time required to place the anvil averaged 5 min compared with 9 min reported by others. There were no major complications or mortality in this series. The major advantage of this technique is that circular stapling is much easier than linear stapling, allowing surgeons without advanced surgical skills in LATG to perform the procedure effectively and safely.","Muguruma, Kazuya; Tanaka, Hiroaki; Sakurai, Katsunobu; Toyokawa, Takahiro; Kubo, Naoshi; Yamashita, Yoshito; Sawada, Tetsuji; Ohira, Masaichi; Hirakawa, Kosei",International surgery,https://doi.org/10.9738/intsurg-d-13-00090.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444275/,520

124585,Short-term outcomes of laparoscopic single anastomosis gastric bypass (LSAGB) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in lower BMI (<30 kg/m(2)) patients.,2014,"UNLABELLED ♦ BACKGROUND Peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions containing icodextrin as the osmotic agent have advantages during long dwells. The glucose polymers that constitute icodextrin are a heterogeneous mix of molecules with a polydispersity [ratio of weight-average to number-average molecular weight (Mw/Mn)] of approximately 2.6. The present study evaluates whether modifications in the polydispersity and concentration of glucose polymers can improve ultrafiltration (UF) without an associated increase in carbohydrate absorption (CA). ♦ METHODS Computer simulations using a three-pore model of peritoneal transport during a long dwell in PD patients predict that, in general, compared with 7.5% icodextrin, glucose polymers with a Mw greater than or equal to 7.5 kDa, a polydispersity less than 2.6, and concentrations greater than 7% could achieve higher UF without higher CA. Based on the simulations, we hypothesized that, compared with 7.5% icodextrin, glucose polymers with a Mw of 18 - 19 kDa and a polydispersity of 2.0 at 11% concentration could achieve higher UF without a higher CA. We tested this hypothesis in experimental studies using 8-hour dwells in New Zealand White rabbits. In those studies, UF was measured by complete fluid collection, and CA was measured by subtracting the total carbohydrate in the collected fluid from the carbohydrate initially infused. ♦ RESULTS The UF was higher with 11% 19 kDa glucose polymer than with 7.5% icodextrin (mean ± standard deviation: 89 ± 31 mL vs 49 ± 15 mL; p = 0.004) without higher CA (5.2 ± 0.9 g vs 5.0 ± 0.9 g, p = 0.7). Similar results were seen with the 11% 18 kDa glucose polymer, which, compared with 7.5% icodextrin, resulted in higher UF (mean ± standard deviation: 96 ± 18 mL vs 66 ± 17 mL; p < 0.001) without higher CA (4.8 ± 0.7 g vs 5.2 ± 0.6 g, p = 0.2). ♦ CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate that, compared with 7.5% icodextrin solution, long-dwell PD solutions containing 11% glucose polymers with a Mw of 18-19 kDa and a polydispersity of 2.0 can provide higher UF without higher CA.","Leypoldt, John K; Hoff, Catherine M; Akonur, Alp; Holmes, Clifford J",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.3747/pdi.2013.00232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584616/,520

Complications associated with this access contribute to significant morbidity and mortality, while loss of access is an increasingly common reason for intestinal transplant referral. As more emphasis has been placed on the prevention of central line-associated blood stream infections and new technologies have developed, care for central lines has improved. However, as care has evolved independently in local centers, care of central venous access varies significantly in this vulnerable population.

125059,Video. Laparoscopic repair of congenital bilateral Morgagni hernia.,2011,"INTRODUCTION During the first peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German Ministry of Health recommended that elective treatments should be postponed to increase hospital capacities. This has also compromised the capacity for application of specialized Parkinson's disease (PD) therapies to an unknown extent. METHODS We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study using administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of PD receiving multimodal complex treatment (PD-MCT), initial setup of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) or continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) in Germany. We compared case numbers and clinical characteristics of the pandemic (March 16th - May 15th, 2020) and post-lockdown (July 16th - September 15th, 2020) period with the pre-pandemic (January 16th - March 15th, 2020) and historical control period (March 16th - May 15th, 2019). RESULTS We identified a strong decline for PD-MCT(-57.6%) and for the application of drug pump-based therapies (-69.4%) during the first peak phase of the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period while specialized PD treatment procedures increased again in the post-lockdown phase. The presence of motor fluctuations was an independent predictor for receiving PD-MCT during the pandemic period (OR: 1.245, CI 1.058-1.465). CONCLUSION Besides the marked decline in specialized PD treatments during the first peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found recuperative effects for these procedures in the post-lockdown period without reaching pre-pandemic levels. Strengthening treatment capacities for PD patients, even in the event of a persistent pandemic, is urgently needed in order to maintain the quality of care.","Richter, Daniel; Scherbaum, Raphael; Bartig, Dirk; Gold, Ralf; Krogias, Christos; Tönges, Lars",Parkinsonism & related disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2021.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845342/,520
125215,Initial experience of transanal total mesorectal excision with rigid or flexible transanal platforms in cadavers.,2016,"Objective: To analyzes epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and provide evidence for adjustment for COVID-19 prevention and control strategies. Methods: The data of COVID-19 cases in Wuchang district reported as of 19 March, 2020 were obtained from National Notifiable Disease Report System of Chinese Disease Prevention and Control Information System. The software's of Excel 2010, SPSSS 22.0, Arc GIS10.2 and Joinpoint regression program 4.8.0.0 were used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 7547 COVID-19 cases had been reported as of 19 March, 2020 in Wuchang district, including 5 448 confirmed cases (72.19%), 2009 clinical diagnosed cases (26.62%) and 90 asymptomatic cases case (1.19%). The age of the cases was (56.65±16.25) years and age ranged from 2 days to 105 years among confirmed cases, 2634 were males (48.35%) and 2814 were females (51.65%), 2 492 were retirees (45.74%). A total of 545 health workers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (7.22% of all cases) including 365 confirmed cases and 5 cases have died. A total of 430 cases of death were reported with case fatality rate of 7.89% (430/5 448), case fatality rate of males (10.9%, 266/2 634) was higher than that of females (5.82%, 164/2 814). The first phase of epidemic peak was from January 24 to January 26, the second phase of epidemic peak was from February 1 to February 5 and there was no one of new confirmed case in one day for the first time on March 18. The first four Streets with the highest incidence rates of confirmed cases were Huanghelou Street (1 043.77/100 000), Ziyang Street (627.97/100 000), Yangyuan Street (503.67/100 000) and Shuiguohu Street (486.02/100 000). Compared with females, aged ≤50 years and mild cases of clinical classification respectively, males (RR=0.690, 95%CI: 0.322-1.478), aged >50 years (RR=11.745, 95%CI: 6.878-20.058), severe cases (RR=2.317, 95%CI: 1.789-3.000) and critical cases of clinical classification (RR=10.794, 95%CI: 7.997-14.569), and gender time-dependent covariate (RR=1.392, 95%CI: 1.053-1.840) were major influencing factors of prognosis of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Conclusions: The gender, ages and occupation of distribution were wide among COVID-19 cases in Wuchang district. Males, aged >50 years, severe cases and critical cases of clinical classification were influencing factors of prognosis of COVID-19 confirmed cases. The standardized management of discharged cases, asymptomatic infected cases and close contact persons were main measures to reduce incidence rates of COVID-19 cases.","Chen, Y L; Wang, H; Zhou, Y N; Lu, Z H; Peng, M; Sun, F; Huang, Y H",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200412-00565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33297617/,520

Many programmes use campaigns to raise awareness of chlamydia screening in young people. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of campaigns on uptake of chlamydia screening in young people. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of articles assessing the outcomes of community-based health-promotion campaigns to increase chlamydia screening in young people, their experiences of the campaigns and other facilitators and barriers to the conduct of the campaigns. We searched four databases for quantitative and qualitative studies with no language restrictions. MAIN RESULTS From 10 329 records identified, 19 studies (20 articles) were included in the review: 14 quantitative, 2 qualitative and 3 mixed methods. All studies with quantitative outcomes were before-after study designs or interrupted time series. The prediction interval for relative change (RC) in test counts ranged from 0.95 to 1.56, with a summary pooled estimate of RC 1.22 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.30, 13 studies, I2=97%). For test positivity rate, 95% prediction interval was 0.59 to 1.48, with a summary pooled estimate of RC 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, 8 studies, I2=91.8%). Large variation in characteristics between studies precluded exploring outcomes by type of campaign components. Seven major qualitative themes to improve screening were identified: targeting of campaigns; quality of materials and message; language; anonymity; use of technology; relevance; and variety of testing options. CONCLUSIONS Health promotion campaigns aiming to increase chlamydia testing in those aged 15-24 years may show some effectiveness in increasing overall numbers of tests, however numbers of positive tests do not follow the same trend. Qualitative findings indicate that campaigns require clear, relevant messaging that displays the full range of testing options and assures anonymity in order to be effective.","Pearce, Emma; Jolly, Kate; Harris, Isobel Marion; Adriano, Ada; Moore, David; Price, Malcolm; Ross, Jonathan",Sexually transmitted infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-055142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34446545/,520

126696,Single-incision versus conventional laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy: a case-matched series.,2012,"Although osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a known primary limitation of long-term or high-dose clinical administration of glucocorticoids, the mechanisms underlying this side effect remain unclear. Hypoxia is an important biological state under numerous pathological conditions. In this study, we investigated glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis under hypoxic conditions in the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line using a cell cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting. 6α-Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSL) more effectively induced apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions. Correspondingly, MPSL more effectively upregulated cellular levels of cleaved caspase 3, p53, and its target p21, and downregulated cyclin D1 levels in hypoxia. Moreover, overexpression of Akt abrogated the MPSL activation of p53, p21, and cleaved caspase 3 and the attenuation of cyclin D1 expression and rescued osteoblasts from MPSL-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, indicating that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling might play an essential role in MPSL-induced inhibition of osteoblasts. Furthermore, the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling and upregualtion of cellular p85α monomer levels by MPSL were more pronounced under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions. Finally, we found that the enhancement of the effects of MPSL under hypoxic conditions was attributed to hypoxia-upregulated glucocorticoid receptor activity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MPSL, a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist, promotes the level of p85α and inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts, and that this effect is enhanced under hypoxic conditions.","Zou, Wanjing; Yang, Shu; Zhang, Tie; Sun, Haimei; Wang, Yuying; Xue, Hong; Zhou, Deshan",Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00774-014-0627-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230819/,520
126999,Novel technique for a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) approach to cholecystectomy: single-institution case series.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical and histologic ocular anatomy of the black-tailed prairie dog (PD). ANIMALS STUDIED Seventeen captive black-tailed PDs (11 males and six females), ranging in age from approximately 4 months to 4.5 years. PROCEDURES Complete ocular examinations, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. The globes (n = 2) of one black-tailed PD were harvested immediately after euthanasia and processed after formalin fixation. Staining with hematoxylin-eosin, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, glial fibrillary acidic protein, chromogranin A, claudin-5, smooth muscle actin, and vimentin was performed for light microscopic evaluation. RESULTS A thick mucinous precorneal tear film was present on the ocular surface. A vestigial nictitating membrane was identified in the medial canthus area. The limbus was heavily pigmented, the iris was a dark homogenous brown, and the pupil was round. Funduscopically, there was no tapetum lucidum, the retinal vascular pattern was holangiotic, and a horizontally elongated optic disk was visualized. The most common ocular abnormalities were acquired eyelid margin defects, present in seven eyes of six black-tailed PDs (35.3%). On histologic examination, the retina was asymmetric, thicker below the optic disk and thinner above it.

However, much uncertainty surrounds intensification of high-magnitude events that are often inadequately resolved by global climate models. In this analysis, we develop a framework involving targeted dynamical downscaling of historical and future extreme precipitation events produced by a large ensemble of a global climate model. This framework is applied to extreme ""atmospheric river"" storms in California. We find a substantial (10 to 40%) increase in total accumulated precipitation, with the largest relative increases in valleys and mountain lee-side areas. We also report even higher and more spatially uniform increases in hourly maximum precipitation intensity, which exceed Clausius-Clapeyron expectations. Up to 85% of this increase arises from thermodynamically driven increases in water vapor, with a smaller contribution by increased zonal wind strength. These findings imply substantial challenges for water and flood management in California, given future increases in intense atmospheric river-induced precipitation extremes.","Huang, Xingying; Swain, Daniel L; Hall, Alex D",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba1323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832619/,520

127143,Gasless single-port access laparoscopy using a J-shaped retractor in patients undergoing adnexal surgery.,2020-05-22,"INTRODUCTION Acute hemodynamic decompensation during catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is associated with increased mortality. We assessed the effectiveness of mechanical circulatory support using a micro-axial percutaneous assist device in preventing acute hemodynamic decompensation. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-six consecutive patients with structural heart disease undergoing 28 ventricular tachycardia ablations between May 2013 and October 2017 were included. All patients presenting with left ventricular ejection fraction < 25%, symptomatic heart failure and arrhythmia associated hemodynamic decompensation underwent catheter ablation with mechanical circulatory support (Impella 2.5™; Impella CP™, Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA). Electro-anatomic mapping was performed using Ensite™ NavX™ (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA) or Rhythmia™ (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) mapping systems. Mapping/ablation strategy included substrate and activation mapping/ablation. Of the 26 patients, 80 % had ischemic cardiomyopathy, mean age was 68±9 years; mean left ventricular ejection fraction 19.6±3%, mean PAAINESD score was 21±3. Mean tachycardia cycle length was 348±76 ms (range: 280-500 ms). The assist device was used pre-emptively in 25 patients and as rescue therapy in one patient. All ventricular tachycardias occurring during substrate ablation were activation mapped and ablated. The ablation procedure was accomplished in 25 0f 26 patients, acute decompensation occurred only in one patient receiving circulatory support as bail-out therapy. CONCLUSION In patients with advanced heart failure and a high probability of acute hemodynamic decompensation during catheter ablation, mechanical circulatory support prevented acute decompensation in 25 of 26 patients. Thus, mechanical circulatory support facilitates catheter ablation of unstable ventricular tachycardia in a critically ill patient population. This article is protected by copyright.

127359,Feasibility of the Reconstruction with Fascia Lata Patch on the Abdominal Wall Defect After Resection of the Abdominal Desmoid Tumor.,2020,"Acute-on-chronic liver injury is characterized by an important inflammatory response frequently associated with endotoxemia. In this context, acute-phase proteins such as Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) are released; however, little is known about their role in chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of PTX3 in liver injury. The role of PTX3 was evaluated in cultured human cells, liver tissue slices, and mice with acute-on-chronic liver injury. PTX3 expression was assessed in tissue and serum samples from 54 patients with alcoholic hepatitis. PTX3 expression was up-regulated in animal models of liver injury and strongly induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Liver cell fractionation showed that macrophages and activated hepatic stellate cells were the main cell types expressing PTX3 in liver injury. Ex vivo and in vivo studies showed that PTX3 treatment attenuated LPS-induced liver injury, inflammation, and cell recruitment. Mechanistically, PTX3 mediated the hepatic stellate cell wound-healing response. Moreover, PTX3 modulated LPS-induced inflammation in human primary liver macrophages and peripheral monocytes by enhancing a TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-dependent response and favoring a macrophage interleukin-10-like phenotype. Additionally, hepatic and plasma PTX3 levels were increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, a prototypic acute-on-chronic condition; and its expression correlated with disease severity scores, endotoxemia, infections, and short-term mortality, thus suggesting that expression of PTX3 found in patients could be a counterregulatory response to injury. CONCLUSION Experimental and human evidence suggests that, in addition to being a potential biomarker for alcoholic hepatitis, PTX3 participates in the wound-healing response and attenuates LPS-induced liver injury and inflammation; therefore, administration of PTX3 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in acute-on-chronic conditions, particularly those associated with endotoxemia.

Immunomodulator drugs, including biologics, are a mainstay of treatment for this disease. AREAS COVERED This review details the safety profiles of various biologic therapies currently available commercially that have been tried for HS as assessed in clinical trials and observational studies. As the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe HS, adalimumab is discussed in the most detail. Additional biologic medications, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) inhibitors, interleukin 1 (IL-1) inhibitors, IL-12 and IL-23 inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, and IL-23 inhibitors are discussed as well. Safety concerns in special populations, including pregnant women and children, are outlined. EXPERT OPINION Existing data supports excellent short-term and long-term safety profiles for adalimumab, although caution must be taken with use in high-risk patient populations, including those with chronic infections or increased risk of malignancy. Based on their safety data for other indications, additional biologic agents appear safe in HS as well. However, further research is needed to fully understand the safety profiles of these medications in the HS population.","Holcomb, Zachary E; Porter, Martina L; Kimball, Alexa B",Expert opinion on drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2021.1924147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910441/,520

Researchers have made great efforts to investigate SARS-CoV-2. However, there are few studies analyzing the general situation of SARS-CoV-2 research at global level. This study aimed to characterize global scientific efforts based on SARS-CoV-2 publications. METHODOLOGY SARS-CoV-2 -related publications were retrieved using Web of Science. The number of publications, citation, country, journal, study topic, total confirmed cases, and total deaths were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 441 publications were identified. China contributed the largest number of publications (198, 44.90%), followed by USA (51, 11.56%), Italy (28, 6.35%), Germany (19, 4.31%), and South Korea (13, 2.95%). Upper-middle-income economies (51.70%) produced the most SARS-CoV-2 publications, followed by high-income (45.12%), lower-middle-income (2.95%), and low-income economies (0.23%). The research output had a significant correlations with total confirmed cases (r = 0.666, p = 0.000) and total deaths (r = 0.610, p = 0.000). China had the highest total citations (1947), followed by USA (204), and Germany (54). China also had the highest average citations (9.83), followed by Netherlands (5.80), and Canada (5.43). The most popular journals were Journal of Medical Virology, Eurosurveillance, and Emerging Microbes and Infections. The most discussed topic was the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS Scientific research on SARS-CoV-2 is from worldwide researchers' efforts, with some countries and journals having special contributions.

127914,Lower abdominal wall pain and contusion in single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2010,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The goal of reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke is to limit brain infarction. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment on functional outcome could be explained by a reduction in post-treatment infarct volume. METHODS The Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial was a multicenter randomized open-label trial with blinded outcome evaluation. Among 315 enrolled subjects (endovascular treatment n=165; control n=150), 314 subject's infarct volumes at 24 to 48 hours on magnetic resonance imaging (n=254) or computed tomography (n=60) were measured. Post-treatment infarct volumes were compared by treatment assignment and recanalization/reperfusion status. Appropriate statistical models were used to assess relationship between baseline clinical and imaging variables, post-treatment infarct volume, and functional status at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale). RESULTS Median post-treatment infarct volume in all subjects was 21 mL (interquartile range =65 mL), in the intervention arm, 15.5 mL (interquartile range =41.5 mL), and in the control arm, 33.5 mL (interquartile range =84 mL; P<0.01). Baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (P<0.01), site of occlusion (P<0.01), baseline noncontrast computed tomographic scan Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS) (P<0.01), and recanalization (P<0.01) were independently associated with post-treatment infarct volume, whereas age, sex, treatment type, intravenous alteplase, and time from onset to randomization were not (P>0.05). Post-treatment infarct volume (P<0.01) and delta National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (P<0.01) were independently associated with 90-day modified Rankin Scale, whereas laterality (left versus right) was not. CONCLUSIONS These results support the primary results of the ESCAPE trial and show that the biological underpinning of the success of endovascular therapy is a reduction in infarct volume.

127919,Laparoscopic versus open incisional hernia repair: a retrospective cohort study with costs analysis on 269 patients.,2017,"BACKGROUND In colonially breeding birds, the ability to discriminate between individuals is often essential. During post-fledging care, parents have to recognize their own offspring among many other unrelated chicks in the breeding colony. It is well known that fledglings and food-provisioning parents of many bird species use contact calls to convey their identity. These calls are also often used as hunger-related signals of need in young birds. Here, we investigate how such calls incorporate signals of need and at the same time act as reliable indicators of each chick's identity. RESULTS In a field study, we experimentally manipulated the hunger level of colonially breeding Jackson's golden-backed weaver (Ploceus jacksoni) nestlings close to fledging and investigated its effects on acoustic call parameters. Some acoustic parameters that were related to the time-frequency pattern showed high individuality and were largely unaffected by a nestling's state of hunger. However, the majority of call parameters were significantly affected by hunger. Interestingly, most of these acoustic parameters showed both consistent changes with hunger and high between-individual differences, i.e. potential for individual recognition. CONCLUSION The results indicate that individual recognition processes can be based on static, hunger-independent call parameters, but also on dynamic hunger-related parameters that show high individuality. Furthermore, these signal properties suggest that the assessment of signals of need can be improved if the signal value is referenced to a chick's vocal spectrum.","Reers, Hendrik; Jacot, Alain",BMC ecology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-11-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21269465/,520

They are recruited to centrosomes in dividing cells via binding to N-terminal CM1 domains within γ-TuRC-tethering proteins, including Drosophila Centrosomin (Cnn). Binding promotes microtubule nucleation and is restricted to centrosomes in dividing cells, but the mechanism regulating binding remains unknown. Here, we identify an extreme N-terminal CM1 autoinhibition (CAI) domain found specifically within the centrosomal isoform of Cnn (Cnn-C) that inhibits γ-TuRC binding. Robust binding occurs after removal of the CAI domain or with the addition of phosphomimetic mutations, suggesting that phosphorylation helps relieve inhibition. We show that regulation of Cnn binding to γ-TuRCs is isoform specific and that misregulation of binding can result in ectopic cytosolic microtubules and major defects during cell division. We also find that human CDK5RAP2 is autoinhibited from binding γ-TuRCs, suggesting conservation across species. Overall, our results shed light on how and why CM1 domain binding to γ-TuRCs is regulated.","Tovey, Corinne A; Tsuji, Chisato; Egerton, Alice; Bernard, Fred; Guichet, Antoine; de la Roche, Marc; Conduit, Paul T",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202010020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042945/,520

As the organism ages, the ability to maintain homeostasis and regeneration deteriorates and the number and activity of stem cells decline. Theoretically, the restoration of stem cells might reverse aging.

Drug reactions rarely affect both organs concurrently. The clinical features, risk factors, and prognostic markers of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in patients with SJS/TEN are not well studied. Materials and Methods The clinical features, risk factors, and prognostic markers of DILI in patients with SJS/TEN hospitalized at the dermatology department of our hospital from January 2009 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Results A total of 298 patients with SJS/TEN were enrolled in this study. Of them, 40 had liver injury and the rest served as control. Causative drugs mainly included antipodagrics (xanthine oxidase inhibitors occupying 100% among antipodagrics), anticonvulsants (dibenzazepine occupying 76.92% among anticonvulsants), and traditional Chinese medicines. There was a statistically significant difference between the patients with liver injury and the control group in the history of liver disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (P < 0.05). Nine of the 40 patients with liver injury died. High serum total bilirubin and creatinine levels were significantly associated with poor prognosis of DILI in patients with SJS/TEN (P < 0.05). Conclusion DILI usually occurs in patients with SJS/TEN. Pre-existing liver disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia are independent risk factors for DILI in patients with SJS/TEN. High serum total bilirubin and creatinine levels may be useful prognostic markers for DILI in patients with SJS/TEN.","Zhang, Zhibin; Li, Sisi; Zhang, Zhixiong; Yu, Kaihui; Duan, Xunxin; Long, Lin; Zhang, Shulan; Jiang, Meiying; Liu, Ougen",Indian journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijd.ijd_217_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831367/,520

The purpose of this study was to compare the surgical outcomes of both anastomotic techniques in robotic-assisted radical cystectomy. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients with urinary bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy with urinary diversion and with ileo-ileal intestinal anastomosis at a single tertiary centre (2012-2018) was undertaken. The robotic operating time, hospital stay and GI complications were compared between the robotic-sewn (RS) and stapled anastomosis (SA) groups. The only difference between the groups was the anastomosis technique; the other technical steps during the operation were the same. Primary outcomes were GI complications; the secondary outcome was robotic operation time. RESULTS There were 155 patients, of which 112 (73%) were male. The median age was 71 years old. A surgical stapling device was used to create 66 (43%) separate anastomoses, while a robot-sewn method was employed in 89 (57%) anastomoses. There were no statistically significant differences in primary and secondary outcomes between RS and SA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 282 couples with one spouse diagnosed with cancer were selected from the Three-City cohort study. Dyadic analyses were used to determine whether trait anxiety affects the risk of depression and whether a mutual influence process occurs prior and post cancer diagnosis. Cross-sectional analyses were performed at two time-points: before and after receiving the diagnosis. RESULTS A higher level of anxiety among cancer patients resulted in a decreased risk of depression among spousal caregivers. Moreover, a higher anxiety among spousal caregivers increased their own risk of depression, but it didn't influence depression risk among cancer patients. While there is an intra-individual relationship between a higher level of trait anxiety and a greater risk of depression prior to cancer diagnosis, there is no cross-influence between spouses.

129894,Single incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SILS): a novel technique.,2008,"BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant bone cancer, in which circular RNAs (circRNAs) acting as important modulators. Here, we aimed to explore the functional role of circRNA itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (circITCH) in the development and doxorubicin (DXR) resistance of OS and the possible mechanistic pathway. METHODS Quantitative real-time PCR or western blot assays were exploited to analyze the expression of circITCH, miR-524 and Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6). Cell viability and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of DXR were monitored by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell migration, invasion and apoptosis were determined via transwell assay and flow cytometry. The target interaction among circITCH, miR-524 and RASSF6 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. A xenograft model of MG-63/DXR cells stably expressing circITCH in nude mice was established for assessing the role of circITCH in vivo. RESULTS Downregulation of circITCH and RASSF6, as well as the upregulation of miR-524 were revealed in OS by study of 40 paired OS tissue and normal tissue samples. Overexpression of circITCH lowered the cell viability, IC50 value of DXR, migration and invasion, while facilitated apoptosis of OS cells. CircITCH sponged miR-524 to upregulate RASSF6, causing OS progression inhibition and DXR resistance reduction. Additionally, circITCH upregulation reduced tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Transduction with circITCH represses OS progression and promotes DXR sensitivity by the miR-524/RASSF6 axis, providing a new perspective for therapeutic intervention.","Zhou, Wei; Liu, Yuan; Wu, Xuejian",The journal of gene medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgm.3373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151476/,520

Evaluating leaks after gastric bypass.,2016,"OBJECTIVE To compare effectiveness, feasibility, and suturing time required between an absorbable barbed wire (V-Loc) uterine suture and a classic continuous suture with intracorporeal knots among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy. METHODS From January 2010 to February 2011, women with single symptomatic intramural myoma were prospectively enrolled in a single-center study at a university hospital in Rome, Italy. A control group with characteristics meeting the criteria for study inclusion was retrospectively identified from the hospital databases. In the prospective group uterine wall defects were closed with V-Loc suture, whereas in the control group they were closed by classical continuous suture with intracorporeal knots. Data were analyzed via Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher exact test. RESULTS The mean operative time was shorter in the V-Loc (51±18.1 min) than in the control (58±17.8 min) group. Suturing time was significantly lower in the V-Loc than in the control (9.9±4.3 versus 15.8±4.7 min; P=0.0004) group. Both intraoperative bleeding and drop in hemoglobin were significantly lower in the V-Loc group (P=0.0076 and P=0.0176, respectively). CONCLUSION Use of a barbed suture may aid surgeons during laparoscopic suturing by reducing operative time, suturing time, and blood loss.","Angioli, Roberto; Plotti, Francesco; Montera, Roberto; Damiani, Patrizio; Terranova, Corrado; Oronzi, Irma; Luvero, Daniela; Scaletta, Giuseppe; Muzii, Ludovico; Panici, Pierluigi B",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2011.12.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22445426/,520
130363,Cost-Effective Filtrating Suction to Evacuate Surgical Smoke in Laparoscopic and Robotic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Endometrial hyperplasia is a precancerous lesion of the endometrium, commonly presenting with uterine bleeding. If managed expectantly, it frequently progresses to endometrial carcinoma, rates of which are increasing dramatically worldwide. However, the established treatment for endometrial hyperplasia (progestogens) involves multiple side effects and leaves the risk of recurrence. Metformin is the most commonly used oral hypoglycaemic agent in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has also been linked to the reversal of endometrial hyperplasia and may therefore contribute to decreasing the prevalence of endometrial carcinoma without the fertility and side effect consequences of current therapies. However, the efficacy and safety of metformin being used for this therapeutic target is unclear and, therefore, this systematic review will aim to determine this. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search the following trials and databases with no language restrictions: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; PubMed; Google Scholar; ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO International Trials Registry Platform portal; OpenGrey and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of use of metformin compared with a placebo or no treatment, conventional medical treatment (eg, progestogens) or any other active intervention. Two review authors will independently assess the trial eligibility, risk of bias and extract appropriate data points. Trial authors will be contacted for additional data. The primary review outcome is the regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology. Secondary outcomes include hysterectomy rate; abnormal uterine bleeding; quality of life scores and adverse reactions to treatments. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Dissemination of the completed review will be through the Cochrane Library as well as through presenting the results at appropriate conferences.","Clement, Naomi S; Oliver, Thomas R W; Shiwani, Hunain; Saner, Juliane R F; Mulvaney, Caroline A; Atiomo, William",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27531741/,520

Measurement of ~40,000 oyster shells from archaeological sites along the Atlantic Coast of the United States provides a long-term record of oyster abundance and size. The data demonstrate increases in oyster size across time and a nonrandom pattern in their distributions across sites. We attribute this variation to processes related to Native American fishing rights and environmental variability. Mean oyster length is correlated with total oyster bed length within foraging radii (5 and 10 km) as mapped in 1889 and 1890. These data demonstrate the stability of oyster reefs despite different population densities and environmental shifts and have implications for oyster reef restoration in an age of global climate change.","Thompson, Victor D; Rick, Torben; Garland, Carey J; Thomas, David Hurst; Smith, Karen Y; Bergh, Sarah; Sanger, Matt; Tucker, Bryan; Lulewicz, Isabelle; Semon, Anna M; Schalles, John; Hladik, Christine; Alexander, Clark; Ritchison, Brandon T",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba9652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832610/,520

The PLA samples consisted of typical consumer waste materials, including a cup, a toy, and a three-dimensional (3D) printing material. High selectivities and yields (>94%) were possible depending on temperature and reaction time. Additionally, and to develop a predictive kinetic model, kinetic parameters (pre-exponential factor and activation energies) of the PLA transesterification reaction were first obtained from virgin PLA. These parameters were subsequently used to estimate the conversion of PLA, selectivity, and yield of methyl lactate after 1 and 4 h of the reaction, and the results were compared with the experimental values of the end-of-life PLA. Despite the presence of unknown additives in the PLA waste material and uncontrolled particle size, the model was able to predict the overall conversion, selectivity, and yield to an average deviation of 5, 7, and 12%, respectively. A greater agreement between the model and experimental values is observed for the higher temperatures and the longer reaction time. Larger deviations were observed for the PLA toy, which we attribute to the presence of additives, since despite its lower molecular weight, it possessed a higher structural strength.","Román-Ramírez, Luis A; McKeown, Paul; Shah, Chanak; Abraham, Joshua; Jones, Matthew D; Wood, Joseph",Industrial & engineering chemistry research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c01122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581423/,520
131106,Case of complete mesh migration into the stomach after mesh hiatoplasty for a hiatal hernia.,2018,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, has overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, putting medical professionals at a high risk of getting infected themselves due to a global shortage of personal protective equipment. This has in-turn led to understaffed hospitals unable to handle new patient influx. To help alleviate these problems, we design and develop a contactless patient positioning system that can enable scanning patients in a completely remote and contactless fashion. Our key design objective is to reduce the physical contact time with a patient as much as possible, which we achieve with our contactless workflow. Our system comprises automated calibration, positioning, and multi-view synthesis components that enable patient scan without physical proximity. Our calibration routine ensures system calibration at all times and can be executed without any manual intervention. Our patient positioning routine comprises a novel robust dynamic fusion (RDF) algorithm for accurate 3D patient body modeling. With its multi-modal inference capability, RDF can be trained once and used across different applications (without re-training) having various sensor choices, a key feature to enable system deployment at scale. Our multi-view synthesizer ensures multi-view positioning visualization for the technician to verify positioning accuracy prior to initiating the patient scan. We conduct extensive experiments with publicly available and proprietary datasets to demonstrate efficacy. Our system has already been used, and had a positive impact on, hospitals and technicians on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to see its use increase substantially globally.","Karanam, Srikrishna; Li, Ren; Yang, Fan; Hu, Wei; Chen, Terrence; Wu, Ziyan",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.2991954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365022/,520

PARP1 has been shown to be involved with diseases resulting in increased inflammation and several viral diseases have also been associated with PARP1 activation. PARP1 facilitates influenza A virus entry in host cells by degrading interferon receptor type I. PARP1 regulates expression of NFkB and downstream cytokine production and its inhibition is known to attenuate the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, PARP1 plays an important role in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis. Moreover, pre-clinical and in vitro studies have shown that PARP1 inhibition may affect viability of several viruses including affecting replication of the SARS-CoV virus, a distant relative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the one which caused the SARS epidemic of 2002. Covid-19 has been declared a global pandemic; with symptoms of the disease now not limited to respiratory distress alone. Severe inflammation is observed in the lungs leading to a surge of cytokine release systemically, affecting heart function, ischemia and stroke. Inflammatory cytokines which are associated with severe comorbidities and mortalities due to chronic diseases are being upregulated in an acute fashion. There is no immediate treatment, and only palliative care is being provided.

Decades of psychological knowledge about effective treatments should inform the delivery of better services. Dissemination and implementation (D&I) science has been heralded as a solution to the persistent problem of poor quality services and has, to some extent, improved our understanding of the contexts of delivery systems that implement effective practices. However, there are few studies demonstrating clear, population-level impacts of psychological interventions on children. Momentum is growing among communities, cities, states, and some federal agencies to build ""health in all policies"" to address broad familial, social, and economic factors known to affect children's healthy development and mental health. These health policy initiatives offer a rare opportunity to repurpose D&I science, shifting it from a primary focus on evidence-based practice implementation, to a focus on policy development and implementation to support child and family health and well-being. This shift is critical as states develop policy responses to address the health and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on already-vulnerable families.

The clerkship director remains an essential leader in the education of medical students on core clinical rotations, and the role of the CD has and continues to evolve. The selection of a CD should be an explicit contract between the CD, their department, and the medical school, with each party fulfilling their obligations to ensure the success of the students, the clerkship and of the CD. Educational innovations and accreditation requirements have evolved in the last two decades and therefore this article updates the 2003 standards for what is expected of a CD and provides guidelines for the resources and support to be provided.In their roles as CDs, medical student educators engage in several critical activities: administration, education/teaching, coaching, advising, and mentoring, faculty development, compliance with accreditation standards, and scholarly activity. This article describes (a) the work products that are the primary responsibility of the CD; (b) the qualifications for the CD; (c) the support structure, resources, and personnel that are necessary for the CD to accomplish their responsibilities; (d) incentives and career development for the CD; and (e) the dedicated time that should be provided for the clerkship and the CD to succeed. Given all that should rightfully be expected of a CD, a minimum of 50% of a full-time equivalent is recognized as appropriate. The complexity and needs of the clerkship now require that at least one full-time clerkship administrator (CA) be a part of the CD's team.To better reflect the current circumstances, ACE has updated its recommendations for institutions and departments to have clear standards for what is expected of the director of a clinical clerkship and have correspondingly clear guidelines as to what should be expected for CDs in the support they are provided.

They involve important painstaking but repetitive work. A major producer of systematic reviews, the Cochrane Collaboration, employs Review Manager (RevMan) programme-a software which assists reviewers and produces XML-structured files. This paper describes an add-on programme (RevManHAL) which helps auto-generate the abstract, results and discussion sections of RevMan-generated reviews in multiple languages. The paper also describes future developments for RevManHAL. METHODS RevManHAL was created in Java using NetBeans by a programmer working full time for 2 months. RESULTS The resulting open-source programme uses editable phrase banks to envelop text/numbers from within the prepared RevMan file in formatted readable text of a chosen language. In this way, considerable parts of the review's 'abstract', 'results' and 'discussion' sections are created and a phrase added to 'acknowledgements'. CONCLUSION RevManHAL's output needs to be checked by reviewers, but already, from our experience within the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (200 maintained reviews, 900 reviewers), RevManHAL has saved much time which is better employed thinking about the meaning of the data rather than restating them.

METHODS Between April 2007 and December 2011, 141 DJUSs were placed via a percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tract in 110 consecutive patients with malignant ureteral strictures. 7F DJUSs with multiple side holes in the straight portion were placed in 58 ureters of 43 patients (Group 1). 8F DJUSs with three side holes in the proximal 2-cm of the straight portion were placed in 83 ureters of 67 patients (Group 2). The incidence of early DJUS dysfunction was compared between the two groups, and nephrostographic findings were evaluated in the cases of early dysfunction. RESULTS Early dysfunction of the DJUS was noted in 14 of 58 patients (24.1 %) in Group 1, which was significantly higher (p = 0.001) than in Group 2 in which only 1 of 83 patients (1.2 %) had early dysfunction of the DJUS. Nephrostographic findings of early dysfunction included dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system, filling defects in the ureteral stent, and no passage of contrast media into the urinary bladder. CONCLUSIONS In malignant ureteral strictures, multiple side holes in the straight portion of the 7-F DJUS seem to cause early dysfunction. The 8F DJUSs with three side holes in the proximal 2-cm of the straight portion may be superior at preventing early dysfunction.","Song, Myung Gyu; Seo, Tae-Seok; Lee, Chang Hee; Kim, Kyeong Ah; Kim, Jun Suk; Oh, Sang Cheul; Lee, Jae-Kwan",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-014-0963-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159216/,520

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pressure-volume curve during capnoperitoneum in cats. A total of 59 female cats were scheduled for routine laparoscopy. Pressure and volume data were recorded and processed, and the yield point of the curve was calculated using a method based on a capacitor discharging function. For the remaining 40 cats, a linear-like pressure-volume curve was observed until a yield point with a mean cutoff pressure (COP) of 6.44 ± 1.7 mmHg (SD) (range, 2.72-13.00 mmHg) and a mean cutoff volume (COV) of 387 ± 144.35 mL (SD) (range, 178.84-968.43 mL) was reached. The mean mL/kg CO2 value in cats was 208 ± 34.69 mL/kg (range, 100.00-288.46 mL/kg). The COV correlated with COP and body weight but not with body condition score (BCS). COP correlated only with the COV. This study suggests that feline patients have a pressure-volume curve similar to that of canine patients, and the same pressure limit recommendations can be used for both species. After a yield point of 6.44 mmHg is reached, the increment in volume decreases exponentially as the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) increases.","Dorn, Melissa; Becher-Deichsel, Anja; Bockstahler, Barbara; Peham, Christian; Dupré, Gilles",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10081408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32823512/,520

132908,Laparoscopic gastric bypass versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as a definitive surgical procedure for morbid obesity. Mid-term results.,2013,"BACKGROUND Infectious disease is ubiquitous and can represent a major threat to human health. Procalcitonin (PCT) is mainly used to identify the severity of bacterial infections, which can be secondary to many non-bacterial infectious diseases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate current research in the field of infectious diseases and to suggest directions for further investigation. METHODS The Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) database in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) was used as the search data source. The search parameters including the search scope were limited to ""infectious disease"" and the search term was ""procalcitonin"". The time range of the target literature was 1900 to the final search date of this research (May 7, 2021), and the language was limited to English. The full records of the search results and cited references were exported in plain text format, and Citespace software was used to analyze the documents. RESULTS A total of 996 related research documents were found, and the number increased significantly in 2020. The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom were the main sources of research, and the main research institutions were Aarhus University Hospital and Harvard University. The main journals are publishing material were Clin Infect Dis, Lancet, and Crit Care Med. Analysis of key words showed that the most common current research topics were sepsis and biomarkers of disease monitoring. CONCLUSIONS Research on infectious disease and the role of PCT is increasing. The main research topics are sepsis and biomarkers for disease monitoring.","Zhang, Yajun; Zhang, Jinhui; Zhao, Li; Zhao, Na; Zhang, Ye; Zhang, Jie; Wang, Shuying",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-1607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353085/,520
133067,Abnormal glucose tolerance testing after gastric bypass.,2013,"BACKGROUND Rapid delivery of IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in qualifying patients leads to better clinical outcomes. The American Heart Association has reduced target door-to-needle (DTN) times from 60 to 45 min in the hopes of continued process improvements across institutions. OBJECTIVE To start a quality improvement project called CODE FAST in order to reduce DTN times at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data from our internally maintained database of patients treated with intravenous tPA before and after implementation of the CODE FAST protocol. We assessed demographic information, time of day and times of arrival to first image and delivery of tPA in patients from February 2014 to February 2015. Outcomes were assessed based on discharge to home. Univariate analysis was performed to assess for improvement in DTN times before and after implementation of the protocol. RESULTS A total of 93 patients (41 pre-CODE FAST and 52 post-CODE FAST) received IV tPA during the study period. Patients were equally matched between the two groups except that in the pre-CODE FAST era patients receiving tPA were younger and more likely to be men. There was a substantial reduction in door-to-imaging time from a median of 16 to 8 min (p<0.0001) and DTN time with a reduction in the median from 62 to 25 min (p<0.0001). In logistic regression modeling, there was a trend towards more discharges to home in patients treated during the CODE FAST era. CONCLUSIONS We present a quality improvement project that has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing DTN time to <30 min. The template we present may be helpful to other institutions looking to reduce their DTN times and may also reduce costs as we note a trend towards more discharges to home.","Busby, Leslie; Owada, Kumiko; Dhungana, Samish; Zimmermann, Susan; Coppola, Victoria; Ruban, Rebecca; Horn, Christopher; Rochestie, Dustin; Khaldi, Ahmad; Hormes, Joseph T; Gupta, Rishi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26089402/,520

133582,Postimplant intraperitoneal behavior of collagen-based meshes followed by laparoscopy.,2012,"Understanding virus transfer between liquid and skin is necessary to estimate transmission during water-related activities. Here, we modeled virus transfer from liquid-to-skin and skin-to-liquid. We performed human subject studies using three bacteriophages as pathogenic virus surrogates: nonenveloped MS2 and Qβ and enveloped Φ6. Our study shows that transfer from liquid-to-skin is describable by a single model based on (1) virus concentration and (2) volume of liquid remaining on skin. Contact times (0.1-30 min), and virus species had little-to-no influence on virus transfer. Likewise, liquid conditions (pH 6-9, ionic strength 10-550 mM) had no influence on transfer as shown for MS2. The model accounts for both, virus adsorbed onto the skin, and virus in the liquid retained on skin. In comparison, virus transfer from skin-to-liquid was influenced by the wetness of the skin and by liquid type (water, saliva). 90 ± 19% of the virus inoculated on the skin are transferred to the water when the skin remains wet compared to 30 ± 17% when the skin is dry. The transfer from skin-to-liquid was 41% higher when the recipient liquid was water as compared with saliva. This study quantifies virus transfer between liquid and skin and guides risk assessments of water-related activities.","Pitol, A K; Bischel, Heather N; Kohn, Tamar; Julian, Timothy R",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b04949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161027/,520
133634,Respiratory Symptoms and Complications of Zenker Diverticulum: Effect of Trans-Oral Septum Stapling.,2017,"Despite correction of underlying solid organ failure by transplantation, pediatric transplant recipients still have increased mortality rates compared to the general pediatric population, in part due to increased cardiovascular risk. In particular, pediatric kidney and non-kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease have significant cardiovascular risk that worsens with declining kidney function. Biomarkers associated with future cardiovascular risk such as casual and ambulatory hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular stiffness and calcification, and left ventricular hypertrophy can be detected throughout the post-transplant period and in patients with stable kidney function. Among these, hypertension and dyslipidemia are two potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors that are highly prevalent in kidney and non-kidney pediatric transplant recipients. Standardized approaches to appropriate BP measurement and lipid monitoring are needed to detect and address these risk factors in a timely fashion. To achieve sustained improvement in cardiovascular health, clinicians should partner with patients and their caregivers to address these and other risk factors with a combined approach that integrates pharmacologic with non-pharmacologic approaches. This review outlines the scope and impact of hypertension and dyslipidemia in pediatric transplant recipients, with a particular focus on pediatric kidney transplantation given the high burden of chronic kidney disease-associated cardiovascular risk. We also review the current published guidelines for monitoring and managing abnormalities in blood pressure and lipids, highlighting the important role of therapeutic lifestyle changes in concert with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications.","Charnaya, Olga; Seifert, Michael",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.13811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871051/,520

The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the herbal medicine, Dangguijagyag-san, relative to those of active control, Gamisoyo-san, and a placebo control for primary dysmenorrhea. Methods This protocol details a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center, investigator-initiated, controlled trial evaluating treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Two hundred and forty participants will be randomly divided into one of three groups: 1) the Dangguijagyag-san experimental group (EG) (n = 105), 2) the Gamisoyo-san active control group (ACG) (n = 30), and 3) the placebo control group (PCG) (n = 105). The interventions will be administered for two menstrual cycles, and the follow-up will be carried out for the following six menstrual cycles. The primary outcomes are difference in response rates between the EG and the ACG (non-inferiority comparison) and difference in changes from baseline in average pain intensity measured by the visual analogue scale between the EG and PCG (superiority comparison). The secondary outcomes are pain scores derived from pain assessment tools (verbal multidimensional scoring system, retrospective symptom scale, and short form McGill pain questionnaire), dosage of analgesics, pattern diagnosis questionnaires, and short form 36 health survey. Adverse events and vital signs will be checked at every visit, and laboratory tests will be performed for safety evaluation.

METHODS The study enrolled 317 women listed in the database of the Department of General Surgery and Medical-Surgical Specialties, University of Catania, Italy, family planning clinic who were known to be using hormonal contraceptives. The women were contacted by telephone and asked whether they would like to participate in the study. If they agreed, they were then emailed a questionnaire about their social behaviour and sexual activity during the pandemic, according to their cohabiting status, i.e., whether they were continuing to use their hormonal contraception and whether they had had an unplanned pregnancy. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 175 (81.8%) women who were using short-acting reversible contraception (SARC) and by 90 (87.4%) women who were using long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). All married and cohabiting women were continuing to use their contraceptive method. None had had an unplanned pregnancy. On the other hand, 51 (50.5%) non-cohabiting or single women had discontinued their SARC method while social distancing, for non-method-related reasons; however, 47 (46.5%) non-cohabiting or single women had continued their sexual activity, infringing social distancing rules, and 14.9% had had an unplanned pregnancy, for which they had sought a termination. CONCLUSION Several non-cohabiting women using SARC had discontinued their contraceptive method during the pandemic but had continued to engage in sexual activity and had had an unplanned pregnancy. Clinicians should counsel women about what they should do in regard to contraception in the event of new, future social distancing measures.","Caruso, Salvatore; Rapisarda, Agnese Maria Chiara; Minona, Patrizia",The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,https://doi.org/10.1080/13625187.2020.1830965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33044107/,520

Korea is considered one of the countries with the highest suicide rate among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members for over a decade. We aimed to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalised patients after suicidal acts in Korea. METHODS Data from the Korean National Hospital Discharge In-depth Injury Survey were analysed, and patients older than 9 years admitted to nationwide hospitals after suicidal acts from 2005 to 2016 were included. Their epidemiologic characteristics were explored, and we divided them into groups according to suicidal means (injury vs. poisoning) and treatment outcome (good vs. poor). The association of each characteristic with injury as suicidal means and with poor treatment outcome were explored. RESULTS The sample included 7609 patients (corresponding to 227,571 in national population). More patients were female than male, and most were in their 40s in both sexes. Hospitalisation rate peaked in patients older than 80 years for both sexes. Male and young patients aged 10-19 years and capital residents showed relatively higher odds of choosing injury as suicidal means. Males and patients aged 40-64 and ≥65 years showed relatively higher odds of poor treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS Some suicide attempters were excluded from the survey such as those who did not visit a hospital after the suicide attempt. CONCLUSIONS This epidemiologic feature of suicide attempters might serve as baseline data for preventive policies regarding suicide.","Park, Joon Min; Kim, Min Joung",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734914/,520

METHODS This was a retrospective case-control study of patients with RC operated between 12/2013 and 12/2017 in Ruijin Hospital North, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. In total, 177 patients who underwent CLS and 51 who underwent SILS met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching method (PSM). RESULTS Compared with the CLS group, the SILS group showed shorter operation time [105 (40) vs. 125 (55) min, P = 0.045], shorter total incision length [4 (1) vs. 6.5 (1.5) cm, P < 0.001], lower VAS score on POD2 [1 (1) vs. 2 (1), P < 0.001], shorter time to soft diet [7 (1) vs. 8 (2) days, P = 0.048], and shorter length of hospital stay [9 (2) vs. 11 (3) days, P < 0.001]. The postoperative complications were similar between two groups [1(2%) vs. 5 (9.8%), P = 0.205]. No readmissions or mortality in either group occurred within 30 days of surgery. All 102 specimens met the requirements of TME. No significant differences were observed in the pathologic outcomes between the two groups. The median follow-up period was 32.6 months in the SILS group and 36.8 months in the CLS group (P = 0.053). The 3-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates of the SILS and CLS groups were 89.8% vs. 96.0% (P = 0.224) and 90.9% vs. 96.9% (P = 0.146), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Compared with CLS, TME surgery for rectal cancer can be performed safely and effectively using the SILS technique with better cosmetic results, less postoperative pain, faster postoperative recovery, and acceptable clinical and oncological outcomes.","Jiang, Yimei; Song, Zijia; Cheng, Xi; Liu, Kun; Shi, Yiqing; Wang, Changgang; Li, You; Ji, Xiaopin; Zhao, Ren",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07317-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31858246/,520

Transition Theory also provides the basis for several predictions. Specifically, it predicts (a) a COVID bump (an increase in availability of event memories at the outset of the Pandemic) followed by (b) a lockdown dip (a decrease in availability of event memories from lockdown periods compared to other stable periods). It also predicts that (c) people may consider the Pandemic an important chapter in their life stories, but only when there is little continuity between their pre-Pandemic and post-Pandemic lives.

Qualitative and texture analysis were performed on T1-, T2- and fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted images. Various features of qualitative and texture analysis were compared between high- and low-grade sarcoma. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated for texture features. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the value of qualitative and texture analysis.There were 11 low- and 31 high-grade sarcomas. Among qualitative features, signal intensity on T1-weighted images, tumor margin on T2-weighted images, tumor margin on fat-suppressed CE T1-weighted images and peritumoral enhancement were significantly different between high- and low-grade sarcomas. Among texture features, T2 mean, T1 SD, CE T1 skewness, CE T1 mean, CE T1 difference variance and CE T1 contrast were significantly different between high- and low-grade sarcomas. The AUCs of the above texture features were > 0.7: T2 mean, .710 (95% confidence interval [CI] .543-.876); CE T1 mean, .768 (.590-.947); T1 SD, .730 (.554-.906); CE T1 skewness, .751 (.586-.916); CE T1 difference variance, .721 (.536-.907); and CE T1 contrast, .727 (.530-.924). The multivariate logistic regression model of both qualitative and texture features had numerically higher AUC than those of only qualitative or texture features.Texture analysis at 3T MRI may provide additional diagnostic value to the qualitative MRI imaging features for the differentiation of high- and low-grade sarcomas.","Hong, Ji Hyun; Jee, Won-Hee; Jung, Chan-Kwon; Chung, Yang-Guk",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629676/,520

OBJECTIVE To develop a surveillance system to monitor the public health impacts of the Trump administration in New York City. DESIGN Epidemiologic assessment. Public health surveillance system. SETTING New York City. PARTICIPANTS New York City residents. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES We identified approximately 25 indicators across 5 domains: access to care, food insecurity, reproductive health, environmental health, and general physical and mental health. Sources of data include the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (DOHMH's) health and risk behavior telephone survey, vital statistics, emergency department visits, DOHMH sexual health clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers, lead and diabetes registries, Medicaid claims, Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program enrollment, Women, Infant, and Children program enrollment, and 311 call records. Data are collected monthly or quarterly where possible. We identified measures to stratify indicators by individual and area-based measures of immigration and poverty. RESULTS Since April 2017, we have compiled quarterly reports, including establishing a historical baseline of 10 years to account for secular trends and encompass the establishment and enactment of the ACA. Indicators are interpreted within the context of changes in programming or local policy that might explain trends.

Later called COVID-19, it rapidly spread across China and worldwide. Intensive research revealed that the etiological agent of the global COVID-19 pandemic was a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains typical coronavirus genes but the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein is highly specific. The site for furin-like protease cleavage of the S protein into S1 and S2 subunits is also unique. Further analyses suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is of zoonotic origin. The analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, especially the S gene, shows that natural evolutionary process between a bat-CoV and a pangolin-CoV or other animal coronavirus could have been important in creating SARS-CoV-2, with transmission of novel virus to the human population. On the other hand, new analyses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is not a recombinant virus.

A propensity score-matched, multicenter analysis of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy following totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy.",2019-12-09,"BACKGROUND The degree, prevalence, and risk factors linked to sleeve gastrectomy (SG) postoperative hemorrhage (POH) have not been fully defined. METHODS An analysis was conducted on a prospectively collected database of 394 consecutive primary SGs performed in a single practice from January 2014 to December 2015. END POINTS (1) acute POH, defined by red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and/or re-exploration; (2) subclinical POH, defined by postoperative hemoglobin drop (HgbD) >one standard deviation above mean. Variables tested included three surgical techniques: normal stapling (n = 137), ""tight"" stapling, (n = 142) and oversewing, (n = 115); age; gender; body mass index (BMI); co-morbidities; and elevated postoperative systolic blood pressure. RESULTS Acute POH occurred in 11/394 patients (2.8%) and subclinical POH (HgbD > 2.2 g/dL) was detected in 27/312 (7.7%) of patients with available HgbD data. Acute POH patients had a mean HgbD of 5.43 ± 1.40 g/dl (p < 0.001) reflecting approximately 38.6% ± 10.0% of total blood volume. No difference in prevalence of POH was observed for the different surgical techniques. Compared with non-bleeders (n = 312), acute and subclinical POH patients (n = 38) had 52.6 vs. 27.2% prevalence type-2 diabetes (T2D) and 60.5 vs. 40.1% prevalence of dyslipidemia and higher mean preoperative hemoglobin 14.3 ± 11 vs.13.5 ± 1.2 (p < 0.05 for all). On regression analysis, only T2D (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.6) and higher level of preoperative hemoglobin (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3-2.4) were independent risk factors for POH. CONCLUSION In this study, acute and subclinical POH were primarily linked to T2D and not to surgical techniques. Special consideration is recommended for patients with T2D undergoing SG.","Spivak, Hadar; Azran, Carmil; Spectre, Galia; Lidermann, Galina; Blumenfeld, Orit",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2731-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28523403/,520

Differences in medical legal systems between the US and most European countries with no tort legislation raise the question whether the US definition of defensive medicine holds true in Europe. AIM To present the protocol of a systematic review investigating variations in definitions and understandings of the term 'defensive medicine' in European research articles. METHODS AND ANALYSIS In concordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic review of all medical research literature that investigate defensive medicine will be performed by two independent reviewers. The databases PubMed, Embase and Cochrane will be systematically searched on the basis of predetermined criteria. Data from all included European studies will systematically be extracted including the studies' definitions and understandings of defensive medicine, especially the motives for doing medical actions that the study regards as 'defensive'. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethics clearance is required as no primary data will be collected. The results of the systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed, international journal.

Guidelines for clinical management of infected patients and prevention of new cases focus on measures to control symptoms, hygiene habits, social distancing, and decrease in human crowding. This forced a change in the way health services provide care, generating the incorporation of new health technologies. The Essay thus aims to compile and analyze experiences in the use of digital health technologies to minimize the impacts of COVID-19. The authors identified the development of technological solutions for clinical management of patients, imaging diagnosis, use of artificial intelligence for risk analysis, geolocation apps, data analysis and reports, self-diagnosis, and even orientation for decision-making. The great majority of the initiatives listed here prove effective in minimizing the impacts of COVID-19 on health systems and aim to decrease human crowding and thus facilitate access to services, besides contributing to the incorporation of new health practices and modes of care.","Celuppi, Ianka Cristina; Lima, Geovana Dos Santos; Rossi, Elaine; Wazlawick, Raul Sidnei; Dalmarco, Eduardo Monguilhott",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00243220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729283/,520

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of hearing loss among children with CDH and compare it to age-matched controls. METHODS We used population-based datasets to compare the number of hearing loss diagnoses in children younger than 10 years-of-age born between 1992 and 2009 with CDH to date-of-birth matched controls without CDH. Factors associated with CDH disease severity were analyzed to determine their effect on the prevalence of hearing loss. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine if selection bias of improved care over the course of the study affected hearing loss in CDH patients. The prevalences of hearing loss were compared using Fisher's exact tests and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 529 children, 38 CDH cases and their 491 date-of-birth matched controls, met the inclusion criteria. Hearing loss was found in 7 children with CDH (18.4%) compared to 26 (5.3%) controls; the risk ratio (RR) of hearing loss was 3.48 (95%CI = 1.61-7.49, p = 0.006). There was no association between CDH disease severity and hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS CDH is associated with hearing loss compared to the general population. Our results suggest that congenital factors may contribute to hearing loss in CDH more than perinatal exposures.

Whether COVID-19 patients are at high risk of GBS is unknown. Through a systematic review of case reports, we aimed to summarize the main features of patients with GBS and COVID-19. Methods: Without any restrictions, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv (April 23 rd, 2020). Two reviewers screened and studied titles, abstracts and reports. We extracted information to characterize sociodemographic variables, clinical presentation, laboratory results, treatments and outcomes. Results: Eight reports (n=12 patients) of GBS and COVID-19 were identified; one was a Miller Fisher case. Overall, the median age was 62.5 (interquartile range (IQR)=54.5-70.5) years, and there were more men (9/102). GBS symptoms started between 5 and 24 days after those of COVID-19. The median protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid samples was 101.5 mg/dl (IQR=51-145). None of the cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for COVID-19. Six patients debuted with ascendant weakness and three with facial weakness. Five patients had favourable evolution, four remained with relevant symptoms or required critical care and one died; the Miller Fisher case had successful resolution. Conclusions: GBS is emerging as a disease that may appear in COVID-19 patients. Although limited, preliminary evidence appears to suggest that GBS occurs after COVID-19 onset. Practitioners and investigators should have GBS in mind as they look after COVID-19 patients and conduct research on novel aspects of COVID-19. Comparison with GBS patients in the context of another viral outbreak (Zika), revealed similarities and differences that deserves further scrutiny and epidemiological studies.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Altez-Fernandez, Carlos; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Vizcarra, Joaquín A",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15987.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995555/,520

Research on the cultural evolution of misbeliefs has demonstrated that a social context can explain what people think but not whether it also explains how people think. We shift the focus from the diffusion of false beliefs to the diffusion of suboptimal belief-formation strategies and identify a novel mechanism whereby misbeliefs arise and spread. We show that, when individual decision makers have access to the data-gathering behavior of others, the tendency to make decisions on the basis of insufficient evidence is amplified, increasing the rate of incorrect, costly decisions. We argue that this mechanism fills a gap in current explanations of problematic, widespread misbeliefs such as climate change denial.

Methods Ex vivo ultrasonographic and histologic evaluations of a fresh caecum were initially performed. Then, 20 asymptomatic cats, privately owned or originating from a reproductive colony, were recruited. All cats had an ultrasonographic examination of the ileocaecocolic junction, where the thickness of the caecal wall, ileocolic lymph nodes and the echogenicity of the local fat were assessed. They all underwent a colonoscopy with a macroscopic assessment of the mucosa and biopsies for histology. Results An ultrasonographic hypoechoic nodular inner layer, which corresponded to the coalescence of multiple lymphoid follicles originating from the submucosa and protruding in the mucosa on histology, was visible in all parts of the caecum. The combined mucosa and submucosa was measured ultrasonographically and defined as the follicular layer. Although all cats were asymptomatic, 3/19 cats showed mild caecal inflammation on histology. The most discriminatory ultrasonographic parameter in assessing this subclinical inflammation was the thickness of the follicular layer at the entrance of the caecum, with a cut-off value of 2.0 mm. All cats (20/20) showed some degree of macroscopic 'dimpling' of the caecal mucosa on endoscopy. Conclusions and relevance Lymphoid follicles in the caecal mucosa and submucosa constitute a unique follicular layer on ultrasound. In asymptomatic cats, a subtle, non-clinically relevant inflammation may exist and this is correlated with an increased thickness of the follicular layer on ultrasound. On endoscopy, a 'dimpled aspect' to the caecal mucosa is a normal finding in the asymptomatic cat.","Hahn, Harriet; Freiche, Valérie; Baril, Aurélie; Charpentier, Julie; Desquilbet, Loïc; Le Poder, Sophie; Servely, Jean-Luc; Laloy, Eve; Pey, Pascaline",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15602740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26316516/,520

The true impact of the disease in the pediatric population is still unknown. AIM To describe the clinical characteristics, the use of resources and the evolution of children with COVID-19 in the Garrahan Pediatric Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the first 20 weeks from the identification of the first case. METHODS Descriptive, analytical, retrospective study. The epidemiological, clinical, evolutionary characteristics and the use of hospital resources of patients < 18 years with confirmed COVID-19 are described. In addition, these characteristics were compared according to whether they occurred in the first 10 epidemiological weeks from the first case of COVID-19 in the hospital or in the following ten weeks. RESULTS n: 280. The median age was 83 months (IQR 33-144). 209 patients (74.6%) were hospitalized. The median days of hospitalization was 8 days (IQR 3-13). According to the WHO severity classification, there were 184 mild cases (65.7%), 3 moderate (1.1%), 16 severe (5.7%) and 20 critical patients (7.1%). The main reasons for admission to the ICU were not related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. When comparing the characteristics of the patients in the two periods, in the first period there was a higher frequency of underlying comorbidities, immunosuppressive treatment, the consultation was later and the patients had more requirements for ICU admission. Two children (0.7%) died in relation to the infection, both with severe comorbidities and severe bacterial coinfections. CONCLUSION In this study, patients with underlying disease predominated. The mild form of the disease was the most frequent presentation. At the beginning of the pandemic, there were more patients under immunosuppressive treatment, the consultation was later and the hospitalization was more frequent, prolonged and with more serious clinical pictures.","Ferraro, Daiana; Arias, Ana Paula; Pérez, Guadalupe; Gómez, Sandra; Deschutter, Verónica; Highton, Esmeralda; Taicz, Moira; Trugman, Fernanda; Picollo, Micaela; Bologna, Rosa; Rosanova, María Teresa",Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0716-10182021000400506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652396/,520

As the world has largely adapted to remote platforms for employment, socializing, and health service delivery, the degree to which virtual opportunities for social engagement may offset the impact of limited in-person interactions on mental health functioning is unknown. This column offers preliminary data from an ongoing experience sampling study of the prevalence, course, and impact of loneliness on mental health in a community adult sample living under social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial findings aggregated across all experience sampling reports showed negative associations between virtual social contact (via text, phone, or videoconferencing) and feelings of loneliness, while in-person interactions appeared to have no impact on loneliness. In addition, respondents reported frequent instances of negative effects on physical and mental health, including disruptions in sleep and recurring suicidal ideation. While further analyses are needed, these findings are consistent with similar emerging reports showing increased rates of mental health concerns during periods of social distancing. Possible avenues for addressing these concerns using remote interventions are explored.","Lewis, Katie",Journal of psychiatric practice,https://doi.org/10.1097/pra.0000000000000488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936586/,520
138230,Application of a motion capture data glove for hand and wrist ergonomic analysis during laparoscopy.,2014,"The idea of specimen self-collection or self-STI testing is not new. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the ""WHO Consolidated Guideline on Self-Care Interventions for Health"" as a first installment in a planned series for various diseases (8). The first document focused on ""Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights"". Self-care including self-testing has the readily apparent benefits of privacy, confidentiality, speed, convenience, and access if the price is affordable. It is ""people-centered"" (9) and enables active participation in one's own health. It is also a health system approach as it can reduce burden on stretched systems with world-wide shortages in medical personnel or other barriers to health care access. Potential risks include: low specimen return rates, uncertain follow-up (linkage to care including treatment, repeat testing including test of cure, partner notification, counseling on risk reduction), unintended/unnecessary use (resulting in false positives with their own set of associated problems), incorrect use, lack of understanding of window periods (resulting in false negatives), lack of surveillance data generation, among other issues (9). The WHO systematically reviewed evidence for self-testing or specimen self-collection for GC, CT and syphilis, including US studies, and published a meta-analysis of available evidence (9). Programs offering self-collection of samples increased overall uptake of STI testing services (RR: 2.941, 95% CI 1.188 to 7.281) and case finding (RR: 2.166, 95% CI1.043 to 4.498), prior to the pandemic (9). U. S. laboratory research on the equivalence and/or superiority of self-collected versus provider-collected specimens for test sensitivity was reported by Gaydos et al (summarized or referenced in (10)). Based on this evidence, WHO issued a new recommendation in 2019 ""Self-collection of samples for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis should be made available as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services for individuals using STI testing services"" (8). In addition, WHO issued a new and conditional recommendation: ""Self-collection of samples for Treponema pallidum (syphilis) and Trichomonas vaginalis may be considered as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services for Individuals using STI testing services"" (8).

138489,Prospective non-randomized comparison of open versus laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair under different anesthetic methods.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES For reduced port surgery in pediatric patients, the initial umbilical incision plays an important role in both functional ability and cosmetic impact. Larger umbilical incisions enable better manipulation of forceps, extraction of larger surgical specimens, and easier exteriorization of the intestine for anastomosis. We have pursued an incision of the small pediatric umbilicus that allows for enlargement of the orifice of the abdominal opening with preservation of the natural umbilical profile. This article aims to present a new umbilical incision technique and describe the outcomes. METHODS We devised a new umbilical incision technique for reduced port surgery in pediatric patients. Our incision is made in an inverted Y shape (Benz incision), allowing for access port device insertion. The Benz incision technique was applied between November 2010 and May 2014 and was retrospectively studied. RESULTS Seventy-five patients underwent Benz incisions. The median age of all patients was 6 years 6 months (range, 26 days to 18 years), and the median body weight was 21.7 kg (range, 3.1-54.3 kg). Benz incisions were applied for various procedures, including reduced port surgery with hepaticojejunostomy for congenital biliary dilatation, portojejunostomy for biliary atresia, Meckel diverticulectomy, tumor resection, varicocelectomy, cholecystectomy, splenectomy, ileus surgery, ileocecal resection, and total colectomy. All patients were successfully treated, without a significant increase in operating time or severe complications. The cosmetic profile of the umbilicus was maintained after surgery. CONCLUSION The Benz incision is a feasible, effective, and scarless approach for reduced port surgery in pediatric patients whose umbilical rings are too small for the conventional approach.","Amano, Hizuru; Uchida, Hiroo; Kawashima, Hiroshi; Deie, Kyoichi; Murase, Naruhiko; Makita, Satoshi; Yokota, Kazuki; Tanaka, Yujiro",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25848185/,520

The experiment demonstrates that when a chatbot induces hypocrisy by reminding participants that they have failed to comply with social distancing recommendations, they feel guilty about violating social norms. To reinstate confidence in their personal standards, they form favorable attitudes toward the chatbot ad and establish intentions to comply with recommendations. Interestingly, the persuasive power of hypocrisy induction differs depending on the level of anthropomorphism of the chatbot. When a humanlike chatbot reminds them of their hypocritical behavior, participants feel higher levels of guilt and act more desirably, but a machinelike chatbot is not effective for creating guilt or generating compliance.","Kim, WooJin; Ryoo, Yuhosua","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652216/,520

However, bleeding control during surgery may pose a challenge. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review recent evidence regarding interventions to control bleeding during laparoscopic myomectomy. RECENT FINDINGS The use of vasopressin resulted in less blood loss compared to placebo. Barbed sutures reduced blood loss compared to conventional sutures. Intravenous infusion of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the intraoperative period of large myomectomies showed no significant difference compared to placebo. Uterine artery occlusion (UAO) and emergency uterine artery embolization were reported to be feasible and may reduce and treat bleeding before conversion to laparotomy. SUMMARY Several methods can control bleeding during laparoscopic myomectomy. Vasopressin and barbed sutures resulted in decreased blood loss, and TXA did not have an impact on bleeding control. The use of UAO and emergency embolization techniques can contribute to the control of bleeding; however, further studies are needed to prove the efficacy of these and other agents.","Barbosa, Priscila Almeida; Villaescusa, Marina; Andres, Marina Paula; Fernandes, Luiz Flavio Cordeiro; Abrão, Mauricio S",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34148975/,520
139096,Face validity of the pulsatile organ perfusion trainer for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND Research on the use of video-mediated technology for medical consultation is increasing rapidly and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that focused on physical examination in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in post-surgery consultations has never been studied yet. Also, comparative analysis of the face-to-face and video-setting on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. OBJECTIVE The objective of our study was to examine the impact of video technology on the workings of assessments of post-surgery wounds and its limits. METHODS We recorded 22 post-operative video consultations and 17 post-operative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was informing the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen and the secondary purpose was checking on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of Conversation Analysis. RESULTS The way in which an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (15 out of 17) involve wound showings in the context of which surgeons report their observations formatted with evidentials (""looks neat"") and subsequently assess what these observations imply or what can be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (3 out of 22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments in which diagnostic criteria like redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (""I think"", ""sounds… good"") and evidentials are absent. Even in case of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may reside in questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the video technology on post-operative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians inquire and patients provide their own, ""lay"" observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that in video consultations patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in case of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial. The findings are expected to be generalizable to other healthcare areas, e.g., dermatology, physiotherapy.

Ripening of tomato fruit is associated with several modifications such as loss of cell wall firmness and transformation of chloroplasts to chromoplasts. Besides a peak in H2O2, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are observed at the transition stage. However, the role of different components of oxidative stress metabolism in fruit ripening has been scarcely addressed. Two GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GGP) Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Micro-Tom mutants which have fruit with low ascorbic acid content (30% of wild type) were used in this work to unravel the participation of ascorbic acid and H2O2 in fruit maturation. Both GGP mutants show delayed fruit maturation with no peak of H2O2; treatment with ascorbic acid increases its own concentration and accelerates ripening only in mutants to become like wild type plants. Unexpectedly, the treatment with ascorbic acid increases H2O2 synthesis in both mutants resembling what is observed in wild type fruit. Exogenous supplementation with H2O2 decreases its own synthesis delaying fruit maturation in plants with low ascorbic acid content. The site of ROS production is localized in the chloroplasts of fruit of all genotypes as determined by confocal microscopy analysis. The results presented here demonstrate that both ascorbic acid and H2O2 actively participate in tomato fruit ripening.","Steelheart, Charlotte; Alegre, Matías Leonel; Baldet, Pierre; Rothan, Christophe; Bres, Cecile; Just, Daniel; Okabe, Yoshihiro; Ezura, Hiroshi; Ganganelli, Inti; Gergoff Grozeff, Gustavo Esteban; Bartoli, Carlos Guillermo",Planta,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-020-03440-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767124/,520
139393,"Abdominal Wall ""Closure"".",2015,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence and abundance of sewage and animal fecal contamination of sediment at seven estuarine locations in Sydney, NSW, Australia. Sediment samples were tested for the occurrence of microbial targets including molecular marker genes of enterococci (ENT), Bacteroides HF183 (HF183), Methanobrevibacter smithii (nifH), human adenovirus (HAdV) and emerging sewage-associated marker genes crAssphage (CPQ_056) and Lachnospiraceae (Lachno3) and animal feces-associated marker genes, including avian feces-associated Helicobacter spp. (GFD), canine-feces associated Bacteroides (DogBact), cattle-feces associated (cowM2) and horse feces-associated Bacteroides (HoF597). Results from this study showed that urban estuarine sediment can act as a reservoir of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and several microbial source tracking (MST) marker genes, including previously unreported Lachno3. The sewage-associated marker gene CPQ_056 was most prevalent, in 63.8% of sediment samples, while the avian associated marker gene GFD had the highest mean abundance. The GFD marker gene was highly abundant and widely detected in sediment samples from all seven locations compared to the other animal feces-associated marker genes. In all, 31 (44.9%) sediment samples were positive for at least two sewage-associated marker genes. However, the non-quantifiable detection of the HAdV marker gene did not always align with the detection of two or more sewage-associated marker genes. In addition, the most frequent wet weather overflow exposure occurred at locations that did not have a consistent pattern of detection of the sewage-associated marker genes, suggesting sediments may not be a suitable measure of recent sewage contamination. To assist water quality and public health managers better understand past microbial contamination of estuarine sediment, further studies seem justified to explore the role of decay of MST marker genes in sediment. Further work is also needed on the role of resuspension of MST marker genes from sediment during storm events to the water column as a source of contamination for both the GFD and sewage-associated marker genes.","Ahmed, Warish; Payyappat, Sudhi; Cassidy, Michele; Harrison, Nathan; Marinoni, Oswald; Besley, Colin",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818744/,520

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer is technically feasible, but there are no data to evaluate the long-term outcome between laparoscopic and open approach. Moreover, the long-term impact of conversion is not known. METHODS Between 1994 and 2006, patients treated by open (1994-1999) and laparoscopic (2000-2006) curative resection for rectal cancer were included in a retrospective comparative study. Patients with fixed tumors or metastatic disease were excluded. Those with T3-T4 or N+ disease received long course preoperative radiotherapy. Surgical technique and follow-up were standardized. Survival were analyzed by Kaplan Meier method and compared with the Log Rank test. RESULTS Some 471 patients had rectal excision for invasive rectal carcinoma: 238 were treated by laparoscopy and 233 by open procedure. Postoperative mortality (0.8% vs. 2.6%; P = 0.17), morbidity (22.7% vs. 20.2%; P = 0.51), and quality of surgery (92.0% vs. 94.8% R0 resection; P = 0.22) were similar in the 2 groups. At 5 years, there was no difference of local recurrence (3.9% vs. 5.5%; P = 0.371) and cancer-free survival (82% vs. 79%; P = 0.52) between laparoscopic and open surgery. Multivariate analysis confirmed that type of surgery did not influence cancer outcome. Conversion (36/238, 15%) had no negative impact on postoperative mortality, local recurrence, and survival. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of laparoscopic surgery in a team specialized in rectal excision for cancer (open and laparoscopic surgery) is suggested with similar long-term local control and cancer-free survival than open surgery. Moreover, conversion had no negative impact on survival.","Laurent, Christophe; Leblanc, Fabien; Wütrich, Philippe; Scheffler, Mathieu; Rullier, Eric",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3181ad6511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561481/,520
139942,"Modified transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy: double-incision, triple-port access.",2013,"BACKGROUND Single-port access laparoscopic surgery is emerging as a method to improve the morbidity and cosmetic benefits of conventional laparoscopic surgery and minimize the surgical trauma. However, the feasibility of this procedure in rectal surgery has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate our initial experience using single-port access in laparoscopic rectal surgery. DESIGN This investigation was designed as a prospective clinical study. SETTINGS The study took place in a university hospital. PATIENTS Ten patients with nonmetastatic rectal cancer underwent rectal resections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures are perioperative data including intraoperative and postoperative complications, pathological outcome, length of stay, and short-term follow-up. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 67 (range, 49-83) and the median body mass index was 23.5 kg/m (range, 20-25 kg/m). Six patients had previously had abdominal surgery. The operations were 6 low anterior resections (4 receiving diverting ileostomy), 2 anterior resections, 1 Hartmann procedure, and 1 abdominoperineal resection. The median operative time was 229 minutes (range, 185-318), and blood loss ranged from 0 to 100 mL. In 2 cases, it was necessary to add an extra 5-mm port to deal with intraoperative complications. The median hospital stay was 7 days (range, 4-14). There were no anastomotic leaks and no mortality. All of the resection margins were clear, and the circumferential resection margin was a median of 11 mm (range, 2.5-25). The median number of lymph nodes examined was 14 (range, 3-20). LIMITATIONS This study's limitations include the lack of registration of postoperative pain, immunological parameters, and long-term clinical and oncological outcome. The small sample size makes it difficult to ascertain complication and conversion rates. CONCLUSIONS Single-port access laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can be performed safely in slim patients with a small tumor. This technique can be an alternative option for selected patients in the hands of skilled laparoscopic surgeons. Prospective comparative studies are needed to determine the role for this technique approach in the future.","Bulut, Orhan; Nielsen, Claus B; Jespersen, Niels",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3182147b4d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21654246/,520

The relevant guidelines for patients with intracranial aneurysms aim to standardize the clinical practice and decision making for these patients. However, their management is controversial, and the quality of the guidelines has not been assessed. We aim to evaluate the quality of the guidelines for intracranial aneurysms as well as to compare and analyze the recommendations between different guidelines. Systematic searches were conducted to identify the guidelines for intracranial aneurysms from general electronic and guideline databases. Two independent reviewers identified the guidelines and extracted the data, and four reviewers independently evaluated the eligible guidelines through the AGREE II tool. Agreement among reviewers was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient. A total of 12 guidelines, which were published from 1997 to 2016, were included. The agreement among reviewers was high (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.85 (95% CI: 0.8-0.89)). The mean scores of six domains ranged from 16.5 to 57.5% (scope and purpose 57.5% (39-68%); stakeholder 30.8% (19-46%); rigor 31.9% (19-52%); clarity 57.2% (42-79%); applicability 24.9% (16-42%); and editorial independence: 16.5% (0-58%)). Furthermore, 202 recommendations related to intracranial aneurysms were collected from the included guidelines. Of these, 143 reported the quality of evidence and/or strength, and 119 reported both the quality of evidence and the strength. Of the 119 recommendations, there were six class A and 20 class B recommendations based on level III evidence. There were 12 recommendations in which the contents were similar between different guidelines and two recommendations with the opposite contents. The AGREE II scores of the guidelines for intracranial aneurysms were relatively low. The majority of recommendations were rated as classes A and B and based on levels II and III evidence. Approximately a fifth of strong recommendations was based on a low quality of evidence without interpretation or explanation.","Li, Qiao; Yang, Yingchun; Pan, Yawen; Duan, Lei; Yang, Hu",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-017-0905-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28905137/,520

We have modified the technique by using a two-incision triple-port access approach and conventional laparoscopic instruments. A total of 52 patients accepted the modified transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and all the procedures were completed successfully. The operative time was 150 minutes for the first case, 100 minutes and 90 minutes for the second and third cases, and an average of 50 ± 14 minutes for the following 49 cases. All patients were discharged on post-operative day 3. No complications were observed during a follow-up of at least three months. The umbilical incisions were nearly invisible, and all patients were satisfied with the abdominal cosmetic results.In conclusion, transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a double-incision triple-port access approach and conventional laparoscopic instruments as described in this study is safe and feasible, and it reduces the conflict of instruments without using special devices.","Zhang, Hai-Feng; Lu, Chun-Lei; Gao, Ying; Chen, Dong-Feng; Wang, Wei-Jia",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2012.704875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22793779/,520

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to critical illness affecting almost every organ including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Myoclonus, a less expected and relatively unusual neurological complication, together with ataxia, has lately been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We describe the case of a 67-year-old male patient, admitted to our hospital for interstitial bilateral pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, who progressively developed general myoclonus and later cerebellar ataxia and gait disturbance. Given the timeline from COVID-19 systemic symptoms to neurological manifestations and the normal results of extensive and non-conclusive diagnostic work-up (blood test, lumbar puncture, EEG, cerebral MRI), a para-infectious encephalopathy related to SARS-CoV-2 was contemplated and a high dose of methylprednisolone was started with prompt symptom improvement. Further investigation and neuroepidemiological studies are needed to help define the mechanism of neuroinvasion and the entire spectrum of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in mildly affected patients, in terms of prevention, treatment and possible neurological sequelae.

141083,Abdominal wall reconstruction with components separation and mesh reinforcement in complex hernia repair.,2014,"Background: Scopus is a leading bibliometric database. It contains the largest number of articles cited in peer-reviewed publications . The journals included in Scopus are periodically re-evaluated to ensure they meet indexing criteria and some journals might be discontinued for publication concerns. These journals remain indexed and can be cited. Their metrics have yet to be studied. This study aimed to evaluate the main features and metrics of journals discontinued from Scopus for publication concerns, before and after their discontinuation, and to determine the extent of predatory journals among the discontinued journals. Methods: We surveyed the list of discontinued journals from Scopus (July 2019). Data regarding metrics, citations and indexing were extracted from Scopus or other scientific databases, for the journals discontinued for publication concerns. Results: A total of 317 journals were evaluated. Ninety-three percent of the journals (294/318) declared they published using an Open Access model. The subject areas with the greatest number of discontinued journals were Medicine (52/317; 16%), Agriculture and Biological Science (34/317; 11%), and Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (31/317; 10%). The mean number of citations per year after discontinuation was significantly higher than before (median of difference 64 citations, p<0.0001), and so was the number of citations per document (median of difference 0.4 citations, p<0.0001). Twenty-two percent (72/317) were included in the Cabell's blacklist. The DOAJ currently included only 9 journals while 61 were previously included and discontinued, most for 'suspected editorial misconduct by the publisher'. Conclusions: The citation count of journals discontinued for publication concerns increases despite discontinuation and predatory behaviors seemed common. This paradoxical trend can inflate scholars' metrics prompting artificial career advancements, bonus systems and promotion. Countermeasures should be taken urgently to ensure the reliability of Scopus metrics both at the journal- and author-level for the purpose of scientific assessment of scholarly publishing.","Cortegiani, Andrea; Ippolito, Mariachiara; Ingoglia, Giulia; Manca, Andrea; Cugusi, Lucia; Severin, Anna; Strinzel, Michaela; Panzarella, Vera; Campisi, Giuseppina; Manoj, Lalu; Gregoretti, Cesare; Einav, Sharon; Moher, David; Giarratano, Antonino",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.23847.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024548/,520

During the pandemic, nurses have faced an elevated risk of exposure and have experienced the hazards related to a novel virus. While being heralded as lifesaving heroes on the front lines of the pandemic, nurses have experienced more physical, mental and psychosocial problems as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media discussions by nursing professionals participating in publicly formed Facebook groups constitute a valuable resource that offers longitudinal insights. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to explore how COVID-19 impacted nurses through capturing public sentiments expressed by nurses on social media discussion platforms and how these sentiments changed over time. METHODS We collected over 110,993 Facebook discussion posts and comments in an open COVID-19 group for nurses from March 2020 until the end of November 2020. A de-identified offline HTML scraping on social media posts and comments was performed. Using subject-matter expert opinions and social media analytics (topic modeling, information retrieval and sentiment analysis), we performed a human-in-a-loop nursing key perspectives analysis to identify trends of the COVID-19 impact among at-risk nursing communities. We further investigated the key insights of the nursing perspectives trends by detecting temporal changes of comments related to emotional effects, feeling of frustration, impacts of isolation, shortage of safety equipment and the frequency of safety equipment uses. Anonymous quotes were highlighted to add context to the data. RESULTS We determined that COVID-19 impacted nurses' physical, mental and psychosocial health as expressed in the form of emotional distress, anger, anxiety, frustration, loneliness and isolation. Major topics discussed by nurses were related to work during a pandemic, misinformation spread by the media, improper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), PPE side effects, the effects of testing positive and lost days of work related to illness.

The frequency of seroma increases further among obese patients, who have achieved massive weight loss after bariatric surgery. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of fibrin glues with a low concentration of thrombin in reducing seroma formation after a lipo-abdominoplasty. METHODS Thirty patients, that had achieved a significant weight loss after an intervention of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), underwent a circular lipo-abdominoplasty at our bariatric surgery department. Patients were divided into two groups of 15 subjects each: group A underwent traditional surgery; in group B, we applied a slow-clotting variant of fibrin glue (ARTISS, Baxter) under the abdominal flap. All subjects were evaluated clinically using an ultrasound device on postoperative day 15. We considered positive for seroma, those cases with a liquid collection greater than 20 cc. RESULTS The groups were homogeneous for age, BMI, male/female ratio, and diabetic or smoker patients. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in group A than in group B. We found eight cases of serum collection >20 cc in group A and only one case in group B. Hematoma, umbilicus necrosis, and surgical site infection occurred in both groups, but overall complication rate was lower in group B.

Role of a new device.,2017,"Resistant hypertension continues to pose a major challenge to clinicians worldwide and has serious implications for patients who are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with this diagnosis. Pharmacological therapy for resistant hypertension follows guidelines-based regimens although there is surprisingly scant evidence for beneficial outcomes using additional drug treatment after three antihypertensives have failed to achieve target blood pressure. Recently there has been considerable interest in the use of endoluminal renal denervation as an interventional technique to achieve renal nerve ablation and lower blood pressure. Although initial clinical trials of renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension demonstrated encouraging office blood pressure reduction, a large randomised control trial (Symplicity HTN-3) with a sham-control limb, failed to meet its primary efficacy end point. The trial however was subject to a number of flaws which must be taken into consideration in interpreting the final results. Moreover a substantial body of evidence from non-randomised smaller trials does suggest that renal denervation may have an important role in the management of hypertension and other disease states characterised by overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. The Joint UK Societies does not recommend the use of renal denervation for treatment of resistant hypertension in routine clinical practice but remains committed to supporting research activity in this field. A number of research strategies are identified and much that can be improved upon to ensure better design and conduct of future randomised studies.","Lobo, Melvin D; de Belder, Mark A; Cleveland, Trevor; Collier, David; Dasgupta, Indranil; Deanfield, John; Kapil, Vikas; Knight, Charles; Matson, Matthew; Moss, Jonathan; Paton, Julian F R; Poulter, Neil; Simpson, Iain; Williams, Bryan; Caulfield, Mark J",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431461/,520

Here we create a guide to help with the transition from pediatric to adult for patients with DS. METHODS Experts in Dravet syndrome flagged the main barriers in caring for adults with DS and created a 2-page transition summary guide based on their expertise and a literature review. RESULTS The 2-page guide addresses: DS diagnosis in children and adults; clinical manifestations, including the differences in seizures types and frequencies between children and adults with DS; the natural history of intellectual disability, behavior, gait, motor disorders and dysautonomia; a review of optimal treatments (including medications not commonly used in adult epilepsy settings such as stiripentol and fenfluramine), as well as emergency seizure management; avoidance of triggers, preventive measures, and vaccine administration in adults with DS.

Herein, we define displaced populations and, within this context, review the epidemiology of skin diseases, discuss pertinent skin conditions, examine challenges to care provision, and present approaches for improving dermatologic care. Inflammatory and communicable infectious disorders are the most common skin diseases seen in displaced populations. Other relevant conditions include skin manifestations of heat injuries, cold injuries, immersion foot syndromes, macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, torture, and sexual and gender-based violence. Provision of dermatologic care to displaced populations is hampered by limited diagnostic and therapeutic resources and specialist expertise. Medical screening for cutaneous disorders, context-relevant dermatology training, and telemedicine are potential tools to improve diagnosis and management of skin diseases in displaced populations.","Knapp, Alexia P; Rehmus, Wingfield; Chang, Aileen Y",International journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.15063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32686140/,520

Among the most exciting advances, the possibility of using free radical chemistry has attracted the attention of the most important synthetic groups. Nowadays, electrochemical strategies based on these species with a synthetic purpose are published continuously in scientific journals, increasing the alternatives for the synthetic organic chemistry laboratories. Free radicals can be obtained in organic electrochemical reactions; thus, this review reassembles the last decade's (2010-2020) efforts of the electrosynthetic community to generate and take advantage of the C-, O-, and N-centered radicals' reactivity. The electrochemical reactions that occur, as well as the proposed mechanism, are discussed, trying to give clear information about the used conditions and reactivity of these reactive intermediate species.","Chicas-Baños, Diego Francisco; Frontana-Uribe, Bernardo A",Chemical record,https://doi.org/10.1002/tcr.202100056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047059/,520
143482,Long-term follow-up after sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus one-anastomosis gastric bypass: a prospective randomized comparative study of weight loss and remission of comorbidities.,2019,"BACKGROUND Hypnotic depth during anesthesia affects electroencephalography waveforms and electroencephalogram-derived indices, such as the bispectral index (BIS). Titrating anesthetic administration against the BIS assumes reliable relationships between BIS values, electroencephalogram waveforms, and effect site concentration, beyond loss of responsiveness. Associations among BIS, end-tidal anesthetic concentrations (ETAC), and patient characteristics were examined during anesthetic maintenance, using B-Unaware trial data. METHODS Pharmacokinetically stable ETAC epochs during intraoperative anesthetic maintenance were analyzed. A generalized estimating equation determined independent relationships among BIS, ETAC (in age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration equivalents), patient characteristics, and 1-yr mortality. Further individual and population characteristics were explored graphically. RESULTS A total of 3,347,523 data points from 1,100 patients were analyzed over an ETAC range from 0.42 to 1.51 age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration. A generalized estimating equation yielded a best predictive equation: BIS = 62.9-1.6 (if age younger than 60 yr) -1.6 (if female) -2.5 (if American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status more than 3) -2.6 (if deceased at 1 yr) -2.5 (if N2O was not used) -1.4 (if midazolam dose more than 2 mg) -1.3 (if opioid dose more than 50 morphine equivalents) -15.4 × age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration. Although a population relationship between ETAC and BIS was apparent, interindividual variability in the strength and reliability of this relationship was large. Decreases in BIS with increasing ETAC were not reliably observed. Individual-patient linear regression yielded a median slope of -8 BIS/1 age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range -30, 0) and a median correlation coefficient of -0.16 (interquartile range -0.031, -0.50). CONCLUSIONS Independent of pharmacokinetic confounding, BIS frequently correlates poorly with ETAC, is often insensitive to clinically significant changes in ETAC, and is vulnerable to interindividual variability. BIS is therefore incapable of finely guiding volatile anesthetic titration during anesthetic maintenance.","Whitlock, Elizabeth L; Villafranca, Alexander J; Lin, Nan; Palanca, Ben J; Jacobsohn, Eric; Finkel, Kevin J; Zhang, Lini; Burnside, Beth A; Kaiser, Heiko A; Evers, Alex S; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e3182395dcb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037642/,520

143814,Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: also for the treatment of retrorectal tumors.,2014,"OBJECTIVE Racial/ethnic disparities in obesity may be due, in part, to minority groups consuming more energy-rich diets in response to greater stress exposure. The present study systematically reviewed the literature describing the effects of stress on food consumption among various racial/ethnic groups in the US. METHODS PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies reporting associations between stress and food consumption by different racial/ethnic groups, conducted between January 1, 1999 to November 25, 2019. The search included terms related to food consumption, stress, and race/ethnicity. After screening 3660 records, 30 studies were included for review. RESULTS The selected studies assessed diverse stressors and eating constructs; African-American and Hispanic/Latinx were the most commonly studied minority groups. Studies generally supported that diverse forms of stress exposure are associated with reduced healthy eating patterns and increased obesogenic eating patterns across racial/ethnic groups. However, studies that directly compared stress-eating associations among multiple racial/ethnic groups showed mixed results. CONCLUSION Members of diverse racial/ethnic groups are susceptible to stress-induced unhealthy eating patterns, though evidence is insufficient to conclude whether the degree of susceptibility differs among groups. Additional studies utilizing observational measures of food intake and culturally sensitive measures of stress are needed to identify the most influential stressors on dietary behaviors, to assess whether some stressors are more salient for given racial/ethnic groups, and to examine the extent to which stress-induced eating contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related diseases.","Kazmierski, Kelly F M; Gillespie, Marie L; Kuo, Sabrina; Zurita, Tomas; Felix, Dania; Rao, Uma",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00849-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839895/,520

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) face unique challenges during the pandemic, including concerns regarding infection risk, drug shortages, limited access to care, social isolation, and mental health. This review will examine the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients living with RA. RECENT FINDINGS In patients with RA, risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes include older age and comorbidities, similar to those in the general population. Glucocorticoids, but not other classes of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), appear to be associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. RA patients have been affected by changes in access to care, telemedicine, drug shortages, anxiety, and social isolation, which may contribute to disease flares. SUMMARY Glucocorticoids, but not other DMARDs, are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in RA patients. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of specific DMARDs on COVID-19 outcomes, understand the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on RA disease activity, and optimize the use of telemedicine in RA management.","D'Silva, Kristin M; Wallace, Zachary S",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625043/,520
144679,Predictors of weight loss are different in men and women after sleeve gastrectomy.,2014,"What is the central question of this study? Do individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest or during exercise? What is the main finding and its importance? Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have a greater prevalence of blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest than age-matched control subjects. Given that the intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses are large enough to permit venous emboli to pass into the arterial circulation, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and an elevated risk of thrombus formation may be at risk of intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomosis-facilitated embolic injury (e.g. stroke or transient ischaemic attack). The pulmonary capillaries prevent stroke by filtering venous emboli from the circulation. Intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses are large-diameter (≥50 μm) vascular connections in the lung that may compromise the integrity of the pulmonary capillary filter and have recently been linked to cryptogenic stroke and transient ischaemic attack. Prothrombotic populations, such as individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may be at increased risk of stroke and transient ischaemic attack facilitated by intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses, but the prevalence and degree of blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses in this population has not been fully examined and compared with age-matched healthy control subjects. We used saline contrast echocardiography to assess blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest (n = 29 COPD and 19 control subjects) and during exercise (n = 10 COPD and 10 control subjects) in subjects with COPD and age-matched healthy control subjects. Blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses was detected in 23% of subjects with COPD at rest and was significantly higher compared with age-matched healthy control subjects. Blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest was reduced or eliminated in subjects with COPD after breathing hyperoxic gas. Sixty per cent of subjects with COPD who did not have blood flow through the intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest had blood flow through them during exercise. The combination of blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses and potential for thrombus formation in individuals with COPD may permit venous emboli to pass into the arterial circulation and cause stroke and transient ischaemic attack. Breathing supplemental oxygen may reduce this risk in COPD. The link between blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses, stroke and transient ischaemic attack is worthy of future investigation in COPD and other populations.","Norris, H Cameron; Mangum, Tyler S; Kern, Julia P; Elliott, Jonathan E; Beasley, Kara M; Goodman, Randy D; Mladinov, Suzana; Barak, Otto F; Bakovic, Darija; Dujic, Zeljko; Lovering, Andrew T",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep085811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339093/,520

RESULTS One-quarter of IPFs were in counties with high or very high COVID-19 vulnerability. On average, 84% of patients at IPFs were screened for influenza immunization status and were offered an immunization if indicated. Only 57% of patients had their records transmitted to another provider within 24 hours of discharge, and 50% had a follow-up visit with a mental health provider within 30 days. Scores on attainment of follow-up care were worse in counties with higher COVID-19 vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS IPFs may be well positioned to offer COVID-19 vaccinations but will need new processes and improved rates of follow-up care to ensure that patients receive the second dose.","Brown, Jonathan D; Bell, Nadia",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015949/,520
145719,Combined paraesophageal hernia repair and partial longitudinal gastrectomy in obese patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias.,2012,"INTRODUCTION A tracheal bronchus is rarely observed, occurring in only 1% of all patients who undergo thoracic surgeries. We rarely encounter lung cancer in a patient with a tracheal bronchus; however, it is essential to know the distinctive perioperative management strategy for patients with a tracheal bronchus. CASE PRESENTATION We report a 72-year-old man with lung cancer located in the right apical segment supplied by a tracheal bronchus. Annual chest computed tomography performed as follow-up after colon cancer resection showed an enlarging pulmonary nodule with pure ground-glass opacity, which was suspected to be lung adenocarcinoma. The nodule was located in the right apical segment. The apical segment was independently supplied by a single pulmonary artery superior trunk and a tracheal bronchus that branched directly from the trachea at 1.2 cm above the carina. The pulmonary vein branching pattern was uncommon in that the central vein that usually runs through B2 (posterior bronchus) and B3 (anterior bronchus) was missing. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic apical segmentectomy under one-lung ventilation using a left-sided double-lumen tube. DISCUSSION Anomalous venous return accompanied with tracheal bronchus has been described in some reports. Since pulmonary vein is important during segmentectomy, the surgeon should pay particular attention to the venous return. CONCLUSION Preoperative three-dimensional graphic imagery helped us accurately identify the anatomical anomaly to enable the successful segmentectomy in a patient with a tracheal bronchus. We review the relevant literature regarding the perioperative management of patients with a tracheal bronchus.","Akamine, Takaki; Kometani, Takuro; Miura, Naoko; Yoshimura, Hayashi; Shikada, Yasunori",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044263/,520
145771,Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for faecal incontinence: equivalent benefit is seen in internal and external rectal prolapse.,2015,"BACKGROUND The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic broke out in December 2019 and is now characterized as a pandemic. Effective control of this infectious disease requires access to diagnostic techniques, for both case finding and epidemic size estimation. The molecular technique is routinely used worldwide. Although it is the ""standard"" case detection and management method, it has its own shortcomings. Thus, some easy-to-use rapid serological tests have been developed. METHODS One hundred and fourteen positive RT-PCR-diagnosed patients were tested by VivaDiag Kit, a brand of rapid serological kits available in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. Frozen serum specimens taken from healthy people in summer and fall 2019 were also tested as negative controls. RESULTS Test sensitivity was 47.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.8-56.9) for IgM and 47.0% (95% CI: 38.0-56.0) for IgG. There was no difference between IgG and IgM seropositivity except in one case. Specificity was calculated as 99.0% (95% CI: 96.4-99.9) for IgM and of 100.0% (95% CI: 0.98.2-100.0) for IgG. Sensitivity was higher in men and older participants. CONCLUSION This test can be used for epidemiological investigations, especially for the estimation of the level of infection in the community, after it is properly corrected for sensitivity and specificity. The low sensitivity could be attributed to the technical limitations of the kit or low levels of antibodies after infection. The different sensitivity in age and sex groups supports the hypothesis that different people show different immune responses to this virus.","Shamsollahi, Hamid Reza; Amini, Mostafa; Alizadeh, Shaban; Nedjat, Saharnaz; Akbari-Sari, Ali; Rezaei, Mehdi; Allameh, Seyed Farshad; Fotouhi, Akbar; Yunesian, Masud",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32979911/,520

Social isolation and distancing measures have been the only prevention available for months. Scientific research has done a great deal of work, developing in a few months safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. In the European Union, nowadays, four vaccines have been authorized for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca/Oxford), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), and three others are currently under rolling review.Vaccine allocation policy is crucial to optimize the advantage of treatment preferring people with the highest risk of contagion. These days the priority in the vaccination program is of particular importance since it has become clear that the number of vaccines is not sufficient for the entire Italian population in the short term. Cardiovascular diseases are frequently associated with severe COVID-19 infections, leading to the worst prognosis. The elderly population suffering from cardiovascular diseases is, therefore, to be considered a particularly vulnerable population. However, age cannot be considered the only discriminating factor because in the young-adult population suffering from severe forms of heart disease, the prognosis, if affected by COVID-19, is particularly ominous and these patients should have priority access to the vaccination program. The aim of this position paper is to establish a consensus on a priority in the vaccination of COVID-19 among subjects suffering from different cardiovascular diseases.","Indolfi, Ciro; Barillà, Francesco; Basso, Cristina; Ciccone, Marco Matteo; Curcio, Antonio; Mancone, Massimo; Mercuro, Giuseppe; Muscoli, Saverio; Nodari, Savina; Pedrinelli, Roberto; Romeo, Francesco; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Filardi, Pasquale Perrone",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,https://doi.org/10.1714/3592.35745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960979/,520

Historical examples suggest that responses to forced abstinence may include compliance and abstinence, but also seeking alternatives to the original addiction and substitution. Substitution of alternative activities/objects may provide similar appetitive effects to fill the void of the terminated addictive behavior, temporarily or in the long-term. While substitutes do not necessarily portend a relapse, coupled with isolation and reduced recovery support, they can potentiate relapse to the former or 'new' addictive behavior.

Subsequently, data has emerged showing a significant CV benefit in patients treated with SGLT2i regardless of diabetes status. Renal protection has been initially evaluated in CV randomized trials only as secondary endpoints; nonetheless, the positive results gained have rapidly led to the evaluation of nephroprotection as primary outcome in the CREDENCE trial. Different renal and vascular mechanisms can account for the CV and renal benefits enlightened in recent literature. As clinical guidelines rapidly evolve and the role of SGLT2i appears to become pivotal for CV, T2DM, and kidney disease management, in this review, we analyze the renal effects of SGLT2, the benefits derived from its inhibition, and how this may result in the multiple CV and renal benefits evidenced in recent clinical trials.","Margonato, Davide; Galati, Giuseppe; Mazzetti, Simone; Cannistraci, Rosa; Perseghin, Gianluca; Margonato, Alberto; Mortara, Andrea",Heart failure reviews,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-020-10024-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901315/,520

The pathological substrate for these findings remains elusive. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. Generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. Based on these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with over 3000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of Spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited Spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focussed our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was Niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductances in Spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F/Anoctamin6, a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase responsible for phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and support the repurposing of Niclosamide for therapy.","Braga, Luca; Ali, Hashim; Secco, Ilaria; Chiavacci, Elena; Neves, Guilherme; Goldhill, Daniel; Penn, Rebecca; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Ortega-Prieto, Ana M; Bussani, Rossana; Cannatà, Antonio; Rizzari, Giorgia; Collesi, Chiara; Schneider, Edoardo; Arosio, Daniele; Shah, Ajay M; Barclay, Wendy S; Malim, Michael H; Burrone, Juan; Giacca, Mauro",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03491-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827113/,520

We illustrate two cases of an inguinal hernia where the defect was demonstrated to lie between the deep ring and the inferior epigastric vessels, therefore, not fitting the standard criteria for either direct or indirect inguinal hernias.

148248,Internal Herniation After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: Pitfalls in Diagnosing and the Introduction of the AMSTERDAM Classification.,2016,"OBJECTIVES Our aim was to evaluate the effect of standard surgical and N-95 respiratory mask use on maternal oxygen saturation, vital signs and result on non-stress tests in term pregnancies. METHODS It is a prospective observational study. The study included healthy, not in labor, singleton pregnant women of 370/7-410/7 weeks who were applied to our hospital for routine obstetric control examination between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Patients were randomised by coin toss method. Oxygen saturation, systolic, and diastolic arterial blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature of pregnant women using surgical masks and respiratory masks were measured before and after the non-stress test. The tolerance of the masks was also evaluated. Student's t-test was used for variables showing parametric distribution and the Mann Whitney U-test was used for non-parametric tests. The categorical variables between the groups was analyzed by using the Chi square test or Fisher Exact test. The statistical significance level was taken as p<0.05 in all tests. RESULTS A total of 297 pregnant women using masks were included in the study. The effect of mask type on oxygen saturation before and after the non-stress test was found to be significant (97.1±1.8 corresponds to 95.3±2.6 for the surgical mask, p=0.0001; 97.8±1.7 corresponds to 93.7±2.0 for the respiratory mask, p=0.0001). Mask tolerance of patients using respiratory masks was significantly higher than those using surgical masks (mean 8, 1-10, p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Surgical mask and respiratory mask usage decreased significantly in oxygen saturation in term pregnancies.","Toprak, Erzat; Bulut, Ayça Nazlı",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544533/,520

148904,A 10-year experience of totally extraperitoneal endoscopic repair for adult inguinal hernia.,2015,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a neurotropic alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes that causes encephalitis and death in humans1. VEEV is a biodefence concern because of its potential for aerosol spread and the current lack of sufficient countermeasures. The host factors that are required for VEEV entry and infection remain poorly characterized. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen, we identify low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain-containing 3 (LDLRAD3)-a highly conserved yet poorly characterized member of the scavenger receptor superfamily-as a receptor for VEEV. Gene editing of mouse Ldlrad3 or human LDLRAD3 results in markedly reduced viral infection of neuronal cells, which is restored upon complementation with LDLRAD3. LDLRAD3 binds directly to VEEV particles and enhances virus attachment and internalization into host cells. Genetic studies indicate that domain 1 of LDLRAD3 (LDLRAD3(D1)) is necessary and sufficient to support infection by VEEV, and both anti-LDLRAD3 antibodies and an LDLRAD3(D1)-Fc fusion protein block VEEV infection in cell culture. The pathogenesis of VEEV infection is abrogated in mice with deletions in Ldlrad3, and administration of LDLRAD3(D1)-Fc abolishes disease caused by several subtypes of VEEV, including highly virulent strains. The development of a decoy-receptor fusion protein suggests a strategy for the prevention of severe VEEV infection and associated disease in humans.","Ma, Hongming; Kim, Arthur S; Kafai, Natasha M; Earnest, James T; Shah, Aadit P; Case, James Brett; Basore, Katherine; Gilliland, Theron C; Sun, Chengqun; Nelson, Christopher A; Thackray, Larissa B; Klimstra, William B; Fremont, Daved H; Diamond, Michael S",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2915-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208938/,520
148928,Intraluminal erosion of laparoscopic gastric band tubing into duodenum with recurrent port-site infections.,2012,"BACKGROUND Treatment for pediatric cancer generates costs that place sizeable demands on family finances relative to household income. Little is known about whether children sense that their cancer has created financial problems for the family. The study purpose was to describe parents' perceptions about whether their child sensed that pediatric cancer created financial problems for their family. PROCEDURE Family Communications Theory informed our study. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis to examine parents' (n = 417) responses to questions about the child's sense of pediatric cancer-related financial problems from a larger survey study. RESULTS Approximately 56.2% of parents indicated that their child had no sense of the pediatric cancer-related financial problems and 44.1% indicated their child had some. Proportions of children perceived to sense these financial problems steadily increased with age grouping, while proportions perceived to have none declined. With content analysis, we identified cognitive capacity as the key child factor influencing children's sense of these problems. Influential context factors included social norms, observed changes in family routines and spending patterns, and overheard conversations between adults. Child psychological outcomes included guilt, anxiety about money, and feelings of being a burden. CONCLUSION Pediatric oncology professionals and staff should be mindful of parent preferences about burdening children with sensitive financial information, and modify their behaviors and processes accordingly. They can also provide anticipatory guidance and psycho-education about psychological responses related to the effects of pediatric cancer on family finances and the role of cognitive development in the evolution of children's awareness of those effects.","Santacroce, Sheila Judge; Killela, Mary K; Kamkhoad, Donruedee; Leckey, Jill A; Hubbard, Grace",Pediatric blood & cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.29080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894050/,520

METHODS A single-center retrospective study was conducted to enroll the COVID-19 patients in isolation ward of the only designated hospital to receive COVID-19 patients (the Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) when the authors were assigned by the Ningxia Health Commission as experts from January 20, 2020 to March 15, 2020. According to the antiviral regimen, the patients were divided into conventional antiviral group and unconventional antiviral group. The conventional antiviral group received α-interferon combined with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/R). The unconventional antiviral group was given α-interferon combined with LPV/R and Abidor or Ribavirin or Chloroquine. The patients were divided into mild (13 cases), ordinary (45 cases), severe (14 cases) and critical (1 case) types. The clinical data, length of hospital stay, the first 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid negative recovery time, cost of hospitalization, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive reversal after 14 days of discharge, and the combination of hormones and antibiotics were collected. The differences in blood routine, liver function, blood lipid level and adverse reactions of antiviral drugs during hospitalization were compared between the two groups at 1, 3 and 7 days after admission and 1 and 3 months after discharge. RESULTS (1) General information: a total of 75 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted, and 73 patients were eventually enrolled, including 47 cases in the conventional antiviral group and 26 cases in the unconventional antiviral group. Patients with different clinical classification were analyzed, the higher the clinical classification and the patients' age, the higher the proportion of primary diseases and the cost of treatment, and the longer the length of hospital stay. Compared with conventional antiviral group, in unconventional antiviral group the percentage of severe and critical patients were higher [34.6% (9/26) vs. 10.6% (5/47), 3.8% (1/26) vs. 0 (0/47)], the length of hospital stay (days: 16.1±5.6 vs. 11.6±3.3), first nucleic acid negative recovery time (days: 12.4±4.5 vs. 10.0±3.5) were longer, and hospitalization cost was higher [Yuan: 11 984.2 (9 000.6, 24 424.7) vs. 8 140.4 (6 715.7,9 707.7)], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in gender, age, proportion of patients with primary diseases and nucleic acid positive reversal rate after 14 days of discharge between the unconventional and conventional antiviral groups (all P > 0.05). (2) Laboratory tests: during the hospitalization, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), total bilirubin (TBil) and three acyl glycerin (TG) levels were first increased and then reduced, lymphocyte count (LYM) was first decreased and then increased in two groups. In the unconventional antiviral group, WBC [(6.53±2.78)×109/L], PLT [(250.77±96.12)×109/L], and TG [(1.94±0.96) μmol/L] all reached their peak values at 7 days after admission. TBil peaked at 3 days after admission, which was (23.69±12.14) μmol/L, and LYM reached the peak 1 month after discharge, which was (1.82±0.50)×109/L; however, there was no statistical significance among the above indicators between two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total cholesterol (TC) between the two groups at each time point. (3) The ratio of combined use of hormones in the non-antiviral group was significantly higher than that in the conventional antiviral group [26.9% (7/26) vs. 4.3% (2/47), P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS Age and associated primary diseases are related to the severity of COVID-19 patients. Unconventional antiviral treatment regimens are mostly used for severe COVID-19 patients whose ucleic acid did not turn negative for a long time. Individual antiviral therapy can be used based on the patients' response and tolerance to drugs.","Gao, Xiaofang; Ma, Chunxia; Ma, Yujie; Wang, Xiaoqi; Wei, Jianhua; Feng, Tao; Zhao, Guixia; Xu, Lin; Zhou, Wei; Zheng, Xiwei; Zhao, Qian; Cao, Xiangyuan",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20201019-00679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541491/,520

However, there is no accreditation requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the curricula. METHODS In this qualitative study, faculty across the three disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS All participants recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students. DISCUSSION Successful development of OH in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning.","Roopnarine, Rohini; Regan, Julie-Anne",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,https://doi.org/10.1097/ceh.0000000000000332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33433130/,520
149130,Outcomes of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in adolescents.,2012,"OBJECTIVES This study sought to perform a weighted meta-analysis of the complication risk during chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND The safety profile of CTO PCI has received limited study. METHODS We conducted a meta-analysis of 65 studies published between 2000 and 2011 reporting procedural complications of CTO PCI. Data on the frequency of death, emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, stroke, myocardial infarction, perforation, tamponade, stent thrombosis, major vascular or bleeding events, contrast nephropathy, and radiation skin injury were collected. RESULTS A total of 65 studies with 18,061 patients and 18,941 target CTO vessels were included. Pooled estimates of outcomes were as follows: angiographic success 77% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74.3% to 79.6%); death 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1% to 0.3%); emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0% to 0.2%); stroke <0.01% (95% CI: 0.0% to 0.1%); myocardial infarction 2.5% (95% CI: 1.9% to 3.0%); Q-wave myocardial infarction 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1% to 0.3%); coronary perforation 2.9% (95% CI: 2.2% to 3.6%); tamponade 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2% to 0.5%); and contrast nephropathy 3.8% (95% CI: 2.4% to 5.3%). Compared with successful procedures, unsuccessful procedures had higher rates of death (0.42% vs. 1.54%, p < 0.0001), perforation (3.65% vs. 10.70%, p < 0.0001), and tamponade (0% vs. 1.65%, p < 0.0001). Among 886 lesions treated with the retrograde approach, success rate was 79.8% with no deaths and low rates of emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (0.17%) and tamponade (1.2%).

We investigated whether direct infection of an AAV2 encoding a fragment of mutant huntingtin (AV2-82Q) into the rat striatum was useful for optimizing the Huntington rat model. Methods We prepared ten unilateral models by injecting AAV2-82Q into the right striatum, as well as ten bilateral models. In each group, five rats were assigned to either the 2×1012 genome copies (GC)/mL of AAV2-82Q (×1, low dose) or 2×1013 GC/mL of AAV2-82Q (×10, high dose) injection model. Ten unilateral and ten bilateral models injected with AAV-empty were also prepared as control groups. We performed cylinder and stepping tests 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after injection, tested EM48 positive mutant huntingtin aggregates. Results The high dose of unilateral and bilateral AAV2-82Q model showed a greater decrease in performance on the stepping and cylinder tests. We also observed more prominent EM48-positive mutant huntingtin aggregates in the medium spiny neurons of the high dose of AAV2-82Q injected group. Conclusion Based on the results from the present study, high dose of AAV2-82Q is the optimum titer for establishing a Huntington rat model. Delivery of high dose of human AAV2-82Q resulted in the manifestation of Huntington behaviors and optimum expression of the huntingtin protein in vivo.","So, Kyoung-Ha; Choi, Jai Ho; Islam, Jaisan; Kc, Elina; Moon, Hyeong Cheol; Won, So Yoon; Kim, Hyong Kyu; Kim, Soochong; Hyun, Sang-Hwan; Park, Young Seok",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2019.0182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32131152/,520

The objective of this study was to describe India's biennial HIV estimation 2017 process, data inputs, tool, methodology and epidemiological assumptions used to generate the HIV estimates and trends of key indicators for 2010-2017 at national and State/Union Territory levels. Methods Demographic Projection (DemProj) and AIDS Impact Modules (AIM) of Spectrum 5.63 software recommended by the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS Global Reference Group on HIV Estimates, Modelling and Projections, were used for generating HIV estimations on key indicators. HIV sentinel surveillance, epidemiological and programme data were entered into Estimation Projection Package (EPP), and curve fitting was done using EPP classic model. Finally, calibration was done using the State HIV prevalence of two rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -3 and -4 and Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS), 2014-2015. Results The national adult prevalence of HIV was estimated to be 0.22 per cent in 2017. Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland had the highest prevalence over one per cent. An estimated 2.1 million people were living with HIV in 2017, with Maharashtra estimated to have the highest number. Of the 88 thousand annual new HIV infections estimated nationally in 2017, Telangana accounted for the largest share. HIV incidence was found to be higher among key population groups, especially people who inject drugs. The annual AIDS-related deaths were estimated to be 69 thousand nationally. For all indicators, geographic variation in levels and trends between States existed. Interpretation & conclusions With a slow decline in annual new HIV infections by only 27 per cent from 2010 to 2017 against the national target of 75 per cent by 2020, the national target to end AIDS by 2030 may be missed; although at the sub-national level some States have made better progress to reduce new HIV infection. It calls for reinforcement of HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment efforts by geographical regions and population groups.","Sahu, Damodar; Kumar, Pradeep; Chandra, Nalini; Rajan, Shobini; Shukla, D K; Venkatesh, S; Nair, Saritha; Kumar, Anil; Singh, Jitenkumar; Reddy, Srikanth; Godbole, Sheela; Elangovan, A; Saha, M K; Rai, Sanjay; Lakshmi, P V M; Gambhir, T; Ammassari, Savina; Joshi, Deepika; Das, Amitabh; Bakshi, Poonam; Chakraborty, Sabyasachi; Palkar, Amol; Singh, S K; Reddy, D C S; Kant, Shashi; Pandey, Arvind; Vardhana Rao, M Vishnu",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1619_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719229/,520

150407,Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the first 100 outpatients.,2010,"Based on reports in adult lung transplant recipients, we hypothesized that community acquired respiratory viral infections (CARV) would be a risk factor for poor outcome after pediatric lung transplant. We followed 61 pediatric lung transplant recipients for 2+ years or until they met a composite primary endpoint including bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)/obliterative bronchiolitis, re-transplantation or death. Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained with standard of care visits. Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained with respiratory viral symptoms. Respiratory specimens were interrogated for respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR. Donor-specific HLA antibodies, self-antigens, and Elispot reactivity were also evaluated. Survival was 84% (1 year) and 68% (3 years). BOS incidence was 20% (1 year) and 38% (3 years). The primary endpoint was met in 46% of patients. CARV was detected in 156 patient visits (74% enterovirus/rhinovirus). We did not find a relationship between CARV recovery from respiratory specimens and the primary endpoint (HR 0.64 (0.25, 1.59), P=0.335) or between CARV and the development of allo- or autoimmune humoral or cellular responses. These findings raise the possibility that the immunologic impact of CARV following pediatric lung transplant is different than that observed in adults. This article is protected by copyright.

150758,"Deep neuromuscular blockade and surgical conditions during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: A randomised, blinded study.",2018,"BACKGROUND The lack of consensus criteria of acute on chronic kidney injury (ACKI) affects the judgment for its clinical prognosis. METHODS In this study, we analyzed the data from 711,615 hospitalized adults who had at least 2 serum creatinine (SCr) tests within 30 days. We estimated the reference change value (RCV) of SCr given initial SCr level in adults without known risks of acute kidney injury other than chronic kidney disease (CKD). We proposed a criterion for ACKI based on the RCV of SCr (cROCK), which defined ACKI as a ≥25% increase in SCr in 7 days. We validated cROCK by its association with the risks of in-hospital mortality, death after discharge, and CKD progression in a large cohort of patients with CKD stage 3. RESULTS In 21,661 patients with CKD stage 3, a total of 3,145 (14.5%), 1,512 (7.0%), and 221 (1.0%) ACKI events were detected by both cROCK and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), cROCK only, and KDIGO only, respectively. cROCK detected 40% more ACKI events than KDIGO. Compared with patients without ACKI by both definitions, those with cROCK- but not KDIGO-defined ACKI had a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 5.53; 95% CI 3.75-8.16), death after discharge (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.21-1.83), and CKD progression (OR 5.65; 95% CI 3.05-10.48). CONCLUSIONS RCV-based criterion (cROCK) for ACKI is clinically valid in that it has a substantially improved sensitivity in identifying patients with high risk of adverse outcomes.","Xu, Xin; Wang, Long; Xiong, Mengqi; Nie, Sheng; Liu, Zhangsuo; Feng, Yunlin; Chen, Chunbo; Zha, Yan; Ou, Jun; Ge, Shuwang; Chen, Jianghua; Wan, Qijun; Teng, Siyuan; Hao, Chuan-Ming; Liu, Bi-Cheng; Xu, Anping; Feng, Jian-Hua; Zhang, Aihua; Mao, Jianhua; Liu, Hai-Peng; Liang, Huiying; Shen, Qian; Feng, Shipin; Zhou, Wei; Liu, Xuemei; Yang, Yonghong; Tao, Yuhong; Wang, Mo; Wang, Li-Jun; Qi, Jin-Lei; Li, Yanqin; Su, Licong; Hou, Fan Fan",American journal of nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000506664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349004/,520

DESIGN In vitro study. SETTINGS Pneumology laboratories. INTERVENTIONS Eight high-volume low-pressure cuffs of cylindrical or tapered shape, made of polyvinylchloride or polyurethane, were studied. Cuffs were tested within a tracheal model, oriented 30° above horizontal to assess 1 hr leakage of oropharyngeal secretions simulant at cuff internal pressures of 15-30 cm H2O. The four best performing cuffs were evaluated for 24 hrs using an internal pressure of 30 cm H2O. The extent of transmitted tracheal wall pressure throughout the cuff-trachea contact area was determined using an internal pressure sensor within a tracheal model upon cuff inflation up to 30 cm H2O. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Outer diameter, length, and compliance of each cuff were assessed. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify the main determinants of simulant leakage rate. The cuff-trachea contact area and the percentage of tracheal wall pressure measurements greater than 50 cm H2O were computed. Cuff design characteristics significantly differ among tubes. The cuffs made of polyurethane showed the best short- and long-term sealing efficacy. Nevertheless, in the multivariate analysis, the cuff outer diameter (n: 288, p = 0.003) and length (n: 288, p < 0.001), along with the internal pressure (n: 288, p < 0.001), were the only predictors of simulant leakage rate. The tapered cuffs showed the lowest tracheal wall contact area (n: 96, p < 0.001). The tracheal wall pressure distribution pattern was heterogeneous, and the percentage of high tracheal wall pressure significantly differs among the cuffs (n: 96, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The high-volume low-pressure cuffs' outer diameter, length, material, and internal pressure are the main determinants of sealing efficacy. Despite internal pressure within the safe range, transmitted tracheal pressure is extremely heterogeneous and differs among cuffs, occasionally reaching localized, very high, unsafe levels.","Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Ranzani, Otavio Tavares; Marti, Joan Daniel; Giunta, Valeria; Luque, Nestor; Isetta, Valentina; Ferrer, Miquel; Farre, Ramon; Pimentel, Guilherme Leite; Torres, Antoni",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e31826a4804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23263575/,520

Organized by the respiratory representatives of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Federations (EFPIA) group of companies involved in the EU-funded project (U-BIOPRED), the aim of the symposium was to identify state-of-the-art improvements in the utility and design of models of respiratory disease, with a view to improving their translational potential and reducing wasteful animal usage. The respiratory research and development community is responding to the challenge of improving translation in several ways: greater collaboration and open sharing of data, careful selection of the species, complexity and chronicity of the models, improved practices in preclinical research, continued refinement in models of respiratory diseases and their sub-types, greater understanding of the biology underlying human respiratory diseases and their sub-types, and finally greater use of human (and especially disease-relevant) cells, tissues and explants. The present review highlights these initiatives, combining lessons from the symposium and papers published in Clinical Science arising from the symposium, with critiques of the models currently used in the settings of asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD. The ultimate hope is that this will contribute to a more rational, efficient and sustainable development of a range of new treatments for respiratory diseases that continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality across the world.","Mercer, Paul F; Abbott-Banner, Katharine; Adcock, Ian M; Knowles, Richard G",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20140373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25328010/,520

Socioeconomic status (SES) also significantly influences eating behaviors, and low SES is associated with increased risk for obesity. However, little is known regarding the relationship between snacking behavior and SES among adolescents and how this may contribute to obesity-related outcomes. The primary objective of this scoping review was to review the literature to assess and characterize the relationship between SES and snacking in adolescents. The secondary objective was to assess weight-related outcomes and their relation to snacking habits. Included articles were published between January 2000 and May 2019; written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish; and focused on adolescents (13-17 years). In total, 14 bibliographic databases were searched, and seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Preliminary evidence from the seven included studies suggests a weak but potential link between SES and snacking. Additionally, these dietary patterns seemed to differ by sex and income type of country. Finally, only three of the included studies addressed weight-related outcomes, but the overall available evidence suggests that snacking does not significantly affect weight-related outcomes. Due to the small number of included studies, results should be interpreted with caution.","Williamson, Victoria G; Dilip, Abhaya; Dillard, Jackson R; Morgan-Daniel, Jane; Lee, Alexandra M; Cardel, Michelle I",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12010167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31936076/,520
152614,"Robotic Pyeloplasty in Children: A ""Barbed"" Shortcut.",2018,"CONTEXT Satureja (Lamiaceae) species are used as flavoring compounds in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries because of its sweetness and simple cultivation characteristics. They have traditionally been used as muscle pain relievers, tonic, and carminative agents to treat stomach and intestinal disorders such as cramps, nausea, indigestion, and diarrhea, due to their considerable phytochemical characteristics. OBJECTIVE This review evaluates some information published since 1989 on Satureja genus from a systematic perspective in terms of its pharmacological and phytochemical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to March 2014. ""Satureja"" was used as a research term without narrowing or limiting research elements. After obtaining all reports from database (a total number is about 637), the papers were carefully analyzed in order to find data related to the topic of this review. RESULTS In this review, 453 reports were used which were published between 1989 and 2014. The study was compiled into two sections (Pharmacology and Phytochemistry). In the pharmacology section, more than 50 different activities were studied. In the second section, in addition to other compounds and inorganic substances, volatiles, phenolic acids, and flavonoids were discussed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION According to our contemporary information, Satureja species have been evaluated for their wide range of biological activities. However, a small part of these studies have been carried out on the active principles. Therefore, in the future, more studies should be carried out to identify responsible phytochemicals for the various activities.","Tepe, Bektas; Cilkiz, Mustafa",Pharmaceutical biology,https://doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2015.1043560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25955956/,520

152932,Ethnicity Does Not Influence Glycemic Outcomes or Diabetes Remission After Sleeve Gastrectomy or Gastric Bypass in a Multiethnic Asian Cohort.,2018,"PURPOSE The ∼15 kDa variable domains of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies (called Nanobodies®) have the flexibility to be formatted as monovalent, monospecific, multivalent or multispecific single chain proteins with either fast or slow pharmacokinetics. We report the evaluation of the fast kinetic anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Nanobody 7D12, labelled with (68)Ga via the novel bifunctional chelate (BFC) p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (Df-Bz-NCS). Df-Bz-NCS has recently been introduced as the chelate of choice for (89)Zr immuno-positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS Nanobody 7D12 was premodified with Df-Bz-NCS at pH 9. Radiolabelling with purified (68)Ga was performed at pH 5.0-6.5 for 5 min at room temperature. For in vitro stability measurements in storage buffer (0.25 M NaOAc with 5 mg ml(-1) gentisic acid, pH 5.5) at 4°C or in human serum at 37°C, a mixture of (67)Ga and (68)Ga was used. Biodistribution and immuno-PET studies of (68)Ga-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12 were performed in nude mice bearing A431 xenografts using (89)Zr-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12 as the reference conjugate. RESULTS The Df-Bz-NCS chelate was conjugated to Nanobody 7D12 with a chelate to Nanobody molar substitution ratio of 0.2:1. The overall (68)Ga radiochemical yield was 55-70% (not corrected for decay); specific activity was 100-500 MBq/mg. Radiochemical purity of the conjugate was >96%, while the integrity and immunoreactivity were preserved. (68/67)Ga-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12 was stable in storage buffer as well as in human serum during a 5-h incubation period (<2% radioactivity loss). In biodistribution studies the (68)Ga-labelled Nanobody 7D12 showed high uptake in A431 tumours (ranging from 6.1 ± 1.3 to 7.2 ± 1.5%ID/g at 1-3 h after injection) and high tumour to blood ratios, which increased from 8.2 to 14.4 and 25.7 at 1, 2 and 3 h after injection, respectively. High uptake was also observed in the kidneys. Biodistribution was similar to that of the reference conjugate (89)Zr-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12. Tumours were clearly visualized in a PET imaging study. CONCLUSION Via a rapid procedure under mild conditions a (68)Ga-Nanobody was obtained that exhibited high tumour uptake and tumour to normal tissue ratios in nude mice bearing A431 xenografts. Fast kinetic (68)Ga-Nanobody conjugates can be promising tools for tumour detection and imaging of target expression.","Vosjan, Maria J W D; Perk, Lars R; Roovers, Rob C; Visser, Gerard W M; Stigter-van Walsum, Marijke; van Bergen En Henegouwen, Paul M P; van Dongen, Guus A M S",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-010-1700-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21210114/,520

This study investigated the language of university-based communications, based on models of crisis communication and epidemic management. METHODS The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count was used to investigate the language in the most salient written messages from universities to students regarding the migration to online classes. RESULTS As predicted, certain word types were used more frequently than others. The larger the student body, the more frequently universities used positive emotion/resilience and power/organizational words. and the more likely a COVID update would be posted on the homepage within three months' time. CONCLUSION Messages should be guided by models of crisis management and carefully crafted, given the role of universities in managing large numbers of students during ongoing pandemic illness.","Mohlman, Jan; Basch, Corey",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1856116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400637/,520

METHODS literature was systematically searched in different databases. Results were limited to 2019+ and English, French and Spanish language. RESULTS Children can exhibit mild and less severe COVID-19 disease than adults and also have asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2, while severe disease is more frequently noted during infancy (<1 year). SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor; age-, racial-, and gender-specific differences in ACE-2 expression need to be elucidated in order to explain the differential clinical profiles between children and adults. Multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an important condition to recognize in children. The decision to use antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy in a child or adolescent should be individualized based on the clinical scenario. Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved therapy available for children older than 12 years old who require hospitalization for COVID-19. CONCLUSION Further studies are urgently required to address prevention and treatment in at-risk and infected children, especially with underlying comorbidities.

Increasing recognition of its cellular, molecular, and functional heterogeneity prompted us to review the latest advancements in cardiac health and disease at single-cell resolution. RECENT FINDINGS Single-cell RNA profiling of cardiac lineage commitment events uncovered immense heterogeneity amongst ostensibly homogeneous cell populations. Classic cardiac transcription factors and new regulatory genes exhibit cell subtype-specific and temporally controlled expression patterns that serve the phenotypic changes in development, disease progression, and regeneration. Dissection of dynamically changing cell-cell communications and cardiac cell plasticity offers new opportunities in disease intervention and cardiac repair. Finally, updates in research models, platforms, and pipelines are continuously increasing the efficiency and reliability in data generation and interpretation. Transcriptional profiling of cardiac lineage cells, especially cardiomyocytes, has tremendously enriched our knowledge of the cellular milieu and the transcriptional network in the heart. Implementing technical standards and interrogating underexplored research areas will further our understanding of this organ and increase the likelihood of finding tractable therapeutic targets.","Zhou, Bingying; Wang, Li",Current cardiology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01346-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647945/,520

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed 522 MESS RFAs on 516 patients from December 2006 to June 2011. A total of 956 tumours that met the Milan criteria with an average diameter of 2.64 cm (range, 0.9-4.6 cm) were treated with MESS RFA. Ultrasonic contrast and serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) were measured every 2 months during the first postoperative year and every 4 months thereafter. Enhanced computed tomography was performed every 6 months. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Follow-up was censored at 60 months. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS For the 956 HCC tumours, the complete ablation rate with MESS was 98.83% (510/516). During a median of 34 months (IQR, 23-52 months) of follow-up, 171 patients died and 4 were lost to follow-up (15, 30, 38 and 42 months). The cumulative incidence of local tumour progression at 1, 3 and 5 years was 0.39%, 4.96% and 6.66%, respectively, and the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival was 99.42%, 83.97% and 68.42%, respectively. Tumour size >30 mm was the only parameter that was predictive of local tumour progression (p < .0001). Risk factors associated with overall survival included prothrombin time >14 s, serum AFP levels >200 ng/mL and tumour abutting vessel diameter <5 mm. The complication rate was 1.74%. CONCLUSION MESS RFA is a safe and effective method for HCC treatment. This approach results in a high local progression-free survival for HCC tumours that meet the Milan criteria.","Tan, Yunhua; Jiang, Jiayun; Wang, Qiang; Guo, Shixiang; Ma, Kuansheng; Bie, Ping","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2017.1330495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554226/,520
154034,Single-Incision Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernioplasty Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernioplasty.,2017,"Respiratory viral infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, are the most importance risk factors for the onset of wheezing in infants and small children. Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing. Changes in the immune response to viral infections in genetically predisposed individuals are very likely to be the main factors involved in the association between viral infection and asthma.","Garcia-Garcia, M Luz; Calvo Rey, Cristina; Del Rosal Rabes, Teresa",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2015.11.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26766408/,520

154529,Effect of vagotomy during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on weight loss outcomes.,2015,"Fibrosis is driven by a misdirected cell response causing the overproduction of extracellular matrix and tissue dysfunction. Numerous pharmacological strategies have attempted to prevent fibrosis but have attained limited efficacy with some detrimental side effects. While stem cell treatments have provided more encouraging results, they have exhibited high variability and have not always improved tissue function. To enhance stem cell efficacy, we evaluated whether mechanical memory could direct cell response. We hypothesized that mechanically pre-conditioning on a soft matrix (soft priming) will delay adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) transition to a pro-fibrotic phenotype, expanding their regenerative potential, and improving healing in a complex tissue environment. Primary ASCs isolated from rat and human subcutaneous fat exhibited mechanical memory, demonstrated by a delayed cell response to stiffness following two weeks of soft priming including decreased cell area, actin coherency, and extracellular matrix production compared to cells on stiff substrates. Soft primed ASCs injected into our rat model of post-traumatic elbow contracture decreased histological evidence of anterior capsule fibrosis and increased elbow range-of-motion when evaluated by joint mechanics. These findings suggest that exploiting mechanical memory by strategically controlling the culture environment during cell expansion may improve the efficacy of stem cell-based therapies targeting fibrosis.","Dunham, Chelsey; Havlioglu, Necat; Chamberlain, Aaron; Lake, Spencer; Meyer, Gretchen",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202001274r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411380/,520

Using this HTS platform, we selected 35 medicinal plants out of 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and found that 7 examples had not been reported. After examining many previous reports, we found that Vaccinium angustifolium Ait., Vitis vinifera L, and Cinnamomum cassia Presl had a common active compound, procyanidin, and then determined the anti-IAV effect of procyanidin and explored its mechanism of action. With a plaque inhibition assay and a time-of-addition experiment, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the IAV replication at several stages of the life cycle. In the Western blot and EGFP-LC3 localization assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the accumulation of LC3II and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. In the RT-PCR and Western blot assays, we found procyanidin could inhibit the expression of Atg7, Atg5, and Atg12. Finally, by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation-fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer and the dissociation of the beclin1/bcl2 heterodimer. In conclusion, we have established an HTS platform and identified procyanidin as a novel and promising anti-IAV agent.","Dai, Jianping; Wang, Gefei; Li, Weizhong; Zhang, Lin; Yang, Jiacai; Zhao, Xiangfeng; Chen, Xiaoxuan; Xu, Yanxuan; Li, Kangsheng",Journal of biomolecular screening,https://doi.org/10.1177/1087057111435236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22286278/,520

Many tools include visualizations (data visualizations, visualizations of physical representations). However, the role of visualizations in supporting aging in place remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE To synthesize and identify gaps in the literature evaluating visualizations (data visualizations and visualizations of physical representations), for informatics tools to support healthy aging. METHODS We conducted a search in CINAHL, Embase, Engineering Village, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science using a priori defined terms for publications in English describing community-based studies evaluating visualizations used by adults aged ≥65 years. RESULTS Six out of the identified 251 publications were eligible. Most studies were user studies and varied methodological quality. Three visualizations of virtual representations supported performing at-home exercises. Participants found visual representations either (a) helpful, motivational, and supported their understanding of their health behaviors or (b) not an improvement over alternatives. Three data visualizations supported understanding of one's health. Participants were able to interpret data visualizations that used precise data and encodings that were more concrete better than those that did not provide precision or were abstract. Participants found data visualizations helpful in understanding their overall health and granular data. CONCLUSIONS Studies we identified used visualizations to promote engagement in exercises or understandings of one's health. Future research could overcome methodological limitations of studies we identified to develop visualizations that older adults could use with ease and accuracy to support their health behaviors and decision-making.","Backonja, Uba; Chi, Nai-Ching; Choi, Yong; Hall, Amanda K; Le, Thai; Kang, Youjeong; Demiris, George",Journal of innovation in health informatics,https://doi.org/10.14236/jhi.v23i3.860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28059694/,520
154779,Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy: the technique must suit the lesion.,2014,"The etiology of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is multifactorial. Treatment of ONFH is disease stage dependent. For early stages, femoral head preservation procedures are preferred including core decompression, muscle pedicle grafting and de-rotational osteotomy. Core decompression with bone grafting is considered the gold standard. However, the results are inconsistence and unpredictable. An effective non-invasive method of treatment is imperative. Recently, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) has shown beneficial effects in ONFH. ESWT improves pain and function of the hip and regression of the ONFH lesion. ESWT is more effective than core decompression with or without bone grafting, cocktail therapy that combined HBO, ESWT and oral alendronate is shown effective for patients with early osteonecrosis. The purpose of the article is to review, update and summarize the clinical treatment of ONFH using shockwave therapy.","Wang, Ching-Jen; Cheng, Jai-Hong; Huang, Chung-Cheng; Yip, Han-Kan; Russo, Sergio",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.06.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26188081/,520

We aim to investigate the impact of pandemic on stroke treatment in tertiary stroke centers in western China, and to quantitatively evaluate the worldwide influence with a meta-analysis. The original part was conducted in three tertiary stroke centers in Sichuan province. We compared emergency visits and efficiency of stroke treatment pre-, early, peak and late pandemic. Single-center analysis was further conducted in the largest local hospital and one hospital located close to the epicenter respectively. Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Library for English publications from December 2019 to July 2020 for systematic review. Fixed-and random-effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate the overall rates. Totally current original study showed fewer time of hospital admission and significantly higher rates of mechanical thrombectomy during the early and peak epidemic periods, compared with pre-epidemic time. The largest local hospital had significantly higher mechanical thrombectomy rates during the whole crisis and less daily admission during early and peak epidemic periods. The hospital located close to the epicenter presented higher proportions of intravenous thrombolysis since outbreak, and more favorable outcomes after reperfusion therapies than later (all P values <0.05). In meta-analysis, studies reported differences in reperfusion therapies and stroke severity but pooled results were non-significant. Overall, comprehensive measures should be implemented to keep hospital's capacity to deliver high-quality stroke emergency care during the global pandemic. Some key messages were provided for medical practice in the crisis.","Wang, Jian; Hong, Ye; Ma, Mengmeng; Zhou, Muke; Guo, Jian; Chen, Ning; Fang, Jinghuan; Liu, Wanping; Zhang, Yang; Chen, Lizhang; Hao, Nanya; Wang, Yi; Zhou, Dong; He, Li",Reviews in the neurosciences,https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2020-0097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550778/,520
155489,Novel approach to rectal foreign body extraction.,2013,"West Nile virus (WNV) has been the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the United States since 1999. The endocytic processes involved in the internalization of infectious WNV by various cell types are not well characterized, and the involvement of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts, in the life cycle of WNV has not been investigated previously. In this study, we found that the depletion of cellular cholesterol levels by brief treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin resulted in a 100-fold reduction of the titers of infectious WNV released into the culture supernatant, as well as a reduction in the number of WNV genome copies in the cholesterol-depleted cells. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to cholesterol-depleted cells reversed this effect. Cholesterol depletion postinfection did not affect WNV growth, suggesting that the effect occurs at the level of WNV entry. We also showed that while WNV entry did not require alphavbeta3 integrin and focal adhesion kinase, WNV particles failed to be internalized by cholesterol-depleted cells. Finally, we showed the colocalization of the WNV envelope protein and cholera toxin B, which is internalized in a lipid raft-dependent pathway, in microdomain clusters at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that WNV utilizes lipid rafts during initial stages of internalization and that the lipid rafts may contain a factor(s) that may enhance WNV endocytosis.","Medigeshi, Guruprasad R; Hirsch, Alec J; Streblow, Daniel N; Nikolich-Zugich, Janko; Nelson, Jay A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00008-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385233/,520

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression pattern of pSTAT3 in the mucosa of dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE) and explore correlations between its expression and clinical and histopathological severity scoring. ANIMALS Twenty-eight canine CIE patients grouped into food-responsive enteropathy (FRE; 9), steroid-responsive enteropathy (SRE; 10), and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE; 9). Ten healthy beagle dogs served as controls (CO). METHODS Retrospective case control study. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect pSTAT3 in canine duodenal mucosa samples. RESULTS Compared to CO, SRE (P < .001) and PLE (P < .001) dogs had significantly higher pSTAT3 expression in the villus epithelium. The SRE group had a significantly higher expression in the villus lamina propria (VLP) compared to controls (P = .009). In the crypt epithelium (CE), all CIE dogs had significantly higher pSTAT3 expression (FRE, P = .002; SRE, P = .003; PLE, P < .001) compared to CO. In the lamina propria crypt region (CLP), dogs with FRE (P = .04) and SRE (P = .03) had significantly upregulated pSTAT3 compared to controls. A positive correlation was found between canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) scoring and pSTAT3 expression for both epithelial (rho = .541; P < .001) and crypt regions (rho = .32; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE pSTAT3 is upregulated in CIE in dogs, correlates with clinical severity, and may be helpful as a clinical marker in dogs with CIE.","Manz, Anita; Allenspach, Karin; Kummer, Stefan; Richter, Barbara; Walter, Ingrid; Macho-Maschler, Sabine; Tichy, Alexander; Burgener, Iwan A; Luckschander-Zeller, Nicole",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.16141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955083/,520
155741,Review of 1000 fibrin glue mesh fixation during endoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair.,2016,"Plastic costume masks regularly exhibit unpleasant odors that may be associated with the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Upon inhalation, VOCs might adversely affect the wearer's health if the exposure exceeds regulatory threshold values. The VOCs emitted from a selection of costume masks (n = 12) were characterized semiquantitatively with a screening method based on GC/MS measurements in dynamic headspace sampling mode. Furthermore, odors associated with the masks were evaluated by a sensory panel. Two masks emitted particularly high concentrations of ethylbenzene, xylenes, and cyclohexanone and exhibited the most intense and unpleasant odors, which were described as rubber-like, pungent, and leather-like. To simulate and assess the inhalation exposures for wearers of these masks, an innovative experimental setup based on a doll's head was developed, with sampling of emitted volatiles on adsorption material and subsequent analysis by thermal desorption-GC/MS. The measured inhalable concentrations of cyclohexanone exceeded the derived no-effect level (DNEL) for systemic effects on the general population over several hours of wearing, and also after repeated use. Importantly, the cyclohexanone DNEL was reevaluated in relation to a recent study on inhalation toxicity in rodents and was found to be significantly lower (1.4 mg·m-3) compared to the industry-derived values (10-20 mg·m-3), thus aggravating the health risks associated with inhalation exposure from some of the costume masks tested. Finally, a comparison of the inhalable concentrations derived from the simulated exposure assessments with those derived from measurements in miniaturized emission test chambers indicate that microchambers represent a useful tool for high-throughput analysis. The influences of temperature and inhalation/exhalation flow rates on VOC exposures were also studied.","Even, Morgane; Roloff, Alexander; Lüttgert, Nils; Beauchamp, Jonathan; Stalter, Daniel; Schulte, Agnes; Hutzler, Christoph; Luch, Andreas",Chemical research in toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400513/,520
155860,Development and validation of a risk stratification score for ventral incisional hernia after abdominal surgery: hernia expectation rates in intra-abdominal surgery (the HERNIA Project).,2015,"OBJECTIVES Animal studies have demonstrated the feasibility of tracheal replacement by silicone-stented allogenic aortas (AAs), showing mature cartilage regeneration into the grafts. In clinical trials, this graft did not prove stiff enough to allow long-term stent withdrawal. This graft insufficiency could be due to ischaemic phase prior to neoangiogenesis. To solve this issue, we investigated both the efficacy of the rabbit lateral thoracic fascial flap as a vehicle for revascularization of the AA and construction of a tube-shaped graft with transferable vascular pedicle, for more efficient replacement of the trachea. METHODS Thirty-four New Zealand rabbits were used. After harvesting of donors 'thoracic aortas', the fresh aortic allografts were transplanted within 1 h, and the others were cryopreserved. Fifteen male and four female rabbits were used as recipients for fresh (n = 9) or cryopreserved (n = 10) aortic allografts that were implanted under the skin of the chest wall, after graft wrap using a pedicled lateral thoracic fascial flap. Animal sacrifice was scheduled at regular intervals up to 61 days. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to study the morphology, revascularization process and viability of the construct. RESULTS There was no operative death. Animals showed no graft rejection, despite the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. They all had a satisfactory tubular morphology of their construct. Of the 19 rabbits, 15 were found to have a generally preserved histological structure of the aorta and satisfactory neoangiogenesis. In the last four, a severe wound complication was associated with necrosis of the aortic graft. FISH on three aortic grafts with satisfactory neoangiogenesis showed migration of recipient cells into the aortic graft, decreasing from the adventitial to the luminal side, associated with the persistence of cells from the donor. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that the chimeric construct transformed into a well-vascularized tube-shaped organ with transferable pedicle and some degree of stiffness. Persistence of donor's cells of normal morphology into the aortic graft was suggestive of minimal ischaemia during the initial phase of revascularization. This construct might be investigated in the setting of tracheal replacement in the rabbit model.","Wurtz, Alain; Hysi, Ilir; Zawadzki, Christophe; Soenen, Valérie; Hubert, Thomas; Banfi, Carlo; Jashari, Ramadan; Copin, Marie-Christine",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezr012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22011778/,520

They are the most frequent causative agents of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in this age group and are associated with a broad variety of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory disease requiring hospitalisation. In addition to their impact on short-term morbidity, RVs are also debated as important pathogens in the development of recurrent wheeze and/or asthma. Several studies in infants at high-risk for atopy and asthma and in hospitalised children have demonstrated that recurrent wheezing illnesses induced by RVs early in life are a risk factor for the development of asthma later in childhood. However, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The question whether RVs are directly involved in the development of childhood wheeze and asthma, or whether symptomatic RV infections only represent a proxy for infants prone to develop obstructive lung diseases, is still open. In this review we provide an overview on the role of RVs as important disease-causing agents from infancy to early childhood and discuss their contribution to the subsequent development of childhood wheeze and/or asthma.","Kieninger, Elisabeth; Fuchs, Oliver; Latzin, Philipp; Frey, Urs; Regamey, Nicolas",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00203511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743674/,520

The observed diseases were compared among different breeds, genders and ages of the examined horses. RESULTS The factor of age among the other three factors was more important in the incidence of diseases because most of the diseases found were significantly different among age groups. Between different breeds examined, only cheek teeth cemental caries in Kurdish and Arabian horses was significantly different (p = .022). Enamel point with an occurrence of 34.4% was the most common disease. Broken cheek teeth were more prevalent in male horses in comparison with female horses (p = .035).

157619,Feasibility of single-access laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in super-super obese patients.,2010,"ABSTRACT SARS Cov 2 pandemic outbreak caused countless changes in the daily habits among people in the entire World. National Health Systems were highly stressed and at severe risk of collapse. In the first months of 2020, it was expected a worsening of the typical overcrowding working flow. Quite the opposite, we found out an unexpected decrease throughout the daily ED visits. We evaluated the ER visits of a University Metropolitan Hospital in Rome in March 2020, comparing them with the same month in 2019. We highlight the sharp decline in ED visits for deferrable urgencies, considered among the leading causes of ED overcrowding. On the contrary, the rate of visits for ""time-dependent"" pathologies is superimposable for those pathologies mainly centralized through the Out-of-Hospital Emergency System. In a historical period where significant outpatient activity restrictions took place, we expected an increase in ED visits for deferred emergencies. On the contrary, it was undergoing a considerable decrease. The critical decrease in accesses recorded in March 2020 can be considered an indicator of ED's improper use. Probably, the fear of a possible coronavirus-related infection might have to lead the population to refer to the ED just in case of real emergency condition or severe medical issues, as it should ""normally"" be. The critical decrease in accesses recorded in March 2020 can be considered an indicator of ED's improper use. We would highlight the need to sensitize people to proper use of Emergency Medical Services, avoiding overcrowding and overuse.

157676,Revisional Adjustable Gastric Band in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass-Is It Worth It?,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND Recent evidence suggests that antecedent red blood cell (RBC) transfusions increase the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the most common gastrointestinal emergency encountered by very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The underlying mechanism for this association is unknown. Altered oxygenation of the mesenteric vasculature during RBC transfusion has been hypothesized to contribute to NEC development and was investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Oxygenation patterns among four VLBW infants who developed transfusion-related NEC (TR-NEC) were compared to four VLBW infants with similar gestational age who were transfused but did not develop NEC (non-NEC). Cerebral and mesenteric patterns were recorded before, during, and 48 hours after RBC transfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology. Percentage change from mean baseline regional oxygen saturation values and cerebrosplanchnic oxygenation ratios were analyzed. RESULTS All TR-NEC infants (24-29 weeks' gestation; 705-1080 g) demonstrated greater variation in mesenteric oxygenation patterns surrounding transfusions than non-NEC infants (27.6-30 weeks' gestation; 980-1210 g). TR-NEC infants received larger mean volumes of total blood (27.75 ± 8.77 mL/kg) than non-NEC infants (15.25 ± 0.5 mL/kg). CONCLUSION Wide fluctuation and decreases in mesenteric oxygenation patterns are more pronounced in TR-NEC infants, especially before TR-NEC onset, compared to non-NEC infants. Greater total volume of infused blood was associated with TR-NEC in preterm infants. Using NIRS, larger prospective studies are needed to further evaluate potential risk factors for NEC in this high-risk population.","Marin, Terri; Moore, James; Kosmetatos, Niki; Roback, John D; Weiss, Paul; Higgins, Melinda; McCauley, Linda; Strickland, Ora L; Josephson, Cassandra D",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.12158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23480548/,520

METHODS To describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, region-wide registry study in adult patients on RRT versus the general population from March 2 to May 25, 2020. This study comprised all patients undergoing RRT in the Flanders region of Belgium, a country that has been severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS At the end of the epidemic wave, crude and age-standardized cumulative incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 5.3% versus 2.5%, respectively, among 4297 patients on hemodialysis, and 1.4% versus 1.6%, respectively, among 3293 patients with kidney transplants (compared with 0.6% in the general population). Crude and age-standardized cumulative mortality rates were 29.6% versus 19.9%, respectively, among patients on hemodialysis, and 14.0% versus 23.0%, respectively, among patients with transplants (compared with 15.3% in the general population). We found no excess mortality in the hemodialysis population when compared with mean mortality rates during the same 12-week period in 2015-2019 because COVID-19 mortality was balanced by lower than expected mortality among uninfected patients. Only 0.18% of the kidney transplant population died of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS Mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is high in patients on RRT. Nevertheless, the epidemic's overall effect on the RRT population remained remarkably limited in Flanders. Calculation of excess mortality and age standardization provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden of COVID-19 among patients on RRT.","De Meester, Johan; De Bacquer, Dirk; Naesens, Maarten; Meijers, Bjorn; Couttenye, Marie M; De Vriese, An S",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020060875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154174/,520

158521,"The safety of biologic mesh for laparoscopic repair of large, complicated hiatal hernia.",2012,"BACKGROUND Many general thoracic surgeons are learning robotic pulmonary resection. METHODS We retrospectively compared results of completely portal robot lobectomy with 4 arms (CPRL-4) against propensity-matched controls and results after technical changes to CPRL-4. RESULTS In 14 months, 168 patients underwent robotic pulmonary resection: 7 had metastatic pleural disease, 13 had conversion to open procedures, and 148 had completion robotically (106 lobectomies, 26 wedge resections, 16 segmentectomies). All patients underwent R0 resection and removal of all visible lymph nodes (median of 5 N2, 3 N1 nodal stations, 17 lymph nodes). The 106 patients who underwent CPRL-4 were compared with 318 propensity-matched patients who underwent lobectomy by rib- and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. The robotic group had reduced morbidity (27% vs 38%; P = .05), lower mortality (0% vs 3.1%; P = .11), improved mental quality of life (53 vs 40; P < .001), and shorter hospital stay (2.0 vs 4.0 days; P = .02). Results of CPRL-4 after technical modifications led to reductions in median operative time (3.7 vs 1.9 hours; P < .001) and conversion (12/62 vs 1/106; P < .001). Technical improvements were addition of fourth robotic arm for retraction, vessel loop to guide the stapler, tumor removal above the diaphragm, and carbon dioxide insufflation. CONCLUSIONS The newly refined CPRL-4 is safe and yields an R0 resection with complete lymph node removal. It has lower morbidity, mortality, shorter hospital stay, and better quality of life than rib- and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. Technical advances are possible to shorten and improve the operation.","Cerfolio, Robert J; Bryant, Ayesha S; Skylizard, Loki; Minnich, Douglas James",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.07.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21840547/,520

With most people experiencing months of lockdowns, social media may become a particularly important tool in Asian people's coping with discrimination. Grounded in the multiactivity framework of social media use, this study explored whether experience with discrimination was associated with more social media use among Asian people and how adaptive social media use was for their well-being during COVID-19. A sample of 242 Asians/Asian Americans residing in the United States (Mage = 32.88, SD = 11.13; 48 percent female) completed an online survey. Results showed that more experience of discrimination during COVID-19 was associated with more engagement in social media private messaging, posting/commenting, and browsing, but the activities yielded different implications for subjective well-being. Both social media private messaging and posting/commenting were associated with more perceived social support, which contributed to better subjective well-being. Social media posting/commenting was also related to better subjective well-being through lower worry about discrimination. In contrast, social media browsing was associated with poorer subjective well-being through more worry about discrimination.","Yang, Chia-Chen; Tsai, Jiun-Yi; Pan, Shuya","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762541/,520
159040,Long-term outcomes after prophylactic use of onlay mesh in midline laparotomy.,2018,"OBJECTIVES Hysterectomy is among the most common gynecologic procedures performed for women, second only to cesarean sections, and the proportion of it performed laparoscopically continues to increase. Addressing apical support at the time of the hysterectomy is crucial to minimizing the risk of posthysterectomy prolapse. Barriers to addressing apical support include the lack of experience in laparoscopic suturing and knot tying that require advanced skills and dexterity. The K-technique is a novel modification of the uterosacral ligament suspension procedure using the knot-less barbed suture technology, rendering suturing easier and quicker to perform. METHOD The vaginal cuff epithelium is closed with 2 unidirectional barbed sutures that are started at the lateral fornices and ran until the midsection. The same sutures will then serially purchase the anterior and posterior vaginal endopelvic fascia and the midsegment of the uterosacral ligament. Two more passes are thrown through the same structures, yet farther laterally, back and forth. A video illustration of the procedure is attached. RESULTS Eighteen patients underwent the procedure with no urinary tract injuries documented by cystoscopy and no postoperative morbidity documented during the 6-week postoperative follow-up period. Limited short- and long-term follow-up data are reassuring, but more will be needed to confirm the efficacy of barbed sutures in prolapse repair. CONCLUSIONS The K-technique combines the conventional uterosacral ligament suspension concept with the ease, effectiveness, and safety of barbed sutures. The technique might aid the surgeon to add the apical vaginal support when indicated.","Khalife, Tarek; Hanna, Rabbie K",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000000381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118169/,520
159067,Meta-analysis of bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement and risk of fistula following pancreatic resection.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Kidney involvement is frequent among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and occurrence of AKI is associated with higher mortality in this population. The objective of this study was to describe occurrence and significance of proteinuria in this setting. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS : We conducted a single-center retrospective study to describe the characteristic features of proteinuria measured within 48 hours following admission among patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary care hospital in France, and to evaluate its association with initiation of dialysis, intensive care unit admission, and death. RESULTS Among 200 patients with available data, urine protein-creatinine ratio at admission was ≥1 g/g for 84 (42%), although kidney function was normal in most patients, with a median serum creatinine of 0.94 mg/dl (interquartile range, 0.75-1.21). Median urine albumin-creatinine ratio was 110 mg/g (interquartile range, 50-410), with a urine albumin-protein ratio <50% in 92% of patients. Urine retinol binding protein concentrations, available for 85 patients, were ≥0.03 mg/mmol in 62% of patients. Urine protein-creatinine ratio ≥1 g/g was associated with initiation of dialysis (odds ratio, 4.87; 95% confidence interval, 2.03 to 13.0; P<0.001), admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.93 to 6.71; P<0.001), and death (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.90 to 6.54; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Proteinuria is very frequent among patients admitted for COVID-19 and may precede AKI. Low levels of albuminuria suggest a predominant tubular origin, confirmed by the elevated levels of urine retinol binding protein. Urine protein-creatinine ratio ≥1 g/g at admission is strongly associated with poor kidney and patient outcome.","Karras, Alexandre; Livrozet, Marine; Lazareth, Hélène; Benichou, Nicolas; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien; Fayol, Antoine; Chauvet, Sophie; Jannot, Anne-Sophie; Penet, Marie-Aude; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Godier, Anne; Sanchez, Olivier; Mirault, Tristan; Thervet, Eric; Pallet, Nicolas",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.09130620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661756/,520

The purpose of this review is to discuss indications in which eRARP would be a more favorable approach in comparison to tRARP. In addition, we will discuss the safety and technique of eRARP. RECENT FINDINGS Recently published work has highlighted the outcomes and safety of eRARP in comparison to tRARP; specifically that eRARP is not inferior to tRARP. In addition, eRARP may be preferred in certain circumstances. For example, Ludwig et al. recently discussed the concomitant repair of inguinal hernia during eRARP. Extraperitoneal RARP is a safe and effective alternative to tRARP. With previous knowledge and experience with tRARP, urologists can adapt the extraperitoneal approach without difficulty. This approach is useful for specific situations in which tRARP may be challenging.","Semerjian, Alice; Pavlovich, Christian P",Current urology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-017-0689-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28417427/,520

159152,In vivo analysis of the morphologic characteristics of synthetic mesh to resist MRSA adherence.,2012,"BACKGROUND Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective treatment for patients with COPD, but patient uptake and adherence to the current offering of center-based pulmonary rehabilitation is modest due to transportation, access, poverty, and frailty, and even more so in the context of the COVID pandemic. Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center-based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for COPD rehabilitation with health coaching. METHODS We conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6 times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the telephone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine. There (P = .062) was no significant difference in breathlessness (CRQ dyspnea). There was a significant improvement in self-management abilities (P < .001). The results of the qualitative interviews showed high levels of acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS The tested home-based rehabilitation program with health coaching was feasible, highly acceptable, showed a high degree of adherence, and improved self-management abilities. This study offers seminal information for home-based rehabilitation programs to design alternative options of rehabilitation to individuals with COPD that cannot attend to the well-established center-based pulmonary rehabilitation.

Estrogen play an important role in mediating the body, regulating physiological and pathological processes. Estrogen is activated by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) and mediates rapid signaling events by pathways that involve transmembrane ERs. Our previous study had confirmed that high estrogen levels during pregnancy are associated with high HEV titers. However, the association between HEV infection and estrogen signaling pathways remains unclear. In the present study, the regulation of estrogen signaling pathways by HEV infection was evaluated. Results demonstrated that HEV infection significantly inhibits the cAMP-PKA-CREB and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways, but is independent of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. In summary, the increasing estrogen levels and highly activated ERα during pregnancy aggravates HEV replication. The exacerbation of HEV replication, in turn, inhibits ERα expression and suppress both cAMP-PKA-CREB and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways. This article is protected by copyright.

159820,Incisional hernia repair by fascial component separation: results in 128 cases and evolution of technique.,2010,"Effective prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scars (HTSs), a dermal form of fibrosis that frequently occurs following thermal injury to deep dermis, are unsolved significant clinical problems. Previously, we have found that stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCR4 signaling is up-regulated during wound healing in burn patients and HTS tissue after thermal injury. We hypothesize that blood-borne mononuclear cells are recruited into wound sites after burn injury through the chemokine pathway of stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor CXCR4. Deep dermal injuries to the skin are often accompanied by prolonged inflammation, which leads to chemotaxis of mononuclear cells into the wounds by chemokine signaling where fibroblast activation occurs and ultimately HTS are formed. Blocking mononuclear cell recruitment and fibroblast activation, CXCR4 antagonism is expected to reduce or minimize scar formation. In this study, the inhibitory effect of CXCR4 antagonist CTCE-9908 on dermal fibrosis was determined in vivo using a human HTS-like nude mouse model, in which split-thickness human skin is transplanted into full-thickness dorsal excisional wounds in athymic mice, where these wounds subsequently develop fibrotic scars that resemble human HTS as previously described. CTCE-9908 significantly attenuated scar formation and contraction, reduced the accumulation of macrophages and myofibroblasts, enhanced the remodeling of collagen fibers, and down-regulated the gene and protein expression of fibrotic growth factors in the human skin tissues. These findings support the potential therapeutic value of CXCR4 antagonist in dermal fibrosis and possibly other fibroproliferative disorders.","Ding, Jie; Ma, Zengshuan; Liu, Hongbin; Kwan, Peter; Iwashina, Takashi; Shankowsky, Heather A; Wong, Donald; Tredget, Edward E",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/wrr.12208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139227/,520

In a previous study, we found that β3-endonexin expressed in vascular endothelial cells was involved in promoting proliferation and angiogenesis partially by facilitating VEGF expression. However, it still remains unclear if β3-endonexin in vascular endothelial cells also employs other mechanisms in regulating angiogenesis. In this study, we utilized a β3-endonexin mutant (M2) carrying a defective nuclear localization sequence to disrupt its nuclear localization and evaluated its ability to promote HUVEC proliferation and formation of tube-like vascular structures. In addition, we performed yeast 2-hybrid assay to identify potential functional effectors of β3-endonexin. We found that both wild type β3-endonexin and the M2 mutant could localize to centrosomes in HUVECs and both were able to promote HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures. However, the M2 mutant failed to promote VEGF expression in HUVECs. Further, we found that both wild type β3-endonexin and the M2 mutant were capable of binding to ninein, a centrosomal protein with a proangiogenic effect. Knockdown of ninein in HUVECs impeded centrosome localization of wild type β3-endonexin and the M2 mutant and inhibited HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures. Taken together, these findings suggest that β3-endonexin interacts with centrosome ninein and contributes to HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures.","Cao, Zhongyuan; Ge, Shushu; Xu, Zhen; Ma, Yan-Qing",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118594/,520
160325,Long-term outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a Lebanese center experience.,2016,"BACKGROUND The novel influenza A H7N9 virus emerged recently in mainland China, whereas the influenza A H5N1 virus has infected people in China since 2003. Both infections are thought to be mainly zoonotic. We aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics of the complete series of laboratory-confirmed cases of both viruses in mainland China so far. METHODS An integrated database was constructed with information about demographic, epidemiological, and clinical variables of laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 (130 patients) and H5N1 (43 patients) that were reported to the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention until May 24, 2013. We described disease occurrence by age, sex, and geography, and estimated key epidemiological variables. We used survival analysis techniques to estimate the following distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, onset to laboratory confirmation, admission to death, and admission to discharge. FINDINGS The median age of the 130 individuals with confirmed infection with H7N9 was 62 years and of the 43 with H5N1 was 26 years. In urban areas, 74% of cases of both viruses were in men, whereas in rural areas the proportions of the viruses in men were 62% for H7N9 and 33% for H5N1. 75% of patients infected with H7N9 and 71% of those with H5N1 reported recent exposure to poultry. The mean incubation period of H7N9 was 3·1 days and of H5N1 was 3·3 days. On average, 21 contacts were traced for each case of H7N9 in urban areas and 18 in rural areas, compared with 90 and 63 for H5N1. The fatality risk on admission to hospital was 36% (95% CI 26-45) for H7N9 and 70% (56-83%) for H5N1. INTERPRETATION The sex ratios in urban compared with rural cases are consistent with exposure to poultry driving the risk of infection--a higher risk in men was only recorded in urban areas but not in rural areas, and the increased risk for men was of a similar magnitude for H7N9 and H5N1. However, the difference in susceptibility to serious illness with the two different viruses remains unexplained, since most cases of H7N9 were in older adults whereas most cases of H5N1 were in younger people. A limitation of our study is that we compared laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 and H5N1 infection, and some infections might not have been ascertained.

At present, clinical cure is the ideal endpoint for hepatitis B treatment. That is to say, after the completion of treatment, the serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) is negative, with or without the presence of antibody against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs), undetectable HBV DNA, liver biochemical indicators within normal range, and improved liver tissue lesions. However, it is difficult to achieve a satisfactory clinical cure effect based on the existing therapeutic drugs. To this end, scientists have conducted many explorations, whether it is a combination of nucleos(t)ide analogues and pegylated interferon therapy strategies, or timely termination of antiviral drug treatment, or accelerate the research and development of innovative drugs. The road to clinical cure of hepatitis B is obstructive and long, with full of opportunities and controversies, but the lead is about to come.

As a high-risk department, it is necessary to take corresponding prevention and control measures in the ophthalmology department. To guide the ophthalmology department of medical institutions to recover from the post-pandemic period of COVID-19, we designed relevant prevention and control strategies formulated by the National Health Committee, combined with our practical work of hospital pandemic management. The prevention and control strategies contained ward settings, channel design, allocation of protective equipment, screening of hospitalized patients, supervision-guided improvement, ward disinfection, the management of patients and escorts. There are 64 doctors and nurses who had standardized training during the post-pandemic period in the ophthalmology department. A total of 185 patients were admitted to the ophthalmology department of our institution, and 107 operations were successfully performed during that period. We made a follow-up visit two weeks after discharge to ask whether the patients had fever and/or other symptoms and whether he had been diagnosed with a COVID-19 case. Ultimately the ophthalmic ward was free of infection with the novel coronavirus. These showed that our prevention strategies were effective for ophthalmology department to defending COVID-19 in the process of recovering medical services.","Xia, Jiao; Wang, Rongli; Tian, Min; Wu, Xunlian",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725779/,520

OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to describe the effect of listening to classical music, music of patients' own choice, or no music on patient's pain and satisfaction rates when carrying out an elective cystoscopy and the effect on the assessment capability of the performing urologist. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized trial included 127 patients undergoing elective cystoscopy at the Urological Department of the University Clinic of Munich between June 2019 and March 2020. Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis: Patients were assigned randomly to 3 groups: group I: listening to standardized classical music (n = 35), group II: listening to music according to the patients' choice (n = 34), and control group III: no music (n = 44). Prior to cystoscopy, anxiety levels were assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The Visual Analog Scale (VAS, range 1-100) was used for a self-assessment of pain, discomfort, and satisfaction. Statistical analysis was done with Spearman's rank correlation and t-tests. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The median age was 63 (range 27-91) years. The duration of cystoscopy was 5.7 (1-30) min. Patients had undergone a median of 2.3 cystoscopies in the past. Between giving informed consent and cystoscopy, patients had to wait for a median of 64 (0-260) min. The median VAS pain score was significantly lower in group I at 1.7 and group II at 2.3 versus 5.2 in the control group III (p < 0.001). The control group III had significantly worse pain and patient satisfaction rates compared with groups I and II. Group I had a significant lower VAS pain score than groups II and III (p < 0.001). Classical music also increased the assessment capability of the preforming urologist. CONCLUSIONS Listening to music during elective cystoscopy significantly reduces pain and distress and leads to higher patient and surgeon satisfaction. We recommend listening to classical music or music chosen by the patients during outpatient flexible/rigid cystoscopy in daily clinical routine. Patient Summary: In this study, we found that patients who listened to classical music or music of their own choice while undergoing a cystoscopy showed significant reduction of pain and distress.","Mumm, Jan-Niclas; Eismann, Lennert; Rodler, Severin; Vilsmaier, Theresa; Zehni, Alaleh Zati; Apfelbeck, Maria; Pfitzinger, Paulo L; Volz, Yannic; Chaloupka, Michael; Bauer, Ricarda M; Stief, Christian G; Staehler, Michael",Urologia internationalis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000517275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280934/,520

Nationally, rates of ACP completion are low, and internal medicine residency clinics face additional barriers. To address this need, we implemented an ACP clinic for internal medicine residents. METHODS An ACP clinical experience was created for PGY2 residents beginning in 2018, with 6 total sessions, consisting of consolidated didactics, protected time to identify, outreach, and schedule patients, and two half days of dedicated ACP visits. Residents were surveyed before (end of PGY1) and after (end of PGY2) the intervention. The preceding residency class, serving as a historic control, only received the curriculum and were surveyed at the end of their PGY2 year. Electronic medical record (EMR) data was accessed to track ACP documentation. RESULTS The overall survey response rate was 124/134 (93%). Comparing the intervention cohort before and after the intervention, there was a significant increase in self-assessed confidence in completing ACP (2.1/4.0 vs 3.5/4.0, p < 0.01). Comparing the intervention and historic cohorts (end of PGY2), the intervention was associated with improved confidence in ability to complete ACP for their patients (3.5/4.0 vs 2.7/4.0, p < 0.01). The historic control had no increase in ACP documentation rates over time, while the intervention cohort had a 13.9% absolute increase in ACP documentation for their patients over the course of residency (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION The creation of an ACP-specific clinical experience, in conjunction with existing curricula, resulted in significant improvements in knowledge, self-assessed skills and behavior, and EMR documentation.","Coyle, Andrew; Bhatia, Sonica; Reyes Arnaldy, Amy; Wang, Katherine; Lindenberger, Elizabeth C; Fishman, Mary",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374990/,520
161451,Laparoscopic transperitoneal heminephrectomy for duplex kidney in infants and children: a comparative study.,2013,"Background The evaluation of septic hip arthritis often incorporates the utilization of hip ultrasonography to determine the presence of a hip joint effusion, as well as to guide arthrocentesis. Point-of-care (POC) hip ultrasound has previously been demonstrated to be accurate when performed by the emergency physician. Time to diagnosis and subsequent intervention in septic arthritis (SA) is critical to favorable outcomes. Methods Retrospective single-center study of all emergency department (ED) patients who had a POC or radiology hip ultrasound or arthrocentesis as part of their ED evaluation for SA in a 3-year period. We investigated the difference in time to obtain hip ultrasonography results and the time to arthrocentesis between radiology and emergency physician-performed studies in cases of suspected septic hip arthritis. Results Seventy-four patients met inclusion criteria. The median time to hip ultrasound completion was 68 (interquartile range [IQR], 38.8-132) minutes in the emergency physician-performed ultrasound group versus 208.5 (IQR, 163.8-301.3) minutes for the radiology group (P < 0.001). A total of 17 patients had a hip arthrocentesis performed. Time to arthrocentesis was 211 (IQR 141.3-321.5) minutes in the emergency physician-performed arthrocentesis group and 602 (IQR 500-692) minutes in the radiology arthrocentesis (P < 0.001). Conclusion There was a statistically shorter time to ultrasound result and arthrocentesis when POC hip ultrasound was utilized by the emergency physician. Given that unfavorable outcomes in SA are associated with delay in treatment, further study is warranted to determine if emergency physician-performed hip ultrasound and arthrocentesis could lead to improved patient-centered clinical end points.","Thom, Christopher; Ahmed, Azhar; Kongkatong, Matthew; Moak, James",Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians open,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000078/,520

161682,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: comparison between hand-sewn and mechanical gastrojejunostomy.,2012,"UNLABELLED Influenza A virus (IAV) uses the low pH in late endocytic vacuoles as a cue for penetration by membrane fusion. Here, we analyzed the prefusion reactions that prepare the core for uncoating after it has been delivered to the cytosol. We found that this priming process occurs in two steps that are mediated by the envelope-embedded M2 ion channel. The first weakens the interactions between the matrix protein, M1, and the viral ribonucleoprotein bundle. It involves a conformational change in a linker sequence and the C-terminal domain of M1 after exposure to a pH below 6.5. The second step is triggered by a pH of <6.0 and by the influx of K(+) ions. It causes additional changes in M1 as well as a loss of stability in the viral ribonucleoprotein bundle. Our results indicate that both the switch from Na(+) to K(+) in maturing endosomes and the decreasing pH are needed to prime IAV cores for efficient uncoating and infection of the host cell. IMPORTANCE The entry of IAV involves several steps, including endocytosis and fusion at late endosomes. Entry also includes disassembly of the viral core, which is composed of the viral ribonucleoproteins and the RNA genome. We have found that the uncoating process of IAV is initiated long before the core is delivered into the cytosol. M2, an ion channel in the viral membrane, is activated when the virus passes through early endosomes. Here, we show that protons entering the virus through M2 cause a conformational change in the matrix protein, M1. This weakens interactions between M1 and the viral ribonucleoproteins. A second change was found to occur when the virus enters late endosomes. The preacidified core is then exposed to a high concentration of K(+), which affects the interactions between the ribonucleoproteins. Thus, when cores are finally delivered to the cytosol, they are already partially destabilized and, therefore, uncoating competent and infectious.","Stauffer, Sarah; Feng, Yuehan; Nebioglu, Firat; Heilig, Rosalie; Picotti, Paola; Helenius, Ari",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01430-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25165113/,520

A 36-year-old woman with a cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas, which had been discovered incidentally at a medical checkup, was referred to our department for further examination. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography and positron emission tomography demonstrated a multilocular cyst in the tail of the pancreas without any evidence of malignancy, although differential diagnosis was extremely difficult because of the neoplasm-like appearance of the lesion. Therefore, we performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy under a preoperative diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm. Postoperative pathologic examination demonstrated an epidermoid cyst arising from a heterotopic spleen within the pancreas. This is the first report of successful laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for an epidermoid cyst arising in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. One virtually has no chance to diagnose an epidermoid cyst in an accessory spleen on the basis of preoperative diagnostic workup, and consequently the type of surgical resection (open vs. laparoscopic) would be conditioned by factors other than the clinical entity suspected at the preoperative period.","Iwasaki, Yoshimi; Tagaya, Nobumi; Nakagawa, Aya; Kita, Junji; Imura, Johji; Fujimori, Takahiro; Kubota, Keiichi","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31822dd14a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002295/,520

We aimed at comparing its outcomes with those obtained in a propensity-matched group of patients undergoing sternotomy at our two high-volume centers. Methods Main clinical and operative data of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement between January 2010 and May 2016 were retrospectively collected. A total of 678 patients were treated with a standard full sternotomy approach, while MIAVR was performed in 502. Propensity score matching identified 363 patients per each group. Results In-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the propensity-matched groups (1.7% in MIAVR patients vs. 2.2% in conventional sternotomy patients; P=0.79). No significant difference in the incidence of major post-operative complications was observed. Post-operative ventilation times (median 7, range 5-12 hours in MIAVR patients vs. median 7, range 5-12 in conventional sternotomy patients; P=0.72) were not significantly different between the two groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass time (61.0±21.0 vs. 65.9±24.7 min in conventional sternotomy group; P<0.01) and aortic cross-clamping time (48.3±16.7 vs. 53.2±19.6 min in full sternotomy group; P<0.01) were shorter in MIAVR group. EuroSCORE (OR 1.52, 95% CI, 1.12-2.06; P<0.01) was found to be the only independent predictor of intra-hospital mortality in the whole propensity-matched population. Conclusions Our experience shows that mini-access isolated aortic valve surgery is a reproducible, safe and effective procedure with similar outcomes and no longer operative times compared to conventional sternotomy.","Del Giglio, Mauro; Mikus, Elisa; Nerla, Roberto; Micari, Antonio; Calvi, Simone; Tripodi, Alberto; Campo, Gianluca; Maietti, Elisa; Castriota, Fausto; Cremonesi, Alberto",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2018.03.47; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29707310/,520

To date no studies have analyzed the role played by the different dimensions of psychological distress quarantine induced in patients with epilepsy. Methods: We included a total of 40 patients, 18 suffered from generalized, and 22 from focal epilepsy. The patients previously seen in the outpatient clinic during the prelockdown period between January and February 2020 were re-evaluated after the lockdown period of March and April 2020. Psychological distress was evaluated by using the three subscales of Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) tapping intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal related to traumatic event. Results: As for the overall sample, the number of epileptic attacks was significantly higher at post-lockdown than at pre-lockdown. The same pattern of results was observed for patients with high scores on IES-R Intrusion and IES-R Avoidance subscales. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that: 1) higher scores on IES-R Intrusion subscale were associated with higher age, female sex, and higher scores on HADS-Anxiety subscale;2) higher scores on IES-R Hyperarousal subscales were related to higher scores on HADS-Anxiety subscale;3) higher scores on IES-R Avoidance scale were associated with higher age, and higher scores on HADS-Anxiety subscale. Conclusion: The frequency of epileptic seizures increased during lockdown (months March and April) when compared to pre-lockdown period (months January and February). This pattern of increased frequency is particularly notable for older female patients which experienced with higher intrusivity and avoidance and suffered from more marked anxious symptoms.","Giordano, A.; Tessitore, A.; Tedeschi, G.; Siciliano, M.; De Micco, R.; Sant039,; elia, V.; Russo, A.",European Journal of Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14968,520

The pandemic has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives, the collapse of businesses, indefinite closure of schools, and other activities resulting to the need for a ‘new normal’. Virologists, epidemiologists, and all other scientists are working round the clock to bring a stop to this ravaging disease. The virus which exhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome was first detected in Wuhan China towards the end of 2019, with a fatality rate of 2 to 3%. By the first week of May 2020, the infection rate stood at over 3.4 million confirmed cases, with more than 238,000 deaths across 215 countries. Many virologists and epidemiologists have come to trust computer-based approaches in finding solutions to diseases of this kind. This study seeks to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of relevant models e.g. SIR (Susceptible, Infective, Recovered) model in predicting the spread of nCov-19 using live time-series data while making Nigeria a case study. Results from the prediction suggest that, like many other countries, Nigeria has entered the exponential state of the pandemics.

We aimed to investigate changes in T2D initial clinical presentation and patient demographic characteristics during COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional review of youth diagnosed with T2D during the COVID-19 pandemic (3/11/2020-11/30/2020) and in the time matched period in 2019 was conducted at a pediatric tertiary care center. BMI Z-score (>1.64), age (>8) and the absence of DKA and autoantibodies at diabetes diagnosis (A1c >6.5%) were used to screen for T2D, with confirmation by chart review. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and independent samples t-tests were used for analyses. Results: During the pandemic, cases of T2D increased 233% from 2019 (n=36, Mage=14.1±2.6 years, 56% F) to 2020 (n=84, Mage=14.6±2.2 years, 42% F). Rates of new onset T2D increased as the pandemic continued, from 4-8 per month in April-June to 20 and 16 cases, respectively, in October and November. Only 3 youth were actively infected with COVID-19 at T2D diagnosis. Rates of DKA at diagnosis increased from 6% in 2019 to 21% in 2020 (p=0.03), with 6 cases of hyperosmolar DKA during the pandemic as compared to none in 2019. Before the pandemic, 53% of youth diagnosed with T2D were Black, compared to 77% during the pandemic (p=0.03). Similar increases were seen among those with public insurance, rising from 67% to 86% (p=0.02). Conclusions: Cases of T2D and severity of initial presentation increased during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among Black and publicly insured youth. These findings align with prior reports highlighting the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. As few youth were infected with COVID-19 at T2D diagnosis, pandemic-related social distancing measures may also have disproportionate impacts on these communities and serve to worsen pre-existing health disparities.","Marks, Brynn E.; Khilnani, Aneka Meyers Abby Estrada Doris E.; Boughton, Jennifer Gai Jiaxiang Streisand Randi Monaghan Maureen",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-15-or,520

Certain aspects of the microenvironment (or niche) play critical roles in determining the fate of ES cells. Here, we reported the feasibility of using the technique of microencapsulation to study the interaction between ES cells and their tissue niche. ES cells' growth, viability, and differentiation in vitro were evaluated when they were enclosed in solid or liquefied core APA microcapsules. In comparison with those microcapsules with solid cores, the liquefied capsules provided a more suitable culture environment for the growth of ES cells. In addition, behavior of encapsulated ES cells in vivo was observed after their being implanted into mouse peritoneal cavities. In contrast to the prolonged lag phase in vitro, ES cells encapsulated grew much faster in vivo. Typical markers for the undifferentiated ES cells, such as AP, SSEA-1, and Oct-4 gene, were also tracked by immunochemistry and RT-PCR. Results showed that expression of markers remained high over 2 weeks of culture in vitro. However, decreased expression of markers was found in those samples in vivo with time passage. These findings implied that it was the combination of the intrinsic characteristics of ES cells and their microenvironment that regulated their fate. The APA-ES cells system may provide an optimal model to study the interaction between stem cells and their tissue niches.","Wang, Xiuli; Wang, Wei; Ma, Juan; Guo, Xin; Yu, Xingju; Ma, Xiaojun",Biotechnology progress,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16739963/,520
187235,Six months results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in treatment of obesity and its metabolic complications.,2012,"In this study, 221 phytocompounds were evaluated for activity against anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activities using a cell-based assay measuring SARS-CoV-induced cytopathogenic effect on Vero E6 cells. Ten diterpenoids (1-10), two sesquiterpenoids (11 and 12), two triterpenoids (13 and 14), five lignoids (15-19), curcumin (20), and reference controls niclosamide (21) and valinomycin (22) were potent inhibitors at concentrations between 3.3 and 10 microM. The concentrations of the 22 compounds to inhibit 50% of Vero E6 cell proliferation (CC50) and viral replication (EC50) were measured. The selective index values (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 16 were 58, >510, 111, 193, 180, and >667, respectively. Betulinic acid (13) and savinin (16) were competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki values = 8.2 +/- 0.7 and 9.1 +/- 2.4 microM, respectively.

187384,Characterisation of viral RNA in cells infected with the murine coronavirus JHM.,1981,"An immunochromatographic strip was developed for the detection of an antibody against Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV). Colloidal gold-labeled rabbit anti-pig immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as the detection reagent, and the PHEV recombinant antigens and goat anti-rabbit IgG were coated on the prototype strip and the control lines, respectively. The immunochromatographic strip was capable of specifically detecting PHEV antibodies in serum with a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of 2 within 10 min. Storage of the strips at room temperature for 6 months or at 4°C for 12 months did not change their sensitivity and specificity. Using HI as a reference test, the relative specificity and sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip were determined to be 93.41% and 98.42%, respectively. There was a strong agreement between the results obtained by HI and the immunochromatographic strips (κ = 0.926). Additionally, there was a strong agreement between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunochromatographic strips (κ = 0.929). When the immunochromatographic strip was used for serological diagnosis of 1,117 serum samples in Jilin Province in China, the seropositivity ranged from 6.5% in the Liaoyuan District to 81.6% in the Changchun District. Furthermore, many piglets were seropositive to PHEV, indicating the possible transfer of maternal antibodies via the colostrum. Based on the high specificity, sensitivity, and stability of the immunochromatographic strip, it would be suitable for on-site detection of PHEV antibodies in order to monitor PHEV infections in an animal population.","Chen, Keyan; He, Wenqi; Lu, Huijun; Song, Deguang; Gao, Wei; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Gao, Feng","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21398449/,520

187866,The molecular biology of arteriviruses.,1998,"INTRODUCTION There have been few studies on public trust in doctors and healthcare systems and this is the first in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey was carried out in Redhill in January 2005. Citizens or Permanent Residents aged > or =18 years were randomly selected, one per household to avoid cluster bias, and 361 participated (response rate 68.7%). An interview administered questionnaire included 3 questionnaires measuring public trust: ""Interpersonal Trust in Physicians Scale"" for primary care doctors; ""Trust in Physicians Generally Scale"" for the medical profession; and ""Trust in Healthcare System Scale"" for the Healthcare System. Questions were answered on a Likert scale: 1. Strongly Disagree, 2. Disagree, 3. Neutral, 4. Agree, 5. Strongly Agree. Individual transformed scores of trust (range, 0 to 100) were equally divided into 5 categories with their average being the transformed mean. RESULTS Trust in primary care doctors (mean 59.7) had proportions (prevalence rates) of: very low 0.3%, low 2.5%, neutral 40.4%, high 54.0%, and very high 2.8%. Trust in the medical profession (mean 61.8) had proportions of: very low 1.0%, low 7.7%, neutral 33.7%, high 47.0%, and very high 10.5%. Trust in the healthcare system (mean 61.5) had proportions of: very low 0.5%, low 4.1%, neutral 40.0%, high 48.7%, and very high 6.7%. For areas of the healthcare system, proportions of high/very high trust were: ""Healthcare Providers' Expertise"" (70.8%), ""Quality of Care"" (61.5%), ""Patient Focus of Providers"" (58.7%), ""Information Supply and Communication by Care Providers"" (52.3%), ""Quality of Cooperation"" (43.3%), and Policies of the Healthcare System"" (24.6%). CONCLUSIONS While low proportions had low/very low trust, the high proportions with neutral trust and the rather low level of trust in ""Policies of the Healthcare System"" are causes for concern.","Lee, Yi Yong; Ng, Choon Ta; Siti Aishah, M Ghazalie; Ngiam, Ju Zheng; Tai, Bee Choo; Lim, Meng Kin; Hughes, Kenneth","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17767336/,520
188040,Effect of monopolar radiofrequency energy on pacemaker function.,2012,"OBJECTIVE This research (EP-Covid19-Madrid) was inspired on the lack in the middle of March 2020 of data on COVID-19 produced from representative samples. Its goal was to evaluate the potential of interviewing such type of samples in order to assess the incidence and prevalence of epidemics as COVID-19. METHODS The sample was of 211 households in the city of Madrid, with one informant for all household members (571). Households were selected through random generation of phone numbers, informants through sex and age quotes. A questionnaire was applied on April/3/20, with a list of symptoms and basic socio-demographic questions for the informant and a general question on COVID-19 for co-residents. Data was analyzed through cross-tabulations and logistic regression. RESULTS Prevalence for individuals. On April/3/20, 10,9% of people 18 years and older living in Madrid reported symptoms compatible with COVID19 (SCC19). Occurrence of SCC19 was similar for both sexes, being respectively above and below the mean for the 40-49 (18,9%) and for the >69 (4%) age groups, showing no relation with household size, but being associated with economic activity (19% among working population) and, even more strongly, with the fact of living with symptomatic co-residents (52%). As for households, there was one member with SCC19 in 17% of households. In 8% of the households two or more members presented SSC19, in fact representing 42,9% of the people in these multiply affected households. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of SSC19 was much higher than officially reported for COVID-19, although surprisingly low for people of >65. This prevalence associates with work and intra-home transmission. The inter and intra-home prevalence rates (17% and 42,9% respectively) might be useful to assess the proportion of asymptomatic carriers. These results would benefit from confirmation in larger surveys, preferably also including COVID-19 serological testing.","Carabaña Morales, Julio",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199676/,520

189051,Comparison of immediate postoperative pain after transvaginal versus traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2014,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has been a struggle for medical systems throughout the world. In austere locations in which testing, resupply, and evacuation have been limited or impossible, unique challenges exist. This case series demonstrates the importance of population isolation in preventing disease from overwhelming medical assets. METHODS This is a case series describing the outbreak of COVID-19 in an isolated population in Africa. The population consists of a main population with a Role 2 capability, with several supported satellite populations with a Role 1 capability. Outbreaks in five satellite population centers occurred over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic from its start on approximately 1 March 2020 until 28 April 2020, when a more robust medical asset became available at the central evacuation hub within the main population. RESULTS Population movement controls and the use of telehealth prevented the spread within the main population at risk and enabled the setup of medical assets to prepare for anticipated widespread disease. CONCLUSION Isolation of disease in the satellite populations and treating in place, rather than immediately moving to the larger population center's medical facilities, prevented widespread exposure. Isolation also protected critical patient transport capabilities for use for high-risk patients. In addition, this strategy provided time and resources to develop infrastructure to handle anticipated larger outbreaks.","Hall, Andrew B; Dixon, Michael; Dennis, Andrew J; Wilson, Ramey L",Journal of special operations medicine : a peer reviewed journal for SOF medical professionals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320319/,520
189246,Incidence and surgical treatment of synthetic mesh-related infectious complications after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy.,2016,"The goal of this study was to assess the role of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-induced endothelial cell (EC) pyroptosis in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) following radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatic hemangiomas. We enrolled 76 patients with hepatic hemangioma who underwent RF ablation. Serum concentrations of HMGB1, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined at different time points. Immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) was performed to evaluate the expressions of HMGB1, NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-18 and IL-1β in hepatic hemangioma and sub-ablated hemangioma tissues. In vitro experiments used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with sub-ablative hyperthermia to mimic insufficient RF ablation of hepatic hemangiomas. ELISA and western blotting were performed to quantify HMGB1, NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-18, IL-1β and LDH levels with or without the addition of ethyl pyruvate (EP), a HMGB1 inhibitor, in the medium. Flow cytometry and fluorescent staining were performed to assess pyroptosis of HUVECs. Twenty-nine patients experienced SIRS after RF ablation (29/76, 38.2%). HMGB1, IL-1β and IL-18 levels were significantly correlated with SIRS. IHC staining revealed an obvious increase in HMGB1, NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-18, and IL-1β in the ECs of sub-ablated hemangioma but not in hepatic hemangioma. In vitro experiments showed that subablative hyperthermia led to HMGB1-induced pyroptosis of HUVECs and EP attenuated the pyroptosis of HUVECs. Taken together, these data demonstrate HMGB1-induced ECs pyroptosis may occur during SIRS following RF ablation of hepatic hemangiomas.","Yang, Mengmeng; Yang, Xu; Wang, Shaohong; Xu, Li; Ke, Shan; Ding, Xuemei; Sun, Wenbing; Gao, Jun",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31934300/,520
191107,Laparoscopic repair of hiatal hernia after esophagectomy.,2013,"Lower respiratory infections are commonly due to viruses and are the third largest cause of death. Respiratory tract viruses have a tendency to target the specific regions in the lung and can harm the host via direct effect of the virus and the host's inflammatory response. In this study, relationships between morphologic changes in the lung and the viral agent type isolated in the lung by the polymerase chain reaction technique were investigated. This study was performed retrospectively at 113 autopsy cases in the Council of Forensic Medicine in Istanbul. Slides from the lung tissues diagnosed as interstitial pneumonia and detected viral agent in polymerase chain reaction were evaluated and reviewed under light microscope by 2 pathologists simultaneously according to predetermined bronchiolar, alveolar, and interstitial findings. Alveolar findings were detected in 108 cases (95.6%), whereas interstitial and bronchiolar findings were detected in 91 (80.5%) and 38 (33.6%) cases, respectively. Intra-alveolar edema was the most common alveolar finding. Some findings such as multinucleated syncytial cells and smudge cells can aid the search for etiologic agent. Interstitial inflammation was the most common histopathologic finding in the lung in viral infections and the most prominent clue to viral infections in the lung histopathologically without discrimination of viral agent type.","Daş, Taner; Sargan, Aytül; Yağmur, Gülhan; Yildirim, Muzaffer; Topal, Cumhur Selçuk; Gürler, Ahmet Selçuk; Asliyüksek, Hizir; Arslan, Murat Nihat; Özdemirel, Rifat",The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27753645/,520

The purpose of this report is to review the components of the designs and methods of these trials and to describe the influence of those components on the interpretation of trial results. METHODS A critical review of trial design and conduct of IMS III, MR RESCUE, and SYNTHESIS EXPANSION is performed with emphasis on patient selection, shortcomings in procedural aspects, and methodology of data ascertainment and analysis. The influence of each component is estimated based on published literature including multicenter clinical trials reporting on endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. RESULTS We critically examined the time interval between symptom onset and treatment and rates of angiographic recanalization to differentiate between ""endovascular treatment"" and ""parameter optimized endovascular treatment"" as it relates to the IMS III, MR RESCUE, and SYNTHESIS EXPANSION trials. All the three trials failed to effectively test ""parameter optimized endovascular treatment"" due to the delay between symptom onset and treatment and less than optimal rates of recanalization. In all the three trials, the magnitude of benefit with endovascular treatment required to reject the null hypothesis was larger than could be expected based on previous studies. The IMS III and SYNTHESIS EXPANSION trials demonstrated that rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages subsequent to treatment are similar between IV thrombolytics and endovascular treatment in matched acute ischemic stroke patients. The trials also indirectly validated the superiority/equivalence of IV thrombolytics (compared with endovascular treatment) in patients with minor neurological deficits and those without large vessel occlusion on computed tomographic/magnetic resonance angiography. CONCLUSIONS The results do not support a large magnitude benefit of endovascular treatment in subjects randomized in all the three trials. The possibility that benefits of a smaller magnitude exist in certain patient populations cannot be excluded. Large magnitude benefits can be expected with implementation of ""parameter optimized endovascular treatment"" in patients with ischemic stroke who are candidates for IV thrombolytics.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Abd-Allah, Foad; Aleu, Aitziber; Connors, John J; Hanel, Ricardo A; Hassan, Ameer E; Hussein, Haitham M; Janjua, Nazli A; Khatri, Rakesh; Kirmani, Jawad F; Mazighi, Mikael; Mattle, Heinrich P; Miley, Jefferson T; Nguyen, Thanh N; Rodriguez, Gustavo J; Shah, Qaisar A; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Suarez, Jose I; Suri, M Fareed K; Tolun, Reha",Journal of vascular and interventional neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920991/,520

METHODS The pulmonary inflammatory reaction in rat models were induced by intratracheal instillation of N-protein of SARS-CoV with a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. The rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal saline control group (Nc group), N-protein group 1 (P1 group, 6 h), N-protein group 2 (P2 group, 24 h), and N-protein + dexamethasone group (P + D group, dexamethasone 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The blood samples, bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were collected after challenge. The cytological and histopathologic changes of lung tissues were observed and the wet/dry ratios (W/D) of lung tissue were determined. The interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) of serum and BALF were measured by ELISA. RESULTS (1) Compared with the percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes in Nc group [(68.42 +/- 13.07)%], that in P2 group [(50.50 +/- 14.36)%] was significantly decreased (P < 0.05); compared with Nc group and P2 group, that in P + D group was furthermore significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Compared with the total WBC of peripheral blood in Nc group [(5.86 +/- 2.25) x 10(9)] and P2 group [(4.83 +/- 1.49) x 10(9)], that in P + D group [(1.96 +/- 1.30) x 10(9)] was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). (2) Compared with the total WBC of BALF in Nc group [(95 +/- 29) x 10(7)], that in P2 group [(160 +/- 60) x 10(7)] was significantly increased (P < 0.05); but compared with P2 group, that in P + D group [(62 +/- 23) x 10(7)] was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Analysis of BALF differential cell counts showed that the majority of cells were alveolar macrophages in all groups. (3) The W/D ratios of lung tissue in both P1 and P2 group [(5.18 +/- 0.29) and (5.19 +/- 0.34), respectively] after N-protein challenge were significantly increased than that in Nc groups [(4.77 +/- 0.27), P < 0.05]; the W/D ratio in P + D group (4.70 +/- 0.18) was significantly decreased than that in P2 group (P < 0.01). (4) Compared with Nc group, the levels of IL-6, IL-10, TGF-beta1 in both serum and BALF of P1 group were significantly increased (P < 0.01), and the levels of these cytokines in P2 group were significantly higher than those in P1 group (P < 0.01), but significantly lower in P + D group compared with P2 group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The N-protein of SARS-CoV had pathogenicity and could induce obvious pulmonary inflammatory reaction and acute lung injury, which were related to the increase and imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Glucocorticoids could effectively alleviate the pulmonary inflammatory reaction induced by N-protein of SARS-CoV.","Hao, Dong; He, Li-xian; Qu, Jie-ming; Pan, Jue; Hu, Bi-jie; Zhang, Jing; Li, Zhuo-zhe",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16409721/,520

METHODS Patient data for a three-week period was prospectively collected for ESU patients during lockdown period and compared to the ESU workload for the same time period prior to lockdown. RESULTS Surgical emergencies admissions reduced by 2.5 times during our study period (p value = 0.001). In this changed paradigm, the overall number of surgical emergencies were reduced. A high mortality (n = 4, 5.7%) was noted during lockdown period as compared to pre-lockdown period (n = 1, 0.58%, p value = 0.025). Almost half of surgical admissions were tested for COVID-19 based on their symptoms and more than third (n=14, 38.9%) of them were positive. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common in COVID-19 positive group (85.7%) and only a third (36%) of COVID-19 positive patients needed surgical attention.

Nasal swab and serum samples were collected prior to onset of the epizootics, during disease progression, and after death, when necropsies were performed and lung samples were collected. Eighteen normal control cattle also were sampled at the beginning of the epizootics as well as at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Respiratory bovine coronaviruses (RBCV) were isolated from nasal secretions of 21 and 25 cattle before and after transport. Two and 17 cattle nasally shed Pasteurella spp. before and after transport, respectively. RBCV were isolated at titers of 1 x 10(3) to 1.2 x 10(7) PFU per g of lung tissue from 18 cattle that died within 7 days of the epizootics, but not from the lungs of the remaining cattle that died on days 9 to 36. Twenty-five of the 26 lung samples were positive for Pasteurella spp., and their CFU ranged between 4.0 x 10(5) and 2.3 x 10(9) per g. Acute and subacute exudative, necrotizing lobar pneumonia characterized the lung lesions of these cattle with a majority of pneumonic lung lobes exhibiting fibronecrotic and exudative changes typical of pneumonic pasteurellosis, but other lung lobules had histological changes consisting of bronchiolitis and alveolitis typical of virus-induced changes. These cattle were immunologically naive to both infectious agents at the onset of the epizootics, but those that died after day 7 had rising antibody titers against RBCV and Pasteurella haemolytica. In contrast, the 18 clinically normal and RBCV isolation-negative cattle had high hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titers to RBCV from the beginning, while their antibody responses to P. haemolytica antigens were delayed. Evans' criteria for causation were applied to our findings because of the multifactorial nature of shipping fever pneumonia. This analysis identified RBCV as the primary inciting cause in these two epizootics. These viruses were previously not recognized as a causative agent in this complex respiratory tract disease of cattle.","Storz, J; Lin, X; Purdy, C W; Chouljenko, V N; Kousoulas, K G; Enright, F M; Gilmore, W C; Briggs, R E; Loan, R W",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10970373/,520

Viral RNA was detected in faeces by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and plasma antiviral antibodies by immunofluorescence. The cats rarely shed FCoV in their saliva. Three patterns of FCoV shedding were observed. Eighteen of the cats shed virus continuously, so were persistent, and possibly lifelong, carriers; none of them developed feline infectious peritonitis. Fifty-six cats ceased shedding virus, although they were susceptible to reinfection, and 44 shed intermittently or were being continuously reinfected. Four of the cats were resistant to infection. Seventy-three per cent of the virus shedding episodes lasted up to three months and 95 per cent up to nine months. There was a correlation between shedding and antibody titre but the cats could remain seropositive for some time after they had ceased shedding virus. One-off testing for FCoV by RT-PCR is inappropriate. Identification of longterm carriers requires that a positive result be obtained by RT-PCR on faecal samples for at least eight consecutive months. A cat should be shown to be negative over five months, or to have become seronegative, to ensure that it has ceased shedding virus.","Addie, D D; Jarrett, O",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11400984/,520

In sixteenth century China, physicians routinely prescribed pills made from the fleas collected from sick cows, which purportedly prevented smallpox. One may dismiss the wisdom of the Bedouins or Chinese but the Nobel laureate, Charles Richet, demonstrated in 1900 that feeding raw meat can cure tuberculous dogs - an approach he termed zomotherapy. Despite historical clues indicating the feasibility of oral vaccination, this particular field is notoriously infamous for the abundance of dead-end leads. Today, most commercial vaccines are delivered by injection, which has the principal limitation that recipients do not like needles. In the last few years, there has been a sharp increase in interest in needle-free vaccine delivery; new data emerges almost daily in the literature. So far, there are very few licensed oral vaccines, but many more vaccine candidates are in development. Vaccines delivered orally have the potential to take immunization to a fundamentally new level. In this review, the authors summarize the recent progress in the area of oral vaccines.","Silin, Dmytro S; Lyubomska, Oksana V; Jirathitikal, Vichai; Bourinbaiar, Aldar S",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17683247/,520
193361,Adapting your practice to COVID-19.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Previous complicated abdominal surgeries such as pancreaticoduodenectomy with large abdominal incisions may keep the surgeons away from major laparoscopic procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study that shows the feasibility of major laparoscopic surgery in a patient with previous pancreaticoduodenectomy. CASE REPORT A 68-year-old female (BMI 27 kg/m2, ASA II), was admitted for anemia. Her medical history included an open pancreaticoduodenectomy four years ago for chronic pancreatitis. She had an abdominal Mercedes incision. Computed tomography and colonoscopy showed a 5-cm cecal mass with a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. We performed a totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and intracorporeal ileotransverse anastomosis. The specimen was extracted through the vagina. The operating time was 500 minutes and the blood loss was 400 ml. The patient was uneventfully discharged on postoperative day four. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic colon surgery can be feasible and safe despite previous extensive abdominal surgeries such as pancreaticoduodenectomy. Moreover, laparoscopic surgery in these cases can also be completed with intracorporeal anastomosis and specimen extraction through a natural orifice.","Yagci, M A; Kayaalp, C; Kutluturk, K",Il Giornale di chirurgia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25419586/,520
193666,Incidental Gastric Fundus Diverticulum during Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.,2019,"Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Indonesia are still increasing and even higher in the last few weeks. Contact tracing and surveillance are important to locate cases in the community, including asymptomatic individuals. Diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on the detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or indirectly, viral antibodies. Molecular diagnosis, using real time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the common standard method; however, it is not widely available in Indonesia and requires a high standard laboratory. Rapid, point-of-care antibody testing has been widely used as an alternative; however, interpretation of the results is not simple and now it is no longer used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for people travelling between locations. Thus, the rapid antigen detection test (Ag-RDT) is used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for travellers. As a result, many people buy the kit online and perform self-Ag-RDT at home. This raises the question of how safe and accurate it is to perform self-Ag-RDT at home. Before a test is applied, it is suggested to research its sensitivity and specificity, as compared to gold standard, and its limitations. In this article, laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is discussed, with an emphasis on Ag-RDT and the recommendation to use it properly in daily practice.","Loho, Tonny; Widodo, Djoko",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818415/,520

Methods A Delphi process was initiated among a panel of 12 experts in robot assisted surgery invited through the SERGS. An online questionnaire survey was based on a literature search for standards in education in gynaecological robot assisted surgery. The survey was performed in three consecutive rounds to reach optimal consensus. The results of this survey were discussed by the panel and led to consensus recommendations on 39 issues, adhering to general principles of medical education. Results On review there appeared to be no accredited training programs in Europe, and few in the USA. Recommendations for requirements of training centres, educational tools and assessment of proficiency varied widely. Stepwise and structured training together with validated assessment based on competencies rather than on volume emerged as prerequisites for adequate and safe learning. An appropriate educational environment and tools for training were defined. Although certification should be competence based, the panel recommended additional volume based criteria for both accreditation of training centres and certification of individual surgeons. Conclusions Consensus was reached on minimum criteria for training in robot assisted gynaecological surgery. To transfer results into clinical practice, experts recommended a curriculum and guidelines that have now been endorsed by SERGS to be used to establish training programmes for robot assisted surgery.","Rusch, P; Ind, T; Kimmig, R; Maggioni, A; Ponce, J; Zanagnolo, V; Coronado, P J; Verguts, J; Lambaudie, E; Falconer, H; Collins, J W; Verheijen, Rhm","Facts, views & vision in ObGyn",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695855/,520

Mice up to 20 days of age are fully susceptible while mice older than 23 days resist the infection. Protection of suckling mice from death of infection can be provided by intraperitoneal administration of immune spleen cells but not by non-immune spleen cells from adult mice. The immune spleen cells can be generated by priming adult mice, or by priming non-immune spleen cells from adult mice in baby mice with inactivated JHM virus. Thus the immune system might well be involved in the different outcome of infection with JHM-virus in suckling and adult mice, but it does not seem to be the exclusive factor responsible for the achievement of natural resistance.","Pickel, K; Müller, M A; ter Meulen, V",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6278892/,520

194748,Self-adhesive mesh for Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair. Experience of a single center.,2014,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was recently identified as the etiology of SARS. The virus particle consists of four structural proteins: spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Recognition of a specific sequence, termed the packaging signal (PS), by a virus N protein is often the first step in the assembly of viral RNA, but the molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly of SARS-CoV RNA are not clear. In this study, Vero E6 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV. This generated virus-like particles (VLPs) of SARS-CoV that can be partially purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient from the culture medium. The VLPs bearing all four of the structural proteins have a density of about 1.132 g/cm(3). Western blot analysis of the culture medium from transfection experiments revealed that both E and M expressed alone could be released in sedimentable particles and that E and M proteins are likely to form VLPs when they are coexpressed. To examine the assembly of the viral genomic RNA, a plasmid representing the GFP-PS580 cDNA fragment encompassing the viral genomic RNA from nucleotides 19715 to 20294 inserted into the 3' noncoding region of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was constructed and applied to the cotransfection experiments with the four structural proteins. The SARS-CoV VLPs thus produced were designated VLP(GFP-PS580). Expression of GFP was detected in Vero E6 cells infected with the VLP(GFP-PS580), indicating that GFP-PS580 RNA can be assembled into the VLPs. Nevertheless, when Vero E6 cells were infected with VLPs produced in the absence of the viral N protein, no green fluorescence was visualized. These results indicate that N protein has an essential role in the packaging of SARS-CoV RNA. A filter binding assay and competition analysis further demonstrated that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the SARS-CoV N protein each contain a binding activity specific to the viral RNA. Deletions that presumably disrupt the structure of the N-terminal domain diminished its RNA-binding activity. The GFP-PS-containing SARS-CoV VLPs are powerful tools for investigating the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.","Hsieh, Ping-Kun; Chang, Shin C; Huang, Chu-Chun; Lee, Ting-Ting; Hsiao, Ching-Wen; Kou, Yi-Hen; Chen, I-Yin; Chang, Chung-Ke; Huang, Tai-Huang; Chang, Ming-Fu",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16254320/,520

HAV-containing excretions from patients were analysed ultrastructurally. The highest frequency of HAV detection was established in patients in a water-borne and food-borne outbreak of hepatitis A (HA) and was 40.9% and 36.9%, respectively. In patients with HA diagnosis in the period of a seasonal rise of HA incidence HAV particles were found in 11.8%, and in the interseasonal period in 5%. Apart from HAV particles, in a small per cent of patients with HA diagnosis adenovirus and enterovirus particles were found. In patients with the disease diagnosed as hepatitis B (HB) only adenovirus and enterovirus particles were found. In contrast to the patients with HAV and HB diagnosis, the patients who were combined into a conditional ""non-hepatitis"" group were found to have, in addition to HAV (in the period of seasonal rise of HA incidence), adenovirus and enterovirus particles, also particles of astrovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus. In fecal specimens of patients containing typical HAV particles structures were found resembling individual fragments of empty HAV particles, antibody-covered 17-22 nm and 27 nm spherical structures poorly reacting with antibody.","Andzhaparidze, A G; Balaian, M S; Savinskaia, S S; Mamedov, M K; Annenkov, A E",Voprosy virusologii,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6097043/,520

Although several techniques exist to control elephant populations, e.g., culling, relocation, and immunocontraception, the technique of laparoscopic vasectomy of free-ranging bull elephants was investigated. Bilateral vasectomies were performed in 45 elephants. Of these elephants, one died within 24 hr of recovery and two had complications during surgery but recovered uneventfully. Histologic examination confirmed the resected tissue as ductus deferens in all the bulls. Most animals recovered uneventfully and showed no abnormal behavior after surgery. Complications recorded included incisional dehiscence, 1 full-thickness and 2 partial-thickness lacerations of the large intestine, and initial sling-associated complications, for example, deep radial nerve paresis. One bull was found dead 6 weeks after surgery without showing any prior abnormal signs. Vasectomy in free-ranging African bull elephants may be effectively performed in their normal environment. The surgical procedure can be used as a realistic population management tool in free-ranging elephants without major anesthetic, surgical, or postoperative complications.","Marais, Hendrik J; Hendrickson, Dean A; Stetter, Mark; Zuba, Jeffery R; Penning, Mark; Siegal-Willott, Jess; Hardy, Christine",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437080/,520

HCQ also suppresses immunity, mainly by interference in TLR signalling, but reliable clinical data on the extent and nature of HCQ-induced immunosuppression are lacking. Here, we discuss the mechanistic basis for the use of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 in a prophylactic setting and in a therapeutic setting, at different stages of the disease. We argue that the clinical effect of prophylactic or therapeutic HCQ treatment in COVID-19 depends on the balance between inhibition of viral replication, immunosuppression, and off-target side effects, and that the outcome is probably dependent on disease stage and disease severity. This is supported by the initial outcomes of the well-designed randomized controlled trials: so far, evidence for a beneficial effect of HCQ treatment for COVID-19 is weak and conflicting.","039, In; t Veld, Aliede E; Jansen, Manon A A; Ciere, Luuk C A; Moerland, Matthijs",J Immunol Res,,520

Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as-usual.","Chung, Minwoong; Dekker, Debra; Gridley-Smith, Chelsea; Dearing, James W",Prev Chronic Dis,,520

OBJECTIVE: To compare analytical sensitivity and clinical sensitivity for the three commercially available RAD kits. STUDY DESIGN: Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined by limit of detection (LOD) using RT-PCR as a reference method. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using respiratory specimens collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The LOD results showed that the three RAD kits varied from 102-105 fold less sensitive than RT-PCR. Clinical sensitivity of RAD kits ranged from 22.9 %-71.4 % for detecting specimens from COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although RAD kits were less sensitive than RT-PCR, understanding the clinical characteristics of different RAD kits can guide us to obtain suitable specimens for testing. The likelihood of positive results for RAD kits will be higher.","Mak, Gannon Ck; Lau, Stephen Sy; Wong, Kitty Ky; Chow, Nancy Ls; Lau, C S; Lam, Edman Tk; Chan, Rickjason Cw; Tsang, Dominic Nc",J Clin Virol,,520

Objective To estimate the prevalence of and examine the factors associated with prehypertension in Dhulikhel. Method This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 752 participants of the Dhulikhel Heart Study (DHS). The data collectors interviewed the participants at their home using a tablet based structured pre-tested questionnaire and measured blood pressure using a standard digital blood pressure machine (Microlife, Switzerland). Multivariate analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations with multivariate logistic regression (with household as cluster) adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, income, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and food consumption. Result Males had a three-fold higher odds of prehypertension than females (OR:3.17, 95% CI:1.91-5.26). The odds of prehypertension increased with being overweight (OR:2.29, 95% CI:1.42-3.70) and with being obese (OR:5.00, 95% CI:1.81-13.79) compared to normal BMI. Education reduced the odds of developing prehypertension (OR:0.51, 95% CI:0.29-0.91). Those who met the recommended level of physical activity (OR:0.61, 95% CI:0.40-0.95) also were associated with lower prehypertension prevalence. Conclusion Obese/overweight and being male increased the odds of prehypertension whereas formal education and recommended level of physical activities were associated with lower prehypertension prevalence. Primordial prevention against cardiovascular risk factors at the community level, especially targeting the young adult male, is imperative.","Tamrakhar, D; Karmacharya, B M; Shrestha, R; Koju, R; Fitzpatrick, A L; Shrestha, A",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),,520

618195,The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract Statement of Solidarity Against Anti-Asian Violence,2021-04-26,"An orderly and effective vaccination campaign is essential in combating the global COVID-19 pandemic. As one of the pioneers, the U.S. Center for Disease Control proposes a phased plan to promote the vaccination process. This plan starts with vaccinating the high-priority population in Phase I, then turns to the remainder of the public in Phase II, and ends with a scale-back network in Phase III. The phased plan not only provides a sense of hope to impacted communities that this global pandemic can be defeated, but can serve as a template for other countries. To enhance this plan, this paper develops a generalizable framework for designing a hub-and-spoke vaccination dispensing network to achieve the goals in the Phase 2, which aims to expand the vaccination coverage for the general public. We introduce a new coverage index to measure the priority of different potential dispensing sites based on geo-data and develop an optimization model for network design. The hub-and-spoke network enhances the accessibility of the vaccines to various communities and helps to overcome the challenges related to ultra-cold storage facility shortage. A case study of Middlesex County in New Jersey is presented to demonstrate the application of the framework and provide insights for the Phase 2. Results from the baseline scenario show that increasing the driving time limit from 10 minutes to 25 minutes can improve the total coverage index from 40.8 to 55.9. Additionally, we explore how the changes of parameters impact the network design and discuss potential solutions for some special cases. When we allow 4 outreach nodes per hub, all potential 45 outreach points can be covered in the vaccination network within a 20-minute drive, and the total coverage index reaches its maximum value of 58.3.","Xu, Xinglu; Rodgers, Mark D.; Guo, Weihong",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21011178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34509324/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21011178?v=s5,520
