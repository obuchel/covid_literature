In the present review, the potential usefulness of monoclonal antibodies in animal production - with emphasis on reproduction - is discussed, including the inherent limitations of the current technology and the improvements that can be foreseen within the next few years. Because of their unique specificity and the fact that they can be produced in virtually unlimited quantities, monoclonal antibodies are an important tool in diagnostics. However, the use of these antibodies does not always guarantee absolute specificity, and the low affinity of many monoclonal antibodies will impose a number of limitations on their use. Monoclonal antibodies can also be used to optimize physiological processes such as growth and reproduction. For this, homologous antibodies will probably offer several advantages over their murine counterparts in terms of effectiveness for passive immunization. Some success has already been achieved in the development of monoclonal antibodies from livestock species. Finally, it is shown that monoclonal antibodies are becoming extremely powerful research tools.","Booman, P.",Livest,532,4

Contribuciones y desafíos de la microbiología,16.78092,-1.6834011,2020-04-27,"Rural amenity migration, or the relocation for quality of life purposes as opposed to monetary enhancement, has been occurring for decades and has been particularly pronounced in the American West where the phenomenon peaked in the 1990s. Researchers have illustrated that some places are more attractive for migrants than others and that certain regional amenities hold considerable influence on where migrants relocate. Increased migration levels typically result in increased economic growth indicators, making amenity migration an attractive rural development strategy. But comprehensive econometric analysis focused on amenity migration in the American West has been lacking. To address this, we conducted an econometric analysis of attributes that influenced migration to rural Western counties from 1980 to 2010. Over 20 potential amenity supply categories were collated for 356 rural counties from 11 Western states, with a focus on public lands. Descriptive statistics and OLS regressions were estimated and interpreted. Traditional amenities of climate, water area, and regional access were highly associated with migration levels, while designated natural amenities of Wilderness and National Monuments were the most influential public lands for migration to rural Western counties. Farming and oil and gas dependency were negatively associated with migration levels. Increasing the amount of protected areas, and branding campaigns based on natural amenities, can be a critical development strategy for rural communities.","Hjerpe, Evan; Hussain, Anwar; Holmes, Thomas",Environ Manage,532,4

Sialoperoxidase is present in salivary secretions and in the biofilms that line the oral surfaces, while myeloperoxidase is abundant in the dento-gingival sulcus area. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), oral peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of the pseudohalide anion thiocyanate (SCN(−)) to hypothiocyanite (OSCN(−)), a strong oxidant that serves an antimicrobial role. Furthermore, oral peroxidases consume bacteria-produced H(2)O(2) and could help inactivate toxic carcinogenic and genotoxic substances. Numerous in vitro studies have reported the antibacterial, antimycotic and antiviral role of peroxidases, suggesting possible applications in oral therapy. However, the use of oral hygiene products incorporating peroxidase systems has not yet been shown to be beneficial for the treatment or prevention of oral infections. This paradox reflects our incomplete knowledge of the physiological role of peroxidases in a complex environment, such as the oral region. While hygiene is crucial for restoring oral microbiota to a symbiotic state, there are no data to suggest that the addition of a peroxidase per se can create a dysbiotic state. Recent investigations have associated the presence of peroxidase activity with gram-positive cocci microbial flora, and its insufficiency with dysbiosis has been linked to pathologies, such as caries, periodontitis or infections of the oral mucosa. Therefore, oxidants generated by oral peroxidases appear to be an essential ecological determinant for oral health through the selection of a symbiotic microbiota capable of resisting oxidative stress. The objective of the present review was to update the current knowledge of the physiological aspects and applications of oral peroxidases in clinical practice.","Courtois, Philippe",Mol Med Rep,532,4

Therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is standard care for neonatal encephalopathy; however, its benefit in inflammation-sensitized HI (IS-HI) is unknown. METHODS: Twelve newborn piglets received a 2 µg/kg bolus and 1 µg/kg/h infusion over 52 h of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). HI was induced 4 h after LPS bolus. After HI, piglets were randomized to HT (33.5 °C 1–25 h after HI, n = 6) or normothermia (NT, n = 6). Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) was recorded and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was acquired at 24 and 48 h. At 48 h, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive brain cell death, microglial activation/proliferation, astrogliosis, and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) were quantified. Hematology and plasma cytokines were serially measured. RESULTS: Two HT piglets died. aEEG recovery, thalamic and white matter MRS lactate/N-acetylaspartate, and TUNEL-positive cell death were similar between groups. HT increased microglial activation in the caudate, but had no other effect on glial activation/proliferation. HT reduced CC3 overall. HT suppressed platelet count and attenuated leukocytosis. Cytokine profile was unchanged by HT. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe protection with HT in this piglet IS-HI model based on aEEG, MRS, and immunohistochemistry. Immunosuppressive effects of HT and countering neuroinflammation by LPS may contribute to the observed lack of HT efficacy. Other immunomodulatory strategies may be more effective in IS-HI. IMPACT: Acute infection/inflammation is known to exacerbate perinatal brain injury and can worsen the outcomes in neonatal encephalopathy. Therapeutic HT is the current standard of care for all infants with NE, but the benefit in infants with coinfection/inflammation is unknown. In a piglet model of inflammation (LPS)-sensitized HI, we observed no evidence of neuroprotection with cooling for 24 h, based on our primary outcome measures: aEEG, MRS Lac/NAA, and histological brain cell death. Additional neuroprotective agents, with beneficial immunomodulatory effects, require exploration in IS-HI models.","Martinello, Kathryn A.; Meehan, Christopher; Avdic-Belltheus, Adnan; Lingam, Ingran; Mutshiya, Tatenda; Yang, Qin; Akin, Mustafa Ali; Price, David; Sokolska, Magdalena; Bainbridge, Alan; Hristova, Mariya; Tachtsidis, Ilias; Tann, Cally J.; Peebles, Donald; Hagberg, Henrik; Wolfs, Tim G.

However, not all ARGs pose serious threats to public health, highlighting the importance of identifying those that are high-risk. Here, we developed an ‘omics-based’ framework to evaluate ARG risk considering human-associated-enrichment, gene mobility, and host pathogenicity. Our framework classifies human-associated, mobile ARGs (3.6% of all ARGs) as the highest risk, which we further differentiate as ‘current threats’ (Rank I; 3%) - already present among pathogens - and ‘future threats’ (Rank II; 0.6%) - novel resistance emerging from non-pathogens. Our framework identified 73 ‘current threat’ ARG families. Of these, 35 were among the 37 high-risk ARGs proposed by the World Health Organization and other literature; the remaining 38 were significantly enriched in hospital plasmids. By evaluating all pathogen genomes released since framework construction, we confirmed that ARGs that recently transferred into pathogens were significantly enriched in Rank II (‘future threats’). Lastly, we applied the framework to gut microbiome genomes from fecal microbiota transplantation donors. We found that although ARGs were widespread (73% of genomes), only 8.9% of genomes contained high-risk ARGs. Our framework provides an easy-to-implement approach to identify current and future antimicrobial resistance threats, with potential clinical applications including reducing risk of microbiome-based interventions.","Zhang, An-Ni; Gaston, Jeffry M.; Dai, Chengzhen L.; Zhao, Shijie; Poyet, Mathilde; Groussin, Mathieu; Yin, Xiaole; Li, Li-Guan; van Loosdrecht, Mark C.

In line with prior mouse data, here, we show in rhesus macaques that intravenous BCG enhances innate cytokine production associated with changes in H3K27 acetylation typical of trained immunity. Alternative delivery of BCG does not alter the cytokine production of unfractionated bronchial lavage cells. However, mucosal but not intradermal vaccination, either with BCG or the M. tuberculosis-derived candidate MTBVAC, enhances innate cytokine production by blood- and bone marrow-derived monocytes associated with metabolic rewiring, typical of trained immunity.

Based on interviews with parties and mediators involved in the peace processes of Syria and Yemen, we analyse the affordances of virtual and physical meetings respectively. Particularly, virtual meetings condition peace diplomacy in terms of broadening accessibility, putting confidentiality at risk, allowing for higher frequency of meetings, often disrupting interaction, but also in some instances equalizing it. Physical meetings on the other hand allow for bodily presence, for spending extended periods of time together, for reconciliatory interaction and creating informal space. Most importantly, the transition to virtual meetings demonstrated the missing sense of peace, a notion we develop to capture the visceral dimension of physical meetings, conceptualized to include understanding, togetherness and trust. We argue that neither virtual nor physical diplomacy should be discarded and discuss strategies of how to work around the missing sense of peace in virtual diplomacy and the potential of hybrid solutions exploiting the potential of both formats.","Bramsen, Isabel; Hagemann, Anine",Int Aff,532,3

In particular, it is unclear how family firms, which are the economic backbone of most of the countries affected by the pandemic, have adapted to COVID‐19. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on a rich body of evidence collected from 90 interviews and secondary data in a longitudinal case study of four German family firms. We develop a framework for understanding how family firms adapt to exogenous shocks such as the COVID‐19 pandemic and find that the exogenous shock further reinforces the family firm’s resource constraints and the family’s fear of losing their socioemotional wealth. These motivational sources, in turn, trigger behavioral changes in both the firm and the family. In addition to a temporarily induced short‐term orientation, these changes manifest in (pseudo)family cohesion, less rigid mental models, and the utilization of digital technologies. Organizational outcomes such as new alliances, digital platforms, and the adaptive capacity of family firms are the result of these behavioral changes. By providing a comprehensive understanding of how COVID‐19 affects family firms, the insights from our study contribute to innovation research, business practice, and policymaking alike. More broadly, we provide innovation scholars with a theoretical comprehension of how exogenous shocks can challenge our canonical understanding of organizations’ (innovative) behavior.","Soluk, Jonas; Kammerlander, Nadine; De Massis, Alfredo",,532,13

Results show that both personal beliefs and general beliefs significantly predict depression and poor health. There is also a contextual effect of globalization on depression. In addition, the relationship between general beliefs and depression is stronger in countries with lower rates of mobility. With respect to poor health, the effect of general beliefs similarly varies inversely with the level of globalization. Our study indicates that one's own beliefs and the perception of others' regarding social distancing, along with contextual factors (measures of mobility and globalization), critically shape mental and physical health.

The results were then compared with 50 consecutive patients who underwent RARP by the same surgeon before this new technique. We examined whether this novel technique had any effects on posterior reconstruction time, vesicourethral anastomosis time, and thus total reconstruction and operative time by inference. RESULTS The V-Loc 180 group had significantly shorter posterior reconstruction (40 seconds vs 60 seconds; P ≤ 0.001) and vesicourethral anastomotic times (7 min vs 12 min; P ≤ 0.001). By inference, this meant that total reconstruction and operative times were also significantly less (8 minutes vs 13.5 min; P ≤ 0.001 and 106 min vs 114.5 minutes; P ≤ 0.001, respectively).

It is known that the high mutation rate of RNA viruses can generate huge genetic diversity to facilitate viral adaptation. However, less attention has been paid to the underlying fitness landscape that represents the selection forces on viral genomes, especially under different selection conditions. Here, we systematically quantified the distribution of fitness effects of about 1,600 single amino acid substitutions in the drug-targeted region of NS5A protein of HCV. We found that the majority of nonsynonymous substitutions incur large fitness costs, suggesting that NS5A protein is highly optimized. The replication fitness of viruses is correlated with the pattern of sequence conservation in nature, and viral evolution is constrained by the need to maintain protein stability. We characterized the adaptive potential of HCV by subjecting the mutant viruses to selection by the antiviral drug daclatasvir at multiple concentrations. Both the relative fitness values and the number of beneficial mutations were found to increase with the increasing concentrations of daclatasvir. The changes in the spectrum of beneficial mutations in NS5A protein can be explained by a pharmacodynamics model describing viral fitness as a function of drug concentration. Overall, our results show that the distribution of fitness effects of mutations is modulated by both the constraints on the biophysical properties of proteins (i.e., selection pressure for protein stability) and the level of environmental stress (i.e., selection pressure for drug resistance).IMPORTANCE Many viruses adapt rapidly to novel selection pressures, such as antiviral drugs. Understanding how pathogens evolve under drug selection is critical for the success of antiviral therapy against human pathogens. By combining deep sequencing with selection experiments in cell culture, we have quantified the distribution of fitness effects of mutations in hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein. Our results indicate that the majority of single amino acid substitutions in NS5A protein incur large fitness costs. Simulation of protein stability suggests viral evolution is constrained by the need to maintain protein stability. By subjecting the mutant viruses to selection under an antiviral drug, we find that the adaptive potential of viral proteins in a novel environment is modulated by the level of environmental stress, which can be explained by a pharmacodynamics model. Our comprehensive characterization of the fitness landscapes of NS5A can potentially guide the design of effective strategies to limit viral evolution.","Dai, Lei; Du, Yushen; Qi, Hangfei; Huber, Christian D; Chen, Dongdong; Zhang, Tian-Hao; Wu, Nicholas C; Wang, Ergang; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Sun, Ren",mSystems,532,16

METHODS Elite kayak rowers (10 men and 7 women) were supplemented with either 80 mg·kg body mass·d of β-alanine or placebo for 8 wk. Muscular fatigue development was investigated by applying a 2-min elbow flexor maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). EMG was recorded continuously, and voluntary activation was determined 30, 60, 90, and 115 s into the 2-min MVC. In addition, performance was evaluated as 1000-m and 5 × 250-m kayak ergometer rowing. RESULTS Force reduction during the 2-min MVC was similar before and after supplementation with β-alanine (30.9% ± 10.3% vs 36.0% ± 14.1%) and placebo (35.5% ± 7.7% vs 35.1% ± 8.0%). No time effect was apparent in voluntary activation during the 2-min MVC. In addition, there was no detectable effect of β-alanine supplementation on 1000-m kayak ergometer performance (β-alanine: 0.26% ± 0.02% vs placebo: -0.18% ± 0.02%) or accumulated 5 × 250-m time (β-alanine: -1.0% ± 0.3% vs placebo: -1.0% ± 0.2%). In 5 × 250 m, mean power output was reduced to a similar extent from first to fifth interval before and after supplementation with β-alanine (23% ± 11% vs 22% ± 10%) and placebo (26% ± 13% vs 20% ± 5%). CONCLUSIONS Two-minute MVC characteristics are unaffected by β-alanine supplementation in elite kayakers, and likewise, both a 1000-m kayak ergometer time trial lasting 4-5 min and a 5 × 250-m repeated sprint ability were unaltered by supplementation.","Bech, Signe Refsgaard; Nielsen, Tobias Schmidt; Hald, Martin; Jakobsen, Jarl Pors; Nordsborg, Nikolai Baastrup",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,532,1

METHODS In this prospective, correlational study, SbpO(2), SaO(2), and SpO(2) values were recorded at normoxemia and at three hypoxemic conditions (SpO(2)=90%, 80%, and 70%) for 53 healthy, nonsmoking adults who were without cardiac or pulmonary disease, baseline hypoxemia, peripheral edema, dyshemoglobinemia, and fever. Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess agreement and precision between SbpO(2) and SaO(2) measures and between SbpO(2) and SpO(2) measures. Data were adjusted to account for a lag time between buccal and finger sites. RESULTS When comparing SbpO(2) and SaO(2) values, mean differences of -1.8%, .3%, 2.4%, and 2.6% were evident at the normoxemia, 90%, 80%, and 70% levels, respectively. When comparing SbpO(2) and SpO(2) values, the mean differences were -1.4%, .1%, 3.3%, and 4.7% at the normoxemia, 90%, 80%, and 70% levels, respectively. The SbpO(2) and SaO(2) values met a priori precision criteria (1.6%; 95% confidence limit, -4.9% to 1.3%) at normoxemia. The SbpO(2) and SpO(2) values met precision criteria at normoxemia (1.5%; 95% confidence limit, -4.4% to 1.5%) and 90% (1.9%; 95% confidence limit, -3.6% to 3.8%) conditions, but exceeded precision criteria at the other tested conditions. On average, SpO(2) lagged 21 seconds behind SbpO(2). CONCLUSION Buccal oximetry is an inaccurate and imprecise method of assessing SpO(2) when oxygen saturation is <90%. The divergence between SbpO(2) and both SaO(2) or SpO(2) values increased as hypoxemia worsened. The buccal method overestimated oxygen saturation in proportion to the degree of hypoxemia. Such overestimates may lead nurses to conclude falsely that a patient's arterial oxygen saturation is acceptable when further assessment or intervention is warranted.","De Jong, Marla J; Schmelz, Joseph; Evers, Karen; Bradshaw, Patricia; McKnight, Kathleen; Bridges, Elizabeth",Heart & lung : the journal of critical care,532,1

Therefore, it is important to understand barriers and facilitators of physical distancing to help inform future public health campaigns. Methods: The current study aimed to qualitatively explore barriers and facilitators of physical distancing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic using a qualitative interpretative design. Semi-structured one-to-one phone interviews were conducted with 25 participants aged 18+ years and living in the Republic of Ireland between September and October 2020. A purposive sampling strategy was used to maximise diversity in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Analysis resulted in the development of six main themes related to barriers and facilitators of physical distancing: (1) Maintaining and negotiating close relationships; (2) Public environments support or discourage physical distancing; (3) Habituation to threat; (4) Taking risks to maintain well-being; (5) Personal responsibility to control the ""controllables""; and (6) Confusion and uncertainty around government guidelines. Conclusions: Our study found that physical distancing measures are judged to be more or less difficult based on a number of internal and external psychosocial factors, including maintaining and negotiating close relationships, habituation to threat, risk compensation, structure of public environments, personal responsibility, and confusion or uncertainty around government guidelines. Given the diversity in our sample, it is clear that the identified barriers and facilitators vary depending on context and life stage. Messaging that targets sub-groups of the population may benefit from considering the identified themes in this analysis.","Farrell, Karen; Durand, Hannah; McSharry, Jenny; Meade, Oonagh; Kenny, Eanna; Noone, Chris; O'Connor, Laura L; Lavoie, Kim L; Byrne, Molly; Mooney, Robert; McGuire, Brian E; Molloy, Gerard J",HRB open research,532,5

METHODS Patients with aneurysmal SAH were extracted from the Nationwide Readmission Database (2013). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate predictors of a 30-day readmission, and multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the association of hospital readmission rates with hospital mortality rates. Predictors screened included patient demographics, comorbidities, severity of SAH, complications from the SAH hospitalization, and hospital characteristics. RESULTS The 30-day readmission rate was 10.2% (n=346) among the 3387 patients evaluated, and the most common reasons for readmission were neurological, hydrocephalus, infectious, and venous thromboembolic complications. Greater number of comorbidities, increased severity of SAH, and discharge disposition other than to home were independent predictors of readmission (P≤0.03). Although hydrocephalus during the SAH hospitalization was associated with readmission for the same diagnosis, other readmissions were not associated with having sustained the same complication during the SAH hospitalization. Hospital mortality rate was inversely associated with hospital SAH volume (P=0.03) but not significantly associated with hospital readmission rate; hospital SAH volume was also not associated with SAH readmissions. CONCLUSIONS In this national analysis, readmission was primarily attributable to new medical complications in patients with greater comorbidities and severity of SAH rather than exacerbation of complications from the SAH hospitalization. Additionally, hospital readmission rates did not correlate with other established quality metrics. Therefore, readmission may be a suboptimal quality indicator in the SAH population.","Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Angriman, Frederico; Smith, Timothy R; Gormley, William B; Frerichs, Kai U; Aziz-Sultan, M Ali; Du, Rose",Stroke,532,1

We investigated whether static cold storage (SCS) can be safely replaced with a novel technique of pressure-controlled normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) in heart-beating donor kidney transplantation. METHODS Right kidneys were removed from 30 kg Yorkshire pigs in a model of heart-beating donation and either preserved in cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution for 8 hours (n = 5), or subjected to 8 hours of pressure-controlled NEVKP (n = 5) followed by renal heterotopic autotransplantation. RESULTS During NEVKP, physiologic perfusion conditions were maintained with low intrarenal resistance and normal electrolyte and pH parameters. Aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase as injury markers were below the detectable analyzer range (<4 and <100 U/L, respectively). Perfusate lactate concentration decreased from baseline until the end of perfusion (10.38 ± 0.76 mmol/L vs 1.22 ± 0.26 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Posttransplantation, animals transplanted with NEVKP versus SCS grafts demonstrated similar serum creatinine peak levels (NEVKP, 2.0 ± 0.5 vs SCS 2.7 ± 0.7 mg/dL; P = 0.11) and creatinine clearance on day 10 (NEVKP, 65.9 ± 18.8 mL/min vs SCS 61.2 ± 15.6 mL/min; P = 0.74). After 10 days of follow-up, animals transplanted with NEVKP grafts had serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values comparable to their basal levels (P = 0.49 and P = 0.59), whereas animals transplanted with SCS grafts had persistently elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen when compared with basal levels (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Continuous pressure-controlled NEVKP is feasible and safe in good quality heart-beating donor kidney grafts. It maintains a physiologic environment and excellent graft function ex vivo during preservation without causing graft injury.","Kaths, J Moritz; Echeverri, Juan; Goldaracena, Nicolas; Louis, Kristine S; Chun, Yi-Min; Linares, Ivan; Wiebe, Aryn; Foltys, Daniel B; Yip, Paul M; John, Rohan; Mucsi, Istvan; Ghanekar, Anand; Bagli, Darius J; Grant, David R; Robinson, Lisa A; Selzner, Markus",Transplantation,532,31

Currently, atrial endocardial catheter ablation, mainly targeting focal discharges in the pulmonary veins, is the most widely used interventional treatment of drug-refractory AF. Despite technical improvements, results are not yet optimal. There is ongoing search for alternative and/or complementary interventional targets. Conditions associated with increased sympathetic activation such as hypertension, heart failure and sleep apnea lead to structural, neural and electrophysiological changes in the atrium thereby contributing to the progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF and increasing recurrence rate of AF after PVI. Until now, interventional modulation of autonomic nervous system was limited by highly invasive techniques. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) was introduced as a minimally invasive approach to reduce renal and whole body sympathetic activation with accompanying blood pressure control and left-ventricular morphological and functional changes in resistant hypertension. This review focuses on the potential atrial antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects of RDN in AF patients with hypertension, heart failure, and sleep apnea and discusses the possible role of RDN in the treatment of AF.","Linz, Dominik; van Hunnik, Arne; Ukena, Christian; Ewen, Sebastian; Mahfoud, Felix; Schirmer, Stephan H; Lenski, Matthias; Neuberger, Hans-Ruprecht; Schotten, Ulrich; Böhm, Michael",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,532,31

This poses the question as to whether cancer treatments can be postponed or modified without compromising their efficacy, especially for highly curable cancers such as germ cell tumors (GCTs). MATERIALS AND METHODS To depict the state of art management of GCTs during the COVID-19 pandemic a survey including 26 questions was circulated by e-mail among the physicians belonging to 3 cooperative groups: 1. Italian Germ cell cancer Group (IGG); 2. European G3 Domain (Rare male genito-urinary cancers); 3. Genitourinary Medical Oncologists of Canada (GUMOC). Percentages of agreement between I vs C, I vs E and E vs C were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and Chi square-test for trends for the questions with 3 or more options. RESULTS Fifty-three GCT experts responded to the survey: 20 Italian (I), 6 in other European (E) countries and 27 from Canada (C). Telemedicine was broadly utilized; there was high consensus to interrupt chemotherapy in COVID-positive patients (I=75%, C=55% and E=83.3%) and for G-CSF primary prophylaxis use for neutropenia (I=65%, C=62.9% and E=50%). Main differences emerged regarding the management of stage I and stage IIA disease, likely due to cultural and geographical differences. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights the common efforts of GCT experts in Europe and Canada to maintain high standards of treatment for GCT patients with few changes in their management during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Despite the chaos, disruptions and fears fomented by the Covid-19 illness, oncology care teams in Italy, other European countries and Canada are delivering the enormous promise of curative management strategies for patients with testicular cancer and other germ cell tumors. At the same time, these teams are applying safe and innovative solutions to minimize frequency and intensity on patient contacts with thinly stretched health care capacity and sharing best practices.","Nappi, Lucia; Ottaviano, Margaret; Rescigno, Pasquale; Tortora, Marianna; Banna, Giuseppe L; Baciarello, Giulia; Basso, Umberto; Canil, Christina; Cavo, Alessia; Rocca, Maria Cossu; Czaykowski, Piotr; De Giorgi, Ugo; Del Muro, Xavier Garcia; Di Napoli, Marilena; Fornarini, Giuseppe; Gietema, Jourik A; Heng, Daniel Y C; Hotte, Sebastien J; Kollmannsberger, Christian; Maruzzo, Marco; Messina, Carlo; Morelli, Franco; Mulder, Sasja; Nichols, Craig; Nolè, Franco; Oing, Christoph; Sava, Teodoro; Secondino, Simona; Simone, Giuseppe; Soulieres, Denis; Vincenzi, Bruno; Zucali, Paolo A; De Placido, Sabino; Palmieri, Giovannella",The oncologist,532,28

It has been shown that the BIS is sensitive to changes in electromyogram (EMG) activity in anaesthetized patients. A single study using an earlier version of the BIS showed that decreased EMG activity caused the BIS to decrease even in awake subjects, to levels that suggested deep sedation and anaesthesia. METHODS We administered suxamethonium and rocuronium to 10 volunteers who were fully awake, to determine whether the BIS decreased in response to neuromuscular block alone. An isolated forearm technique was used for communication during the experiment. Two versions of the BIS monitor were used, both of which are in current use. Sugammadex was used to antagonise the neuromuscular block attributable to rocuronium. RESULTS The BIS decreased after the onset of neuromuscular block in both monitors, to values as low as 44 and 47, and did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. The BIS showed a two-stage decrease, with an immediate reduction to values around 80, and then several minutes later, a sharp decrease to lower values. In some subjects, there were periods where the BIS was <60 for several minutes. The response was similar for both suxamethonium and rocuronium. Neither monitor was consistently superior in reporting the true state of awareness. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the BIS monitor requires muscle activity, in addition to an awake EEG, in order to generate values indicating that the subject is awake. Consequently, BIS may be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs.

AlloDerm is the most familiar type of ADM to most surgeons in breast reconstruction. It is prepared by freeze-drying. CG CryoDerm is the first form of ADM that requires no drying process. Therefore, theoretically, it has a higher degree of preservation of the dermal structures than AlloDerm. We conducted this study to compare the clinical course and postoperative outcomes of patients who underwent direct-to-implant breast reconstructions using AlloDerm and those who did using CG CryoDerm. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records in a consecutive series of 50 patients who underwent direct-to-implant breast reconstruction using AlloDerm (n=31) or CryoDerm (n=19). We then compared the clinical course and postoperative outcomes of the two groups based on the overall incidence of complications and the duration of drainage. RESULTS The mean follow-up period was 16 months. There were no significant differences in the overall incidence of complications (seroma, infection, skin flap necrosis, capsular contracture, and implant loss) between the two groups. Nor was there any significant difference in the duration of drainage. CONCLUSIONS CG CryoDerm has the merits of short preparation time and easy handling during surgery. Our results indicate that CG CryoDerm might be an alternative allograft material to AlloDerm in direct-to-implant breast reconstruction.","Lee, Jun Ho; Park, Ki Rin; Kim, Tae Gon; Ha, Ju-Ho; Chung, Kyu-Jin; Kim, Yong-Ha; Lee, Soo Jung; Kang, Soo Hwan",Archives of plastic surgery,532,31

Facing this unknown, unexpected and devastating disease, Chinese corporations demonstrated their CSR in different approaches. The purpose of this paper is to explore how CSR influences the decisions of the corporations that respond to a severe incident and how corporations can achieve their mission or strategic objectives by responding to a serious incident. Design/methodology/approach: Based on secondary data and thematic analysis, this paper examines six Chinese corporations which are the leading firms in their respective industries. Findings: This paper finds that firms adopted a mixed approach to conducting their CSR initiatives, including altruistic, strategic and citizenship CSR initiatives. This paper also confirms that strategic CSR initiatives were in line with the five dimensions of strategic CSR including centrality, specificity, proactivity, visibility and voluntarism. In addition, this paper also shows that a company could create its competitive advantage by carrying out CSR initiatives that are able to strengthen its value chain activities or the competitive context. This is based on the partnership built by the firms with their stakeholders to recognize the shared value. Practical implications: This paper shows the implication that business leaders should understood the role of a business in society and the importance of stakeholders’ expectations. The underlying philosophy is that CSR could strengthen the resilience of society;business organizations need to operate in a healthy society.

With the rapid adoption of online learning systems (including learning management systems) due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a need to ensure that the systems’ design can encourage and sustain students to actively use them to achieve the required learning objectives. We argue that it is possible to incorporate socially-oriented persuasive strategies in the design of online learning systems to support students’ engagement and improve learning outcomes. We integrated three socially-oriented persuasive strategies (upward social comparison, social learning and competition) with a learning management system used in a university course. The strategies were implemented as social visualizations, and we explored their influence on 628 students’ access to learning materials. We found that the three persuasive strategies implemented as social visualizations encouraged students to access more frequently the learning materials, and this increase in frequency correlated positively with their academic performance (final grade in a course).

Design/methodology/approach An in-depth, multiple-firm (five SMEs), cross-country (2 countries - Brazil and Tunisia), cross-region (Latin America and the MENA region) case study based on a mixed embeddedness perspective. Findings The study highlights how challenges and uncertainties are managed, what inspires female entrepreneurs and what frightens them. We capture these entrepreneurs' insecurities, self-doubts and creative survival strategies. Our findings reinforce the need for self-efficacy and resilience, as well as the importance of a support network and the ability to ""reboot"" whenever needed. Despite persistent patriarchal norms and cultures, the women surveyed did not see themselves as female entrepreneurs but as successful entrepreneurs, akin to their male counterparts. Research limitations/implications Academically, the study contributes to the fields of entrepreneurship, female entrepreneurship and crisis management with empirical evidence in new contexts (LATAM and MENA regions) and times (collected during a crisis). The results also contribute in a practical way to female entrepreneurs, policy makers and global agencies. Originality/value The study's originality arises from a qualitative cross-country comparison of findings from internationally minded companies from under-researched developing countries and regions at an especially interesting and turbulent time: the pandemic of 2020.","Kogut, C.

We aim to find a practical tool for dental practitioners to conveniently and accurately monitor CO2 levels and assess the ventilation rates in their office in order to devise a pragmatic and effective strategy for ventilation improvement in their work environment. Methods: Mechanical ventilation rate in air change per hour (ACHVENT) of 10 dental operatories was first measured with an air velocity sensor and air flow balancing hood. CO2 levels were measured in these rooms to analyze the effects of ventilation rate and number of persons in the room on CO2 accumulation. Ventilation rates were estimated using natural steady state CO2 levels during dental treatments and experimental CO2 concentration decays by dry ice or mixing baking soda and vinegar. We compared the differences and assessed the correlations between ACHVENT and ventilation rates estimated by steady states CO2 model with low (0.3 L/min, ACHSS30) or high (0.46 L/min, ACHSS46) CO2 generation rates, by CO2 decay constants using dry ice (ACHDI) or baking soda (ACHBV), and by time needed to remove 63% of excess CO2 generated by dry ice (ACHDI63%) or baking soda (ACHBV63%). Results: ACHVENT varied from 3.9 to 35.0 with a mean of 13.2 ({+/-}10.6) in the 10 dental operatories. CO2 accumulation occurred in rooms with low ventilation (ACHVENT [≤]6) and more persons (n>3) but not in those with higher ventilation and less persons. ACHSS30 and ACHSS46 correlated well with ACHVENT (r=0.83, p=0.003), but ACHSS30 was more accurate for rooms with low ACHVENT. Ventilation rates could be reliably estimated using CO2 released from dry ice or baking soda. ACHVENT was highly correlated with ACHDI (r=0.99), ACHBV(r=0.98), ACHDI63%(r=0.98), and ACHBV63% (r=0.98). There were no statistically significant differences between ACHVENT and ACHDI63% or ACHBV63%. Conclusions: Dental operatories with low ventilation rates and overcrowding facilitate CO2 accumulations. Ventilation rates could be reliably calculated by observing the changes in CO2 levels after a simple mixing of household baking soda and vinegar in dental settings. Time needed to remove 63% of excess CO2 generated by baking soda could be used to accurately assess the ventilation rates using a consumer-grade CO2 sensor and a basic calculator.","Huang, Q.; Marzouk, T.; Cirligeanu, R.; Malmstrom, H.; Eliav, E.; Ren, Y.",,532,24

To explore the impact of COVID-19 on the circulation of manufacturing industry products at different geographical scales, we drew upon a case study of development zones in the city of Weifang in China to analyze the characteristics of firms’ logistics networks in these development zones, and how these characteristics have changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data used in this study were collected from fieldwork conducted between 26 August 2020 and 15 October 2020, and included the supply originations of firms’ manufacturing sources and the sales destinations of their goods. We chose the two-mode network analysis method as our study methodology, which separates the logistics networks into supply networks and sales networks. The results show the following: First, the overall structure of firms’ logistics networks in Weifang’s development zones is characterized by localization. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the local network links have further strengthened, whereas the global links have seriously declined. Moreover, the average path length of both the supply and sales logistics networks has slightly decreased, indicating the increased connectivity of the logistics networks. Second, in terms of the network node centrality, the core nodes of the supply logistics networks are the development zones and the city in which the firms are located, whereas the core nodes of the sales logistics networks are the core companies in the development zones. However, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the centrality of supply originations and sales destinations at the local scale has increased, whereas the centrality of supply originations and sales destinations at the global scale has decreased significantly. Third, the influencing factors of such changes include controlling personnel and goods circulation based on national boundaries and administrative boundaries, forcing the logistics networks in the development zones to shrink to the local scale. Moreover, there are differences in the scope of spatial contraction between supply logistics networks and the sales logistics networks.","Yan, Yiran Wang Xingping",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,532,17

The causative agent of SARS is a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This report summarizes the hematological findings in SARS patients and proposes the possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV related abnormal hematopoiesis. Hematological changes in patients with SARS are common and include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and occasionally leukopenia. A significant decrease was also observed in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets and it was related to onset of SARS. A number of potential mechanisms may be involved. The development of auto-immune antibodies or immune complexes triggered by viral infection may play a major role in inducing lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Moreover, SARS-CoV may also directly infect hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells via CD13 or CD66a inducing their growth inhibition and apoptosis. The receptor for group I and III CoV is aminopeptidase N (CD13). CD13 has been identified in human bone marrow CD34+ cells, platelets, megakaryocytes, myeloid cells, and erythroid cells, but not in lymphocytes. The common receptor for group II CoV is CEACAM1a (CD66a). CD66a is an adhesion molecule expressed on bone marrow CD34+ cells, platelets, granulocytes and activated lymphocytes. In addition, glucocorticoids could induce lymphopenia and the use of steroids may account for the decrease of lymphocytes in some SARS patients. The increased consumption of platelets and/or the decreased production of platelets in the damaged lungs are a potential alternative but often overlooked mechanism that can contribute to thrombocytopenia in severe critical pulmonary conditions.","Yang, Mo; Li, Chi Kong; Li, Karen; Hon, K L E; Ng, M H L; Chan, Paul K S; Fok, Tai Fai",International journal of molecular medicine,532,28

Also, increasing demands of the European Union (EU) and other international partners had to be met. The IPHRS monitors the health of the Slovenian population and its determinants and contributes to planning and implementation of population-based interventions for the better health of the whole nation. The diversity of the IPHRS activities is mirrored by the organization's internal complexity, multi-disciplinary approach, and links to various sectors. Currently, activities are organized within five centers: Center for Population Health Research; Center for Health Care Organization, Economics and Informatics; Center for Environmental Health; Center for Communicable Diseases; and Center for Health Promotion. The IPHRS is the key national institution in public health research, which is an integral part of all the areas covered by the Institute. The IPHRS also provides education programs in the field of public health. In the near future, it will be important to sustain current activities while integrating into the new program of Community action in the field of public health as well as contributing to the response to challenging public health issues in the wider context of the whole European region. Our aim is to integrate the Institute's activities in the programs relevant to public health issues of outstanding importance in this European sub-region.

As a result, they may not be completely aware of the danger/risk involved, which could impact their ability to control the spread of the virus. This systematic review aims to enhance HWs' knowledge and their perception of the spread risk of COVID-19 during the pandemic. A search was conducted in four databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and ScienceDirect) to locate peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2020 and April 2020. Eventually, nine articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were, therefore, included in the present study. Six of the aforementioned studies specifically investigated HWs' perception of risk. Apart from a study that indicated medium perception (min = 56.5%), all other studies found high levels of risk perception (n = 5, max 92.1%). As for HWs' knowledge, apart from two studies that indicated medium percentage levels (min = 56.5%), the rest of the studies report high percentages (n = 7, max = 93.2%). Two of the studies, which assessed the sources of information that HWs use, agree that social media is the most widely used source of information. The findings of this study suggest that HWs had a satisfactory perception of risk during the spread of COVID-19. Although fields with medium knowledge levels were identified, HWs' overall knowledge may also be described as satisfactory. It is also noted that certain demographic characteristics (occupation, age, and years of experience) appear to affect HWs' knowledge and perceptions. The application of educational strategies aiming to provide continuous support to HWs is unanimously recommended by all studies.","Polychronis, Giannis; Roupa, Zoe",J Public Aff,532,16

However, naming these products has been the subject of considerable debate. This study used a 3 × 10 between-subjects online experiment involving a quota sample of 3,186 U.S. adult panel participants to test common or usual names using images of realistic packages of three types of seafood that a consumer might encounter in a supermarket. The terms tested were, ""cell-based seafood,"" ""cell-cultured seafood,"" ""cultivated seafood,"" and ""cultured seafood"" and the phrases, ""produced using cellular aquaculture,"" ""cultivated from the cells of ____,"" and ""grown directly from the cells of ____,"" where the blanks are filled by the name of the seafood product. Five criteria were used for evaluation, including each term's ability to: enable consumers to distinguish cell-based seafood from wild and farmed fish, to signal potential allergenicity, be seen by consumers as an appropriate term to identify the product, not disparage either cell-based or conventional products, and not evoke thoughts, images, or emotions that are inconsistent with the idea that the products are safe, healthy, and nutritious. The results showed that ""cell-based seafood"" outperforms the other names tested. It enables consumers to recognize that the products are neither wild caught nor farm raised, signals potential allergenicity, is seen as an appropriate name for describing the technology/process, and it performs well with respect to measures of consumer acceptance, particularly in comparison to conventional products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Creating consensus around a single common or usual name for cell-based meat, poultry, and seafood products is clearly important both for regulatory reasons and for shaping public perceptions and understanding of the products that are labeled with it. Our findings suggest that ""cell-based"" is the best common or usual name for seafood products that both meets FDA regulatory requirements and performs well with respect to potential consumer acceptance. Consistent use of this term by industry, advocates, and regulators would help orient consumers to what is likely to be a transformational food technology.","Hallman, William K",J. food sci,532,20

Kids Helpline, Australia's national youth helpline, provides children and young people with free 24/7 information and counseling through telephone, WebChat, and e-mail. We aimed to examine the use of Kids Helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed monthly and weekly time trends of demand for and response by the Kids Helpline. The frequency of counseling contacts by common concern types, age, and gender were also examined. We used Joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Analyses of weekly demand for Kids Helpline showed an increase when the pandemic was declared, followed by a gradual decline. A second rise from 12 July 2020 when parts of Australia experienced a second wave of infections, followed by another decline, occurred more recently. Increased demand was almost entirely in the WebChat modality. Most answered counseling contacts were from girls and those aged 13-18 years. The number of contacts about mental health, suicide/self-harm, and family relationships increased, with mental health contacts also increasing as a proportion of total contacts. COVID-19-related concerns were the most common reason for contact in April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic saw a rapid increase in demand for Kids Helpline, mainly by WebChat, with the virus itself, mental health, suicide/self-harm, and relationships common reasons for contact. Responding to rapid changes in demand for particular modalities is challenging and understanding of the use and effectiveness of different modalities is needed.","Batchelor, Samantha; Stoyanov, Stoyan; Pirkis, Jane; Kõlves, Kairi",J Adolesc Health,532,24

We also review the recommended management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the various pharmacological agents that are being investigated and may have a role in the treatment of this disease. At present, it does not appear that pregnant women are at increased risk of severe infection than the general population, although there are vulnerable groups within both the pregnant and nonpregnant populations, and clinicians should be cognizant of these high-risk groups and manage them accordingly. Approximately 85% of women will experience mild disease, 10% more severe disease and 5% critical disease. The most common reported symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea.

Complementary to immunotherapies, drug repurposing is possibly the best option to arrive at COVID-19 treatments in the short term. Areas covered: Repurposing prospects undergoing clinical trials or with some level of evidence emerging from clinical studies are overviewed. The authors discuss some possible intellectual property and commercial barriers to drug repurposing, and strategies to facilitate equitable access to incoming therapeutic solutions, highlighting the importance of collaborative drug discovery models. Based on a critical analysis of the available literature about in silico screens against SARS-CoV-2 main protease, the authors illustrate how frequently overconfident conclusions are being drawn in COVID-19-related literature. Expert opinion: Most of the current clinical trials on potential COVID-19 treatments are, in fact, drug repurposing examples. In October 2020, the FDA approved a repurposed antiviral, remdesivir, as the first treatment for COVID-19. Considering the high expectations invested in approaching therapeutic solutions, the scientific community must be careful not to raise unrealistic expectations. Today more than ever, the conclusions drawn in scientific reports have to be fully supported by the level of evidence, avoiding any sort of unfounded speculation.","Bellera, Carolina L; Llanos, Manuel; Gantner, Melisa E; Rodriguez, Santiago; Gavernet, Luciana; Comini, Marcelo; Talevi, Alan",Expert Opin Drug Discov,532,24

It is unclear whether pregnant women manifest enhanced disease similar to influenza viral infection or whether specific risk factors might predispose to severe disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe maternal disease and obstetrical outcomes associated with coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy to rapidly inform clinical care. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from 6 hospital systems in Washington State between Jan. 21, 2020, and April 17, 2020. Demographics, medical and obstetrical history, and coronavirus disease 2019 encounter data were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: A total of 46 pregnant patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were identified from hospital systems capturing 40% of births in Washington State. Nearly all pregnant individuals with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were symptomatic (93.5%, n=43) and the majority were in their second or third trimester (43.5% [n=20] and 50.0% [n=23], respectively). Symptoms resolved in a median of 24 days (interquartile range, 13-37). Notably, 7 women were hospitalized (16%) including 1 admitted to the intensive care unit. A total of 6 cases (15%) were categorized as severe coronavirus disease 2019 with nearly all patients being either overweight or obese before pregnancy or with asthma or other comorbidities. Of the 8 deliveries that occurred during the study period, there was 1 preterm birth at 33 weeks' gestation to improve pulmonary status in a woman with class III obesity, and 1 stillbirth of unknown etiology. CONCLUSION: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 developed in approximately 15% of pregnant patients and occurred primarily in overweight or obese women with underlying conditions. Obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 may synergistically increase risk for a medically indicated preterm birth to improve maternal pulmonary status in late pregnancy. These findings support categorizing pregnant patients as a higher-risk group, particularly those with chronic comorbidities.","Lokken, Erica M; Walker, Christie L; Delaney, Shani; Kachikis, Alisa; Kretzer, Nicole M; Erickson, Anne; Resnick, Rebecca; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Hwang, Joseph K; Barnhart, Nena; Rah, Jasmine; McCartney, Stephen A; Ma, Kimberly K; Huebner, Emily M; Thomas, Chad; Sheng, Jessica S; Paek, Bettina W; Retzlaff, Kristin; Kline, Carolyn R; Munson, Jeff; Blain, Michela; LaCourse, Sylvia M; Deutsch, Gail; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,532,16

There are multiple potential barriers to racial and ethnic minority enrollment in clinical trials, one of which could be that inclusion and exclusion criteria select for certain racial or ethnic groups disproportionately. In this observational cohort study at a single health care system, we examined if there were differences in eligibility for treatment with remdesivir based on clinical trial criteria for racial and ethnic minorities compared to non-Hispanic Whites. 201 electronic medical record charts were reviewed manually. Self-identified Whites were older than other racial or ethnic groups. At the time of presentation, Black, Latinx, and White participants met inclusion criteria for remdesivir at similar rates (72%, 80%, and 73% respectively), and exclusion criteria at similar rates (43%, 38% and 49% for Black, Latinx and White participants respectively).

Several adjunctive infection prevention methods are in common use but their effectiveness in reducing healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections is unclear. In this review, recent advances regarding the effectiveness of several adjunctive infection prevention methods to reduce healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Training and education on hand hygiene guidelines, mandatory influenza vaccination for healthcare personnel, access to paid sick leave to reduce ill presenteeism, cohorting of patients with the same infection or clinical syndrome, neuraminidase inhibitor chemoprophylaxis during influenza outbreaks, and enhanced visitor restrictions in pediatric hospitals all have shown some degree of effectiveness in observational or quasi-experimental studies. SUMMARY: Most of the studies evaluating the effect of adjunctive infection prevention methods on healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections are observational or quasi-experimental and are often combined with other interventions. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the precise effectiveness or efficacy of these interventions and more controlled trials are needed. Multimodal infection prevention policies are likely to be most effective in reducing healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections.","Most, Zachary M",Curr Opin Infect Dis,532,6

We found HLA-I peptides derived not only from canonical open reading frames (ORFs) but also from internal out-of-frame ORFs in spike and nucleocapsid not captured by current vaccines. Some peptides from out-of-frame ORFs elicited T cell responses in a humanized mouse model and individuals with COVID-19 that exceeded responses to canonical peptides, including some of the strongest epitopes reported to date. Whole-proteome analysis of infected cells revealed that early expressed viral proteins contribute more to HLA-I presentation and immunogenicity.

In a large, diverse region of Southern California, a collaborative effort was made to collect real-time data trends in stroke code activations and to assess this impact locally. The San Diego (SD) County Stroke Receiving Centers demonstrated a notable decrease of 30% in stroke code activations from March-May 2020 as compared to the same timeframe in 2019, which motivated the group to dedicate time and resources to pursue a united community messaging focused on seeking emergency treatment for stroke. Methods: A unified marketing campaign was created in collaboration with SD County EMS and the SD region American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. A single graphic message was utilized that emphasized the importance of seeking emergency treatment when suffering signs of stroke, along with the slogan “We are here for you. Every minute matters.” Impact of the campaign was gauged by quantifying the number of times our message was viewed on social media and number of stroke code activations after the campaign ended. Results: The unified social media campaign was posted by 14 of the 18 SD County stroke receiving hospitals during the month of June 2020. The team utilized Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn to convey the message. The campaign yielded a total of 26,727 views. The median monthly stroke code activations in July 2020 increased to 34, as compared to 26.5 for March-May 2020. Conclusion: In a time when social distancing has become the norm, it is more important than ever to band together as a community. This endeavor demonstrates that virtual messaging serves as a viable option for community education during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future. A unified social messaging campaign targeting the importance of seeking emergency care for stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic is an effective way to reach large numbers of people regionally.","Olson-Mack, L.

The primary endpoint was the IgG index according to DMTs (anti-CD20 mAb, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor [S1PR] modulator and other treatments) and COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 groups. RESULTS: In the vaccinated MS patients, the median IgG index was lower in patients treated with anti-CD20 mAb and in patients treated with S1PR modulator compared to patients receiving other or no DMTs (4.80 [1.58-28.6], 16.5 [16.3-48.5], 1116 [434-1747] and 1272 [658-1886], respectively, P<0.001). Similar results were found for MS patients after COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS and treated with S1PR modulators or anti-CD20 mAb had a reduced humoral response after COVID-19 vaccine.","Bigaut, K; Kremer, L; Fleury, M; Lanotte, L; Collongues, N; de Seze, J",Rev. neurol.

METHODS: A electronic survey inquiring as to how institutions determined remdesivir allocation was developed. On June 17, 2020, an invitation with a link to the survey was posted on the Vizient Pharmacy Network Community pages and via email to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy's Infectious Disease Practice and Research Network listserver. RESULTS: 66 institutions representing 28 states responded to the survey. The results showed that 98% of surveyed institutions used a multidisciplinary team to develop remdesivir allocation criteria. A majority of those teams included clinical pharmacists (indicated by 97% of respondents), adult infectious diseases physicians (94%), and/or adult intensivists (69%). Many teams included adult hospitalists (49.2%) and/or ethicists (35.4%). Of the surveyed institutions, 59% indicated that all patients with COVID-19 were evaluated for treatment, and 50% delegated initial patient identification for potential remdesivir use to treating physicians. Prioritization of remdesivir allocation was often determined on a ""first come, first served"" basis (47% of respondents), according to a patient's respiratory status (28.8%) and/or clinical course (24.2%), and/or by random lottery (22.7%). Laboratory parameters (10.6%), comorbidities (4.5%), and essential worker status (4.5%) were rarely included in allocation criteria; no respondents reported consideration of socioeconomic disadvantage or use of a validated scoring system. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inconsistencies of US medical centers' methods for allocating a limited pharmacotherapy resource that required rapid, fair, ethical and equitable distribution. The medical community, with citizen participation, needs to develop systems to continuously reevaluate criteria for treatment allocation as additional guidance and data emerge.","Mun, Frederick; Hale, Cory M; Hennrikus, Eileen F",Am. j. health system pharm,532,24

The in-hospital mortality rate between the patients with perineal burn and those with other burns was compared, and the adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital mortality was determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, mechanism of burn injury, year of admission, total burn surface area, inhalation injury, hand injury, and transfers from another hospital. One thousand one hundred forty-nine patients with perineal burn were enrolled, and the in-hospital mortality of this group was higher than that of the group of patients with other types of burns (46 vs 5.2%, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis found that the presence of perineal burns is associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 2.11 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.64-2.71]; P < 0.001).

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care pediatric otolaryngology practice during expansion of telehealth-based visits. A review of questionnaire responses was performed for 103 consecutive patients with MAs over 50 business days from March 20, 2020, to May 29, 2020. Families were asked a brief survey regarding the cause of the MA and assisted with technical support and rescheduling. MA rates and causes were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall MA rate during the initiation of telehealth services was significantly increased at 12.4% as compared with clinic-based visits of a similar duration before COVID of 5.2% (P < .001). Technical issues were the most common causes of MAs (51.3%). Of the caregivers, 23.8% forgot or reported cancellation of the appointment. Five percent of patients were non-English speaking and scheduled without translator support. Minorities and patients with public insurance represented 53.6% and 61.9% of MAs, respectively. DISCUSSION: Technical difficulties were the most commonly reported cause of missed telehealth appointments. Optimization of applications by providing patient reminders, determining need for translator assistance, and reducing required upload/download speeds may significantly reduce rates of MAs and conversions to other communication. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Clear, concise education materials on the technical aspects of telehealth, platform optimization, and robust technical and administrative support may be necessary to reduced missed telehealth appointments and support large-scale telehealth operations.

A great number of publications about older adults focus on function or self-care, so we aimed to analyse how cancer and its treatments affect leisure and productivity. Secondary objectives were to identify whether particular clinical and/or sociodemographic factors were associated with occupational disruptions and to assess the impact of rehabilitation approaches on leisure and productivity in this population. Methods: A systematic review of the 2009-2019 literature performed on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Results: 1471 publications were retrieved: 48 full texts were assessed; seven of these (four cross-sectional studies, two cohort studies, and a case report) were reviewed, including data on 16668 people (12649 healthy controls, 3918 cancer survivors, and 101 ill patients). Older adults with comorbidities and a low level of activity before cancer diagnosis may be more at risk of occupational disruptions. However, studies focused more on physical activity than leisure and productivity. Two studies mentioned occupational therapy. Discussion. As cancer can become a chronic disease, it appears important to also offer occupation-centred assessments and follow-up.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an observational trial, COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients were enrolled. MR-proADM, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic acid (LA) were measured in all patients at admission (T0), at 24 hours (T1) and in the third (T3) and fifth day (T5) of hospitalization. The aims of this study were to determine the role of MR-proADM to detect patients with high risk of mortality and compare the prognostic value of MR-proADM with commonly used clinical scores (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score - SOFA score, Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II score - APACHE II score, and Simplified Acute Physiological score II - SAPS II score). RESULTS: Twenty-one COVID-19 ARDS patients admitted to the Intermediate Care Unit (IMCU) were enrolled. The median MR-proADM values were 2.28, 2.41, 1.96 and 1.89 nmol/L at T0, T1, T3 and T5, respectively. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 52.4%. Mean MR-proADM T0 value was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors (3.5 vs. 1.1 nmol/L, p < 0.05). No significant differences were found for the other inflammatory biomarkers. In terms of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), MR-proADM showed a similar discriminatory power compared with APACHE II, SOFA and SAPS II score (0.81, 0.91, 0.70 and 0.78, respectively).

For this purpose, the authors presented (thermal maps) and analyzed the concentrations of selected gases such as NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 particles during the strict quarantine period in Poland and other EU countries. Statistical analysis of the concentration level of these gases was performed. It was noticed that in Poland, Germany, and France, the concentrations of such gases as CO, NO2, and PM2.5 particles decreased, while in Italy and Spain, the tendency was the opposite. To verify whether the discovered dependencies are not a natural continuation of the trends shaping the given phenomenon, the time series of gas and PM2.5 particle emissions were analyzed. On this basis, the emission forecast up to 2023 was created, using the ARIMA class models. The obtained results allowed to construct five scenarios for the development of NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 emissions until 2023, considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was stated that in the optimistic scenario, in 2023, a decrease in CO, NO2, and PM2.5 emissions could be achieved by maximums of 51%, 95%, and 28%, respectively.","Rybak, Aurelia Rybak Aleksandra",Energies,532,16

Noroviruses e.g., can be transmitted via smear infection, are relatively stable in the environment and very resistant to chemical disinfection. Some studies determined the virucidal efficacy of laundering processes, but few studies focused on the virucidal efficacy of dishwashing processes. Here, especially consumer related conditions are of interest. Households for example are a hotspot of norovirus infection and thus a sufficient reduction of these and other viruses from dishes must be insured to avoid an infection via this route. The likelihood of such an event should not be underestimated, since it was shown that the washing machine can be a reservoir for the transmission of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria in newborns. Although viruses do not replicate in these devices a transmission via contaminated cutlery e.g., cannot be excluded. Using a consumer related approach to determine the virucidal efficacy of dishwashers, we found a combination of a bleach containing dishwasher detergent, a cleaning temperature of 45 °C for 45 min and a rinsing temperature of 50 °C, to be sufficient to reduces viral titer of bovine corona virus, murine norovirus and modified vaccinia virus by 4.8, 4.2 and 3.8 logarithmic stages respectively.","Lucassen, Ralf Weide Mirko Bockmühl Dirk",Microbiology Research,532,14

Providing the results of economic evaluation for mass vaccination is of paramount importance for all stakeholders worldwide. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision tree for the economic evaluation of mass vaccination against COVID-19. The effectiveness of reducing outcomes after the administration of three COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca)) were modelled with empirical parameters obtained from literatures. The direct cost of vaccine and COVID-19 related medical cost, the indirect cost of productivity loss due to vaccine jabs and hospitalization, and the productivity loss were accumulated given different vaccination scenarios. We reported the incremental cost-utility ratio and benefit/cost (B/C) ratio of three vaccines compared to no vaccination with a probabilistic approach. RESULTS: Moderna and Pfizer vaccines won the greatest effectiveness among the three vaccines under consideration. After taking both direct and indirect costs into account, all of the three vaccines dominated no vaccination strategy. The results of B/C ratio show that one dollar invested in vaccine would have USD $13, USD $23, and USD $28 in return for Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, respectively when health and education loss are considered. The corresponding figures taking value of the statistical life into account were USD $176, USD $300, and USD $443. CONCLUSION: Mass vaccination against COVID-19 with three current available vaccines is cost-saving for gaining more lives and less cost incurred.","Wang, Wei-Chun; Fann, Jean Ching-Yuan; Chang, Ray-E; Jeng, Ya-Chung; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Liu, Jin-Tan; Yen, Amy Ming-Fang",J Formos Med Assoc,532,20

Data were collected 2 min before, 2 min during, and 6 min after AGPs. The EOS device and the air sampler for particle counting were placed 0.35 m from the open mouth of a manikin head. The particle number concentration (PN, counts/m3) was measured to calculate ΔPN (ΔPN = [post-PN] − [pre-PN]).ResultsMean ΔPN (SD) ranged between −8.65E+06 (2.86E+07) counts/m3 for 0.15 µm and 6.41E+04 (2.77E+05) counts/m3 for 1.0 µm particles. No significant differences were found among the AGP groups (p &gt; 0.05) or between the AGP and control groups (p &gt; 0.05). With an EOS device, lower ΔPN was detected for smaller particles by high-speed tooth preparation (0.1–0.3 µm;p &lt; 0.001).DiscussionA greater reduction in the number of smaller particles generated by the EOS device was found for high-speed tooth preparation. Low ΔPN by all AGPs demonstrated the efficacy of high-flow suction.ConclusionsThe additional use of an EOS device should be carefully considered when performing treatments, such as high-speed tooth preparation, that generate particularly small particles when more people are present and all other protective options have been exhausted.","Graetz, Christian Düffert Paulina Heidenreich Ralf Seidel Miriam Dörfer Christof E.",BDJ Open,532,4

As of August 21, mortality from COVID-19 has reached almost 200,000 people, with the United States leading the globe in levels of morbidity and mortality. Large volumes of high-acuity patients, particularly those of advanced age and with chronic comorbidities, have significantly increased the need for palliative care resources beyond usual capacity. More specifically, COVID-19 has changed the way we approach patient and family member interactions. DISCUSSION: Concern for nosocomial spread of this infection has resulted in strict visitation restrictions that have left many patients to face this illness, make difficult decisions, and even die, alone in the hospital. To meet the needs of COVID patients, services such as Emergency Medicine and Palliative Care have responded rapidly by adopting novel ways of practicing medicine.

As of August 21, mortality from COVID-19 has reached almost 200,000 people, with the United States leading the globe in levels of morbidity and mortality. Large volumes of high-acuity patients, particularly those of advanced age and with chronic comorbidities, have significantly increased the need for palliative care resources beyond usual capacity. More specifically, COVID-19 has changed the way we approach patient and family member interactions. DISCUSSION: Concern for nosocomial spread of this infection has resulted in strict visitation restrictions that have left many patients to face this illness, make difficult decisions, and even die, alone in the hospital. To meet the needs of COVID patients, services such as Emergency Medicine and Palliative Care have responded rapidly by adopting novel ways of practicing medicine.

Without specific antivirals, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality. Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mefloquine have emerged as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. CQ/HCQ entered the Solidarity and RECOVERY clinical trials against COVID-19 and showed lack of efficacy. Importantly, mefloquine is not a 4-aminoquinoline like CQ and HCQ and has been previously repurposed for other respiratory diseases. Unlike the 4-aminoquinolines that accumulate in the high pH of intracellular lysosomes of the lung, the high respiratory tract penetration of mefloquine is driven by its high lipophilicity. While CQ and HCQ exhibit activity in Vero E6 cells, their activity is obviated in TMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as Calu-3 cells, which more accurately recapitulate in vivo entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, here we report the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of mefloquine in Calu-3 type II pneumocytes and primary human monocytes. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells with low cytotoxicity and EC50 and EC90 values of 1.2 and 5.3 {micro}M, respectively. In addition, mefloquine reduced up to 68% the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in infected monocytes, reducing viral-induced inflammation. Mefloquine blocked early steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and was less prone than CQ to induce drug-associated viral mutations and synergized with RNA polymerase inhibitor. The pharmacological parameters of mefloquine are consistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points that this drug may accumulate in the lungs. These data indicate that mefloquine could represent an orally available clinically approved drug option against COVID-19 and should not be neglected on the basis of the failure of CQ and HCQ.","Sacramento, Carolina Q.; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Dias, Suelen S.

OBJECTIVES: We assess the prevalence of co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with seasonal respiratory viruses, document the respiratory viruses detected among individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, and describe characteristics of individuals with respiratory virus co-infection detected. METHODS: Specimens included in this study were submitted as part of routine clinical testing to Public Health Ontario Laboratory from individuals requiring testing for SARS-CoV-2 and/or seasonal respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Co-infection was detected in a smaller proportion (2.5%) of individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 than those with seasonal respiratory viruses (4.3%); this difference was not significant. Individuals with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to be younger than 65 years of age and male than those with single infection. Those with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection manifested mostly mild respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study may not support routine testing for seasonal respiratory viruses among all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, as they were rare during the study period nor associated with severe disease. However, testing for seasonal respiratory viruses should be performed in severely ill individuals, in which detection of other viruses may assist with patient management.","Peci, Adriana; Tran, Vanessa; Guthrie, Jennifer L; Li, Ye; Nelson, Paul; Schwartz, Kevin L; Eshaghi, AliReza; Buchan, Sarah A; Gubbay, Jonathan B",Viruses,532,16

The swift strategy to find effective treatment against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is to repurpose the approved drugs. In this pursuit, an exhaustive computational method has been used on the DrugBank compounds targeting nsp16/nsp10 complex (PDB code: 6W4H). A structure-based pharmacophore model was generated, and the selected model was escalated to screen DrugBank database, resulting in three compounds. These compounds were subjected to molecular docking studies at the protein-binding pocket employing the CDOCKER module available with the Discovery Studio v18. In order to discover potential candidate compounds, the co-crystallized compound S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) was used as the reference compound. Additionally, the compounds remdesivir and hydroxycholoroquine were employed for comparative docking. The results have shown that the three compounds have demonstrated a higher dock score than the reference compounds and were upgraded to molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies. The MDS results demonstrated that the three compounds, framycetin, kanamycin, and tobramycin, are promising candidate compounds. They have represented a stable binding mode at the targets binding pocket with an average protein backbone root mean square deviation below 0.3 nm. Additionally, they have prompted the hydrogen bonds during the entire simulations, inferring that the compounds have occupied the active site firmly. Taken together, our findings propose framycetin, kanamycin, and tobramycin as potent putative inhibitors for COVID-19 therapeutics.","Rampogu, S.; Lee, K. W.",Frontiers of Chemistry,532,16

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19 and uses ACE2 as a cell receptor to invade human cells. Therefore, ACE2 is a key factor to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 9,783 sequencing results of different organs, analyzed the effects of different ACE2 expression patterns in organs and immune regulation. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in the lungs and digestive tract. The cellular immunity of individuals with elevated ACE2 expression is activated, whereas humoral immunity is dampened, leading to the release of many inflammatory factors dominated by IL6. Furthermore, by studying the sequencing results of SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected cells, IL6 was found to be an indicator of a significant increase in the number of infected cells. However, although patients with high expression of ACE2 will release many inflammatory factors dominated by IL6, cellular immunity in the colorectum is significantly activated. This effect may explain why individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have severe lung symptoms and digestion issues, which are important causes of milder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This finding indicates that ACE2 and IL6 inhibitors have important value in COVID-19.","Bao, Z; Wang, L-J; He, K; Lin, X; Yu, T; Li, J; Gong, J; Xiang, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,532,16

We also examine the current literature regarding the association of vitamin D with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease. The vitamin D was evaluated not only as a biomarker but also as a nutritional supplement. We concluded that vitamin D levels could be valuable in predicting severe forms of MIS-C and correction of abnormal levels in severe MIS-C may influences its evolution. 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] supplementation raising serum [25(OH)D] concentrations potentially have a favorable effect in reducing the severity of MIS-C in certain circumstances.

METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley female rats underwent bladder and epidural catheter implantation. Five days later, cystometry was performed using continuous infusion. Anesthesia with isoflurane, ketamine-xylazine (KX) or fentanyl-fluanisone-midazolam (FFM) was used. After three micturition cycles, intrathecal bupivacaine was administered leading to the suppression of reflex bladder contractions. LPP measurements were performed using vertical tilt. After the initial LPP measurement, animals underwent partial resection of the striated urethral sphincter. The effect was evaluated 6 weeks after surgery, by repeating the LPP measurement in the same animal. RESULTS: Ten out of 19 animals showed full micturition cycles under isoflurane, and all 9 animals under KX anesthesia. No significant difference in micturition pressures (Mean ± SEM; 30.1 ± 2.3 vs. 26.8 ± 1.6 mmHg) and LPP (31.0 ± 2.4 vs. 28.0 ± 0.9 mmHg) was observed between isoflurane and KX groups, respectively. Reflex micturition was suppressed with FFM. Bupivacaine led to overflow incontinence in all cases. Sphincter injury caused fibrotic changes and a significant increase in LPP (26.4 ± 2.3 before vs. 46.9 ± 4.6 mmHg after injury, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: KX anesthesia preserves bladder contractions. Intrathecal bupivacaine eliminates reflex micturition, allowing for repeated LPP measurements in the same animal. Resection of striated sphincter resulted in increased LPP 6 weeks post injury.

DESIGN: Matched pairs analysis of nursing homes that had their initial vaccine clinics between December 18, 2020, and January 2, 2021, versus between January 3, 2021, and January 18, 2021. Matched facilities had their initial vaccine clinics between 12 and 16 days apart. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and eighty nursing homes in 21 states owned and operated by the largest long-term care provider in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week; hospital transfers and/or deaths per 100 residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection per day, averaged over a week. RESULTS: The early vaccinated group included 136 facilities with 12,157 residents; the late vaccinated group included 144 facilities with 13,221 residents. After 1 week, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 2.5 fewer incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week (95% CI: 1.2-4.0) compared with what would have been expected based on the experience of the late vaccinated facilities. The rates remained significantly lower for several weeks. Cumulatively over 5 weeks, the predicted reduction in new infections was 5.2 cases per 100 at-risk residents (95% CI: 3.2-7.3). By 5 to 8 weeks post-vaccine clinic, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 1.1 to 3.8 fewer hospitalizations and/or deaths per 100 infected residents per day, averaged by week than expected based on late vaccinated facilities' experience for a cumulative on average difference of 5 events per 100 infected residents per day. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines seem to have accelerated the rate of decline of incident infections, morbidity, and mortality in this large multi-state nursing home population.","Mor, Vincent; Gutman, Roee; Yang, Xiaofei; White, Elizabeth M; McConeghy, Kevin W; Feifer, Richard A; Blackman, Carolyn R; Kosar, Cyrus M; Bardenheier, Barbara H; Gravenstein, Stefan A",J. am. geriatr. soc,532,20

This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over-demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox 'distanceship'.","Al Lily, Abdulrahman Essa; Ismail, Abdelrahim Fathy; Abunasser, Fathi Mohammed; Alhajhoj Alqahtani, Rafdan Hassan",Technol Soc,532,20

In Germany the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a slowly growing demand for health care with a sudden occurrence of regional hotspots. This leads to an unpredictable situation for many hospitals, leaving the question of how many bed resources are needed to cope with the surge of COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: In this study we created a simulation-based prognostic tool that provides the management of the University Hospital of Augsburg and the civil protection services with the necessary information to plan and guide the disaster response to the ongoing pandemic. Especially the number of beds needed on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU) are the biggest concerns. The focus should lie not only on the confirmed cases as the patients with suspected COVID-19 are in need of the same resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the input we used the latest information provided by governmental institutions about the spreading of the disease, with a special focus on the growth rate of the cumulative number of cases. Due to the dynamics of the current situation, these data can be highly variable. To minimize the influence of this variance, we designed distribution functions for the parameters growth rate, length of stay in hospital and the proportion of infected people who need to be hospitalized in our area of responsibility. Using this input, we started a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 runs to predict the range of the number of hospital beds needed within the coming days and compared it with the available resources. RESULTS: Since 2 February 2020 a total of 306 patients were treated with suspected or confirmed COVID-19â¯at this university hospital. Of these 84 needed treatment on the ICU. With the help of several simulation-based forecasts, the required ICU and normal bed capacity at Augsburg University Hospital and the Augsburg ambulance service in the period from 28 March 2020 to 8 June 2020 could be predicted with a high degree of reliability. Simulations that were run before the impact of the restrictions in daily life showed that we would have run out of ICU bed capacity within approximately 1 month. CONCLUSION: Our simulation-based prognosis of the health care capacities needed helps the management of the hospital and the civil protection service to make reasonable decisions and adapt the disaster response to the realistic needs. At the same time the forecasts create the possibility to plan the strategic response days and weeks in advance. The tool presented in this study is, as far as we know, the only one accounting not only for confirmed COVID-19 cases but also for suspected COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the few input parameters used are easy to access and can be easily adapted to other healthcare systems.","Römmele, C; Neidel, T; Heins, J; Heider, S; Otten, V; Ebigbo, A; Weber, T; Müller, M; Spring, O; Braun, G; Wittmann, M; Schoenfelder, J; Heller, A R; Messmann, H; Brunner, J O",Anaesthesist,532,26

METHODOLOGY: To acquire the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou province, we collected data from 169 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 related cases. We described the demographic characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and the effective reproduction number. We also presented two representative case studies in Guizhou province: Case Study 1 was an example of the asymptomatic carrier; while Case Study 2 was an example of a large and complex infection chain that involved four different regions, spanning three provinces and eight families. RESULTS: Two peaks in the incidence distribution associated with COVID-19 in Guizhou province were related to the 6.04 days (95% CI: 5.00 - 7.10) of incubation period and 6.14±2.21 days of serial interval. We also discussed the effectiveness of the control measures based on the instantaneous effective reproduction number that was a constantly declining curve. CONCLUSIONS: As of February 2, 2020, the estimated effective reproduction number was below 1, and no new cases were reported since February 26. These showed that Guizhou Province had achieved significant progress in preventing the spread of the epidemic. The medical isolation of close contacts was consequential. Meanwhile, the asymptomatic carriers and the super-spreaders must be isolated in time, who would cause a widespread infection.","Ping, Kaike; Lei, Mingyu; Gou, Yun; Tao, Zhongfa; Yao, Guanghai; Hu, Can; Tao, Qin; Zou, Zhiting; Wang, Dingming; Li, Shijun; Huang, Yan",J Infect Dev Ctries,532,26

While there are several reports on COVID-19's impact on inpatient palliative care, literature is limited about the impact on outpatient care which may be more relevant for these patients. AIM: To generate a person-centered description of the impact of COVID-19 from the perspectives of patients living with neurodegenerative disease and caregivers to improve outpatient palliative care delivery. DESIGN: This qualitative study used rapid analysis via matrix design to identify emergent themes related to participant perspectives on the challenges of COVID-19. Data sources included semi-structured interviews, open-ended survey responses, medical record documentation and participant-researcher communications. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Data was collected from 108 patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease or related disorders and 90 caregivers enrolled in a multicenter, clinical trial of community-based, outpatient palliative care between March 20, 2020 and August 8, 2020 (NCT03076671). RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: (1) disruptions to delivery of healthcare and other supportive services; (2) increased symptomatic and psychosocial needs; (3) increased caregiver burden; (4) limitations of telecommunications when compared to in-person contact. We observed that these themes interacted and intersected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers have unmet care needs because of the pandemic, exacerbated by social isolation. While telemedicine has helped improve access to healthcare, patients and caregivers perceive clear limitations compared to in-person services. Changes in society and healthcare delivery in response to COVID-19 highlight ongoing and novel gaps that must be addressed to optimize future outpatient palliative care for neurologic illness.","Macchi, Zachary A; Ayele, Roman; Dini, Megan; Lamira, Jensine; Katz, Maya; Pantilat, Steven Z; Jones, Jacqueline; Kluger, Benzi M",Palliat Med,532,15

METHODS: This nationwide case-control and cohort study included all individuals in Denmark tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with PCR from 27 February 2020 to 26 July 2020. We estimated confounder-adjusted ORs for a positive test among all SARS-CoV-2 tested, and inverse probability of treatment weighted 30-day risk and risk ratios (RRs) of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality comparing current ACE-I/ARB use with calcium channel blocker (CCB) use and with non-use. RESULTS: The study included 13 501 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and 1 088 695 PCR-negative individuals. Users of ACE-I/ARB had a marginally increased rate of a positive PCR when compared with CCB users (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37), but not when compared with non-users (aOR 1.00 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09).Among PCR-positive individuals, 1466 (11%) were ACE-I/ARB users. The weighted risk of hospitalisation was 36.5% in ACE-I/ARB users and 43.3% in CCB users (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02). The risk of ICU admission was 6.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 5.4% in CCB users (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.16), while the 30-day mortality was 12.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 13.9% in CCB users (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.30). The associations were similar when ACE-I/ARB users were compared with non-users. CONCLUSIONS: ACE-I/ARB use was associated neither with a consistently increased rate nor with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings support the current recommendation of continuing use of ACE-Is/ARBs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

We previously reported excellent outcomes with the abbreviated Stanford V regimen. Herein we report updated results with median follow-up >10 years on survival, therapy-related late effects, and impact of disease risk factors on patient outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The XXXXXX and YYYYYY studies enrolled patients with stage I-IIA non-bulky ESHL. Patients received eight weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy followed by 30 Gy modified involved-field radiotherapy (mIFRT) (XXXXXX) or Stanford V-C + 20 Gy mIFRT (YYYYYY). Patients were categorized as favorable or unfavorable risk per German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) criteria and outcomes between groups compared. RESULTS: 129 patients were enrolled (68 favorable and 61 unfavorable risk). In the XXXXXX study (n = 87), at median follow-up of 19.7 years, 5-, 10-, and 15-year PFS and OS were 95.4%/97.7%, 91.8%/96.5%, and 91.8%/95.3%, respectively. In the YYYYYY study (n = 42), at median follow-up of 13.5 years, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year PFS and OS were 92.9%/100%, 92.9%/100%, and 88.4%/91.9%, respectively. PFS (p = 0.86) and OS (p = 0.86) were not significantly different between studies. There were also no significant differences between studies in patients with favorable or unfavorable risk for PFS (F: p = 0.53; U: p = 0.96), OS (F: p = 0.99; U: p = 0.78), secondary malignancies (F: p = .74; U: p = 1.0), and cardiovascular complications (F: no cases; U: p = 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The XXXXXX and YYYYYY studies achieve high rates of durable remission. 20 versus 30 Gy mIFRT and cyclophosphamide substituted for mechlorethamine did not compromise nodal control, PFS, or OS in both favorable and unfavorable risk disease. These results support the efficacy of CMT in early-stage disease and lower-dose radiotherapy in patients with favorable and non-bulky unfavorable ESHL.","Mou, Eric; Advani, Ranjana H; von Eyben, Rie; Rosenberg, Saul A; Hoppe, Richard T",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,532,6

Cu-PABA@Lac biocomposites were synthesized in situ by the one-step method under moderate conditions (water environment and normal temperature and pressure). Cu-PABA@Lac had great potential to maintain stability due to the protection of the Cu-PABA shell and reasonable conformational changes. In addition, Cu-PABA@Lac could be used repeatedly by centrifugation, as confirmed in the degradation experiment of bisphenol A (BPA). Because of the synergistic effect of copper ions between laccase and Cu-PABA, the Km value decreased (from 0.0024 to 0.0014â¯mM); therefore, the affinity between laccase and guaiacol was enhanced.

The authors discuss the structure and efficacy of the U.S. Navy's response to COVID-19 and evaluate the utility of this endeavor, with the objective of providing future recommendations for managing worldwide healthcare and medical operational demands from the perspective of Navy Neurosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors present an extensive review of topics and objectively highlight the efforts of U.S. Navy Neurosurgery as it pertains to the humanitarian mission during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the humanitarian mission (March 27, 2020-April 14, 2020), the response of active duty and reserve neurosurgeons in the U.S. Navy was robust. Neurosurgical coverage was present on board the U.S. Navy Ships Mercy and Comfort, with additional neurosurgical deployment to New York City for intensive care unit management and coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The U.S. Navy neurosurgical response to the COVID-19 pandemic was swift and altruistic. Although neurosurgical pathologies were limited among the presenting patients, readiness and manpower continue to be strong influences within the Armed Forces. The COVID-19 response demonstrates that neurosurgical assets can be rapidly mobilized and deployed in support of wartime, domestic, and global humanitarian crises to augment both trauma and critical care capabilities.","Ravindra, Vijay M; Dunn, Gavin P; Belverud, Shawn; Carroll, Christopher P; Zuckerman, Scott L; Menger, Richard; Malone, David; Cooke, Jonathon; Porenksy, Paul; Klugh Iii, Arnett; Gilhooly, Jonathan; Tomlin, Jeffrey; Bell, Randy; Ikeda, Daniel S",Mil Med,532,20

SARS-CoV-2 previously accumulated mutations at a much slower rate, of 1-2 per month; the sudden appearance of a large cluster of mutations was thought to be unusual. We now suspect that VOC may have arisen from immunosuppressed individuals who shed virus for longer periods. Epidemiological analyses estimate VOC to be more infectious; this is of most concern because these estimates were calculated during periods where many regions of the UK were in high social distancing restrictions. Therefore, the previous 'tiered' system implemented in the UK was ineffective at containing VOC. The most likely reason for this is that previous restrictions, no matter how strict, still allowed for gatherings in certain places. VOC also has implications for the national vaccination programme - a higher proportion of people will need to be vaccinated with a more infectious virus. Prolongation of the second dose of vaccines to increase vaccine uptake has understandably caused concern, but is based on sound immunological principles. There is now an urgent need to monitor the effect of new variants on vaccine efficacy - marking a new chapter in the global fight against COVID-19.","Pan, Daniel; Mudalige, Nadeesha Lakmal; Sze, Shirley; Koeckerling, David; Oyefeso, Oluwatobiloba; Barker, Joseph; Williams, Caroline Ml; Tang, Julian W; Pareek, Manish",Clin Med (Lond),532,3

Patients additionally present severe lymphopenia and, in some cases, complement consumption and autoantibody development. There is a normalization of lymphocytes once the infection is controlled. After this, autoimmune conditions of unknown etiology may occur. A hypothesis for the development of post-COVID-19 autoimmunity is proposed based on the consequences of both a transient immunosuppression (both of innate and acquired immunity) in which self-tolerance is lost and an inappropriate form of immune reconstitution that amplifies the process.","Cañas, Carlos A",Med Hypotheses,532,27

This paper is a descriptive study aims at describing the three community approaches that exist in Oman and reviewing their role in preparedness and response strategies to COVID-19 pandemic and discuss the lessons learned. Community participation approaches in Oman were translated into action during the pandemic through empowering community members, mobilizing resources, and strengthening the ownership among the local community to ensure effective advocacy, proper networking, and dissemination of information and, subsequently, actions at the level of the community. The first community participation approach is community organizations within the healthy cities and villages initiative, which facilitated networking and acted as a platform for community engagement, reviewing the health information and updating them accordingly to meet evloving demands. The second approach is Willayat (District) health committees, with their unique multi-sectoral structure, that enhanced collaboration at the state level with different community leaders and groups to develop pandemic action plans, which were implemented using available local resources. The third approach is community volunteers that remain the key information providers, particularly when physical access becomes limited due to physical distancing measures. Based on this review, we advocate to further strengthen these approaches and recommends that they are implemented for the protection and promotion of health and well-being, including for health emergencies.","Al Siyabi, Huda; Al Mukhaini, Said; Kanaan, Mohsen; Al Hatmi, Sumaya; Al Anqoudi, Zahir; Al Kalbani, Ahmed; Al Bahri, Zakiya; Wannous, Chadia; Al Awaidy, Salah T",Front Public Health,532,16

The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) among the viral proteins is known as an effective antiviral target. Lycorine is a phenanthridine Amaryllidaceae alkaloid isolated from the bulbs of Lycoris radiata (L'Hér.) Herb. and has various pharmacological bioactivities including antiviral function. PURPOSE: We investigated the direct-inhibiting action of lycorine on CoV's RdRp, as potential treatment for emerging CoV infections. METHODS: We examined the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, and then quantitatively measured the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV RdRp activity using a cell-based reporter assay. Finally, we performed the docking simulation with lycorine and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. RESULTS: Lycorine efficiently inhibited these CoVs with IC50 values of 2.123 ± 0.053, 1.021 ± 0.025, and 0.878 ± 0.022 µM, respectively, comparable with anti-CoV effects of remdesivir. Lycorine directly inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity with an IC50 of 1.406 ± 0.260 µM, compared with remdesivir's IC50 value of 6.335 ± 0.731 µM. In addition, docking simulation showed that lycorine interacts with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp at the Asp623, Asn691, and Ser759 residues through hydrogen bonding, at which the binding affinities of lycorine (-6.2 kcal/mol) were higher than those of remdesivir (-4.7 kcal/mol). CONCLUSIONS: Lycorine is a potent non-nucleoside direct-acting antiviral against emerging coronavirus infections and acts by inhibiting viral RdRp activity; therefore, lycorine may be a candidate against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Jin, Young-Hee; Min, Jung Sun; Jeon, Sangeun; Lee, Jihye; Kim, Seungtaek; Park, Tamina; Park, Daeui; Jang, Min Seong; Park, Chul Min; Song, Jong Hwan; Kim, Hyoung Rae; Kwon, Sunoh",Phytomedicine,532,29

Classified as a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, ISAV is characterized by the presence of two surface glycoproteins termed hemagglutinin esterase (HE) and fusion protein (F), both of them directly involved in the initial interaction of the virus with the target cell. HE mediates receptor binding and destruction, while F promotes the fusion process of the viral and cell membranes. The carboxy-terminal end of F (F2) possesses canonical structural characteristics of a type I fusion protein, while no functional properties have been proposed for the amino-terminal (F1) region. In this report, based on in silico modeling, we propose a tertiary structure for the F1 region, which resembles a sialic acid binding domain. Furthermore, using recombinant forms of both HE and F proteins and an in vitro model system, we demonstrate the interaction of F with a cell receptor, the hydrolysis of this receptor by the HE esterase, and a crucial role for F1 in the fusion mechanism. Our interpretation is that binding of F to its cell receptor is fundamental for membrane fusion and that the esterase in HE modulates this interaction.","Ojeda, Nicolás; Cárdenas, Constanza; Marshall, Sergio",,532,9

Coronaviruses have been known for 60 years. They are usually responsible for the induction of mild respiratory signs in humans. However, since 2002, the bat-borne virus started to induce fatal epidemics according to WHO reports. In this year, the first serious human coronavirus epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS) occurred (China, 8098 cases, 774 deaths [9.5% of the cases] in 17 countries). The case fatality was higher in elderly patients above 60 years and reached 50% of the cases. SARS epidemic was followed 10 years later by the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia (in 2012, 2260 cases, 803 deaths [35.5% of the cases] in 27 countries). Finally, in December 2019, a new epidemic in Wuhan, China, (corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19) emerged and could spread to 217 countries infecting more than 86,255,226 cases and killing 1,863,973 people by the end of 2020. There are many reasons why bats are ideal reservoir hosts for viral diseases such as the tolerance of their immune system to the invading viruses for several months. They can actively shed the viruses, although they develop no clinical signs (will be discussed in details later in the review). Bats were directly or indirectly involved in the three previous coronavirus epidemics. The indirect transmission takes place via intermediate hosts including civet cats for SARS and dromedary camels in the case of MERS. Although bats are believed to be the source of COVID-19 pandemic, direct pieces of evidence are still lacking. Therefore, coronaviruses' role in epidemics induction and the epidemiological role of bats are discussed. The current work also presents different evidence (phylogenetic data, animal experiments, bats artificial infection studies, and computerized models of SARS-CoV2 evolution) that underline the involvement of bats in the epidemiology of the pandemic.","El-Sayed, Amr; Kamel, Mohamed",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,532,10

By making use of its spike (S) protein, the virus binds to its primary human cell receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is present in the pulmonary epithelial cells as well as other organs. SARS-CoV-2 may cause a downregulation of ACE2. ACE2 plays a protective role in the pulmonary system through its Mas-receptor and alamandine-MrgD-TGR7 pathways. Loss of this protective effect could be a major component of COVID-19 pathogenesis. An attractive strategy in SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics would be to augment ACE2 either directly by supplementation or indirectly through drugs which increase its levels or stimulate its downstream players.

For those suffering from social anxiety, social distancing coincides with a tendency to avoid social interactions. We used this natural experiment imposed by a COVID-19 lockdown to examine how mandated low social exposure influenced socially anxious university students, and compared their anxiety to that of socially anxious students in preceding academic years with no social distancing. Methods: Ninety-nine socially anxious students were assessed for social anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters. Students from the 2019-2020 academic year (which included a lockdown followed by social distancing measures at the end of the fall semester) were compared to students from preceding years (2016-2019) on social anxiety levels. Results: Whereas social anxiety decreased in socially anxious students from the fall to the spring semester in the years preceding the pandemic, during the 2019-2020 academic year social anxiety levels remained high and unchanged. These results held when controlling for depressive symptoms and when analyzing social anxiety items that cannot be confounded with COVID-19-related anxiety. Conclusions: The current results suggest that reduced exposure to social situations may play a role in the maintenance of social anxiety.

Several viruses, including coronaviruses (CoVs), take advantage of cellular autophagy to facilitate their own replication. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta-coronavirus (ß-CoVs) that mediates its replication through a dependent or independent ATG5 pathway using specific double-membrane vesicles that can be considered as similar to autophagosomes. With due attention to several mutations in NSP6, a nonstructural protein with a positive regulatory effect on autophagosome formation, a potential correlation between SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis mechanisms and autophagy can be expected. Certain medications, albeit limited in number, have been indicated to negatively regulate autophagy flux, potentially in a way similar to the inhibitory effect of ß-CoVs on the process of autophagy. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support their direct antagonizing effect on CoVs. Off-target accumulation of a major fraction of FDA-approved autophagy modulating drugs may result in adverse effects. Therefore, medications that have modulatory effects on autophagy could be considered as potential lead compounds for the development of new treatments against this virus. This review discusses the role of autophagy/virophagy in controlling SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the potential therapeutic implications.","Sargazi, Saman; Sheervalilou, Roghayeh; Rokni, Mohsen; Shirvaliloo, Milad; Shahraki, Omolbanin; Rezaei, Nima",Cell biol. int,532,10

It recognizes attorneys as crucial to interprofessional health care teams and to establishing equitable health-related laws and policies. Attorney interventions transform institutional practices and help facilitate the stability necessary for health maintenance and recovery. Yet, critically, many rural residents cannot access legal supports.As more individuals experience unemployment, eviction, and insecure benefits amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for attorneys to address these social determinants of health as legal needs. Accordingly, the growing absence of attorneys in the rural United States proves particularly consequential-because of this pandemic context but also because of rural health disparities. We argue that unless a collaborative understanding of these interrelated phenomena is adopted, justice gaps will continue to compound rural health inequities.","Statz, Michele; Termuhlen, Paula",Am J Public Health,532,24

Coronavirus is the influenza-like respiratory disease causing damage to the respiratory system of the humans through the ACE2 receptors which acts as an entry gate for the virus to enter. The Corona virus was identified in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China which later spread to the most of the territories in China. The spread was first identified by the Bluedot which is a Saas service designed to track and detect the spread of infectious disease. When the other countries came to know the severity of the virus they made various steps to prevent the spread of the virus. The initial symptoms of coronavirus are rise in temperature, loss of taste and smell and short breathness. As the entry level check many institutions and offices, checks the body temperature of the people and checks whether the person is wearing a mask or not. To make this process fully automatic without human intervention the use of AI enabled IR camera sensor with the Arduino UNO is made. The detection of temperature can be made possible by the use of the computer leveraging vision techniques which is equipped with the Raspberry-pi camera module. The process is based on the thermal imaging of the person which can detect the elevated temperature of the person and prevents them from entering into the institution or offices thereby the spread due to the possibly affected persons can be avoided thereby the spread can be controlled. The system not only identifies the person with high temperature but also checks whether the person is wearing a mask or not.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the full adaptation of the discipline of geriatrics to a web-based learning tool, of two activities that were developed including the current COVID-19 to illustrate some of the main concepts of geriatric medicine. METHODS: The course was fully adapted to the open-source course management system called MOODLE. The first activity was a COVID-19 clinical case discussion, whose main objective was to include COVID-19 in the content of our course, illustrating some of the main concepts of geriatrics. The second activity was a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) experience, done via videoconference, which also assessed the impact of social distancing measures on the health of older adults. RESULTS: A total of 43 medical students performed both activities, and 95% of the students considered the inclusion of the COVID-19 into the discipline of geriatrics useful, 88% approved the practical experience of CGA, and 84% felt that they contributed to the health of the interviewees after contact. CONCLUSION: Adapting our discipline to a web-based learning tool, while including the current COVID-19 in our course content and a practical experience of CGA via videoconference was possible and approved by students.

METHODS: The outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated. Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style. The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, and neurological outcome. RESULTS: Data from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward. The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%. Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated <1â¯min. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (30.2%), and the most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (75%). Of the patients receiving CPR, ROSC was achieved in 18 (13.2%) patients, 4 (2.9%) patients survived for at least 30 days, and one patient achieved a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days. Cardiac arrest location and initial rhythm were associated with better outcomes.

Those antibodies exert a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, whose evolution overtime after COVID-19 as well as efficiency against novel variants are however poorly characterized. METHODS: In this prospective study, sera of 107 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected at 3- and 6-months post-infection. We performed quantitative neutralization experiments on top of high-throughput serological assays evaluating anti-Spike (S) and anti-Nucleocapsid (NP) IgG. FINDINGS: Levels of sero-neutralization and IgG rates against the ancestral strain decreased significantly over time. After 6 months, 2.8% of the patients had a negative serological status for both anti-S and anti-NP IgG. However, all sera had a persistent and effective neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels correlated with sero-neutralization and this correlation was stronger for anti-S than for anti-NP antibodies. The level of sero-neutralization quantified at 6 months correlated with markers of initial severity, notably admission in intensive care units and the need for mechanical invasive ventilation. In addition, sera collected at 6 months were tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed efficient neutralizing effects against D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants but a significantly weaker activity against B.1.351 variant. INTERPRETATION: Decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19. A weaker protection was however observed for the B.1.351 variant.","Betton, Maureen; Livrozet, Marine; Planas, Delphine; Fayol, Antoine; Monel, Blandine; Védie, Benoit; Bruel, Timothée; Tartour, Eric; Robillard, Nicolas; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; Blanchard, Anne; Ghosn, Jade; Visseaux, Benoit; Péré, Hélène; Lebeaux, David; Schwartz, Olivier; Veyer, David; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien",Clin. infect. dis,532,16

METHODS: One IgM(+) and IgG(-), 32 IgM(+) and IgG(+), 38 IgM(-) and IgG(+), and 40 IgM(-) and IgG(-) patients were included. Demographic data were collected. IgM and IgG antibodies, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocyte subsets in serum were determined at weeks 0, 2 and 4. RESULTS: The hs-CRP and IL-6 levels of all patients were within the normal ranges. The number of patients with all lymphocyte subset testing items within normal ranges was 12/110 (10.9%) at week 0, 15/110 (13.6%) at week 2 and 18/110 (16.4%) at week 4. The percentages of CD8 + cells, NK cells and B lymphocytes in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group were quite different from those in the IgM(-) and IgG(+) group and the IgM(-) and IgG(-) group, with much higher percentages of CD8 + cells and much lower percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Twelve IgM(+) patients in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group converted to IgM(-), and the percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes in these patients were significantly increased at week 4.

This included the cancellation of consultations for patients with rare diseases, such as severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), resulting in potential medication shortage and loss of follow-up. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate PH patient health status evolution, access to health care and mental health experience during the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online patient survey, available in 16 languages, between 22/05/2020 and 28/06/2020. The survey included questions corresponding to demographic, COVID-19 and PH related information. RESULTS: 1073 patients (or relatives, 27%) from 52 countries all over the world participated in the survey. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of responders reported a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and 15% of chronic thromboembolic PH. The COVID-19 related events were few: only 1% of all responders reported a diagnosis of COVID-19. However, 8% of patients reported health deterioration possibly related to PH, and 4% hospitalization for PH. Besides, 11% of the patients reported difficulties to access their PH expert centre, and 3% interruption of treatment due to shortage of medication. Anxiety or depression was reported by 67% of the participants. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 incidence in PH patients was low, PH related problems occurred frequently as the pandemic progressed, including difficulties to have access to specialized care. The importance of primary health care was emphasized. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of COVID-related PH care disruption.","Godinas, Laurent; Iyer, Keerthana; Meszaros, Gergely; Quarck, Rozenn; Escribano-Subias, Pilar; Vonk Noordegraaf, Anton; Jansa, Pavel; D039,; Alto, Michele; Luknar, Milan; Milutinov Ilic, Senka; Belge, Catharina; Sitbon, Olivier; Reis, Abílio; Rosenkranz, Stephan; Pepke-Zaba, Joanna; Humbert, Marc; Delcroix, Marion",Orphanet J Rare Dis,532,16

In addition to its role as hypothalamic releasing hormone, GnRH has multiple functions including modulator of neural activity within the nervous system and of resulting behaviors. These multiple functions are reflected by the existence of multiple isoforms. Despite its importance as a critical hypothalamic releasing hormone, the gnrh1 gene has been lost in zebrafish, and its reproductive function is not compensated for by other GnRH isoforms (GnRH2 and GnRH3), suggesting that, surprisingly, zebrafish do not use any of the GnRH peptides to control reproduction and fertility. Previously we proposed that Phoenixin/SMIM20, a novel peptide identified in mammals and the ligand for the orphan GPR173, is a potential candidate to control the initiation of sexual development and fertility in the zebrafish. Here we confirm the sequence of the zebrafish phoenixin/smim20 gene and by RT-PCR show that it is expressed early in development through adulthood.

STUDY DESIGN: Antibodies reactive to S1 and S2 subunits from SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E were measured via ELISA in human milk samples collected from March to June 2020 in mothers with and without viral symptoms. RESULTS: The presence of viral symptoms influenced the levels of SARS-CoV-2 S2-reactive SIgA/IgA and tended to influence SARS-CoV-2 S1 SIgA/IgA and S2-reactive SIgM/IgM in human milk but did not relate to IgG. HCoV-229E S1 + S2-reactive SIgA/IgA and SIgM/IgM, as well as HCoV-OC43 S1 + S2-reactive IgG were related to the symptoms. The duration of antibody levels in human milk in mothers with viral symptoms varied between 3 and 4 months post maternal report of viral symptoms. CONCLUSION: Previous viral symptoms and individual mothers may change the antibody cross-reactive levels to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs in human milk.","Demers-Mathieu, Veronique; DaPra, Ciera; Mathijssen, Gabrielle B; Medo, Elena",J. perinatol,532,12

In this study, we investigated cellular responses in two cell lines, Vero and Calu-3, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated the effects of pathway-specific inhibitors on virus production. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced dephosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, high virus production, and apoptosis in Vero cells. However, in Calu-3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced long-lasting phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, low virus production, and no prominent apoptosis. Inhibitors that target STAT3 phosphorylation and dimerization reduced SARS-CoV-2 production in Calu-3 cells, but not in Vero cells.

The combination of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), injurious invasive ventilation, micro/macro thrombi and the potential for direct myocardial injury create conditions where RVD is likely to occur. No study has prospectively explored the prevalence of RVD, and its association with mortality, in a cohort requiring mechanical ventilation. MethodsProspective, multi-centre, trans-thoracic echocardiographic, cohort study of ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Scottish intensive care units. RVD was defined as the presence of severe RV dilatation and interventricular septal flattening. To explore role of myocardial injury, high sensitivity troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured in all patients. ResultsOne hundred and twenty-one patients were recruited to COVID-RV, 118 underwent imaging and it was possible to determine the primary outcome in 112. RVD was present in seven (6.2% [95%CI; 2.5%, 12.5%]) patients. Thirty-day mortality was 85.7% in those with RVD, compared to 44.8% in those without (p=0.051). Patients with RVD were more likely to have; pulmonary thromboembolism (p<0.001), higher plateau pressure (p=0.048), lower dynamic compliance (p=0.031), higher NT-proBNP (p<0.006) and more frequent abnormal troponin (p=0.048). Abnormal NT-proBNP (OR 4.77 [1.22, 21.32], p=0.03) and abnormal Troponin (16.54 [4.98, 67.12], p<0.001) independently predicted 30-day mortality. ConclusionCOVID-RV demonstrates a prevalence of RVD in ventilated patients with COVID-19 of 6.2% and is associated with a mortality of 85.7%. Association is observed between RVD and each of the aetiological domains of; ARDS, ventilation, micro/macro thrombi and myocardial injury.","McCall, Philip; Willder, Jennifer; Stanley, Bethany; Messow, Claudia-Martina; Allan, John; Gemmell, Lisa; Puxty, Alex; Strachan, Dominic; Berry, Colin; Shelley, Ben; investigators., - The COVID-RV",,532,1

As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections during its initial invasion of the United States remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the United States through 12 March, we estimated that 108,689 (95% posterior predictive interval [95% PPI]: 1,023 to 14,182,310) infections occurred in the United States by this date. By comparing the model's predictions of symptomatic infections with local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between 24 February and 12 March, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.98; 95% PPI: 0.66 to 0.98) with increases in testing. These results suggest that testing was a major limiting factor in assessing the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during its initial invasion of the United States.","Perkins, T Alex; Cavany, Sean M; Moore, Sean M; Oidtman, Rachel J; Lerch, Anita; Poterek, Marya",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,532,11

Given the critical role of NFPs in the global surveillance and response system supported by the IHR, we sought to assess their experiences in carrying out their functions. METHODS: In collaboration with WHO officials, we administered a voluntary online survey to all 196 States Parties to the IHR (2005) in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South and North America, from October to November 2019. The survey was available in six languages via a secure internet-based system. RESULTS: In total, 121 NFP representatives answered the 56-question survey; 105 in full, and an additional 16 in part, resulting in a response rate of 62% (121 responses to 196 invitations to participate). The majority of NFPs knew how to notify the WHO of a potential PHEIC, and believed they have the content expertise to carry out their functions. Respondents found training workshops organized by WHO Regional Offices helpful on how to report PHEICs. NFPs experienced challenges in four critical areas: 1) insufficient intersectoral collaboration within their countries, including limited access to, or a lack of cooperation from, key relevant ministries; 2) inadequate communications, such as deficient information technology systems in place to carry out their functions in a timely fashion; 3) lack of authority to report potential PHEICs; and 4) inadequacies in some resources made available by the WHO, including a key tool - the NFP Guide. Finally, many NFP representatives expressed concern about how WHO uses the information they receive from NFPs. CONCLUSION: Our study, conducted just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrates key challenges experienced by NFPs that can affect States Parties and WHO performance when outbreaks occur. In order for NFPs to be able to rapidly and successfully communicate potential PHEICs such as COVID-19 in the future, continued measures need to be taken by both WHO and States Parties to ensure NFPs have the necessary authority, capacity, training, and resources to effectively carry out their functions as described in the IHR.","Packer, Corinne; Halabi, Sam F; Hollmeyer, Helge; Mithani, Salima S; Wilson, Lindsay; Ruckert, Arne; Labonté, Ronald; Fidler, David P; Gostin, Lawrence O; Wilson, Kumanan",Global Health,532,32

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic and has taken lives of approximately two million people to date. Even though various vaccines are currently under development, virus, and especially its spike glycoprotein can mutate, which highlights a need for a broad-spectrum inhibitor. In this work, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by graphene platforms with precise dual sulfate/alkyl functionalities is investigated. A series of graphene derivatives with different lengths of aliphatic chains is synthesized and is investigated for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and feline coronavirus. Graphene derivatives with long alkyl chains (>C9) inhibit coronavirus replication by virtue of disrupting viral envelope. The ability of these graphene platforms to rupture viruses is visualized by atomic force microscopy and cryogenic electron microscopy. A large concentration window (10 to 100-fold) where graphene platforms display strongly antiviral activity against native SARS-CoV-2 without significant toxicity against human cells is found. In this concentration range, the synthesized graphene platforms inhibit the infection of enveloped viruses efficiently, opening new therapeutic and metaphylactic avenues against SARS-CoV-2.","Donskyi, Ievgen S; Nie, Chuanxiong; Ludwig, Kai; Trimpert, Jakob; Ahmed, Rameez; Quaas, Elisa; Achazi, Katharina; Radnik, Jörg; Adeli, Mohsen; Haag, Rainer; Osterrieder, Klaus",Small,532,20

Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. The dose of aspirin will be 75 mg once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. All other therapies will be administered according to the institute's COVID-19 treatment protocol and the treating physician's clinical judgment. MAIN OUTCOMES: All study participants will be prospectively followed up for ten days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer for outcomes. The primary outcome will be clinical deterioration characterized by progression to WHO clinical improvement ordinal score &#8805; 6 (i.e., endotracheal intubation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, pressor agents, renal replacement therapy, ECMO requirement, and mortality). The secondary outcomes will be change in serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6), Troponin I, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) from time zero to 5th day of study enrolment or 7th day after symptom onset, whichever is later. Other clinical outcomes that will be assessed include progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), shock, ICU admission, length of ICU admission, length of hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality. Adverse drug effects like myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding will also be examined in the trial to assess the safety of the interventions. RANDOMISATION: The study will use a four-arm parallel-group design. A computer-generated permuted block randomization with mixed block size will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to group A (atorvastatin with conventional therapy), group B (aspirin with conventional therapy), group C (aspirin + atorvastatin with conventional therapy), and group D (control; only conventional therapy). BLINDING (MASKING): The study will be an open-label trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): As there is no existing study that has evaluated the role of aspirin and atorvastatin in COVID-19 patients, formal sample size calculation has not been done. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited during six months of study period. Once the first 200 patients are included in each arm (i.e., total 800 patients), the final sample size calculation will be done on the basis of the interim analysis of the collected data. TRIAL STATUS: The institutional ethical committee has approved the study protocol (Protocol version 3.0 [June 2020]). Participant recruitment starting date: 28th July 2020 Participant recruitment ending date: 27th January 2021 Trial duration: 6 months TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been prospectively registered in Clinical Trial Registry - India (ICMR- NIMS): Reference no.

Neurological manifestations can occur even after mild forms of respiratory disease, and neurological symptoms are very often associated with worsening of the patient’s condition. The aim of this study was to show abnormal brain neuroimaging findings evaluated by MRI in patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological symptoms. Methods: Sixteen patients after mild forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, twenty-three patients after moderate forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as sixteen healthy participants in the control group underwent MRI 3T brain scan. All subjects in the SARS-CoV-2 group had small, punctuate, strategically located and newly formed hyperintense lesions on T2 and FLAIR sequences. New lesions were formed more often in the bilateral frontal subcortical and bilateral periventricular, correlated with the severity of the clinical picture. These changes indicate an example of silent cerebrovascular disease related to SARS-CoV-2 and once again emphasize the neurotropism of the virus.","Marcic, Ljiljana Marcic Marino Kojundzic Sanja Lovric Marcic Barbara Capkun Vesna Vukojevic Katarina",Journal of Personalized Medicine,532,16

Until now, there has been no specific treatment against the disease and repurposing of the drug. Our investigation aimed to screen potential inhibitors against coronavirus for the repurposing of drugs. Our study analyzed sequence comparison among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV to determine the identity matrix using discovery studio. SARS-CoV-2 M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; was targeted to generate an E-pharmacophore hypothesis to screen drugs from the DrugBank database having similar features. Promising drugs were used for docking-based virtual screening at several precisions. Best hits from virtual screening were subjected to MM/GBSA analysis to evaluate binding free energy, followed by the analysis of binding interactions. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulation approaches were carried out to assess the docked complex's conformational stability. A total of 33 drug classes were found from virtual screening based on their docking scores. Among them, seven potential drugs with several anticancer, antibiotic, and immunometabolic categories were screened and showed promising MM/GBSA scores. During interaction analysis, these drugs exhibited different types of hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residue. Besides, 17 experimental drugs selected from virtual screening might be crucial for drug discovery against COVID-19. The RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and MM/PBSA descriptors from molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the complex's firm nature. Seven promising drugs for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;), namely sapanisertib, ornidazole, napabucasin, lenalidomide, daniquidone, indoximod, and salicylamide, could be vital for the treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction When considering anatomy in medical school, one challenge facing medical education is integrating preclinical anatomy knowledge with the procedural experiences and pathology encounters of clerkship years.1,2 COVID-19 has further exacerbated this challenge by forcing medical school institutions to maintain social-distancing through reshaping their approach to teaching anatomy. The most notable changes include limiting on-site anatomy laboratory experiences and increasing virtual didactic anatomy sessions. By integrating a virtual 3D anatomy platform into a prosection driven lab curriculum, the possible quality impacts to anatomy medical education may be lessened and even improved.3-9 Materials and Methods First-year medical students at HWCOM (CO 2024) participated. Groups of 4-10 students rotated through six 20-minute stations. Two of the six 20-minute stations were facilitated by a fourth year medical teaching assistant (TA). In each station led by the TA, the TA utilized a didactic teaching model to teach select gastrointestinal and genitourinary anatomy and pathology topics using a prosected cadaver and prosected 3D virtual anatomy models on the Complete Anatomy application. The first ten to fifteen minutes of teaching involved using the prosected cadaver and the final five to ten minutes involved the 3D virtual prosected models. The 3D virtual prosected models were used to further explain anatomical features or pathologies identified on the cadaver. Prior to or after the station was completed, students rotated at the four 20-minute self-learning stations that contained plastinated models, plastic models, or wet organ specimens of gastrointestinal anatomy. At these stations, students completed a worksheet based on the lab objectives for gastrointestinal and genitourinary anatomy. A five-question end-of-course survey (5-point Likert Scale) will be administered to all first-year medical students who participated in the wet lab session. Results We expect the results of our end-of-course survey to support our hypothesis that the integrated didactic anatomy teaching model would improve first year medical students? understanding of the course material. Additionally, we expect the students to recommend incorporating the Complete Anatomy app with the prosected models for the first-year anatomy lab curriculum. Final data analysis of the variables will be completed after obtaining IRB exemption. Conclusion and Significance/Implication Despite the limitations to human anatomy medical education due to the COVID pandemic, we believe this novel integrated virtual 3D and cadaver prosection approach to the traditional anatomy curriculum will not only lessen the impacts to quality but also improve the baseline quality of anatomy medical education, become a permanent inclusion within our institution's curriculum, and serve as a model for novel approaches to first-year anatomy curriculum.","De Witte, Anton Payomo Andrew Ravikumaran Nair Rakesh",The FASEB Journal,532,13

STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a retrospective observational study. METHODS: Data for all patients admitted to seven community hospitals in Michigan, United States, with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 10 to April 15, 2020 were analyzed. The primary outcomes of racial disparity in inpatient mortality and intubation were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The study included 336 Black and 408 White patients. Black patients were younger (62.9 ± 15.0 years vs 71.8 ± 16.4, P < .001), had a higher mean body mass index (32.4 ± 8.6 kg/m2 vs 28.8 ± 7.5, P < .001), had higher prevalence of diabetes (136/336 vs 130/408, P = .02), and presented later (6.6 ± 5.3 days after symptom onset vs. 5.4 ± 5.4, P = .006) compared with White patients. Younger Black patients had a higher prevalence of obesity (age <65 years, 69.9%) than older Black patients (age >65 years, 39.2%) and younger White patients (age < 65, 55.1%). Intubation did not reach statistical significance for racial difference (Black patients 61/335 vs. 54/406, P = .08).

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in the gynecological EDs of Modena (Emilia-Romagna), Sassari and Cagliari (Sardinia) regarding all admissions to gynecological EDs during November 1 to 30, 2019, and March 11 to April 9, 2020 (lockdown period). RESULTS: A total of 691 women (mean age 38.3 ± 14.3 years) who were admitted to the gynecological EDs were included. The relative decrease in women evaluated from March 11 to April 9, 2020, was -56.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 52.2-61.1). Time spent in the ED was also significantly shorter during this period (P=0.02) in comparison to November 1 to 30, 2019. The most evident decrease was observed for pelvic pain (-68.9% [95% CI 60.3-76.7]; -91 cases). The management of women suggests a more effective use of the ED, with higher rates of hospitalization (P=0.001) and recourse to emergent surgeries (P=0.005) and lower rates of discharge to home (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown greatly reduced the rate of admission to gynecological EDs, but the real emergencies were filtered from the more deferrable ones.","Grandi, Giovanni; Del Savio, Maria C; Caroli, Martina; Capobianco, Giampiero; Dessole, Francesco; Tupponi, Giulio; Petrillo, Marco; Succu, Claudia; Paoletti, Anna M; Facchinetti, Fabio",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,532,12

The safety and supply of blood during this pandemic has been a concern of blood banks and transfusion services as it is expected to adversely affect blood system activities. We aim to assess the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) during the first months of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was designed to address blood supply, transfusion demand, and donor management during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Medical directors of different blood banks were invited to participate. RESULTS: A total of 16 centers participated with representation from 15/22 countries in the region. 75% were from national blood banks. Most centres had a decrease in the blood supply, ranging from 26-50%. Representatives from 14 countries (93.3%) believed that public fear has contributed to a decrease in donations. Most centres (n=12, 87.5%) had a reduction in transfusion demand, while those who did not, reported heavy involvement in treating patients with underlying haemoglobinopathies and haematological malignancies. Half of the centres activated their contingency plans. Four centres had to alter the blood donor eligibility criteria to meet demands. All centres implemented donor deferral criteria in relation to SARS-CoV-2, but were variable in measures to mitigate the risk of donor and staff exposure. CONCLUSION: Blood services in the region faced variable degrees of blood shortages. We summarize lessons learnt during this pandemic for the blood banks to consider to plan, assess, and respond proportionately to future similar pandemics.","Riyami, Arwa Z Al; Abdella, Yetmgeta E; Badawi, Maha A; Panchatcharam, Sathiya M; Ghaleb, Yasser; Maghsudlu, Mahtab; Satti, Maria; Lahjouji, Khadija; Merenkov, Zayd; Adwan, Asia; Feghali, Rita; Gebril, Naji; Hejress, Suha; Hmida, Slama; AlHumaidan, Hind; Jamal, Durenaz; Najjar, Osama; Raouf, May",Transfus. clin. biol,532,1

Transplant recipients are considered particularly vulnerable to pathogens because of immunosuppression, and SARS-CoV-2 is likely to generate complications if contracted. Several signs and symptoms observed in COVID-19 positive patients reflect damage to multiple organs and tissues, raising the possibility of extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infections and risk of transmission. At the beginning of the pandemic, a consensus has emerged not to consider COVID-19 positive patients as potential living or deceased donors, resulting in a global decrease in transplantation procedures. Medical decision-making at the time of organ allocation must consider safely alongside the survival advantages offered by transplantation. To address the risk of transmission by transplantation, this review summarizes the published cases of transplantation of cells or organs from donors infected with SARS-CoV-2 until January 2021 and assesses the current state of knowledge for the detection of this virus in different biologic specimens, cells, tissues, and organs. Evidence collected to date raises the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in some CTO, which makes it impossible to exclude transmission through transplantation. However, most studies focused on evaluating transmission under laboratory conditions with inconsistent findings, rendering the comparison of results difficult. Improved standardization of donors and CTO screening practices, along with a systematic follow-up of transplant recipients could facilitate the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk by transplantation.","Gaussen, Amaury; Hornby, Laura; Rockl, Gary; O039,; Brien, Sheila; Delage, Gilles; Sapir-Pichhadze, Ruth; Drews, Steven J; Weiss, Matthew J; Lewin, Antoine",Transplantation,532,16

Rather than looking for drugs that directly interact with key viral proteins inhibiting its replication, an alternative and possibly add-on approach is to dismantle the host cell machinery that enables the virus to infect the host cell and spread from one cell to another. Excellent examples of such machinery are host cell proteases whose role in viral pathogenesis has been demonstrated in numerous coronaviruses. In this review, we propose two therapeutic modalities to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infections; the first is to transcriptionally modulate the expression of cellular proteases and their endogenous inhibitors and the second is to directly inhibit their enzymatic activity. We present a nonexhaustive collection of clinically investigated drugs that act by one of these mechanisms and thus represent promising candidates for preclinical in vitro testing and hopefully clinical testing in COVID-19 patients.","El-Shimy, Ismail A; Mohamed, Mahmoud M A; Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Hadi, Muhammad A",Pharmacol Res Perspect,532,16

Methods: In this prospective study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D high-resolution T1WI sequences were acquired in 60 recovered COVID-19 patients (56.67% male; age: 44.10 ± 16.00) and 39 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 controls (56.41% male; age: 45.88 ± 13.90). Registered fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI, and an index score system was introduced. Regional volumes derived from Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) and DTI metrics were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two sample t-test and Spearman correlation were conducted to assess the relationships among imaging indices, index scores and clinical information. Findings: In this follow-up stage, neurological symptoms were presented in 55% COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had statistically significantly higher bilateral gray matter volumes (GMV) in olfactory cortices, hippocampi, insulas, left Rolandic operculum, left Heschl's gyrus and right cingulate gyrus and a general decline of MD, AD, RD accompanied with an increase of FA in white matter, especially AD in the right CR, EC and SFF, and MD in SFF compared with non-COVID-19 volunteers (corrected p value <0.05). Global GMV, GMVs in left Rolandic operculum, right cingulate, bilateral hippocampi, left Heschl's gyrus, and Global MD of WM were found to correlate with memory loss (p value <0.05). GMVs in the right cingulate gyrus and left hippocampus were related to smell loss (p value <0.05).

In this review, we report the latest developments in terms of bioprinting technologies for the manufacturing of cellular constructs with particular emphasis on material extrusion, jetting, and vat photopolymerization. We then describe the different base polymers employed in the formulation of bioinks for bioprinting and examine the strategies used to tailor their properties according to both processability and tissue maturation requirements. By relating function to organization in human development, we examine the potential of pluripotent stem cells in the context of bioprinting toward a new generation of tissue models for personalized medicine. We also highlight the most relevant attempts to engineer artificial models for the study of human organogenesis, disease, and drug screening.

Both hypoxemia and a prothrombotic diathesis have been associated with more severe disease and increased risk of death. To date, specific indications to treat this condition are lacking. This was a single center, investigator initiated, compassionate use, proof of concept, case control, phase IIb study (NCT04368377) conducted in the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit of L. Sacco University Hospital in Milano, Italy. Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability. We enrolled five consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe respiratory failure requiring helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a pro-thrombotic state identified as a D-dimer > 3 times the upper limit of normal. Five patients matched for age, D-dimer value and SOFA score formed the control group. Beyond standard of care, treated patients received 25 µg/Kg/body weight tirofiban as bolus infusion, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 µg/Kg/body weight per minute for 48 hours. Before tirofiban, patients received acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg infusion and oral clopidogrel 300 mg; both were continued at a dose of 75 mg daily for 30 days. Fondaparinux2.5 mg/day sub-cutaneous was given for the duration of the hospital stay. All controls were receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose heparin, according to local standard operating procedures. Treated patients consistently experienced a mean (SD) reduction in A-a O2 gradient of -32.6 mmHg (61.9, P = 0.154), -52.4 mmHg (59.4, P = 0.016) and -151.1 mmHg (56.6, P = 0.011; P = 0.047 vs. controls) at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after treatment. PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased by 52 mmHg (50, P = 0.172), 64 mmHg (47, P = 0.040) and 112 mmHg (51, P = 0.036) after 24, 48 hours and 7 days, respectively. All patients but one were successfully weaned from CPAP after 3 days. This was not true for the control group. No major adverse events were observed. Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure. The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes' function and platelet adhesion. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm these results.","Viecca, Maurizio; Radovanovic, Dejan; Forleo, Giovanni Battista; Santus, Pierachille",Pharmacol Res,532,1

Moreover, many nanotherapeutics can be delivered by inhalation locally to the lungs avoiding systemic circulation. In addition, nanoscale based delivery systems can be multifunctional, simultaneously carrying out several tasks including diagnostics, treatment and suppression of cellular resistance to the treatment. Nanoscale delivery systems improve the clinical efficacy of conventional therapeutics allowing new approaches for the treatment of respiratory diseases which are difficult to treat or possess intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment.

In response, the academic community has produced multiple forecasting models, approaches and algorithms to best predict the different indicators of COVID-19, such as the number of confirmed infected cases. Yet, researchers had little to no historical information about the pandemic at their disposal in order to inform their forecasting methods. Our work studies the predictive performance of models at various stages of the pandemic to better understand their fundamental uncertainty and the impact of data availability on such forecasts. We use historical data of COVID-19 infections from 253 regions from the period of 22nd January 2020 until 22nd June 2020 to predict, through a rolling window backtesting framework, the cumulative number of infected cases for the next 7 and 28 days. We implement three simple models to track the root mean squared logarithmic error in this 6-month span, a baseline model that always predicts the last known value of the cumulative confirmed cases, a power growth model and an epidemiological model called SEIRD. Prediction errors are substantially higher in early stages of the pandemic, resulting from limited data. Throughout the course of the pandemic, errors regress slowly, but steadily. The more confirmed cases a country exhibits at any point in time, the lower the error in forecasting future confirmed cases. We emphasize the significance of having a rigorous backtesting framework to accurately assess the predictive power of such models at any point in time during the outbreak which in turn can be used to assign the right level of certainty to these forecasts and facilitate better planning.","Gordeev, Dmitry; Singer, Philipp; Michailidis, Marios; Muller, Mathias; Ambati, SriSatish",,532,23

However, there is a lack of empirical research that examines when, why and how insolvency courts prevent actual or potential conflicts. This article reports the results of an empirical study that explored the strategies used by insolvency judges in the Netherlands to resolve conflicts and to prevent a dispute from becoming one. The results show that insolvency courts deploy “under the radar” mediation-like strategies to prevent actual and potential conflicts involving insolvency practitioners, enhancing the speed and cost-effectiveness of the winding-up of cases in the perceptions of stakeholders. Consequently, insolvency judges do not only act as adjudicators in court proceedings, but also take on mediation-like roles, at least in some jurisdictions.

One hundred and three pharmaceutical and medical supply chain employees participated in the study. Most of the participants (58.3%) were aged &#8805;35 years, male (65%), and pharmacists (92.2%). The majority of participants had at least two years of experience in supply chain (77.6%), worked in public hospitals (95.15%), and were mostly working at healthcare institutions located in Riyadh province (59.2%).

Approximately 53% of the participants reported the prices of PPE in shortage had seen an increase by at least 25% during the pandemic. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, its impact was largely manageable in Saudi healthcare institutions.

In the wake of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia, concerns have been raised about education disruption at the elementary school level and its impact on instilling and developing 21st-century skills. Conducted at a college of education in Saudi's Eastern Province, a qualitative exploratory study examined 20 Saudi postgraduate female students' written responses to a journal question concerning teaching elementary pupils online about the pandemic while 21st-century skills were being inculcated. A critical finding was that the participants expressed a sense of ample scope for personal and pedagogical transformation despite the enormity of the challenge.

Heparin, a widely used anticoagulant drug, is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy. Exogenous heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses, including S-associated coronavirus isolate HSR1. Here, we show that heparin inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion of Vero cells by up to 80% at doses achievable through prophylaxis and, particularly relevant, within the range deliverable by nebulisation. Surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that heparin and enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin which is a clinical anticoagulant, bind and induce a conformational change in the spike (S1) protein receptor-binding domain (S1 RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. A library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments were used to probe the structural basis of this interaction. Binding to the RBD is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulfate groups than on N-sulfation and a hexasaccharide is the minimum size required for secondary structural changes to be induced in the RBD. It is likely that inhibition of viral infection arises from an overlap between the binding sites of heparin/HS on S1 RBD and that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The results suggest a route for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and its derivatives as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","Mycroft-West, Courtney J; Su, Dunhao; Pagani, Isabel; Rudd, Timothy R; Elli, Stefano; Gandhi, Neha S; Guimond, Scott E; Miller, Gavin J; Meneghetti, Maria C Z; Nader, Helena B; Li, Yong; Nunes, Quentin M; Procter, Patricia; Mancini, Nicasio; Clementi, Massimo; Bisio, Antonella; Forsyth, Nicholas R; Ferro, Vito; Turnbull, Jeremy E; Guerrini, Marco; Fernig, David G; Vicenzi, Elisa; Yates, Edwin A; Lima, Marcelo A; Skidmore, Mark A",Thromb Haemost,532,16

To achieve this, a llama was immunized using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an immune phage-display library of variable domains was developed. The sdAbs selected from this library segregated into five distinct sequence families. Three of these families bind to unique epitopes with high affinity, low nM to sub-nM KD, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. To further enhance the utility of these sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein, homobivalent and heterobivalent genetic fusion constructs of the three high-affinity sdAbs were prepared. The effectiveness of the sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein was evaluated using MagPlex fluid array assays, a multiplexed immunoassay on color-coded magnetic microspheres. Using the optimal bivalent pair, one immobilized on the microsphere and the other serving as the biotinylated recognition reagent, a detection limit as low as 50 pg/mL of recombinant nucleocapsid and of killed virus down to 1.28 × 103 pfu/mL was achieved.

This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. STUDY DESIGN: We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations. RESULTS: We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate. CONCLUSION: These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Eberhardt, J N; Breuckmann, N P; Eberhardt, C S",J Clin Virol,532,20

Tremendous efforts have been made to control the pandemic, among which neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are of specific interest to researchers. Neutralizing antibodies are generated within weeks after infection or immunization, and can protect cells from virus intrusion and confer protective immunity to cells. Thus, production of NAbs is considered as a main goal for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines and NAbs may be used for patient treatment in the form of monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization assays are capable of quantitatively detecting NAbs against SARS-CoV-2, allowing to explore the relationship between the level of NAbs and the severity of the disease, and may predict the possibility of re-infection in COVID-19 patients. They can also be used to test the effects of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma and vaccines. At present, wild-type virus neutralization assay remains the gold standard for measuring NAbs;while pseudovirus neutralization assays, Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), and high-throughput versions of neutralization assays are popular alternatives with their own advantages and disadvantages.

Older adults showed the highest levels of resilience following the September 11th (9/11) terrorist attacks, but during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak there were no age-related differences in well-being. The current study examined the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disruption on well-being throughout adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Perceived stress and affect were examined in 166 community-dwelling adults (Mage=35.65; SD=15.53; range=18-79) in relation to the perceived disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic to their lives. RESULTS: A significant moderation was found for age and COVID-19 disruption on perceived stress [F(5, 153) = 8.88, p & .05, R2= .22] and negative affect [F(5, 154) = 4.91, p & .05, R2= .14], but not for positive affect. For participants over 50, those who rated COVID-19 as a low or high disruption had similar scores on stress and negative affect, but with younger aged participants, perceiving high disruption corresponded with higher levels of stress and negative affect. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings are consistent with the strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI) model, wherein older adults try to maintain positive emotional well-being; with middle-aged and older adults in the current study having experienced less negative impact on well-being. Middle-aged and older adults may be better able to regulate negative emotions, from COVID-19, than younger adults. SAVI proposes a greater negative impact on older adults when they experience sustained stressors; as the challenges with COVID-19 continue, further data will need to be examined.","Knepple Carney, Amy; Graf, Allyson S; Hudson, Grace; Wilson, Ellen",GerontologistGerontologist,532,3

This virus is supposed to be spread by human to human transmission. Cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dogs might be secondary hosts during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets. There are now many reports of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in dogs, cats, tigers, lion, and minks. Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne routes. Based on these natural infection reports and experimental data, whether the pets are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans; needs to be deeply investigated. Humans showing clinical symptoms of respiratory infections have been undergoing for the COVID-19 diagnostic test but many infected people and few pets confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic.

In the past two decades different parts of the word experienced smaller or bigger outbreak related to human coronaviruses. The spike glycoproteins of the COVID-19 (similar to SARS-CoV) attach to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) and transit over a stabilized open state for the viral internalization to the host cells and propagate with great efficacy. Higher rate of mutability makes this virus unpredictable/less sensitive to the protein/nucleic acid based drugs. In this emergent situation, drug-induced destabilization of spike binding to RBD could be a good strategy. In the current study we demonstrated by bioinformatics (CASTp: computed atlas of surface topography of protein, PyMol: molecular visualization) and molecular docking (PatchDock and Autodock) experiments that tea flavonoids catechin products mainly epigallocatechin gallate or other like theaflavin gallate demonstrated higher atomic contact energy (ACE) value, binding energy, Ki value, ligand efficiency, surface area and more amino acid interactions than hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during binding in the central channel of the spike protein. Moreover, out of three distinct binding sites (I, II and III) of spike core when HCQ binds only with site III (farthest from the nCoV-RBD of ACE2 contact), epigallocatechin gallate and theaflavin gallate bind all three sites. As sites I and II are in closer contact with open state location and viral-host contact area, these drugs might have significant effects. Taking into account the toxicity/side effects by chloroquine/HCQ, present drugs may be important. Our laboratory is working on tea flavonoids and other phytochemicals in the protection from toxicity, DNA/mitochondrial damage, inflammation and so on. The present data might be helpful for further analysis of flavonoids in this emergent pandemic situation.","Maiti, Smarajit; Banerjee, Amrita",Drug dev. res,532,24

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

Moreover, the pandemic has also negatively impacted patients with liver disease who have not contracted COVID-19, since the reallocation of human and material resources to the care of patients with the virus has resulted in a decrease in the treatment, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disease, which will surely have negative consequences in the near future.

We aim to determine any beneficial or detrimental short-term effects of these changes. METHODS: All patients referred to fracture clinic from the emergency department during the period March 24, 2020 to May 10, 2020 (national lockdown) were assessed for number of face to face and telephone appointments, number of radiographs performed, time to discharge, use of a removable cast, any cast complications, other complications, reattendance or re-referral after discharge. They were compared with patients referred in the same period in 2019. Follow-up was to 6 months for every patient. RESULTS: In 2019, 240 patients were reviewed and 110 in 2020. Changes in practice resulted in significant differences in the number of face to face appointments per patient [2 (1 to 6) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 5) 2020 (P<0.00001)] and increase in telephone appointments [0 (0 to 1) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 2) 2020]. Number of radiographs per patient [1 (1 to 7) 2019 vs. 1 (1 to ) 2020 (P=0.0178)] and time to discharge [29 d (0 to 483) 2019 vs. 16 d (0 to 216) 2020 (P<0.00001)] also reduced significantly. Use of a self-removable casting technique increased significantly (2.4% of casts in 2019 vs. 91.8% in 2020 (P<0.00001). There were no significant differences in complications related to cast or otherwise, unplanned attendance or reattendance after discharge. Use of self-removable casts for supracondylar fractures and for simple injuries (including distal radius, forearm, Toddler's, and ankle fractures) also demonstrated no change in complication rate. Significant potential cost savings of >£185 000 per annum could be demonstrated through clinic appointment and cast removal reductions. DISCUSSION: Changes to the normal management of pediatric orthopaedic trauma brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been demonstrated to be safe in the short term with no increase in complications demonstrated. Potential cost savings are possible both to the health care provider and also to the patient because of reduced hospital attendance. It is feasible to continue these practices for the potential benefits as they appear safe in the short term.

Information regarding coronavirus infection in pregnancy is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to describe the clinical course of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Study Design: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020, and April 20, 2020. Severe disease was defined according to published criteria as patient-reported dyspnea, respiratory rate >30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on room air, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded from the study if they had presumed coronavirus disease 2019, but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results: Of 64 hospitalized pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, 44 (69%) had severe disease, and 20 (31%) had critical disease. The following preexisting comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease, and the mean body mass index was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age was at a mean of 29±6 weeks at symptom onset and a mean of 30±6 weeks at hospital admission, with a median disease day 7 since first symptoms. Most women (81%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 7% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days [severe group] and 10.5 days [critical group]; P=.01). Intubation was usually performed around day 9 on patients who required it, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease was performed on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was required in 20% of cases, the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70%, and reintubation was necessary in 20%. There was 1 case of maternal cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal death. Thirty-two of 64 (50%) women with coronavirus disease 2019 in this cohort delivered during their hospitalization (34% [severe group] and 85% [critical group]). Furthermore, 15 of 17 (88%) pregnant women with critical coronavirus disease 2019 delivered preterm during their disease course, with 16 of 17 (94%) pregnant women giving birth through cesarean delivery; overall, 15 of 20 (75%) women with critical disease delivered preterm. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission. Conclusion: In pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, admission into the hospital typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 [severe group] vs 12 [critical group]). Women with critical disease had a high rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and there was 1 case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal mortality. Hospitalization of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in delivery during the clinical course of the disease in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester. There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.","Pierce-Williams, Rebecca A M; Burd, Julia; Felder, Laura; Khoury, Rasha; Bernstein, Peter S; Avila, Karina; Penfield, Christina A; Roman, Ashley S; DeBolt, Chelsea A; Stone, Joanne L; Bianco, Angela; Kern-Goldberger, Adina R; Hirshberg, Adi; Srinivas, Sindhu K; Jayakumaran, Jenani S; Brandt, Justin S; Anastasio, Hannah; Birsner, Meredith; O039,; Brien, Devon S; Sedev, Harish M; Dolin, Cara D; Schnettler, William T; Suhag, Anju; Ahluwalia, Shabani; Navathe, Reshama S; Khalifeh, Adeeb; Anderson, Kathryn; Berghella, Vincenzo",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,532,26

Even before the pandemic shutdowns, the incorporation of virtual laboratories within classroom education had brought transformations in teaching laboratory courses. Virtual laboratories were integrated as training platforms for complementing learning objectives in laboratory education especially during this pandemic imposed shutdown. In context of suspended face-to-face teaching, this study explores the role of virtual laboratories as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in ensuring the continuity of teaching-learning, providing alternative ways for skill training from home. As an innovative approach, the study presents push-pull mooring theory to analyze switching intention of users from offline conventional education to online education. The study explores the complements of physical experiments brought in with animations, simulations, and remote laboratory set-ups for providing skill trainings to learners. To test whether virtualization techniques have global impact in education sector, the study included a comparative analysis of student users during the academic year 2019 (before-COVID) who had a blended approach of learning and those of the year 2020 (post-COVID), with remote learning. Initial before-COVID behavioral analysis on university students (n = 1059) indicated the substantial popularity of virtual laboratories in education for skill training and instructor dependency. Usage adoption of virtual laboratories increased during the pandemic-imposed lockdowns and learners were being less instructor dependent. 24% of students accessed more 10 times a week without the instructor being present and overall, 90% contributed to a minimum of 5 usages a week. In terms of Kolb's learning styles, most of the virtual laboratory learners were assimilators. The results suggest virtual laboratories may have a prominent role in inquiry based and self-guided education with minimum instructor dependency, which may be crucial for complementing practice skills and planning online tools to add to this post-COVID-19 teaching and learning scenarios.","Radhamani, Rakhi; Kumar, Dhanush; Nizar, Nijin; Achuthan, Krishnashree; Nair, Bipin; Diwakar, Shyam",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),532,21

HFNC devices produced by different manufacturers may have varied performance. Whether there is a difference in these devices and the extent of the differences in performance remain unknown. Methods: Four HFNC devices (AIRVO 2, TNI softFlow 50, HUMID-BH, and OH-70C) and a ventilator with an HFNC module (bellavista 1000) were evaluated. The flow was set at 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, and 80 L/min, and the FiO2 was set at 21%, 26%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%. Then, one side of the cannulas was clipped to simulate the compression, bending, or blocking of the nasal cannulas. The flow and FiO2 of the delivered gas were recorded and compared among settings and devices. Results: The actual-flow and actual-FiO2 delivered by different settings and devices varied. AIRVO 2 had superior performance in flow and FiO2 accuracy. bellavista 1000 and OH-70C had good performance in the accuracy of actual-flows and actual-FiO2, respectively. bellavista 1000 and HUMID-BH had a larger flow range from 10 to 80 L/min, but only bellavista 1000 could provide a stable flow with an excessive resistance up to 60 L/min. TNI softFlow 50 had the best flow compensation and could provide sufficient flow with excessive resistance at 20-50 L/min. Conclusions: The variation in flow, FiO2 settings, and devices could influence the actual-flow and actual-FiO2 delivered. AIRVO 2 and OH-70C showed better FiO2 accuracy. TNI softFlow 50, bellavista 1000, and HUMID-BH could lower the risk of insufficient flow support due to accidental compression or blocking of the cannulas. In addition, ventilators with HFNC modules provided comparable flow and FiO2 and could be an alternative to standalone HFNC devices.","Zhou, Yuyan; Ni, Zhong; Ni, Yuenan; Liang, Binmiao; Liang, Zongan",Can Respir J,532,19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection with high mortality in older patients due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The high number of vaccinations may be one of the reasons why children show a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and milder severity when compared to adults. We have designed a study aimed at investigating whether the influenza vaccine may reduce the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We retrospectively enrolled 635 patients who accessed our Emergency Department from March 1st to June 30th, 2020, and were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by an RT-PCR on an oropharyngeal swab. Clinical data, outcomes, and influenza vaccination status were collected from the electronic medical records of our Hospital. We also used data from the Italian Health Ministry to compare the prevalence of flu vaccination among the general population of the Lazio Region and our enrolled patients. We then compared clinical outcomes between vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients, by univariate and multivariate analysis. COVID-19-positive patients older than 65 years reported a lower prevalence of flu vaccination when compared to the general population residing in the Lazio (p = 0.004). After correction for gender, age, and comorbidities, we found a lower risk of death at 60 days in patients with flu vaccination than in not vaccinated patients (p = 0.001). Our study shows that flu vaccination could reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this result.","Candelli, Marcello; Pignataro, Giulia; Torelli, Enrico; Gullì, Antonio; Nista, Enrico Celestino; Petrucci, Martina; Saviano, Angela; Marchesini, Debora; Covino, Marcello; Ojetti, Veronica; Antonelli, Massimo; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco",Intern. emerg. med,532,20

There was an alarming level of public fear during the disease outbreak due toan information crisis, resulted by the government's holdback of vital information and the widespread MERS rumours on social media. By paying attention to news coverage patterns of rumours and comparing them across the outbreak period, the paper examines the following research questions: (a) Under what media frames were the MERS rumours reported by the online news? (b) Which media frame did the online news use most frequently? (c) How did the media frames change during and after the information vacuum?. Methods: Content analysis of news articles that covered MERS rumours during the outbreak has been conducted. Inductive open coding has been performed to investigate what reactions and media frames the news coverages have demonstrated to report the rumour propagation. Sample: The article samples were retrieved for big data analysis from the Big Kinds or the Korea Integrated News Database System (www.bigkinds.or.kr), by using the search terms, “MERS” and “SNS (Social Network Services).” A total of 142 articles have been sampled. Results: The paper found 7 reaction variables and categorized them into 2 risk-reporting media frames: risk-alarming frame(Anxiety, Criticisms and Damage) and risk-mitigating frame (Government, Correction, Remedies and Causes). The paper discovered that anxiety was the most frequently observed reaction variable across all phases. The paper also concluded that there has been a decrease in risk-alarming media frames and an increase in attempts to analyze causes for the rumour propagation (Causes), as the outbreak proceeds to the second phase, when the information vacuum finally ended. Conclusion: By exploring a disease outbreak in which ineffective risk management and absence of official information caused significant problems, the paper underlines the need for systematic risk communication measures, endorsed by effective collaboration among political leadership, media and the public.","Yang, Jeongwon; Lee, Sunhee",J.

Rates vary by a number of factors that can be categorized into different levels of the social ecology. Research and theory in this field point to the importance of community-level factors that can contribute to either risk or prevention of child maltreatment. The COVID-19 pandemic context creates additional risks and concerns related to child maltreatment and exacerbates risk factors that existed before: e.g., families and communities are in much worsened states of poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity; losses and grief are affecting mental health; and limitations and safety concerns are affecting in-person child protection work and more. Central to recovery from this pandemic will be the mobilization of community-level resources and the building back up of the social fabric that can support vulnerable children and caregivers. Key to this mobilization will be a better intersectional understanding of structural inequities in the child welfare system and in our communities. Efforts to dismantle structural biases and discrimination are critical to provide safety and support for families and vital for effective child maltreatment prevention. In this context, we discuss the state of the science of community-level prevention of childhood maltreatment, highlighting evidence-based community-level prevention programs and how these types of efforts may be impacted by the current COVID-19 global pandemic.","Molnar, Beth E; Scoglio, Arielle A J; Beardslee, William R",Int J Child Maltreat,532,24

The improvement was performed in two steps: first, through mutation by gamma irradiation (5 KGy dose), resulting in the recovery of a mutant (CI-24), which produced approximately triple the amount of PHBA produced by the wild-type isolate. Then, biotransformation by this mutant was further optimized via response surface methodology model-based optimization. The maximum PHBA production (7.47 mg/mL) was obtained in a fermentation medium composed of 1% w/v yeast extract as a nitrogen source, with an initial pH of 6.6, incubated at 28 °C at an agitation rate of 250 rpm.

We review the evidence that justifies the repurposing of PARPi to block the proliferation of SARS‐CoV‐2 and combat the life‐threatening sequelae of COVID‐19 by several mechanisms. PARPi’s can effectively decrease IL‐6, IL‐1 and TNFα levels (key interleukins in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm) and can alleviate subsequent lung fibrosis, as demonstrated in murine experiments and clinical trials. PARPi can tune macrophages towards a tolerogenic phenotype. PARPi’s may also counteract SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced and inflammation‐induced cell death and support cell survival. PARPi’s had beneficial effects in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma and ventilator‐induced lung injury. PARPi’s may potentiate the effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab, Adalimumab, Canakinumab or Siltuximab therapy. In summary, the evidence suggests that PARPi therapy would benefit COVID‐19 patients and trials of these drugs should be undertaken.","Curtin, Nicola; Bányai, Krisztián; Thaventhiran, James; Le Quesne, John; Helyes, Zsuzsanna; Bai, Péter",Br J Pharmacol,532,22

Three studies (N = 1,143 American adults) supported these predictions and ruled out several alternative explanations. Compassionate goals unrelated to the health context predicted COVID-19 health behaviors better than the general motivation to be healthy (Studies 2 and 3). In contrast, general health motivation predicted general health behaviors better than did compassionate goals. Compassionate goals and political ideology each explained unique variance in COVID-19 health behaviors (Studies 1–3). Compassionate goals predict unique variance in COVID-19 health behaviors beyond empathic concern, communal orientation, and relational self-construal (Study 3), supporting the unique contribution of compassionate goals to understanding health behaviors.

ACE2 is necessary to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, but due to its essential metabolic roles, it may be difficult to target it in therapies. TMPRSS2, which interacts with ACE2, may be a better candidate for targeted therapies. Using publicly-available expression data, we show that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in many host tissues, including lung. The highest expression of ACE2 is found in the testes, whereas the prostate display the highest expression of TMPRSS2. Given the increased severity of disease among older males with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we address the potential roles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their contribution to the sex differences in disease severity. We show that expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are overall comparable between males and females in multiple tissues suggesting that differences in the expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the lung and other non-sex-specific tissues may not explain the gender disparities in SARS CoV-2 severity. However, given their instrumental roles for SARS-CoV-2 infection and their pleiotropic expression, targeting the activity and expression levels of TMPRSS2 is a rational approach to treat COVID-19.","Baughn, Linda B.; Sharma, Neeraj; Elhaik, Eran; Sekulic, Aleksandar; Bryce, Alan H.; Fonseca, Rafael",Mayo Clin Proc,532,20

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to review the current literature on COVID-19 related chatbots in healthcare, identify and characterize these emerging technologies and their applications for combating COVID-19, and describe related challenges. METHODS: The authors conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature on COVID-19, guided by the Arksey and O’Malley framework. PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar were searched over a period between January and September 2020 by using the keywords “COVID* chatbot”, “virtual assistant”, “AI enabled platform COVID” and associated synonyms. Relevant studies’ references were checked for further articles. The content of these studies was screened and thematically analyzed by the two authors. RESULTS: Out of 543 articles initially identified, 9 were eligible for inclusion. Studies describing chatbots’ development and architecture (n=6) were the most common, and only 3 empirical studies on the user experience were identified. Our scoping review identified five key applications of the current health chatbots, which were: disseminating health information and knowledge; self-triage and personal risk assessment; monitoring exposure and notifications; tracking COVID-19 symptoms and health aspects; and combating misinformation and fake news. Furthermore, these technologies can accomplish the following tasks: ask and answer questions; create health records and history of use; complete forms and generate reports; and take simple actions. Nonetheless, the use of health chatbots poses many challenges both at the level of the social system (i.e., consumers’ acceptability) as well as the technical system (i.e., design and usability). CONCLUSION: Using health chatbots to combat COVID-19 is a practice still in its infancy. We believe that our work will help researchers in this domain gain better understanding of this novel technology’s design and applications, which are needed for continuous improvement in the health chatbots’ functionalities and their usefulness to fight COVID-19.","Almalki, Manal; Azeez, Fahad",Acta Inform Med,532,1

It involves multiple organs of infected individuals and encompasses diverse clinical manifestations. We report a case of acute optic neuritis (ON) associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody possibly induced by COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old man presented to our clinic with left eye pain and vision loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed the bilateral high intensity of the optic nerve sheaths. He tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on the day of admission but he had no signs of respiratory illness. Laboratory testing revealed that MOG immunoglobulin G (MOG IgG) was positive, but other antibodies including aquaporin-4 were negative. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with MOG antibody-positive acute ON possibly induced by COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Steroid pulse therapy consisting of methylprednisolone 1 g/day for a total of 3 days, followed by an oral prednisolone taper was performed. OUTCOMES: His left eye pain was immediately relieved, and his decimal vision improved from 0.03 to 0.1 on the day of discharge. Outpatient follow-up 2 weeks later revealed left a decimal vision of 1.2, and a complete resolution of the left eye pain.

These measures have been reported to have a negative effect on physical activity (PA). Studies of PA during the pandemic have primarily used self-reported data. The single academic study that used tracked data did not report on demographics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore patterns of smartphone-tracked activity before, during, and immediately after lockdown in the United Kingdom, and examine differences by sociodemographic characteristics and prior levels of PA. METHODS: Tracked longitudinal weekly minutes of PA were captured using the BetterPoints smartphone app between January and June 2020. Data were plotted by week, demographics, and activity levels at baseline. Nonparametric tests of difference were used to assess mean and median weekly minutes of activity at significant points before and during the lockdown, and as the lockdown was eased. Changes over time by demographics (age, gender, Index of Multiple Deprivation, baseline activity levels) were examined using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). RESULTS: There were 5395 users with a mean age of 41 years (SD 12) and 61% (n=3274) were female. At baseline, 26% (n=1422) of users were inactive, 23% (n=1240) were fairly active, and 51% (n=2733) were active. There was a relatively even spread across deprivation deciles (31% [n=1693] in the least deprived deciles and 23% in the most [n=1261]). We found significant changes in PA from the week before the first case of COVID-19 was announced (baseline) to the week that social distancing restrictions were relaxed (Friedman test: χ(2)(2)=2331, P<.001). By the first full week of lockdown, the median change in PA was 57 minutes less than baseline. This represents a 37% reduction in weekly minutes of PA. Overall, 63% of people decreased their level of activity between baseline and the first week of COVID-19 restrictions. Younger people showed more PA before lockdown but the least PA after lockdown. In contrast, those aged >65 years appeared to remain more active throughout and increased their activity levels as soon as lockdown was eased. Levels of PA among those classed as active at baseline showed a larger drop compared with those considered to be fairly active or inactive. Socioeconomic group and gender did not appear to be associated with changes in PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our tracked PA data suggests a significant drop in PA during the United Kingdom’s COVID-19 lockdown. Significant differences by age group and prior PA levels suggests that the government’s response to COVID-19 needs to be sensitive to these individual differences and the government should react accordingly. Specifically, it should consider the impact on younger age groups, encourage everyone to increase their PA, and not assume that people will recover prior levels of PA on their own.","McCarthy, Hannah; Potts, Henry W W; Fisher, Abigail",J Med Internet Res,532,26

Aprendiendo dia a dia el primer mes de pandemia de covid19,17.121273,-1.6607515,2020-04-30,"MOTIVATION: To complement experimental efforts, machine learning-based computational methods are playing an increasingly important role to predict human–virus protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Furthermore, transfer learning can effectively apply prior knowledge obtained from a large source dataset/task to a small target dataset/task, improving prediction performance. RESULTS: To predict interactions between human and viral proteins, we combine evolutionary sequence profile features with a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and a multi-layer perceptron. Our architecture outperforms various feature encodings-based machine learning and state-of-the-art prediction methods. As our main contribution, we introduce two transfer learning methods (i.e. ‘frozen’ type and ‘fine-tuning’ type) that reliably predict interactions in a target human–virus domain based on training in a source human–virus domain, by retraining CNN layers. Finally, we utilize the ‘frozen’ type transfer learning approach to predict human–SARS-CoV-2 PPIs, indicating that our predictions are topologically and functionally similar to experimentally known interactions.

This study employed deep-learning convolutional neural networks to classify COVID-19 lung infections on pCXR from normal and related lung infections to potentially enable more timely and accurate diagnosis. This retrospect study employed deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning to classify based on pCXRs COVID-19 pneumonia (N = 455) on pCXR from normal (N = 532), bacterial pneumonia (N = 492), and non-COVID viral pneumonia (N = 552). The data was randomly split into 75% training and 25% testing, randomly. A five-fold cross-validation was used for the testing set separately. Performance was evaluated using receiver-operating curve analysis. Comparison was made with CNN operated on the whole pCXR and segmented lungs. CNN accurately classified COVID-19 pCXR from those of normal, bacterial pneumonia, and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients in a multiclass model. The overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.79, 0.93, and 0.79, 0.85 respectively (whole pCXR), and were 0.91, 0.93, 0.88, and 0.89 (CXR of segmented lung). The performance was generally better using segmented lungs. Heatmaps showed that CNN accurately localized areas of hazy appearance, ground glass opacity and/or consolidation on the pCXR. Deep-learning convolutional neural network with transfer learning accurately classifies COVID-19 on portable chest X-ray against normal, bacterial pneumonia or non-COVID viral pneumonia. This approach has the potential to help radiologists and frontline physicians by providing more timely and accurate diagnosis.","Kikkisetti, Shreeja; Zhu, Jocelyn; Shen, Beiyi; Li, Haifang; Duong, Tim Q.",PeerJ,532,1

According to the current reports, this is a situation when people need to be more careful and take the precaution measures more seriously, unless the condition may become even worse. Maintaining social distances and proper hygiene, staying at isolation or adopting the self-quarantine method are some of the common practices that people should use to avoid the infection. And the growing information regarding COVID-19 and its symptoms help the people to take proper precautions. In this present study, we consider an SEIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission which accounts for the effect of an individual’s behavioural response due to the information regarding proper precautions. Our results indicate that if people respond to the growing information regarding awareness at a higher rate and start to take the protective measures, then the infected population decreases significantly. The disease fatality can be controlled only if a large proportion of individuals become immune, either by natural immunity or by a proper vaccine. In order to apply the latter option, we need to wait until a safe and proper vaccine is developed and it is a time-taking process. Hence, in the latter part of the work, an optimal control problem is considered by implementing control strategies to reduce the disease burden. Numerical figures show that the control denoting behavioural response works with higher intensity immediately after implementation and then gradually decreases with time. Further, the control policy denoting hospitalisation of infected individuals works with its maximum intensity for quite a long time period following a sudden decrease. As, the implementation of the control strategies reduce the infected population and increase the recovered population, so, it may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current epidemic situation.","Saha, Sangeeta; Samanta, G.

AIM: To assess healthcare worker (HCW) perspectives on pre‐warning rapid response calls (RRC) with ‘Code‐95’ in announcements when attending to deteriorating or aggressive patients with suspected/confirmed COVID‐19 infection. METHODS: Design: prospective cross‐sectional single‐centre survey of HCW over a 3‐week period. Setting: tertiary public hospital. Participants: HCW caring for deteriorating or aggressive patients. Main outcome measures: the primary outcome was to assess HCW perspectives in attending Code‐95 calls. Secondary outcomes were to identify any differences related to craft group, age, experience or presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 297 responses was analysed; 86.7% of HCW (n = 257) attending Code‐95 calls reported anxiety. Medical staff reported greater anxiety in comparison to nursing staff (93.8% vs 78.5%; P = 0.002). Efferent team reported higher anxiety in contrast to afferent team (92.6% vs 58.8%; P = 0.021). There was no significant difference in perceived anxiety based on age (≤40 vs >40 years of age), years of experience (≤5 vs >5 years), comorbidities or mental illness; 54% reported concerns about adequacy of infection‐control policies and personal protective equipment; 45% were worried about inadequate training for responding to Code‐95 calls. CONCLUSIONS: Most surveyed HCW supported Code‐95 announcements pre‐warning them of potential COVID‐19 exposure when attending a RRC. However, the majority of HCW reported anxiety when attending these calls. Medical and efferent team HCW perceived greater anxiety compared to nursing and afferent team HCW. The Code‐95 system to pre‐warn rapid response teams may be a useful addition to protecting HCW from infectious diseases, although broader implementation will require greater resourcing, training and support.","Subramaniam, Ashwin; Zuberav, Alexandr; Wengritzky, Robert; Bowden, Christopher; Tiruvoipati, Ravindranath; Wang, Wei Chun; Wadhwa, Vikas",Intern Med J,532,20

Aim of this study was to videopolysomnographically evaluate sleep and sleep disorders after SARS-Cov2 infection. METHODS: Patients with suspected sleep disorders after acute COVID-19 underwent video-polysomnography (v-PSG) at the Sleep Disorders Clinic, Department of Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck. V-PSG was conducted 4.2 (SD = 1.3) months after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Eleven patients [nine men, age 52.5 (SD = 11.7) years; BMI 29 (SD = 5.2) kg/m(2)] were included. At 60 days follow-up after diagnosis, persisting breathing complaints were present in 7/11 (64%) patients. After v-PSG four patients (36%) were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Respiratory frequency during sleep was normal and no tachypnea, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, or periodic deep sighing were detected. Four patients (36%) showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA), and two additional patients showed an RWA index within the highest range of normality. CONCLUSION: We report videopolysomnographic findings in a series of eleven patients after acute COVID-19. A major finding of this study was the presence of isolated RWA, a recognized prodromal stage of RBD, in more than one third of the patients. Future videopolysomnographic investigations including quantification of RWA in patients after COVID-19 will give more insights into a possible acute or post-infectious CNS pathology related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Heidbreder, Anna; Sonnweber, Thomas; Stefani, Ambra; Ibrahim, Abubaker; Cesari, Matteo; Bergmann, Melanie; Brandauer, Elisabeth; Tancevski, Ivan; Löffler-Ragg, Judith; Högl, Birgit",Sleep Med,532,1
