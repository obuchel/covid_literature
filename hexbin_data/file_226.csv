694,Tissue Tropism and Target Cells of NSs-Deleted Rift Valley Fever Virus in Live Immunodeficient Mice,2011-12-06,"BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes disease in livestock and humans. It can be transmitted by mosquitoes, inhalation or physical contact with the body fluids of infected animals. Severe clinical cases are characterized by acute hepatitis with hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis and/or retinitis. The dynamics of RVFV infection and the cell types infected in vivo are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RVFV strains expressing humanized Renilla luciferase (hRLuc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated and inoculated to susceptible Ifnar1-deficient mice. We investigated the tissue tropism in these mice and the nature of the target cells in vivo using whole-organ imaging and flow cytometry. After intraperitoneal inoculation, hRLuc signal was observed primarily in the thymus, spleen and liver. Macrophages infiltrating various tissues, in particular the adipose tissue surrounding the pancreas also expressed the virus. The liver rapidly turned into the major luminescent organ and the mice succumbed to severe hepatitis. The brain remained weakly luminescent throughout infection. FACS analysis in RVFV-GFP-infected mice showed that the macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes were main target cells for RVFV. The crucial role of cells of the monocyte/macrophage/dendritic lineage during RVFV infection was confirmed by the slower viral dissemination, decrease in RVFV titers in blood, and prolonged survival of macrophage- and dendritic cell-depleted mice following treatment with clodronate liposomes. Upon dermal and nasal inoculations, the viral dissemination was primarily observed in the lymph node draining the injected ear and in the lungs respectively, with a significant increase in survival time. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal the high levels of phagocytic cells harboring RVFV during viral infection in Ifnar1-deficient mice. They demonstrate that bioluminescent and fluorescent viruses can shed new light into the pathogenesis of RVFV infection.","Gommet, Céline; Billecocq, Agnès; Jouvion, Grégory; Hasan, Milena; Zaverucha do Valle, Tânia; Guillemot, Laurent; Blanchet, Charlène; van Rooijen, Nico; Montagutelli, Xavier; Bouloy, Michèle; Panthier, Jean-Jacques",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3232203/,226

2010,Nucleobase but not Sugar Fidelity is Maintained in the Sabin I RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,2015-10-26,"The Sabin I poliovirus live, attenuated vaccine strain encodes for four amino acid changes (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E, and T362I) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have previously shown that the T362I substitution leads to a lower fidelity RdRp, and viruses encoding this variant are attenuated in a mouse model of poliovirus. Given these results, it was surprising that the nucleotide incorporation rate and nucleobase fidelity of the Sabin I RdRp is similar to that of wild-type enzyme, although the Sabin I RdRp is less selective against nucleotides with modified sugar groups. We suggest that the other Sabin amino acid changes (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E) help to re-establish nucleotide incorporation rates and nucleotide discrimination near wild-type levels, which may be a requirement for the propagation of the virus and its efficacy as a vaccine strain. These results also suggest that the nucleobase fidelity of the Sabin I RdRp likely does not contribute to viral attenuation.","Liu, Xinran; Musser, Derek M.; Lee, Cheri A.; Yang, Xiaorong; Arnold, Jamie J.; Cameron, Craig E.; Boehr, David D.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632402/,226

2356,Identification of RNA Binding Proteins Associated with Dengue Virus RNA in Infected Cells Reveals Temporally Distinct Host Factor Requirements,2016-08-24,"BACKGROUND: There are currently no vaccines or antivirals available for dengue virus infection, which can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever and death. A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction is required to develop effective therapies to treat DENV. In particular, very little is known about how cellular RNA binding proteins interact with viral RNAs. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Seventy-nine novel RNA binding proteins for dengue virus (DENV) were identified by cross-linking proteins to dengue viral RNA during a live infection in human cells. These cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus, suggesting a specialized role for these factors in DENV amplification. Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The method for identification of host factors described here is robust and broadly applicable to all RNA viruses, providing an avenue to determine the conserved or distinct mechanisms through which diverse viruses manage the viral RNA within cells. This study significantly increases the number of cellular factors known to interact with DENV and reveals how DENV modulates and usurps cellular proteins for efficient amplification.","Viktorovskaya, Olga V.; Greco, Todd M.; Cristea, Ileana M.; Thompson, Sunnie R.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4996428/,226
2425,Mechanistic Insight into the Host Transcription Inhibition Function of Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs and Its Importance in Virulence,2016-10-06,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae, causes periodic outbreaks in livestocks and humans in countries of the African continent and Middle East. RVFV NSs protein, a nonstructural protein, is a major virulence factor that exhibits several important biological properties. These include suppression of general transcription, inhibition of IFN-β promoter induction and degradation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R. Although each of these biological functions of NSs are considered important for countering the antiviral response in the host, the individual contributions of these functions towards RVFV virulence remains unclear. To examine this, we generated two RVFV MP-12 strain-derived mutant viruses. Each carried mutations in NSs that specifically targeted its general transcription inhibition function without affecting its ability to degrade PKR and inhibit IFN-β promoter induction, through its interaction with Sin3-associated protein 30, a part of the repressor complex at the IFN-β promoter. Using these mutant viruses, we have dissected the transcription inhibition function of NSs and examined its importance in RVFV virulence. Both NSs mutant viruses exhibited a differentially impaired ability to inhibit host transcription when compared with MP-12. It has been reported that NSs suppresses general transcription by interfering with the formation of the transcription factor IIH complex, through the degradation of the p62 subunit and sequestration of the p44 subunit. Our study results lead us to suggest that the ability of NSs to induce p62 degradation is the major contributor to its general transcription inhibition property, whereas its interaction with p44 may not play a significant role in this function. Importantly, RVFV MP-12-NSs mutant viruses with an impaired general transcription inhibition function showed a reduced cytotoxicity in cell culture and attenuated virulence in young mice, compared with its parental virus MP-12, highlighting the contribution of NSs-mediated general transcription inhibition towards RVFV virulence.","Terasaki, Kaori; Ramirez, Sydney I.; Makino, Shinji",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5053439/,226

Recently, several flaviviruses have been shown to interact with host protein synthesis. In order to determine whether TBEV interacts with this host process in its natural target cells, we analysed de novo protein synthesis in a human cell line derived from cerebellar medulloblastoma (DAOY HTB-186). We observed a significant decrease in the rate of host protein synthesis, including the housekeeping genes HPRT1 and GAPDH and the known interferon-stimulated gene viperin. In addition, TBEV infection resulted in a specific decrease of RNA polymerase I (POLR1) transcripts, 18S and 28S rRNAs and their precursor, 45-47S pre-rRNA, but had no effect on the POLR3 transcribed 5S rRNA levels.

4272,RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Speed and Fidelity are not the Only Determinants of the Mechanism or Efficiency of Recombination,2019-11-25,"Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the KH virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.","Kim, Hyejeong; Ellis, Victor D.; Woodman, Andrew; Zhao, Yan; Arnold, Jamie J.; Cameron, Craig E.",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947342/,226

Independent of infective dose within the range examined, the virulent isolate caused fatal clinical disease, whereas the avirulent isolate caused subclinical infection. The two isolates differed in rapidity of initial spread of infection and in the maximum virus titres in serum, but they both resulted in a similar low level persisting viraemia. Circulating virulent virus gradually became avirulent during the viraemia. Avirulent infection induced protective immunity to virulent challenge during the first week after primary infection, but full clinical protection was not established until after the fourth week. The findings, corrobated with other closely comparable observations, suggest that the emergence of PED as an intercurrent mortality problem during rabbit passage of pathogenicTreponema pallidum is the result of a specific selective pressure on a benign passenger virus. The expression of virulence of PEDV appears to be dependent on length of interval between passages.","Fennestad, K. L.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086705/,226

Transfer of the virus-binding MOLT-4#8 cells from 4°C to 37°C resulted in increased detection of the viral gp46 and p19 MA protein on the cells, which was, however, inhibited by 4°C or cytochalasin B treatment. These data showed that increased temperature and fluidity of the cell membrane were required for the increased detection of gp46 and p19 after viral adsorption. On the other hand, exposure of the p19 MA protein was not observed on the virus-treated U937 cells although gp46 was detected. This was not due to inefficient binding of the HTLV-I to the U937 cells, since the methanol-fixed cells were p19 MA protein-positive. MOLT-4#8 cells induced marked cell fusion when co-cultured with MT-2 cells, but U937 cells induced no fusion. All of these results indicated that these two cell lines differed in the property of plasma membrane in terms of degradation of HTLV-I envelope after viral adsorption.

5016,"Physico-chemical properties of murine hepatitis virus, strain A59",1987,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a widespread virus in beef and dairy herds. BVDV has been grouped into two genotypes, genotype 1 and genotype 2. In this study, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values and nucleotide content were investigated, and a comparative analysis of codon usage patterns for open reading frames (ORFs) of 22 BVDV genomes, including 14 of genotype 1 and 8 of genotype 2, was carried out. A high A+U content and low codon bias were found in BVDV genomes. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage between the two genotypes, and a geographic factor exists only in genotype-1 of BVDV. The RSCU data have a negative correlation with general average hydrophobicity (GRAVY), aromaticity and nucleotide content. Furthermore, the overall abundance of C and U has no effect on the synonymous codon usage patterns. In contrast, the A and G content showed a significant correlation with the nucleotide content at the third position. In addition, the codon usage patterns of BVDV are similar to those of 22 conserved genes of Bos taurus.

Multiplexing technologies, which allow for simultaneous detection of multiple nucleic acid sequences in a single reaction, can greatly reduce the time, cost and labor associated with single reaction detection technologies. METHODS: The Luminex® xMAP™ system is a multiplexed microsphere-based suspension array platform capable of analyzing and reporting up to 100 different reactions in a single reaction vessel. This technology provides a new platform for high-throughput nucleic acid detection and is being utilized with increasing frequency. Here we review specific applications of xMAP technology for nucleic acid detection in the areas of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, genetic disease screening, gene expression profiling, HLA DNA typing and microbial detection.

However, it is not clear whether curcumin and its derivatives can inhibit neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus. In this study, a meaningful 3D quantitative structure–activity relationship model (comparative molecular field analysis R(2) = 0.997, q(2) = 0.527, s = 0.064, F = 282.663) was built to understand the chemical–biological interactions between their activities and neuraminidase. Molecular docking was used to predict binding models between curcumin derivatives and neuraminidase. Real-time polymerase chain reactions showed that the five active curcumin derivatives might have direct effects on viral particle infectivity in H1N1-infected lung epithelial (MDCK) cells. Neuraminidase activation assay showed that five active curcumin derivatives decreased H1N1-induced neuraminidase activation in MDCK cells. Indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that two active curcumin derivatives (tetramethylcurcumin and curcumin) down-regulated the nucleoprotein expression. Curcumin inhibited IAV in vivo. The therapeutic mechanism of curcumin in the treatment of influenza viral pneumonia is related to improving the immune function of infected mice and regulating secretion of tumor necrosis-α, interleukin-6, and interferon-γ. These results indicate that curcumin derivatives inhibit IAV by blocking neuraminidase in the cellular model and curcumin also has anti-IAV activity in the animal model.","Lai, Yanni; Yan, Yiwen; Liao, Shanghui; Li, Yun; Ye, Yi; Liu, Ni; Zhao, Fang; Xu, Peiping",Arch Pharm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125423/,226
8617,Mouse hepatitis virus ORF 2a is expressed in the cytosol of infected mouse fibroblasts,2004-02-06,"The elucidation of the antigenic structure of the S glycoprotein of murine coronaviruses will provide further understanding of the Complex pathogenicity of these viruses. In order to identify linear antigenic determinants, the primary structure of the S glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus strain A59 was analyzed with a combination of nine epitope prediction algorithms. Fifteen potential epitopes were synthesized chemically and injected into BALB/c mice to study their biological relevance. This approach failed to identify novel important epitopes. Furthermore, the algorithms were unable to identify as antigenic the previously mapped immunodominant epitope A [C Daniel, R. Anderson, M. J. Buchmeier, J. O. Fleming, W. J. M. Spaan, H. Wege, and Talbot, P. J. (1993) J. Virol. 67, 1185-1194]. Interestingly, peptide A coupled to KLH induced an immune response that stimulated the immune response induced by the corresponding region of the protein much more accurately than when the same peptide was coupled to BSA. This included drastically enhanced competition with monoclonal antibodies and protection from virus challenge. These findings emphasize the shortcomings of amino acid sequence-based epitope prediction algorithms and demonstrate the critical importance of the carrier when synthetic peptides are considered as potential vaccines.","Daniel, Claude; Lacroix, Martial; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131057/,226

42342,Rational Drug Design and Docking of the RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase Domain of NCoV,2020-09-27,"BACKGROUND: Neoantigen-based personal vaccines and adoptive T cell immunotherapy have shown high efficacy as a cancer treatment in clinical trials. Algorithms for the accurate prediction of neoantigens have played a pivotal role in such studies. Some existing bioinformatics methods, such as MHCflurry and NetMHCpan, identify neoantigens mainly through the prediction of peptide-MHC binding affinity. However, the predictive accuracy of immunogenicity of these methods has been shown to be low. Thus, a ranking algorithm to select highly immunogenic neoantigens of patients is needed urgently in research and clinical practice. RESULTS: We develop TruNeo, an integrated computational pipeline to identify and select highly immunogenic neoantigens based on multiple biological processes. The performance of TruNeo and other algorithms were compared based on data from published literature as well as raw data from a lung cancer patient. Recall rate of immunogenic ones among the top 10-ranked neoantigens were compared based on the published combined data set. Recall rate of TruNeo was 52.63%, which was 2.5 times higher than that predicted by MHCflurry (21.05%), and 2 times higher than NetMHCpan 4 (26.32%). Furthermore, the positive rate of top 10-ranked neoantigens for the lung cancer patient were compared, showing a 50% positive rate identified by TruNeo, which was 2.5 times higher than that predicted by MHCflurry (20%). CONCLUSIONS: TruNeo, which considers multiple biological processes rather than peptide-MHC binding affinity prediction only, provides prioritization of candidate neoantigens with high immunogenicity for neoantigen-targeting personalized immunotherapies.","Tang, Yunxia; Wang, Yu; Wang, Jiaqian; Li, Miao; Peng, Linmin; Wei, Guochao; Zhang, Yixing; Li, Jin; Gao, Zhibo",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672179/,226

The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge in delivering in-person IPE training. Here we describe adaptations and student outcomes with our Spring/Summer 2020 training sessions. Students (n=46) from health profession programs were recruited and enrolled in the sessions. A LTC partner helped plan two-hour remote training sessions to introduce students to current issues and health care team member roles in LTC. Moderated small group discussions regarding the 4 Ms Framework and a patient case were completed using virtual breakout rooms. A shared virtual document was used to guide discussions and record insights. Student participants (n=46) were primarily White (85%), female (70%), and enrolled in physical therapy (28%), nutrition (33%), and medicine (15%) programs. Thirty-one students completed post-course satisfaction surveys with Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Most students who completed the survey agreed or strongly agreed that the course was effective (85%) and engaging (81%), and will improve care (88%). Positive course aspects included: comprehensive information with speaker experiences and use of 4 Ms; course structure with moderated small groups; and interprofessional collaboration with common goals and multiple perspectives. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, an IPE experience was effectively delivered using video conferencing technology, community collaboration, and moderated small group discussions. The successes of this IPE delivery model will enhance engagement and accessibility of future gerontological workforce training.","Hebdon, Megan Thomas; Wilson, Christina; Carney, Katherine Bernier; Telonidis, Jacqueline; Chase-Cantarini, Sue",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742178/,226

METHODS Survey of hospital doctors working on the acute medical wards of a UK NHS teaching hospital. RESULTS 171/200 (86%) of eligible doctors participated. 165 had experience of DNACPR discussions with older inpatients and/or their families and were included in our analysis. 'Difficulty' (defined as finding discussions 'fairly difficult' or 'difficult') was experienced by 52/165 (32%) for discussions with patients and 60/165 (36%) for discussions with families. Doctors with specific training in DNACPR discussions were less likely to have difficulty in discussions with patients. Older, more experienced doctors were less likely to have difficulty in discussions with families. Lack of time and place, and uncertainty about prognosis were the most frequently reported causes of difficulty. CONCLUSIONS Many doctors have difficulty in DNACPR discussions. Training needs to include managing discussions with families, as well as with patients, and doctors need time and space to deliver this important part of their job.","Walker, Jane; Burke, Katy; Magill, Nicholas; van Niekerk, Maike; Wanat, Marta; Hobbs, Harriet; Rocroi, Isabelle; Frost, Chris; Sharpe, Michael",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-003151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34261766/,226

METHODS We used data from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) trial and assessed severity of WML on baseline non-contrast CT imaging (NCCT; n = 473) according to the Van Swieten Scale. Post-stroke functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We investigated the association of WML with functional outcome using ordinal logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and other relevant cardiovascular and prognostic risk factors. In addition, an interaction term between treatment allocation and WML severity was used to assess treatment effect modification by WML. RESULTS We found an independent negative association between more severe WML and functional outcome (acOR 0.77 [95% CI 0.66-0.90]). Patients with absent to moderate WML had similar benefit of EVT on functional outcome (acOR 1.93 [95% CI 1.31-2.84]) as patients with severe WML (acOR 1.95 [95% CI 0.90-4.20]). No treatment effect modification of WML was found (p for interaction = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS We found that more severe WML predict poor functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke, but do not modify effect of EVT. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE Prognostic accuracy.

Among chronically ill patients, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is reported to be widespread. However, extremely little is known about the use of CAM by SARS survivors in the post-SARS period and even less is known about how the use of CAM is related to the unpleasant social and medical-treatment experiences of SARS survivors, their eagerness to re-establish social networks, and their awareness to prepare for future epidemics. OBJECTIVE To investigate the motivations for practising tai chi among SARS survivors in post-SARS Hong Kong. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Using a qualitative approach, I conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 35 SARS survivors, who were purposively sampled from a tai chi class of a SARS-patient self-help group in Hong Kong. RESULTS Health concerns and social experiences motivated the participants to practise tai chi in post-SARS Hong Kong. Experiencing health deterioration in relation to SARS-associated sequelae, coping with unpleasant experiences during follow-up biomedical treatments, a desire to regain an active role in recovery and rehabilitation, overcoming SARS-associated stigmas by establishing a new social network and preparing for potential future stigmatization and discrimination were the key motivators for them.

Understanding the prognosis of a condition is an important component of clinical decision-making and can help guide the prevention of long-term disabilities of patients with mTBI. Several studies and systematic reviews have been conducted in order to understand prognosis of chronic symptoms following mTBI. We aim to synthesize evidence from systematic reviews on factors that affect the risk of persistent symptoms in mTBI-affected adults. METHODS We will conduct an overview of systematic reviews following steps described in the Cochrane Handbook. We will search in Cochrane, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Epistemonikos for systematic reviews about the prognosis of persistent symptoms following mTBI in the adult population. Two reviewers will independently screen all references and then select eligible reviews based on eligibility criteria. A data extraction grid will be used to extract relevant information. The risk of bias in the included reviews will be assessed using the ROBIS tool. Data will be synthesized into a comprehensive conceptual model in order to have a better understanding of the predictive factors of post-concussion symptoms following mTBI. DISCUSSION Results will help multiple stakeholders, such as clinicians and rehabilitation program managers, to understand the prognosis of long-term consequences following mTBI.

The ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic has provided an unparalleled opportunity to test interventions with the most up-to-date simulations. METHODS To assist the Allegheny County Health Department during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the University of Pittsburgh Models of Infectious Disease Agents Study group employed an agent-based computer simulation model (ABM) of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to explore the effects of various school closure strategies on mitigating influenza epidemics of different reproductive rates (R0). RESULTS Entire school system closures were not more effective than individual school closures. Any type of school closure may need to be maintained throughout most of the epidemic (ie, at least 8 weeks) to have any significant effect on the overall serologic attack rate. In fact, relatively short school closures (ie, 2 weeks or less) may actually slightly increase the overall attack rate by returning susceptible students back into schools in the middle of the epidemic. Varying the illness threshold at which school closures are triggered did not seem to have substantial impact on the effectiveness of school closures, suggesting that short delays in closing schools should not cause concern. CONCLUSIONS School closures alone may not be able to quell an epidemic but, when maintained for at least 8 weeks, could delay the epidemic peak for up to a week, providing additional time to implement a second more effective intervention such as vaccination.","Lee, Bruce Y; Brown, Shawn T; Cooley, Philip; Potter, Maggie A; Wheaton, William D; Voorhees, Ronald E; Stebbins, Samuel; Grefenstette, John J; Zimmer, Shanta M; Zimmerman, Richard K; Assi, Tina-Marie; Bailey, Rachel R; Wagener, Diane K; Burke, Donald S",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0b013e3181ce594e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20035236/,226

METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search of electronic databases and grey literature will include paediatric interventional studies (random controlled trials, cohort studies) with and without a comparison group. Two reviewers will independently undertake the two step process of title/abstract and full-text screening. Data will be extracted and assessed, with aggregate data being reported. When the data allow, meta-analysis will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION There are no ethical concerns with this systematic review, as data have previously been published. This review will inform clinicians taking care of children with OSA and obesity/metabolic syndrome about the potential effects of NIV therapies on metabolic markers and has the potential to change the approach to childhood OSA and obesity. Results of this systematic review will be submitted for dissemination in abstract and manuscript form.","Gerdung, Christopher; Rodriguez-Lopez, Sara; Palkowski, Stefan; Keto-Lambert, Diana; Sebastianski, Meghan; Castro Codesal, Maria Luisa",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830118/,226
90707,Organ-specific attenuation of murine hepatitis virus strain A59 by replacement of catalytic residues in the putative viral cyclic phosphodiesterase ns2.,2009,"BACKGROUND Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. We sought to quantify the importance of potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke in different regions of the world, and in key populations and primary pathological subtypes of stroke. METHODS We completed a standardised international case-control study in 32 countries in Asia, America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. Cases were patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days of symptom onset and 72 h of hospital admission). Controls were hospital-based or community-based individuals with no history of stroke, and were matched with cases, recruited in a 1:1 ratio, for age and sex. All participants completed a clinical assessment and were requested to provide blood and urine samples. Odds ratios (OR) and their population attributable risks (PARs) were calculated, with 99% confidence intervals. FINDINGS Between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015, 26 919 participants were recruited from 32 countries (13 447 cases [10 388 with ischaemic stroke and 3059 intracerebral haemorrhage] and 13 472 controls). Previous history of hypertension or blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher (OR 2·98, 99% CI 2·72-3·28; PAR 47·9%, 99% CI 45·1-50·6), regular physical activity (0·60, 0·52-0·70; 35·8%, 27·7-44·7), apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratio (1·84, 1·65-2·06 for highest vs lowest tertile; 26·8%, 22·2-31·9 for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), diet (0·60, 0·53-0·67 for highest vs lowest tertile of modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index [mAHEI]; 23·2%, 18·2-28·9 for lowest two tertiles vs highest tertile of mAHEI), waist-to-hip ratio (1·44, 1·27-1·64 for highest vs lowest tertile; 18·6%, 13·3-25·3 for top two tertiles vs lowest), psychosocial factors (2·20, 1·78-2·72; 17·4%, 13·1-22·6), current smoking (1·67, 1·49-1·87; 12·4%, 10·2-14·9), cardiac causes (3·17, 2·68-3·75; 9·1%, 8·0-10·2), alcohol consumption (2·09, 1·64-2·67 for high or heavy episodic intake vs never or former drinker; 5·8%, 3·4-9·7 for current alcohol drinker vs never or former drinker), and diabetes mellitus (1·16, 1·05-1·30; 3·9%, 1·9-7·6) were associated with all stroke. Collectively, these risk factors accounted for 90·7% of the PAR for all stroke worldwide (91·5% for ischaemic stroke, 87·1% for intracerebral haemorrhage), and were consistent across regions (ranging from 82·7% in Africa to 97·4% in southeast Asia), sex (90·6% in men and in women), and age groups (92·2% in patients aged ≤55 years, 90·0% in patients aged >55 years). We observed regional variations in the importance of individual risk factors, which were related to variations in the magnitude of ORs (rather than direction, which we observed for diet) and differences in prevalence of risk factors among regions. Hypertension was more associated with intracerebral haemorrhage than with ischaemic stroke, whereas current smoking, diabetes, apolipoproteins, and cardiac causes were more associated with ischaemic stroke (p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION Ten potentially modifiable risk factors are collectively associated with about 90% of the PAR of stroke in each major region of the world, among ethnic groups, in men and women, and in all ages. However, we found important regional variations in the relative importance of most individual risk factors for stroke, which could contribute to worldwide variations in frequency and case-mix of stroke. Our findings support developing both global and region-specific programmes to prevent stroke.

Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..","Barua, Lingkan; Zaman, Muhammed Shahriar; Omi, Fardina Rahman; Faruque, Mithila",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27189.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447383/,226
109966,Rapid detection of porcine deltacoronavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus using the duplex recombinase polymerase amplification method.,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND Analyses of the effectiveness of infectious disease control interventions often rely on dynamic transmission models to simulate intervention effects. We aim to understand how the choice of network or compartmental model can influence estimates of intervention effectiveness in the short and long term for an endemic disease with susceptible and infected states in which infection, once contracted, is lifelong. METHODS We consider 4 disease models with different permutations of socially connected network versus unstructured contact (mass-action mixing) model and heterogeneous versus homogeneous disease risk. The models have susceptible and infected populations calibrated to the same long-term equilibrium disease prevalence. We consider a simple intervention with varying levels of coverage and efficacy that reduces transmission probabilities. We measure the rate of prevalence decline over the first 365 d after the intervention, long-term equilibrium prevalence, and long-term effective reproduction ratio at equilibrium. RESULTS Prevalence declined up to 10% faster in homogeneous risk models than heterogeneous risk models. When the disease was not eradicated, the long-term equilibrium disease prevalence was higher in mass-action mixing models than in network models by 40% or more. This difference in long-term equilibrium prevalence between network versus mass-action mixing models was greater than that of heterogeneous versus homogeneous risk models (less than 30%); network models tended to have higher effective reproduction ratios than mass-action mixing models for given combinations of intervention coverage and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS For interventions with high efficacy and coverage, mass-action mixing models could provide a sufficient estimate of effectiveness, whereas for interventions with low efficacy and coverage, or interventions in which outcomes are measured over short time horizons, predictions from network and mass-action models diverge, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analyses on model structure. HIGHLIGHTS • We calibrate 4 models-socially connected network versus unstructured contact (mass-action mixing) model and heterogeneous versus homogeneous disease risk-to 10% preintervention disease prevalence.• We measure the short- and long-term intervention effectiveness of all models using the rate of prevalence decline, long-term equilibrium disease prevalence, and effective reproduction ratio.• Generally, in the short term, prevalence declined faster in the homogeneous risk models than in the heterogeneous risk models.• Generally, in the long term, equilibrium disease prevalence was higher in the mass-action mixing models than in the network models, and the effective reproduction ratio was higher in network models than in the mass-action mixing models.","Malloy, Giovanni S P; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D; Enns, Eva A; Brandeau, Margaret L",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211006025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899563/,226

Patients may tolerate the placement and maintenance of an SGA at a lower dose of anesthetic than that needed for an endotracheal tube; neuromuscular blocking agents are rarely necessary for airway management with an SGA; the incidence of airway morbidity is lower with SGAs than with endotracheal tubes; and SGAs may facilitate faster recovery and earlier discharge of patients.

DESIGN A two-group randomized control trial with 1,402 male and female students in grades 9 through 11 from 14 secondary schools in Toronto, Canada. Participants were randomly assigned to a tailored Web-assisted tobacco intervention or an interactive control condition task conducted during a single classroom session with e-mail follow-up. The cornerstone of the intervention was a five-stage interactive Web site called the Smoking Zine (http://www.smokingzine.org) integrated into a program that included a paper-based journal, a small group form of motivational interviewing, and tailored e-mails. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Resistance to smoking, behavioral intentions to smoke, and cigarette use were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and three- and six-month follow-up. Multilevel logistic growth modeling was used to assess the effect of the intervention on change over time. RESULTS The integrated Smoking Zine program helped smokers significantly reduce the likelihood of having high intentions to smoke and increased their likelihood of high resistance to continued cigarette use at 6 months. The intervention also significantly reduced the likelihood of heavy cigarette use adoption by nonsmokers during the study period. CONCLUSION The Smoking Zine intervention provided cessation motivation for smokers most resistant to quitting at baseline and prevented nonsmoking adolescents from becoming heavy smokers at 6 months. By providing an accessible and attractive method of engaging young people in smoking prevention and cessation, this interactive and integrated program provides a novel vehicle for school- and population-level health promotion.","Norman, Cameron D; Maley, Oonagh; Li, Xiaoqiang; Skinner, Harvey A","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",https://doi.org/10.1037/a0013105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19025276/,226

Poor solution behavior, which manifests as high solution viscosity or opalescence, profoundly affects the developability of mAb drugs. Using a diverse dataset of 59 mAbs, including 43 approved products, and an array of molecular descriptors spanning colloidal, conformational, charge-based, hydrodynamic, and hydrophobic properties, we show that poor solution behavior is prevalent (>30%) in mAbs and is singularly predicted (>90%) by the diffusion interaction parameter (k D), a dilute-solution measure of colloidal self-interaction. No other descriptor, individually or in combination, was found to be as effective as k D. We also show that well-behaved mAbs, a substantial subset of which bear high positive charge and pI, present no disadvantages with respect to pharmacokinetics in humans.

In this review, we focused on researching the potentiality of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. Our research review includes antibody-based immunotherapy, using human monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral protein regions, specifically the spike protein regions, and using hyper-immune plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients, in which monoclonal antibodies act as immunotherapy for the cytokine storm syndrome associated with the covid-19 infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven consecutive patients with enhancing solid renal masses suitable for treatment with RPN between September 2013 and January 2014 were included in the analysis. Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Preoperative patient characteristics, intraoperative surgical parameters including patient body temperature and ipsilateral kidney temperature with real-time monitoring, and short-term functional outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Median age was 55 years (range, 39-75 years) and American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 3 (range, 2-4). Median tumor size was 4 cm (range, 2.3-7.1) and RENAL nephrometry score was 9 (range, 5-11). One patient had a solitary kidney. During cooling, the lowest median renal parenchymal temperature was 17.05°C (range, 11°C-26°C) and cold ischemia time was 27.17 minutes (range, 18-49 minutes). Median time to latest postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate was 12 days (range, 2-30 days). Median glomerular filtration rate preservation was 81% (range, 47.9%-126%). There was one positive margin. There were no postoperative complications, and no patients experienced a prolonged ileus. The limitations of this study include a small number of patients and short-term follow-up. CONCLUSION RPN with renal hypothermia using intracorporeal ice slush is technically feasible.

Generally, mutations in the VWF gene lead to loss of hemostatic activity and thus the bleeding disorder von Willebrand Disease. By employing cone and platelet aggregometry and microfluidic assays, we uncovered a platelet glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa-dependent prothrombotic gain-of-function (GOF) for variant p.Pro2555Arg, located in the C4-domain, leading to an increase in platelet aggregate size. We performed complementary biophysical and structural investigations using circular dichroism spectra, small angle X-ray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations on the single C4-domain and dimeric wildtype and p.Pro2555Arg constructs. C4-p.Pro2555Arg retained the overall structural conformation with minor populations of alternative conformations exhibiting increased hinge flexibility and slow conformational exchange. The dimeric protein becomes disordered and more flexible. Our data suggest that the GOF is not affecting the binding affinity of the C4-domain for GPIIb/IIIa. Instead, the increased VWF dimer flexibility enhances temporal accessibility of platelet binding sites. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we revealed that p.Pro2555Arg is the first VWF variant, which increases platelet aggregate size and show a shear-dependent function of the VWF stem region, which can become hyperactive through mutations. Prothrombotic GOF variants of VWF are a novel concept of a VWF-associated pathomechanism of thromboembolic events, which is of general interest to vascular health but which is not yet considered in diagnostics. Thus, awareness should be raised for the risk they pose. Furthermore, our data implicate the C4-domain as a novel anti-thrombotic drug target.","Huck, Volker; Chen, Po-Chia; Xu, Emma-Ruoqi; Tischer, Alexander; Klemm, Ulrike; Aponte-Santamaría, Camilo; Mess, Christian; Obser, Tobias; Kutzki, Fabian; König, Gesa; Denis, Cecile; Gräter, Frauke; Wilmanns, Matthias; Auton, Matthew; Schneider, Stefan Werner; Schneppenheim, Reinhard; Hennig, Janosch; Brehm, Maria Alexandra",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1344-4405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385180/,226

However, the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy typically associated with high cholesterol levels in metabolically unhealthy nonobesity (MUNO) remains unclear. We investigated whether cholesterol-generated LysoPCs contribute to cardiomyopathy and the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitor in cholesterol-induced MUNO. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Cholesterol diet was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats that were fed either regular chow (C), or high cholesterol chow (HC), or HC diet with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) for 12 weeks. LysoPCs levels were subsequently measured in rats and in MUNO human patients. The effects of cholesterol-mediated LysoPCs on cardiac injury, and the action of cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3, were further assessed in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. KEY RESULTS HC and HCF rats fed cholesterol diets demonstrated a MUNO-phenotype and cholesterol-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Upregulated levels of LysoPCs were found in rat myocardium and the plasma in MUNO human patients. Further testing in H9C2 cardiomyocytes revealed that cholesterol-induced atrophy and death of cardiomyocytes was due to mitochondrial dysfunction and conditions favoring DCM (i.e. reduced mRNA expression of ANF, BNP, DSP, and atrogin-1), and that AACOCF3 counteracted the cholesterol-induced DCM phenotype. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Cholesterol-induced MUNO-DCM phenotype was counteracted by cPLA2 inhibitor, which is potentially useful for the treatment of LysoPCs-associated DCM in MUNO.","Huang, Jiung-Pang; Cheng, Mei-Ling; Wang, Chao-Hung; Huang, Shiang-Suo; Hsieh, Po-Shiuan; Chang, Chih-Chun; Kuo, Chao-Yu; Chen, Kuan-Hsing; Hung, Li-Man",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942017/,226
165267,Inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from SARSCoV-2 by compounds in Vangag herbal preparation: an in silico evaluation,2020,"This paper provides an optimized cable path planning solution for a tree-topology network in an irregular 2D manifold in a 3D Euclidean space, with an application to the planning of submarine cable networks. Our solution method is based on total cost minimization, where the individual cable costs are assumed to be linear to the length of the corresponding submarine cables subject to latency constraints between pairs of nodes. These latency constraints limit the cable length and number of hops between any pair of nodes. Our method combines the Fast Marching Method (FMM) and a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) where there are constraints between pairs of nodes. We note that this problem of MST with constraints is NP-complete. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that ILP running time is adequate for the great majority of existing cable systems. For cable systems for which ILP is not able to find the optimal solution within an acceptable time, we propose an alternative heuristic algorithm based on Prim's algorithm. In addition, we apply our FMM/ILP-based algorithm to a real-world cable path planning example and demonstrate that it can effectively find an MST with latency constraints between pairs of nodes.","Wang, Tianjiao; Wang, Zengfu; Moran, Bill; Zukerman, Moshe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14380v1.pdf,226
166748,"Structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from 2019-nCoV, a major antiviral drug target",2020-04-09,"Like most university students worldwide, the engineering students at the School of Information Sciences (ESI) have to deal with their school closure and the new paradigm of distance learning. Despite efforts made by the administration and the teachers to accompany students, an internal survey conducted by the end of October 2021 revealed that almost all students, especially first-year ones, did not accept distance learning. This paper describes our experience to improve students’ satisfaction with distance learning by involving them in their courses’ design process. Four courses were concerned by the experience and were designed following the ADDIE method. Last-year students participated in the ADDIE analysis step, while the first-year students participated in the last step by evaluating the co-created courses. Courses were co-created with students as most of them got involved in the ADDIE development step and enriched courses by realizing extras activities. Results showed that students were highly satisfied with courses taught in the context of this study. © 2021 by the authors.","Imane, R.",International Journal of Information and Education Technology,https://doi.org/10.18178/ijiet.2021.11.9.1543,226
172210,Enhancing the Antiviral Efficacy of RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibition by Combination with Modulators of Pyrimidine Metabolism,2020-03-25,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that has forced governments around the world to implement large-scale interventions such as school closures and national lockdowns. Previous research has shown that partisanship plays a major role in explaining public attitudes towards these policies and beliefs about the intensity of the crisis. However, it remains unclear whether and how partisan differences in policy support relate to partisan gaps in beliefs about the number of deaths that the pandemic will cause. Do individuals who forecast fewer COVID-19 deaths show less agreement with preventive measures? How does partisanship correlate with people’s beliefs about the intensity of the crisis and their support for COVID-19 policies? Here, we sought to answer these questions by performing a behavioral experiment in Argentina (Experiment 1, N = 640) and three quasi-replication studies in Uruguay (Experiment 2, N = 372), Brazil (Experiment 3, N = 353) and the United States (Experiment 4, N = 630). In all settings, participants forecasted the number of COVID-19 deaths in their country after considering either a high or low number, and then rated their agreement with a series of interventions. This anchoring procedure, which experimentally induced a large variability in the forecasted number of deaths, did not modify policy preferences. Instead, each experiment provided evidence that partisanship was a key indicator of the optimism of forecasts and the degree of support for COVID-19 policies. Remarkably, we found that the number of forecasted deaths was robustly uncorrelated with participants’ agreement with preventive measures designed to prevent those deaths. We discuss these empirical observations in the light of recently proposed theories of tribal partisan behavior. Moreover, we argue that these results may inform policy making as they suggest that even the most effective communication strategy focused on alerting the public about the severity of the pandemic would probably not translate into greater support for COVID-19 preventive measures.","Freira, Lucia Sartorio Marco Boruchowicz Cynthia Lopez Boo Florencia Navajas Joaquin",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00870-2,226
175496,Potential Inhibition of COVID-19 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase by Hepatitis C Virus Non-nucleoside Inhibitors: An In-silico Perspective,2021,"We evaluated the effectiveness of 11 face coverings for material filtration efficiency, inward protection efficiency on a manikin, and outward protection efficiency on a manikin. At the most penetrating particle size, the vacuum bag, microfiber cloth, and surgical mask had material filtration efficiencies >50%, while the other materials had much lower filtration efficiencies. However, these efficiencies increased rapidly with particle size, and many materials had efficiencies >50% at 2 m and >75% at 5 m. The vacuum bag performed best, with efficiencies of 54-96% for all three metrics, depending on particle size. The thin acrylic and face shield performed worst. Inward protection efficiency and outward protection efficiency were similar for many masks; the two efficiencies diverged for stiffer materials and those worn more loosely (e.g., bandana) or more tightly (e.g., wrapped around the head) compared to a standard earloop mask. Discrepancies between material filtration efficiency and inward/outward protection efficiency indicated that the fit of the mask was important. We calculated that the particle size most likely to deposit in the respiratory tract when wearing a mask is ~2 m. Based on these findings, we recommend a three-layer mask consisting of outer layers of a flexible, tightly woven fabric and an inner layer consisting of a material designed to filter out particles. This combination should produce an overall efficiency of >70% at the most penetrating particle size and >90% for particles 1 m and larger if the mask fits well.","Pan, J.; Harb, C.; Leng, W.; Marr, L.

The pandemic also resulted in job losses as a result of lengthy shutdowns, which burdened the global economy. Even though significant clinical research progress has led to a better perceiving of the virus ( SARS-CoV-2) nature and the disease (COVID-19) management, preventing the virus's spread has become a major concern as SARSCoV-2 continues to wreak havoc around the world. Several countries suffered from the second or third wave of viral disease outbreaks, primarily caused by the mutation of SARS-CoV-2. Imaging is critical in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with new coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). The primary imaging modality in clinically suspected cases is CT scan and it is useful for monitoring imaging changes following therapy. Therefore, CT is regarded as a useful diagnostic technique for clinically suspected cases of COVID-19. CT has the ability to detect patients who have a negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) but are highly suspicious of NCIP in terms of clinical problems. In addition, the results of a CT scan may also reveal information concerning the severity of the condition. In this review article, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is discussed and CT characteristics are defined based on the newest research for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.","El-Kenawy, H.

I investigate public support for the lockdown policy in Spain, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic and with the strictest lockdown in Europe. Based on survey data collected during the first weeks of April and May 2020, I analyse how public support for the lockdown relates to the number of confirmed cases in the province of residence, personal institutional trust and concern about the severity of coronavirus.

In response, athletes, coaches, managers, and other change agents with institutional power in sport organisations across the globe have begun to utilise their platforms to champion social justice generally, and racial justice in particular, in solidarity. Historically, in concert with trends in neoliberal and neocolonial hegemonic societies, sport has reproduced various oppressive ideologies, discourses, and systems grounded in racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia and related systemically oppressive forces. Given the visibility of sport in the global marketplace, racialized groups have used sport as a site of resistance and activism for social justice. Since the athlete activist has re-emerged as an important change agent in the public consciousness, an increasing number of supporters holding privileged identities, within and beyond sport, have backed social justice movements through their allyship. However, scholarship has focussed largely on the allyship of athletes. Perhaps more problematically, the ambiguity of allyship has resulted in instances of decentring the core targets or victims of oppressive systems, who are best positioned to lead social movements. In an effort to cultivate a deeper understanding of allyship and how allies can optimise social movements, the purpose of this conceptual paper is to call for more intentional, critically reflexive, and culturally conscious allyship that is reflective of a transformation of allyship from reactive advocacy to proactive activism for long-term substantive gains. The authors posit that transformational allyship is allyship as activism on both individual and institutional levels. Allyship as activism should consist of intentionality to centre the core targets and victims of oppression, critical reflexivity of the relationship between ally and core activist, the presence of a clear opposition, a challenge or disruption to hegemonic systems, and a connection to a broader social movement. Implications for coaches, administrators, sport managers, and athletes are discussed. © 2021 European Association for Sociology of Sport.","Jolly, S.; Cooper, J.

184678,Mitochondrial aconitase binds to the 3' untranslated region of the mouse hepatitis virus genome.,2001,"Purpose This paper aims to analyse the main variables and causal relationships in the system structure of the diversification of non-agricultural activities on agricultural holdings using system dynamics (SD) modelling. The SD model aims to simulate depictions of the behaviour of the real system while testing the effects of alternative decisions over time. Design/methodology/approach An SD methodology was chosen to model diversification in farm tourism. Findings A system approach increases the authors' understanding of the transition of agricultural holdings to farm tourism. The results indicate that the transition to farm tourism depends on the level of tourism development in a certain area. The system is influenced by subsidies allocated by authorities to expand primary agricultural activities. The model describes a situation in which the tourism and agricultural industries have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications The research is limited by the small set of available data due to the limited number of farms in Slovenia. One major problem is the difference in statistical data on the same activity collected from different institutions in Slovenia. Practical implications The paper includes implications for understanding the transition process to farm tourism, allowing policymakers to experiment with subsidies and promotion to explore the efficacy and efficiency of proposed policies. Originality/value This study provides a structured, systemic view of the diversification of non-agricultural activities on agricultural holdings, where the simulation results are a reliable reflection of the behaviour of the actual system being modelled.","Zibert, M.; Prevolsek, B.; Pazek, K.; Rozman, C.; Skraba, A.",Kybernetes,https://doi.org/10.1108/k-04-2021-0254,226
184810,The versatility of paramyxovirus RNA polymerase stuttering.,1999,"Spontaneous mediastinal emphysema (ME) is a rare clinical entity often associated with sudden changes in intrathoracic pressures. The presumed pathophysiological mechanism is diffuse alveolar injury leading to alveolar rupture and air leak. Inflammatory alterations installed over the airway following SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce its distensibility and compliance conferring an increased risk of developing the complication, even in the absence of mechanical ventilation. However, the exact mechanism by which ME occurs in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is unknown. We report a case of a 58-year-old man that presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection. There was no smoking history and no lung comorbidities. The patient was admitted into a monitored unit and received management accordingly (having never required mechanical intubation). During chest radiological evaluation ME was found and ultimately resolved with noninvasive maneuvers. We want to emphasize the importance of this adverse event despite their non-smoking history and the exclusion of positive pressure ventilation. Given the recent increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia, the presence of pneumomediastinum in patients with COVID-19 infection should alert the clinician to monitor the patients carefully for possible worsening of disease, especially when lung lesions are severe. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

We compared the presentation characteristics and outcomes of people with and without HIV hospitalised with COVID-19 at 207 centres across the United Kingdom. Methods. We analysed data from people with laboratory confirmed or highly likely COVID-19 enrolled into the ISARIC CCP-UK study. The primary endpoint was day-28 mortality after presentation. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression to describe the association with HIV status after adjustment for sex, ethnicity, age, indeterminate/probable hospital acquisition of COVID-19 (definite hospital acquisition excluded), presentation date, and presence/absence of ten comorbidities. We additionally adjusted for disease severity at presentation as defined by hypoxia/oxygen therapy. Findings. Among 47,539 patients, 115 (0.24%) had confirmed HIV-positive status and 103/115 (89.6%) had a record of antiretroviral therapy. At presentation, relative to the HIV-negative group, HIV-positive people were younger (median 55 versus 74 years; p<0.001), had a higher prevalence of obesity and moderate/severe liver disease, higher lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein, and more systemic symptoms. The cumulative incidence of day-28 mortality was 25.2% in the HIV-positive group versus 32.1% in the HIV-negative group (p=0.12); however, stratification for age revealed a higher mortality among HIV-positive people aged below 60 years. The effect of HIV-positive status was confirmed in adjusted analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-2.25; p=0.06). Following additional adjustment for disease severity at presentation, mortality was higher in HIV-positive people (adjusted HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.07-2.48; p=0.02). In the HIV-positive group, mortality was more common among those who were slightly older and among people with obesity and diabetes with complications. Interpretation. HIV-positive status may be associated with an increased risk of day-28 mortality following a COVID-19 related hospitalisation.","Geretti, Anna Maria; Stockdale, Alexander; Kelly, Sophie; Cevik, Muge; Collins, Simon; Waters, Laura; Villa, Giovanni; Docherty, Annemarie B; Harrison, Ewen M; Turtle, Lance; Openshaw, Peter JM; Baillie, Kenneth; Sabin, Caroline; Semple, Malcolm Gracie",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170449,226

Methods: The online snowball research sampling method was used to collect data, and 1129 subjects participated in the study. As data collection tools, the Fear of COVID-19 scale, Trait Anxiety Scale, and Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. In the adaptation and validation process of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, confirmatory factor analysis was applied. Convergent validity of the model resulting from CFA was evaluated with Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and Composite Reliability (CR) based on the factor load values. The reliability of the scale was assessed with Cronbach's alpha method. Independent samples t-test and Two-Way ANOVA analysis were used to compare the differences in the perception of fear of COVID-19, trait anxiety and life satisfaction. Multiple regression was applied to predict anxiety based on fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction. Results: Analyze results confirmed the unidimensionality of the 7-item scale on a Turkish sample, and the results indicated satisfactory reliability coefficients. According to independent t-test and Two Way Anova results, females, non-athletes, participants with the worry of gaining weight, who did not care about their nutrition, and who followed media news more often scored higher fear of COVID-19 and anxiety. Multiple regression analysis identified a negative correlation between fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction and a positive correlation with anxiety. Conclusion: Although the present study revealed the associations of the fear of Covid-19 with life satisfaction and anxiety, further research is still recommended to explore these associations in more depth.","Isik, U.; Ustun, N.

Disruption of individual mouse Piwi genes results in male but not female sterility, leading to the assumption that PIWI genes play little or no role in mammalian oocytes. Here, we report generation of PIWI-defective golden hamsters, which reveals defects in the production of functional oocytes. The mechanisms involved vary among the hamster PIWI genes; lack of PIWIL1 has a major impact on gene expression, including hamster-specific young transposon de-silencing, whereas PIWIL3 deficiency has little impact on gene expression in oocytes, although DNA methylation was found to be reduced to some extent in PIWIL3-defecient oocytes. Our findings serve as the foundation for developing useful models to study the piRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes, including humans, which is not possible with mice.","Hasuwa, Hidetoshi; Iwasaki, Yuka W.; Wan Kin, Au Yeung; Ishino, Kyoko; Masuda, Harumi; Sasaki, Hiroyuki; Siomi, Haruhiko",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.428354,226

METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the impact of two definitions used as epidemiological tools, in adults and children, during the influenza A H1N1 epidemic. Patients were included if they had upper respiratory samples tested for influenza by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction during two periods, using the ILI definition (coughing + temperature ≤ 38ºC) in period 1, and the definition of severe acute respiratory infection (ARS) (coughing + temperature ≤ 38ºC and dyspnoea) in period 2. RESULTS The study included 366 adults and 147 children, covering 243 cases of ILI and 270 cases of ARS. Laboratory confirmed cases of influenza were higher in adults (50%) than in children (21.6%) ( p < 0.0001) and influenza infection was more prevalent in the ILI definition (53%) than ARS (24.4%) (p < 0.0001). Adults reported more chills and myalgia than children (p = 0.0001). Oseltamivir was administered in 58% and 46% of adults and children with influenza A H1N1, respectively. The influenza A H1N1 case fatality rate was 7% in adults and 8.3% in children. The mean time from onset of illness until antiviral administration was 4 days. CONCLUSIONS The modification of ILI to ARS definition resulted in less accuracy in influenza diagnosis and did not improve the appropriate time and use of antiviral medication.","Moretti, Maria Luiza; Sinkoc, Verônica; Cardoso, Luis Gustavo de Oliveira; Camargo, Gema Jesus de; Bachur, Luis Felipe; Hofling, Christian Cruz; Angerami, Rodrigo; Trabasso, Plínio; Garcia, Márcia Teixeira; Resende, Mariângela Ribeiro",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789355/,226

Research conducted in Singapore has provided insight into the clinical manifestations and period of infectivity of COVID-19, demonstrated evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission, linked infection clusters using serological tools, and highlighted aspects of hospital-based environmental contamination. It has also provided guidance for diagnostic testing and has described immune and virologic correlates with disease severity. Evidence of effectiveness of containment measures such as early border control, rigorous contact training, and calibrated social distancing measures have also been demonstrated. Singapore's multipronged strategy has been largely successful at containing COVID-19 and minimising fatalities, but the risk of re-emergence is high.","Tan, Trevor Hwee Yong; Toh, Matthias Paul Han Sim; Vasoo, Shawn; Lye, David Chien Boon; Ang, Brenda Sze Peng; Leo, Yee Sin; Lee, Vernon Jian Ming; Puah, Ser Hon; Kurup, Asok","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283840/,226
188921,Microwave or autoclave treatments destroy the infectivity of infectious bronchitis virus and avian pneumovirus but allow detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.,2004,"Short open reading frames within the 5' leader of some eukaryotic mRNAs are known to regulate the rate of translation initiation on the downstream open reading frame. By employing the polymerase chain reaction, we learned that the 5'-terminal 5 nt on the common leader sequence of bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs were heterogeneous and hypervariable throughout early infection in cell culture and that as a persistent infection became established, termini giving rise to a common 33-nt intraleader open reading frame were selected. Since the common leader is derived from the genomic 5' end during transcription, a common focus of origin for the heterogeneity is expected. The intraleader open reading frame was shown by in vitro translation studies to attenuate translation of downstream open reading frames in a cloned bovine coronavirus mRNA molecule. Selection of an intraleader open reading frame resulting in a general attenuation of mRNA translation and a consequent attenuation of virus replication may, therefore, be a mechanism by which coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses with a similar transcriptional strategy maintain a persistent infection.","Hofmann, M A; Senanayake, S D; Brian, D A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8265618/,226

DESIGN Prospective observational study. ANIMALS 15 adult cats and 18 kittens from a single cattery. PROCEDURE Blood and fecal samples were collected from adult cats every other month for 13 months. Serum FCV antibody titers were measured by use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay. A reverse-transcriptase, nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect FCV in feces. Blood and fecal samples were collected from kittens at approximately 2-week intervals from 3 weeks to 15 weeks of age. RESULTS Adult cats shed FCV intermittently. All adult cats shed virus in their feces at least once during the year, and 4 of 15 shed virus > 75% of the time. Serum antibody titer was not significantly associated with shedding of FCV. For the kittens, median age at the time FCV was first detected in feces was 67 days (range, 33 to 78 days). All except 1 of the kittens was found to be shedding virus in their feces before or at the time of seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggest that serum FCV antibody titers are not a good indicator of shedding of FCV in the feces. Kittens may shed FCV in their feces before they seroconvert, and all kittens in a cattery in which FCV infection is endemic may be infected before 12 weeks of age.","Harpold, L M; Legendre, A M; Kennedy, M A; Plummer, P J; Millsaps, K; Rohrbach, B",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10511857/,226

Thirty-three pigs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups for the 42-day study: inoculated (group A; n = 23), contact transmission (group B; n = 5), and aerosol transmission (group C; n = 5). Contact transmission occurred rapidly to group B pigs whereas productive aerosol transmission failed to occur to group C pigs. Emesis was the first clinical sign noted at 3 days postinoculation (dpi) followed by mild to moderate diarrhea lasting 5 more days. Real-time PCR detected PEDV in fecal and nasal swabs, oral fluids, serum, and gastrointestinal and lymphoid tissues. Shedding occurred primarily during the first 2 weeks postinoculation, peaking at 5-6 dpi; however, some pigs had PEDV nucleic acid detected in swabs collected at 21 and 28 dpi. Antibody titers were measurable between 14 and 42 dpi. Although feces and intestines collected at 42 dpi were PEDV negative by PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, small intestines from 70% of group A pigs were PCR positive. Although disease was relatively mild and transient in this age group, the results demonstrate that 4-week-old pigs are productively infected and can sustain virus replication for several weeks. Long-term shedding of PEDV in subclinically affected pigs should be considered an important source for PEDV transmission.","Niederwerder, Megan C; Nietfeld, Jerome C; Bai, Jianfa; Peddireddi, Lalitha; Breazeale, Barbara; Anderson, Joe; Kerrigan, Maureen A; An, Baoyan; Oberst, Richard D; Crawford, Kimberly; Lager, Kelly M; Madson, Darin M; Rowland, Raymond R R; Anderson, Gary A; Hesse, Richard A","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27698163/,226
191557,"Mutational analysis of the virus and monoclonal antibody binding sites in MHVR, the cellular receptor of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59.",1998,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus known to cause encephalitis and demyelination, uses murine homologues of carcinoembryonic antigens as receptors. However, the expression of these receptors is extremely low in the brain. By low-stringency screening of a mouse brain cDNA library, we have identified a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroup of the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family. Unlike other PSG that are expressed in the placenta, it is expressed predominantly in the brain. Transfection of the cDNA into COS-7 cells, which lack a functional MHV receptor, conferred susceptibility to infection by some MHV strains, including A59, MHV-2, and MHV-3, but not JHM. Thus, this is a virus strain-specific receptor. The detection of multiple receptors for MHV suggests the flexibility of this virus in receptor utilization. The identification of this virus in receptor utilization. The identification of a PSG predominantly expressed in the brain also expands the potential functions of these molecules.","Chen, D S; Asanaka, M; Yokomori, K; Wang, F; Hwang, S B; Li, H P; Lai, M M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8618851/,226

Four horses in each group received either a single killed or a modified-live vaccine intramuscularly. Two local commingled and 2 distant nonvaccinated controls were included for each group. All horses were observed daily for evidence of clinical abnormalities throughout the study periods. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice before vaccination and once weekly for 4 weeks after vaccination and submitted for PCR testing for EHV-1 by 2 independent laboratories using different real-time PCR methodologies. Serum samples collected from all horses on the vaccination day and 21 days later were tested for antibodies against EHV-1 using a serum neutralization test. Whereas the 2 vaccine strains tested positive in both EHV-1 PCR assays, nasopharyngeal swabs and whole blood collected from vaccinated and control horses had negative PCR test results for EHV-1 during the entire study period. Serum neutralization testing revealed a 2- to 4-fold increase in titers for all vaccinated horses, whereas titers in control horses were largely unchanged. The use of seropositive horses before immunization and the sampling frequency of 7 days may have prevented the occasional molecular detection of the vaccine virus in whole blood and nasopharyngeal secretions. However, the study results demonstrate that detection of EHV-1 DNA by PCR in vaccinated and unvaccinated healthy horses is not a common event.","Pusterla, Nicola; Chaney, Kristin P; Maes, Roger; Wise, Annabel G; Holland, Robert; Schott, Hal C","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17459860/,226

The authors examined the effects of infection with HCoV on ciliary structure and function in healthy volunteers infected by intranasal inoculation with HCoV 229E. A further four volunteers were sham infected with ultraviolet-inactivated virus. Immediately before inoculation (day 0) and 3 days later (day 3), ciliated epithelium was obtained by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate. Ciliary beat frequency was determined and beat pattern analysed for evidence of dyskinesia (0=normal, 3=severely dyskinetic) using digital high-speed video photography. Ciliary ultrastructure was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Symptom diaries were kept for the duration of the study. All subjects inoculated with HCoV, including the three who did not develop symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, had disruption of their respiratory epithelium on day 3. Although there was no difference in the mean ciliary beat frequency between day 0 (11.3 Hz (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.6-14.0) and day 3 (9.4 Hz (95% CI 7.2-11.6)), there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the ciliary dyskinesia score between day 0 (0.2 (95% CI 0-0.5)) and day 3 (1.1 (95% CI 0.5-1.7). In sham-infected subjects, no differences in epithelial integrity, or ciliary structure and function were found between day 0 and day 3. Inoculation of healthy volunteers with human coronavirus caused disruption of the ciliated epithelium and ciliary dyskinesia. This is likely to impair mucociliary clearance. Damage to the respiratory epithelium, due to human coronavirus infection, may occur without overt clinical symptoms.","Chilvers, M A; McKean, M; Rutman, A; Myint, B S; Silverman, M; O'Callaghan, C",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11829103/,226

METHODS A nested RT-PCR was used for detecting one fragment of SARS-CoV RNA in oropharyngeal swabs from 3 SARS probable patients, 4 SARS suspect patients and other 27 patients with fever in Hangzhou, and the nested RT-PCR product from one SARS probable patient was sequenced. Meanwhile in these 3 SARS probable patients, other three RT-PCR methods, including a hemi-nested RT-PCR targeted for another fragment of SARS-CoV RNA, a real-time RT-PCR and a modified nested real-time RT-PCR, were employed to detect SARS-CoV RNA. RESULTS Two positives were found in the 3 SARS probable patients, and none positive in 4 SARS suspect patients and other 27 patients with fever, using the nested RT-PCR. The sequence of the nested RT-PCR product from one SARS probable patient was identified with the counterpart of SARS-CoV genomes published in public database. The results of the hemi-nested RT-PCR, the real-time RT-PCR and the modified nested real-time RT-PCR in the 3 SARS patients were consistent with the one of the nested RT-PCR. During detecting specimen with low copies of RNA, a weak positive signal was produced after about 35 cycles in the real-time RT-PCR, but a strong positive signal was found only after 10 cycles in the modified nested real-time RT-PCR. CONCLUSION It might improve the reliability of test by employing RT-PCR targeted for two or more fragments in SARS-CoV genome. The modified nested real-time RT-PCR might have higher sensitivity than the routine real-time RT-PCR.","Ye, Rong; Pan, Jin-cao; Huang, Zhi-cheng; Wang, Heng; Wang, Hao-qiu; Wei, Dong-fang; Xu, Ke; Wen, Hong-gen; Chen, Kang-kai",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15842838/,226

As the numbers expand exponentially, a paucity of data regarding health care workers (HCWs), who are at the forefront of this disaster, exists. Hence we decided to conduct a study amongst the HCWs to determine the prevalence and risk factor stratification. Methods This was an online questionnaire-based survey of healthcare workers conducted at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, India from 23rd March to 30th April 2020. Data on flu-like symptoms, travel history, posting in high-risk or low risk zones, and prophylactic drugs was collected. Results Out of the 18000 HCWs who were approached 4403 responded and adequate data of 3667 was available for analysis. 14.7% had flu-like symptoms. 1.8% (20/1113) of the participants tested were positive for the virus. HCWs posted in the high-risk zones had more symptoms than those working in low-risk zones (169/539, 31.4% vs 679/3128, 21.7%), p<0.001; but no difference in COVID-19 positivity rates (p=0.849). Symptomatic HCWs had higher positivity (10/193, 5.2%) than the asymptomatic ones (10/920, 1.1%), p=0.001. HCQ was taken by 755/1113 (67.8%) people and 14 (1.9%) of these reported positive for the virus. Conclusion This is the first study on healthcare workers from India to the best of our knowledge. Our findings suggest that posting in a high-risk zone with adequate PPE does not pose higher risk to the HCWs. Moreover, HCQ as a prophylactic has no use.

Using a novel data representation, we developed a system termed MULTIPRED that can predict peptide binding to multiple related human leukocyte antigens (HLA). This implementation showed high accuracy in the prediction of the promiscuous peptides that bind to five HLA-A2 allelic variants. MULTIPRED is useful for the identification of peptides that bind multiple HLA-A2 variants as a group. By implementing ANN as a classification engine, we enabled both the prediction of peptides binding to multiple individual HLA-A2 molecules and the prediction of promiscuous binders using a single model. The ANN MULTIPRED predicts peptide binding to HLA-A*0205 with excellent accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve--AROC>0.90), and to HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0204 and HLA-A*0206 with high accuracy (AROC>0.85). Antigenic regions with high density of binders (""antigenic hot-spots"") represent best targets for vaccine design. MULTIPRED not only predicts individual 9-mer binders but also predicts antigenic hot spots. Two HLA-A2 hot-spots in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) membrane protein were predicted by using MULTIPRED.","Zhang, Guang Lan; Khan, Asif M; Srinivasan, Kellathur N; August, J Thomas; Brusic, Vladimir",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16278955/,226

The seven RNAs were assumed to have common 3' ends of the size of RNA7 , the smallest RNA. The data reported here, show that this model is too simple and that the mRNAs are composed of a leader and body sequence. Electron microscopic analysis of hybrids formed between single stranded cDNA copied from mRNA7 and genomic RNA or mRNA6 shows that genomic RNA, mRNA6 and mRNA7 have common 5' terminal sequences. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analysis shows that the nucleotide sequence of the 5' end of mRNA7 diverges from the corresponding region of the genome just upstream from the initiation codon of the nucleocapsid gene. Because the synthesis of each mRNA is inactivated by UV irradiation in proportion to its own length, the subgenomic mRNAs are apparently not produced by the processing of larger RNAs. The available data have to be explained by translocation of the polymerase/leader complex to specific internal positions on the negative strand. In this way the leader and body sequences are joined together by a mechanism completely different from conventional RNA splicing but nevertheless giving the same end result.","Spaan, W; Delius, H; Skinner, M A; Armstrong, J; Rottier, P; Smeekens, S; Siddell, S G; van der Zeijst, B",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6331109/,226

220845,Natural RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors: Molecular docking studies of some biologically active alkaloids of Argemone mexicana,2020,"BACKGROUND: The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has required specialist palliative care (SPC) services to respond by: (I) integrating infection prevention/control measures into care for their usual caseloads and (II) providing consultations and/or care for people dying from a new disease entity. The aim of the current study was to learn about the response of Australian SPC services to COVID-19 and its consequences in order to inform pandemic practice and policy. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was administered online from May to July 2020. Email invitations were sent to 160 providers delivering 503 SPC services listed in the Australian Palliative Care Services Directory. Survey questions asked about service responses to COVID-19, impacts on care quality, and perceived benefits/disadvantages for palliative care clients post-pandemic. Open-ended responses were thematically coded using an established framework that classifies SPC pandemic responses under: 'stuff', 'staff', 'space', 'systems', 'separation', 'sedation', 'communication' and 'equity'. RESULTS: Complete survey responses were received from 28 providers on behalf of 100 SPC services (response rates of 17%/20% respectively): 29 consultative, 25 community home-based, 21 outpatient, 15 inpatient wards/units, eight inpatient hospice and two other services. Responses were reported across all framework categories except 'sedation'. Concerns centred on: inadequate support for self-management, psychosocial needs and bereavement for clients living at home; pressures on staff capacity and wellbeing; and a perceived lack of health system preparedness for a potential future surge. Rapid implementation of telehealth across Australia was perceived to offer potential benefits to palliative care in the longer term, if provided with ongoing support. CONCLUSIONS: Meeting COVID-19-related challenges requires SPC to be agile and responsive. Advocacy is required to ensure the needs of people dying and their families are supported as well as people requiring acute care for COVID-19. Expansion of telehealth during the pandemic presents an opportunity for leveraging to benefit palliative care longer term.","Luckett, Tim; Donkor, Andrew; Phillips, Jane; Currow, David C; Parker, Deborah; Lobb, Elizabeth; Agar, Meera R",Ann. palliat. med.

239994,Introductions to the Community: Early-Career Researchers in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"Sleep has a profound influence on the physiology of body systems and biological processes. Molecular studies have shown circadian-regulated shifts in protein expression patterns across human tissues, further emphasizing the unique functional, behavioral and pharmacokinetic landscape of sleep. Thus, many pathological processes are also expected to exhibit sleep-specific manifestations. Nevertheless, sleep is seldom utilized for the study, detection and treatment of non-sleep-specific pathologies. Modern advances in biosensor technologies have enabled remote, non-invasive recording of a growing number of physiologic parameters and biomarkers. Sleep is an ideal time frame for the collection of long and clean physiological time series data which can then be analyzed using data-driven algorithms such as deep learning. In this perspective paper, we aim to highlight the potential of sleep as an auspicious time for diagnosis, management and therapy of nonsleep-specific pathologies. We introduce key clinical studies in selected medical fields, which leveraged novel technologies and the advantageous period of sleep to diagnose, monitor and treat pathologies. We then discuss possible opportunities to further harness this new paradigm and modern technologies to explore human health and disease during sleep and to advance the development of novel clinical applications: From sleep medicine to medicine during sleep.","Bar, Nitai; Sobel, Jonathan A.; Penzel, Thomas; Shamay, Yosi; Behar, Joachim A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05452v1.pdf,226

We found that the quality of life owners was strongly influenced by the lifestyle and emotional effects of the confinement, and that pets provided them with substantial support to mitigate those effects. However, pets showed signs of behavioral change that were consistent with stress, with dogs that had pre-existing behavioral problems being the most affected.","Bowen, Jonathan; García, Elena; Darder, Patricia; Argüelles, Juan; Fatjó, Jaume",,,226
263764,A frequency-selective pH-responsive paraCEST agent,2020,"The severity of coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19) is determined by the presence of pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), myocarditis, microvascular thrombosis and/or cytokine storms, all of which involve underlying inflammation. A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.","Weir, E Kenneth; Thenappan, Thenappan; Bhargava, Maneesh; Chen, Yingjie",,,226

Therefore, in the present study, 1528 anti-HIV1compounds were screened by sequence alignment between 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and avian infectious bronchitis virus (avian coronavirus) followed by machine learning predictive model, drug-likeness screening and molecular docking, which resulted in 41 screened compounds. These 41 compounds were re-screened by deep learning model constructed considering the IC50 values of known inhibitors which resulted in 22 hit compounds. Further, screening was done by structural activity relationship mapping which resulted in two structural clefts. Thereafter, functional group analysis was also done, where cluster 2 showed the presence of several essential functional groups having pharmacological importance. In the final stage, Cluster 2 compounds were re-docked with four different PDB structures of 3CLpro, and their depth interaction profile was analyzed followed by molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. Conclusively, 2 out of 1528 compounds were screened as potential hits against 3CLpro which could be further treated as an excellent drug against SARS-CoV-2.","Nand, Mahesha; Maiti, Priyanka; Joshi, Tushar; Chandra, Subhash; Pande, Veena; Kuniyal, Jagdish Chandra; Ramakrishnan, Muthannan Andavar",Sci Rep,,226

In an attempt to continue to probe ""essentiality,"" this article coins the term ""essential crimes"" to refer to those socially injurious acts and omissions that are part and parcel of a global neoliberal capitalist order, and that are, therefore, vital to keep the socioeconomic system running. In other words, if keeping humans alive in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic required supermarkets and hospitals to remain open (""essential business and jobs""), maintaining the existing socioeconomic system and ensuring that the powerful remained powerful required harmful acts and omissions by states and corporations-what we refer to as ""essential crimes."" This article sheds light on how the COVID-19 pandemic has helped illuminate just how essential these crimes and harms are to the perpetuation of the status quo by the powerful. In addition, this article encourages us to consider which punishments, if any, are vital to a well-ordered society, and it demands that we rethink whether prison is an ""essential punishment"" for ensuring public safety.","Vegh Weis, Valeria; Magnin, Brittany",Crit Criminol,,226

As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively. The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission. This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively. One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.","Bourget-Murray, Jonathan; Heard, Bryan J; Bansal, Rohit; Johnson, Andrew S; Powell, James",Can J Surg,,226

Therefore, it is very important to understand patients' degree of infection and infection history through antibody testing. Such information is useful also for the government and hospitals to formulate reasonable prevention policies and treatment plans. In this paper, we develop a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) method based on superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SMNPs) and a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensing system for the simultaneously quantitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). A simple and time-effective co-precipitation method was utilized to prepare the SMNPs, which have good dispersibility and magnetic property, with an average diameter of 68 nm. The Internet of Medical Things-supported GMR could transmit medical data to a smartphone through the Bluetooth protocol, making patient information available for medical staff. The proposed GMR system, based on SMNP-supported LFIA, has an outstanding advantage in cost-effectiveness and time-efficiency, and is easy to operate. We believe that the suggested GMR based LFIA system will be very useful for medical staff to analyze and to preserve as a record of infection in COVID-19 patients.","Bayin, Qiaoge; Huang, Lei; Ren, Chunhui; Fu, Yusheng; Ma, Xing; Guo, Jinhong",Talanta,,226

Moreover, statins have pleiotropic, mostly deleterious effects on many cell types, including immune cells. In the attempt to decipher the enigma of SARS-CoV-2 infectivology, the hypothesis should be tested whether the population of subjects who succumbed to Covid-19 may have developed a compromised immunity at sub-clinical levels and have become more susceptible to fatal consequences from SARS-Cov-2 infection due to statin therapy.","Minetti, Giampaolo",Med Hypotheses,,226

The emission of the virus from a human is simulated by using tracer particles solved in water. The recipients inhale the aerosols and droplets and quantify the level of solved tracer particles in their artificial lungs simultaneously over time. The mobile system can be arranged in a large variety of spreading scenarios in indoor environments and allows for quantification of the infection probability due to airborne virus spreading.

METHODS: Using GSEA, we compared our previous transcriptome analysis of neurons injured by glutamate and treated with the ARB Candesartan (GSE67036) with transcriptional signatures from SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and lung postmortem (GSE147507), PBMC and BALF samples (CRA002390) from COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Hundreds of genes upregulated in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 transcriptomes were similarly upregulated by glutamate and normalized by Candesartan. Gene Ontology analysis revealed expression profiles with greatest significance and enrichment, including proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine activity, the NF-kappa B complex, alterations in innate and adaptive immunity, with many genes participating in the COVID-19 cytokine storm. CONCLUSIONS: There are similar injury mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection and neuronal injury, equally reduced by ARB treatment.

The methodological basis of the study encompasses the general and special methods of scientific inquiry (formal logical method, comparative law, structural-logical method, analysis and synthesis methods). The ways and possibilities of balancing the interests of rights-holders and society's interests (in particular patients' interests) have been studied. It is highlighted that compulsory licensing must be employed exclusively in view of the principle of proportionality, since any restrictions on human rights, including patent rights, must comply with the legislation in force and be proportionate to the potential threat. Comprehensive attention is paid to the interests of right holders (in our case, medicines manufacturers), their protection as well as the ways they abuse their patent rights. It is underlined that access to medicines and treatment is a prerequisite for the realization of the right to health and, consequently, is of social interest. However, in Ukraine today we face a situation in which the percentage of medicines purchased at patients' own expense is 88.2%. Such low medicines coverage on the part of the state is not characteristic of any European country. Compulsory licensing legislation, in particular, key international documents in this field, were thoroughly studied. The features of compulsory licensing have been formulated. The general trends regarding the use of this mechanism in the contemporary world have been determined. Based on the study, an evaluation of the effectiveness of compulsory licensing as a tool in the fight against abuse of patent rights is provided. There have been produced suggestions regarding amendments to the current legislation of Ukraine aiming to increase the effectiveness of compulsory licensing of medicines in general and under pandemic conditions in particular. First of all, it is an expansion of the sphere of compulsory licensing with respect to such intellectual property objects as industrial samples and trade secrets (know-hows). It is also suggested that the procedure for issuing compulsory licenses be expedited by the government's decision under pandemic or epidemic conditions.","Chepys, O",Georgian Med News,,226

Despite the enormous efforts of scientists and clinicians around the world, there is still no drug or vaccine available worldwide for the treatment and prevention of the infection. A rapid strategy for the identification of new treatments is based on repurposing existing clinically approved drugs that show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, after developing a quantitative structure activity relationship analysis based on molecular topology, several macrolide antibiotics are identified as promising SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibitors. To confirm the in silico results, the best candidates were tested against two human coronaviruses (i.e., 229E-GFP and SARS-CoV-2) in cell culture. Time-of-addition experiments and a surrogate model of viral cell entry were used to identify the steps in the virus life cycle inhibited by the compounds. Infection experiments demonstrated that azithromycin, clarithromycin, and lexithromycin reduce the intracellular accumulation of viral RNA and virus spread as well as prevent virus-induced cell death, by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Even though the three macrolide antibiotics display a narrow antiviral activity window against SARS-CoV-2, it may be of interest to further investigate their effect on the viral spike protein and their potential in combination therapies for the coronavirus disease 19 early stage of infection.","Galvez, Jorge; Zanni, Riccardo; Galvez-Llompart, Maria; Benlloch, Jose Maria",J Chem Inf Model,,226

WiFi connectivity data consists of sporadic connections between devices and nearby WiFi access points, each of which may cover a relatively large area within a building. Our system, entitled semantic LOCATion cleanER (LOCATER), postulates semantic localization as a series of data cleaning challenges - first, it treats the problem of determining the AP to which a device is connected between any two of its connection events as a missing value detection and repair problem. It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem. We propose a bootstrapping semi-supervised learning method for the coarse localization and probabilistic method to achieve finer localization. We show that LOCATER can achieve significantly high accuracy at both the coarse and fine levels. LOCATER offers several benefits over traditional indoor localization approaches since it neither requires active cooperation from users (e.g., downloading code on a mobile device and communicating with the server) nor installing external hardware (e.g., network monitors).","Lin, Yiming; Jiang, Daokun; Yus, Roberto; Bouloukakis, Georgios; Chio, Andrew; Mehrotra, Sharad; Venkatasubramanian, Nalini",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09676v2.pdf,226

The images are annotated with the type of liquid (e.g., blood, urine), the phase of the material (e.g., liquid, solid, foam, suspension), the type of vessel (e.g., syringe, tube, cup, infusion bottle/bag), and the properties of the vessel (transparent, opaque). In addition, vessel parts such as corks, labels, spikes, and valves are annotated. Relations and hierarchies between vessels and materials are also annotated, such as which vessel contains which material or which vessels are linked or contain each other.

This study adapted an existing parent training intervention to improve outcomes for low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking Latino parents of children with leukemia and pilot tested that intervention for feasibility. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a focus group of 20 Latino parents of children treated for leukemia. Ten Latino families participated in a pilot study of the adapted parenting intervention, consisting of eight sessions over 6 months. RESULTS: Focus groups revealed that parents unanimously supported a parenting intervention but barriers to participation included time constraints, transportation issues, and anxiety in the hospital environment. The parents also highlighted cultural factors that could contribute to the health disparity, such as lack of knowledge and efficacy in facilitating their child's progress with learning and school. In the pilot study, adherence was 90%, establishing feasibility, and the adapted intervention was considered beneficial. The median parenting efficacy scores improved from preintervention to postintervention (median 3.40 vs. 3.94; p < .011), as did parent-reported school functioning of the child (median 50.00 vs. 60.00; p = .088). CONCLUSIONS: This study addressed a health disparity by culturally adapting a parenting intervention, which was designed to improve school functioning, to meet the needs and preferences of low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking families of children with leukemia in Southern California. The pilot study demonstrated that the adapted intervention is feasible and acceptable in the target population.

In this study, changes in the concentrations of the six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) in Wuhan were investigated before (January 1 to 23, 2020), during (January 24 to April 5, 2020), and after the COVID-19 lockdown (April 6 to June 20, 2020) periods. Also, the relationships between the air pollutants and meteorological variables during the three periods were investigated. The results showed that there was significant improvement in air quality during the lockdown. Compared to the pre-lockdown period, the concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and CO decreased by 50.6, 41.2, 33.1, and 16.6%, respectively, while O3 increased by 149% during the lockdown. After the lockdown, the concentrations of PM2.5, CO and SO2 declined by an additional 19.6, 15.6, and 2.1%, respectively. However, NO2, O3, and PM10 increased by 55.5, 25.3, and 5.9%, respectively, compared to the lockdown period. Except for CO and SO2, WS had negative correlations with the other pollutants during the three periods. RH was inversely related with all pollutants. Positive correlations were observed between temperature and the pollutants during the lockdown. Easterly winds were associated with peak PM2.5 concentrations prior to the lockdown.

394704,Recent Advances in Catalytic Hydrosilylations: Developments Beyond Traditional Platin Catalysts,2020,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination by 2030, using direct-acting antiviral treatments, has been promoted by the World Health Organization. This achievement is not attainable, however, particularly after the 2020 pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019. Consequently, the more realistic objective of eliminating HCV from population segments for which targeted strategies of prevention and treatment are easily attained has been promoted in Europe, as a valid alternative. The underlying idea is that micro-elimination will ultimately lead to macro-elimination. The micro-elimination strategy may target different specific populations and at-risk groups. Different settings, including prisons and hospitals, have also been identified as micro-elimination scenarios. In addition, dedicated micro-elimination strategies have been designed that are tailored at the geographical level according to HCV epidemiology and individual country's income. The main elements of a valid and successful micro-elimination project are reliable epidemiological data and active involvement of all the stakeholders. Community involvement represents another essential component for a successful program.","Mangia, Alessandra; Cotugno, Rosa; Cocomazzi, Giovanna; Squillante, Maria Maddalena; Piazzolla, Valeria",World J Gastroenterol,,226

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has complicated informed consent processes, due to physical distancing precautions and increased physician workload. As such, obtaining timely and adequate patient consent has become a bottleneck for many clinical trials. However, this challenging situation might also present an opportunity to rethink and reappraise our approach to consent in clinical trials. This viewpoint discusses the challenges related to informed consent during the COVID-19 pandemic, whether it could be acceptable to alter current consent processes under these circumstances, and outlines a possible framework with predefined criteria and a system of checks and balances that could allow for alterations of existing consent processes to maximize patient benefit under exceptional circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic without undermining patient autonomy.","Goyal, Mayank; Ospel, Johanna Maria; Ganesh, Aravind; Marko, Martha; Fisher, Marc",Stroke,,226
407239,Potential Candidates against COVID-19 Targeting RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase: A Comprehensive Review,2021,"Patients with cancer are a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic due to underlying immunosuppression, pre-existing comorbidities, and poor nutrition. There is a lack of data describing the disease course of cancer patients with COVID-19 disease. Therefore, we analyzed data from cancer patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital. Cancer patients were categorized into two groups as survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19. Among 68 cancer patients with COVID-19, 27% of patients were admitted to ICU, and 37% of the patients died. The median age was 72, and non-survivors were older than survivors (p = 0.001). Non-survivors had higher comorbidity scores, late-stage cancer, and worse ECOG performance status than survivors (all p values<0.005). Non-survivors also had significantly lower lymphocyte count and albumin level but higher lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, troponin, and ferritin levels than survivors. On multivariable analysis, increased age and mechanical ventilation were associated with increased odds of death. We report no association between anti-cancer treatments and mortality from COVID-19 disease. In summary, cancer patients have higher mortality of COVID-19 infection than the general population. In addition to generally known risk factors, the high mortality rate in cancer patients with COVID-19 is associated with several cancer-specific factors.","Ozer, Muhammet; Goksu, Suleyman Yasin; Mahdi, Mohammed; Gandhi, Neel",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,226

It is extremely urgent that global people must take actions to develop safe and effective preventions and therapeutics. Nanobodies, which are derived from single­chain camelid antibodies, had shown antiviral properties in various challenge viruses. In this study, multivalent nanobodies with high affinity blocking SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction with ACE2 protein were developed. RESULTS: Totally, four specific nanobodies against spike protein and its RBD domain were screened from a naïve VHH library. Among them, Nb91-hFc and Nb3-hFc demonstrated antiviral activity by neutralizing spike pseudotyped viruses in vitro. Subsequently, multivalent nanobodies were constructed to improve the neutralizing capacity. As a result, heterodimer nanobody Nb91-Nb3-hFc exhibited the strongest RBD-binding affinity and neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with an IC50 value at approximately 1.54 nM. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that naïve VHH library could be used as a potential resource for rapid acquisition and exploitation of antiviral nanobodies.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of our pediatric VUC program of patients less than age 18 years, from March 1 to May 31, 2020. We include data on expansion of staffing, patient demographics, virtual care, and outcomes. Results: We rapidly onboarded, educated, and trained pediatric telemedicine providers. We evaluated 406 pediatric patients with median age 4.4 years and 53.9% male. Median call time was 5:12 pm, median time to provider was 5.7 min, and median duration of call was 11.1 min. The most common reasons for a visit were COVID-19-related symptoms (36%), dermatologic (15%), and trauma (10%). Virtual care for patients consisted of conservative management (72%), medication prescription (18%), and referral to an urgent care or pediatric emergency department (PED) (10%). Of 16 patients referred and presented to our emergency department, 2 required intensive care for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Oral antibiotics were prescribed for 7.1% of all patients. Only 0.005% of patients had an unplanned 72-h PED visit resulting in hospitalization after a VUC visit. Conclusion: Pediatric emergency VUC allowed for high-quality efficient medical care for patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. Although most patients were managed conservatively in their home, telemedicine also enabled rapid identification of patients who required in-person emergency care.","Kim, Ji Won; Lame, Maria; Szalay, Leanna; Lefchak, Brian; Johnsson, Bille; Gogia, Kriti; Clark, Sunday; Kessler, David; Leyden, David; Sharma, Rahul; Platt, Shari",Telemed. j. e. health,,226

We performed an online survey between July 29th and October 12th 2020 in patients at risk of severe influenza and/or pneumococcal disease recruited from Ipsos internal panel or through AVNIR (Associations VacciNation Immunodéprimées Réalité), a group of patient associations. Among the 2177 respondents, 1350 were female (62%), median age was 58 years (IQR 47-69), 62% were immunocompromised.

Studies have shown that cardiovascular manifestations and complications linked to COVID-19 can be attributed to unfavorable clinical outcome and poor prognosis. Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in participating centers between March and June 2020 were included. Data including demographics, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments and interventions were collected. Mortality and clinical outcomes in patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. A total of 143 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included (86.7% male; age 49.36 ± 15.32 years). Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, and rhythm disturbances were noted in 34.3% of the study population and 21.7% had cardiac injury. In comparison with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were older (59 [33-89] vs 47 [22-94] years; P < 0.0001) and had more co-morbidities and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors (hypertension in 61.3% vs 24.1%; P < 0.0001, chronic heart failure in 16.1% vs 0%; P < 0.00001, diabetes mellitus 54.8% vs 31.3%; P 0.015, COPD/asthma 19.4% vs 3.6%; P 0.002); more patients with cardiac injury required invasive mechanical ventilation (77.4% vs 38.4%; P 0.00012). Complications were more prevalent in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (87% vs 42.9%; P < 0.00001), acute kidney injury (67.7% vs 11.6%; P < 0.00001), and anemia (38.7% vs 3.6%;P < 0.00001). The need for renal replacement therapy was also higher in patients with cardiac injury (48.4% vs 3.6%; P < 0.00001). Noticeably, patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (53.3% vs 7.1%; P < 0.00001). In summary, myocardial injury is common among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Oman in relation to older patients with more CV risk factors and comorbidities, and is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality and unfavorable clinical outcomes.","Al-Wahaibi, Kamla; Al-Wahshi, Yahya; Mohamed Elfadil, Osman",SN Compr Clin Med,,226

(Rishi Sunak, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, 20 March 2020). 1In this piece, I draw on an ethics of care and compassion to address a question that has been asked almost daily in UK politics over the past weeks and months, namely: Where is Boris Johnson? Johnson is a leader with a long-standing reputation for being selective about whether and when he shows up. On 16 March 2020, as the severity of the coronavirus finally seemed to register, Johnson agreed to start holding daily press briefings, bringing his previous track-record and apparent instinct for no-shows into sharp relief. Criticism was understandably stilled during his hospitalisation for the virus, but it was not long after his discharge from hospital before the question of his absences came back into focus, with renewed concern about his non-attendance at key COBRA meetings and his decision to go on holiday in mid-February as the virus had been taking hold. 2Through the prism of the psychoanalytic caring leader, I reflect on some of the explanations for, and implications of, his absences, arguing that they do not always have the same function or effect. Some absences may be politically astute, as a way of promoting an anti-establishment message and/or reassuring his constituents of their own competence and efficacy. Other absences are decidedly risky, because they send a message that he does not care. In times of crisis, the scales of separation versus proximity – absence versus presence – tip differently to normal, and leaders who appear not to care risk triggering especially powerful anxieties about betrayal and abandonment. When it is impossible for us to be carefree, leaders must avoid being perceived or experienced as careless.","Tomkins, Leah",Leadership,,226
482774,Enantio- and Diastereodivergent Sequential Catalysis featuring Two Transition Metal-Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions,2021,"BACKGROUND: Prompt identification of infections is critical for slowing the spread of infectious diseases. However, diagnostic testing shortages are common in emerging diseases, low resource settings, and during outbreaks. This forces difficult decisions regarding who receives a test, often without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. METHODS: Using early SARS-CoV-2 as an example, we used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive. To consider the implications of gains in daily case detection at the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized model of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found that applying this CPR (AUC: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68 - 0.70)) to prioritize testing increased the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e., ""flattens the curve""), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent community mitigation efforts), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden.

487716,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Structure, mechanism, and drug discovery for COVID-19",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging diagnostic testing capacity worldwide. The mass testing needed to limit the spread of the virus requires new molecular diagnostic tests to dramatically widen access at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings. Isothermal molecular assays have emerged as a promising technology, given the faster turn-around time and minimal equipment compared to gold standard laboratory PCR methods. However, unlike PCR, they do not typically target multiple SARS-CoV-2 genes, risking sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, they often require multiple steps thus adding complexity and delays. Here we develop a multiplexed, 1-2 step, fast (20-30 min) SARS-CoV-2 molecular test using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification to simultaneously detect two conserved targets - the E and RdRP genes. The agile multi-gene platform offers two complementary detection methods: real-time fluorescence or dipstick. The analytical sensitivity of the fluorescence test was 9.5 (95% CI: 7.0-18) RNA copies per reaction for the E gene and 17 (95% CI: 11-93) RNA copies per reaction for the RdRP gene. The analytical sensitivity for the dipstick method was 130 (95% CI: 82-500) RNA copies per reaction. High specificity was found against common seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV model samples. The dipstick readout demonstrated potential for point-of-care testing in decentralised settings, with minimal or equipment-free incubation methods and a user-friendly prototype smartphone application. This rapid, simple, ultrasensitive and multiplexed molecular test offers valuable advantages over gold standard tests and in future could be configurated to detect emerging variants of concern.","Cherkaoui, Dounia; Huang, Da; Miller, Benjamin S; Turbé, Valérian; McKendry, Rachel A",Biosens Bioelectron,,226

The learned conservation states show distinct enrichment patterns for genes, protein domains, and other regions of interest. Certain states are strongly enriched or depleted of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, and the state annotations are more predictive than existing genomic annotations in prioritizing bases without nonsingleton mutations, which are likely enriched for important genomic bases.

Such critical course of coronavirus disease (COVID)‐19 is thought to associate with cytokine storm as in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), although these specific data are still lacking. In this study we aimed to directly address the question, whether immune activation in COVID‐19 does indeed mimic conditions as in these classical cytokine storm syndromes. METHODS: We quantified levels of 22 biomarkers in serum samples of COVID‐19 (n=30, n=83 longitudinal samples in total), sHLH/MAS patients (n=50) as well as healthy controls (n=9) using bead array assay as well as single‐marker ELISA and correlated results with disease outcome. RESULTS: In sHLH/MAS we observed dramatic activation of the interleukin(IL)‐18‐interferon (IFN)‐γ axis, while increased serum levels of IL‐1 receptor antagonist (IL‐1Ra), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM‐1) and IL‐8, as well as strongly reduced levels of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in course of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection discriminate immune dysregulation in critical COVID‐19 from the investigated well‐recognized cytokine storm conditions.

Similar results for PEF (P=0.49), asthma symptoms (P=0.17), and asthma medication (P=0.16) were obtained when the analysis was restricted to the 2 days before and after vaccination.","Ahmed, Ala'Eldin H.; Nicholson, Karl G.; Hammersley, Victoria S.; Kent, Julie",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X9600285X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9261948/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X9600285X,226

This scoping review of the original research literature describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for PWUO and identifies gaps in the literature. METHODS: This scoping review of the original research literature maps the available knowledge regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for PWUO. We utilized the methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and content analyses methodology to characterize the current state of the literature. RESULTS: Of the 14 included studies, administrative database (n = 11), cross-sectional (n = 1) or qualitative (n = 2) studies demonstrated service gaps (n = 7), patient/provider experiences (n = 3), and patient outcomes for PWUO (n = 4). In March 2020, healthcare utilization dropped quickly, sharply increasing only for reasons of opioid overdose by May 2020. Service gaps existed in accessing treatment for new patients during the pandemic due to capacity and infrastructure limits. Physicians reported difficulty referring patients to begin an outpatient opioid treatment program due to increased restrictions in capacity and infrastructure. Patients also reported uncertainty about accessing outpatient treatment, but that telehealth initiation of buprenorphine increased access to treatment from home. Disproportionate increases in overdose rates among African Americans were reported in two studies, with differences by race and gender not examined in most studies. Fatal overdoses increased 60% in African Americans during the pandemic, while fatal overdoses in Non-Hispanic White individuals decreased. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this beginning evidence demonstrates that despite early reluctance to use the healthcare system, opioid overdose-related use of healthcare increased throughout the pandemic. Service delivery for medications to treat OUD remained at or above pre-pandemic levels, indicating the ability of telehealth to meet demand. Yet, racial disparities that existed pre-pandemic for PWUO are intensifying, and targeted intervention for high-risk groups is warranted to prevent further mortality. As the pandemic progresses, future research must focus on identifying and supporting subgroups of PWUO who are at heightened risk for experiencing negative outcomes and lack of access to care.","Alexander, Karen; Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika; Gerolamo, Angela; Hassen, Nadia; Kelly, Erin L.; Rising, Kristin L.",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-021-00395-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372900/,226

Seasonal influenza vaccines can reduce influenza-associated morbidity in healthcare settings, but despite mandatory influenza vaccination in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the vaccination uptake rate among HCPs is below expectations. This study investigated vaccination trends from 2017 to 2020 to identify factors affecting vaccination among HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic flu and subsequent seasons. METHODS: Cross-sectional study among HCPs was conducted in January 2021. A structured questionnaire was shared via social media. Vaccine uptake predictors were identified using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models (p-value 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 424 HCPs (118 physicians and 306 nurses) completed the questionnaire. Vaccine uptake increased from 2017 to 2019 (45% to 52% to 62%) but fell (to 59%) during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic flu season. Multivariable analysis indicated participants >40 years old (AOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.64–5.83), female (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.13–2.67), non-Saudi (AOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.72–4.01), nurses (AOR 2.70, 95% CI 1.75–4.17), and who possessed accurate knowledge of the flu vaccine efficacy duration (AOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.87–4.94) were more likely to have received the vaccine. However, 79% of HCPs declared their intention to be vaccinated in the 2021 flu season, with participants >40 years old, female (AOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.38–3.68), non-Saudi (AOR 3.79, 95% CI 2.34–6.16), or nurses (AOR 2.94, 95% CI 1.82–4.76) more likely to do so. CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination uptake declined among HCPs during the 2020 flu season compared with the previous season but is expected to increase in the upcoming 2021 season. Nevertheless, the findings are encouraging and indicate increased willingness of HCPs to become vaccinated in the upcoming 2021 season, but coverage could be further increased by policymakers via a comprehensive plan focusing particularly on younger HCPs, Saudis, males, and physicians.","Alkathlan, Mohammed; Khalil, Rehana; Alhemaidani, Munirah F; Alaed, Ghadah H; Almutairi, Shatha M; Almalki, Hala A; Alghofaili, Renad H; Al-Wutayd, Osama",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552331/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s330029,226

The present study evaluated the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who were overweight or obese and variables associated with severe disease in a large group of consecutive cases. METHODS A nationwide retrospective cohort study was performed using the Turkish National Healthcare Database. Demographic characteristics, laboratory tests, comorbidities, and medications of patients registered between March 11 and May 30, 2020, were recorded. RESULTS A total of 14, 625 patients (median age:42, IQR:26 years; female 57.4%) with normal weight (34.7%), overweight (35.6%), and obesity (29.7%) were included. Hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation/mechanical ventilation, pulmonary involvement, and mortality were significantly higher in patients who were overweight or obese. In adjusted analyses, both overweight (OR, 95% CI: 1.82, 1.04-3.21; p=0.037) and obesity (OR, 95% CI: 2.69, 1.02-1.05; p<0.001) were associated with a higher intubation/mechanical ventilation rate but only obesity was associated with increased mortality (OR, 95% CI: 2.56, 1.40-4.67; p=0.002). Old age, male gender, chronic kidney disease, and high C reactive protein levels were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality in overweight or obese patients.

To address this, a portion of the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein of TCoV carrying relevant B cell epitopes (amino acid positions 54–395) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. This protein was purified and used to develop an indirect ELISA for detection of antibodies against TCoV. Using experimentally derived positive and negative turkey serum samples this ELISA showed high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (92%) for TCoV. To further evaluate the potential of the ELISA, 360 serum samples from commercial turkey farms in Ontario were tested for TCoV-specific antibodies using the recombinant TCoV ELISA. High seroprevalence of TCoV was found with 71.11% of breeders and 56.67% of meat turkeys testing seropositive.

We describe the ‘data-sharing ecosystem’ in HIV care by analysing HIV healthcare professional (HCP) beliefs and practices around sharing diverse types of service user and clinic-generated data across multiple contexts.MethodsDuring February-October 2020, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with HCPs working in a large UK HIV outpatient service. Participants engaged in a card sorting task, sorting 33 data types routinely shared in HIV care into categories (comfortable/not comfortable/not sure) across three data-sharing contexts: (a) service users to HCPs in consultations;(b) HCPs to GPs;(c) HCPs to non-HIV HCPs. Data were analysed thematically.ResultsOver half (57%) of participants were female;57% were doctors. Participants had worked in HIV for 12 years on average.HCPs were comfortable with a wide range of data being shared with them by service users. Across all sharing contexts, HCPs were uncomfortable with sharing of service user photographs, perceiving them as not routinely shared, unnecessary, and potentially risking inadvertent sharing of inappropriate content. HCPs were comfortable sharing data with GPs and other non-HIV HCPs in two broad categories: (a) demographic data (e.g. age) and (b) non-sensitive data related to general health (e.g. sleep). HCPs were less comfortable sharing sensitive information about HIV status, sexual health, behaviour and identity. Service user consent and relevance of data to sharing context were key determinants of data-sharing comfort.ConclusionUnderstanding the context of data-sharing in HIV care is increasingly important given the shift to remote consultations and expectations for self-management. We demonstrate the complex interplay of data types, relationship dynamics, and contexts of care provision that shape the data-sharing ecosystem in HIV care. Developing guidance on the sharing of service user and clinic-generated data in HIV care must account for these complexities.","Lloyd, K.; Tariq, S.; Durrant, A.; Claisse, C.; Coventry, L.; Kasadha, B.; Sillence, E.; Stumpf, S.; Gibbs, J.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.297,226

Up to date, it has resulted in 1826 human infections, including 649 deaths. Analogous to picornavirus 3C protease (3C(pro)), 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) is critical for initiation of the MERS-CoV replication cycle and is thus regarded as a validated drug target. As presented here, our peptidomimetic inhibitors of enterovirus 3C(pro) (6b, 6c and 6d) inhibited 3CL(pro) of MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with IC(50) values ranging from 1.7 to 4.7 μM and from 0.2 to 0.7 μM, respectively. In MERS-CoV-infected cells, the inhibitors showed antiviral activity with EC(50) values ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 μM, by downregulating the viral protein production in cells as well as reducing secretion of infectious viral particles into culture supernatants. They also suppressed other α- and β-CoVs from human and feline origin. These compounds exhibited good selectivity index (over 70 against MERS-CoV) and could lead to the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against emerging CoVs and picornaviruses.","Kumar, Vathan; Shin, Jin Soo; Shie, Jiun-Jie; Ku, Keun Bon; Kim, Chonsaeng; Go, Yun Young; Huang, Kai-Fa; Kim, Meehyein; Liang, Po-Huang",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216305083; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216305083; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28216367/,226
621951,Changes in salivary analytes in canine parvovirus: A high-resolution quantitative proteomic study,2018-09-24,"In a compartmental epidemic model, the initial exponential phase reflects a fixed interaction between an infectious agent and a susceptible population in steady state, so it determines the basic reproduction number R(0) on its own. After the exponential phase, dynamic complexities like societal responses muddy the practical interpretation of many estimated parameters. The computer program ARRP, already available from sequence alignment applications, automatically estimated the end of the exponential phase in COVID-19 and extracted the exponential growth rate r for 160 countries. By positing a gamma-distributed generation time, the exponential growth method then yielded R(0) estimates for COVID-19 in 160 countries. The use of ARRP ensured that the R(0) estimates were largely freed from any dependency outside the exponential phase. The Prem matrices quantify rates of effective contact for infectious disease. Without using any age-stratified COVID-19 data, but under strong assumptions about the homogeneity of susceptibility, infectiousness, etc., across different age-groups, the Prem contact matrices also yielded theoretical R(0) estimates for COVID-19 in 152 countries, generally in quantitative conflict with the R(0) estimates derived from the exponential growth method. An exploratory analysis manipulating only the Prem contact matrices reduced the conflict, suggesting that age-groups under 20 years did not promote the initial exponential growth of COVID-19 as much as other age-groups. The analysis therefore supports tentatively and tardily, but independently of age-stratified COVID-19 data, the low priority given to vaccinating younger age groups. It also supports the judicious reopening of schools. The exploratory analysis also supports the possibility of suspecting differences in epidemic spread among different age-groups, even before substantial amounts of age-stratified data become available.","Spouge, John L.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255772/,226

Many health care systems are balancing resources to manage the current COVID-19 pandemic resulting in surgical delay in patients with large renal masses. METHODS: Using Cox proportional hazard models, we analyzed data from the National Cancer Database for patients undergoing extirpative surgery for clinical T2N0M0 renal masses between 2004 and 2015. Study outcomes were to assess for an association between surgical delay with overall survival and pathologic stage. RESULTS: We identified 11,848 patients who underwent extirpative surgery for clinical T2 renal masses. Compared with patients undergoing surgery within 2 months of diagnosis, we found worse OS for patients with a surgical delay of 3-4 months (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.25) or 5-6 months (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.91). Considering only healthy patients with CCI=0, worse OS was associated with surgical delay of 5-6 months (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.21-2.34, p=0.002) but not 3-4 months (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.26, p=0.309). Pathologic stage (pT or pN) was not associated with surgical delay. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged surgical delay (5-6 months) for patients with T2 renal tumors appears to have a negative impact on OS while shorter surgical delay (3-4 months) was not associated with worse OS in healthy patients. The data presented in this study may help patients and providers to weigh the risk of surgical delay vs. the risk of iatrogenic SARS-CoV-2 exposure during resurgent waves COVID-19 pandemic.","Ginsburg, Kevin B.; Curtis, Gannon L.; Patel, Devin N.; Chen, Wen Min; Strother, Marshall; Kutikov, Alexander; Derweesh, Ithaar H.; Cher, Michael L.",Urology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32966822/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009042952031150X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009042952031150X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.09.010,226

623685,Complete Genome Sequence of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Variant Tottori2/JPN/2014,2015-08-13,"It has emerged that DDX3 plays a role in antiviral innate immunity. However, the exact mechanism by which DDX3 functions in antiviral innate immunity remains to be determined. We found that the expression of the protein activator of the interferon‐induced protein kinase (PACT) was regulated by DDX3 in human cells. PACT acts as a cellular activator of retinoic acid‐inducible gene‐I‐like receptors in the sensing of viral RNAs. DDX3 facilitated the translation of PACT mRNA that may contain a structured 5′ UTR. Knockdown of DDX3 decreased the viral RNA detection sensitivity of the cells. PACT partially rescued defects of interferon‐β1 and chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 5/RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) induction in DDX3‐knockdown HEK293 cells. Therefore, DDX3 may participate in antiviral innate immunity, at least in part, by translational control of PACT. Moreover, we show that overexpression of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein inhibited the translation of a reporter mRNA harboring the PACT 5′ UTR. The HCV core protein was associated and colocalized with DDX3 in cytoplasmic stress granules, suggesting that the HCV core may abrogate the function of DDX3 by sequestering DDX3 in stress granules. The perturbation of DDX3 by viral proteins delineates a critical role for DDX3 in antiviral host defense.","Lai, Ming‐Chih; Sun, H.

628044,Evidence for N(7) guanine methyl transferase activity encoded within the modular domain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L of a Morbillivirus,2015-10-07,"BACKGROUND: A cruise ship is a closed-off environment that simulates the basic functioning of a city in terms of living conditions and interpersonal interactions. Thus, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined because of an onboard outbreak of COVID-19 in February, 2020, provides an opportunity to define the shedding pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patient antibody responses before and after the onset of symptoms. METHODS: We recruited adult (≥18 years) passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan in February, 2020. All participants had been found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate in Hong Kong, where they were recruited. Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and serum IgG and IgM against internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (upon entering quarantine) and on days 4, 8, and 12 of quarantine. FINDINGS: On Feb 22, 2020, 215 adults were recruited, of whom nine (4%; 95% CI 2–8) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR or serology and were hospitalised. Of these nine patients, nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR was positive in eight patients (89%; 57–99) at baseline. All nine patients were positive for anti-RBD IgG by day 8. Eight (89%; 57–99) were simultaneously positive for nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR and anti-RBD IgG. One patient who was positive for anti-RBD IgG and had a negative viral load had multifocal peripheral ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT that were typical of COVID-19. Five patients (56%; 27–81) with ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT were found to have higher anti-nucleoprotein-IgG OD values on day 8 and 12 and anti-RBD IgG OD value on day 12 than patients without ground-glass changes. Six (67%; 35–88) patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine period. INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19 can develop asymptomatic lung infection with viral shedding and those with evidence of pneumonia on imaging tend to have an increased antibody response. Positive IgG or IgM confirmed infection of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A combination of RT-PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing to facilitate early diagnosis, prompt isolation, and treatment.

628457,"New Variants of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, China, 2011",2012-08-11,"Interpretation of chest radiographs, although clinically highly impactful, entails a disproportionate amount of work relative to low reimbursement for these studies. Increasing volumes of chest radiographs in the thoracic imaging division of an academic radiology practice led to incorporation of two radiology extenders (REs) to draft reports of chest radiographs. We evaluated the difference in productivity and accuracy of the reports drafted by REs versus radiology trainees. Impact on throughput was analyzed by measuring flow rates (number of radiograph interpretations finalized per hour) for four subspecialist attending thoracic radiologists under three conditions: independent interpretation, reviewing RE-drafted cases, and reviewing resident-drafted cases. Improvements were calculated as change in flow rates for the latter two conditions compared with an independent interpretation. Accuracy of RE-drafted reports was compared with that of junior residents by evaluating their draft reports for the same chest radiographs (n = 49). A blinded judging panel of three attending radiologists scored these reports using the 3-point RADPEER scoring system; the original report dictated by an attending radiologist served as the reference standard. RADPEER scores were compared between the REs and residents. Flow rates improved significantly (P < .05) by 52% for RE-drafted cases versus a small improvement (17%) for resident-drafted cases compared with independently completed cases. RE-drafted cases generated 36% greater efficiency for attending radiologists compared with resident-drafted cases (P < .05). There was no significant difference in accuracy scores between RE-drafted and resident-drafted reports. RE-drafted reports were finalized more rapidly by attending radiologists with insignificant differences in discrepancy rates compared with resident-drafted reports.","Borthakur, Arijitt; Barbosa, Eduardo M.; Katz, Sharyn; Knollmann, Friedrich D.; Kahn, Charles E.; Schnall, Mitchell D.; Litt, Harold",J Am Coll Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065074/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144020310048; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.09.044; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1546144020310048,226
628618,The dimer interface of the SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein adapts a porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus-like structure,2005-10-24,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed significant challenges to human wellbeing and survival, particularly among groups of people such as the Sundarbans mangrove forest resource-dependent communities (SMFRDCs), and especially the fishermen in these communities, in developing countries like Bangladesh. It is therefore essential to explore the livelihood conditions, health status and care-seeking behavior of the fishermen in these communities during the ongoing pandemic. This study was carried out by applying mixed methods, including interviews and focus group discussion (FGD), in the three sub-districts of Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat, which are in the southwestern region adjacent to the Sundarbans mangrove forest (SMF) of Bangladesh. Quantitative data were collected from 76 fishermen through telephone interviews, while 24 fishermen participated in three distinct focus group discussions. The findings suggest that the fishermen have experienced a reduction of income, as they have been barred from entering the SMF during the pandemic, which has gradually affected their number of trips to and stays at the forest as well as their catch of fisheries resources. The decline in demand in both regional and international markets has left the fishermen with only a handful of alternative ways to adjust to these unprecedented circumstances, such as borrowing money, selling household assets, and in some extreme cases marrying off young children to reduce the financial burden, as many are now jobless. Their financial hardship during the pandemic has affected their households' capacity to afford basic household necessities, including food, fuel, education, and health expenses. Subsequently, when these fishermen suffer ailments such as fever, cough, headache, and cold – the general symptoms of COVID-19 – they cannot seek medical assistance from trained doctors. Their financial constraints have compelled them to rely on indigenous knowledge, in particular village quack doctors, or in some cases to seek help from local pharmacies for modern medicine. Thus, the government should provide financial support and strengthen the local market value chain so that disadvantaged fishermen in SMFRDCs can adopt alternative livelihood opportunities. Furthermore, longitudinal research on the impacts of COVID-19 on livelihood, local adaptation strategies, health status, and care-seeking behavior is also strongly recommended.","Hossain, Md.

Using DAIO, we performed a systematic study of the proteomes of all human Herpesviridae species to define Strict Ortholog Groups (SOGs). In addition to assessing the taxonomic distribution for each protein based on sequence similarity, we performed a protein domain-architecture analysis for every protein family and computationally inferred gene duplication events. While many herpesvirus proteins have evolved without any detectable gene duplications or domain rearrangements, numerous herpesvirus protein families do exhibit complex evolutionary histories. Some proteins acquired additional domains (e.g., DNA polymerase), whereas others show a combination of domain acquisition and gene duplication (e.g., betaherpesvirus US22 family), with possible functional implications. This novel classification system of SOGs for human Herpesviridae proteins is available through the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR, www.viprbrc.org).","Zmasek, Christian M.; Knipe, David M.; Pellett, Philip E.; Scheuermann, Richard H.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30660046/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219300054; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219300054; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.01.005,226
635628,Vector-borne bacteria in blood of camels in Iran: New data and literature review,2019-04-16,"COVID-19 has become a great challenge across the globe, particularly in developing and densely populated countries, such as India. COVID-19 is extremely infectious and is transmitted via respiratory droplets from infected persons. DM, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent comorbidities associated with COVID-19. It has been observed that COVID-19 is associated with high blood-glucose levels, mainly in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies have shown DM to be a significant risk factor affecting the severity of various kinds of infection. Dysregulated immunoresponse found in diabetic patients plays an important role in exacerbating severity. DM is among the comorbidities linked with mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients. Chronic conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and hypertension, together with changed expression of ACE2, dysregulated immunoresponse, and endothelial dysfunction, may put diabetic patients at risk of greater COVID-19 severity. Therefore, it is important to study specific characteristics of COVID-19 in diabetic people and treat these comorbidities along with COVID-19 infection, mainly among old individuals who are already suffering from serious and critical infections. This review will be helpful in understanding the mechanisms involved in COVID-19 and DM, the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis, management of DM, and associated complications in COVID-19 patients.","Verma, Amit K; Beg, Mirza Masroor Ali; Bhatt, Deepti; Dev, Kapil; Alsahli, Mohammed A; Rahmani, Arshad Husain; Goyal, Yamini",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262317/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s285614,226

Meanwhile, myocardial infarction is and will probably remain the foremost cause of death in the Western world throughout the coming decades. Severe deregulation of the immune system can unnecessarily expand the inflammatory response and participate in target and multiple organ failure, in infection but also in critical illness. Indeed, the course and fate of inflammatory cells observed in severe ST-elevation myocardial infarction (neutrophilia, monocytosis, and lymphopenia) almost perfectly mirror those recently reported in severe coronavirus disease 2019. A pleiotropic proinflammatory imbalance hampers adaptive immunity in favor of uncontrolled innate immunity and is associated with poorer structural and clinical outcomes. The goal of the present review is to gain greater insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this canonical activation and downregulation of the two arms of the immune response in both entities, to better understand their pathophysiology and to open the door to innovative therapeutic options.

DS patients often present with several congenital defects and chronic diseases, including immunity disorders. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) have been seen, which appear to vary with age. At birth, patients present with combined immunodeficiency, with frequent infections that decrease with age. Furthermore, high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 with anti-inflammatory properties and low levels of IL-6 and TNF-α are described in children. The immune system is believed to play an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and it has been associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an exaggerated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that may eventually trigger a severe situation called cytokine storm. On the other hand, genetic features seem to be involved in the predisposition to illness and its severity. Overexpression of DSCR1 and ZAKI-4 inhibits the translocation of activated T lymphocyte nuclear factor (NF-AT) to the nucleus, a main step in the inflammatory responsiveness. We discuss here the possible role of immunology and genetic features of DS in the infection and prognosis in COVID-19.","Altable, Marcos; de la Serna, Juan Moisés",Neurol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04880-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231770/,226

Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), located in the North-west, is one of the poorest provinces in China and national surveys have shown TB has been hyper endemic in NHAR for several decades. As no active surveys had been undertaken since the initiation of the DOTS control program across all of NHAR. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of all clinical records of TB patients registered from January 2005 to September 2009. Poisson regression was performed to investigate the change in incidence over time and accounted for age, sex and county. Length of time on treatment, disease severity and patient delay were assessed by county. RESULTS: More than 30% of patients had been on treatment for over 12 months and 10% for over 3 years, reflecting drug-resistance or failure of DOTS. More than 93% of patients had grade III disease at time of diagnosis and >15% of patients had severe disease grade IV-V in some NHAR counties. Further, 8.8% of patients were not diagnosed for over 6 months from the onset of symptoms; this was as high as 20% in some counties. The reported incidence of TB is most likely grossly underestimated and the data indicate TB is a major public health concern in NHAR. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that active surveillance is necessary to determine the full extent of the burden of TB in NHAR. New control and treatment strategies for TB are required that increase awareness in the health-care system and at the individual and community level.","Yang, Yu Rong; McManus, Donald P; Gray, Darren J; Wang, Xiao Ling; Yang, Shu Kun; Ross, Allen G; Williams, Gail M; Ellis, Magda K",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259484/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-1110,226

While many patients have clinically recovered, little is known about long-term alterations in T cell responses of COVID-19 convalescents. In this study, T cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a long-time COVID-19 clinically recovered (20–26 weeks) cohort (LCR) were measured via flow cytometry and ELISpot. The T cell responses of LCR were comparatively analyzed against an age and sex matched short-time clinically recovered (4–9 weeks) cohort (SCR) and a healthy donor cohort (HD). All volunteers were recruited from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China. Phenotypic analysis showed that activation marker PD-1 expressing on CD4(+) T cells of LCR was still significantly lower than that of HD. Functional analysis indicated that frequencies of Tc2, Th2 and Th17 in LCR were comparable to those of HD, but Tc17 was higher than that of HD. In LCR, compared to the HD, there were fewer IFN-γ producing T cells but more IL-2 secreting T cells. In addition, the circulating Tfh cells in LCR were still slightly lower compared to HD, though the subsets composition had recovered. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in LCR were comparable to that of SCR. Collectively, T cell responses experienced long-term alterations in phenotype and functional potential of LCR cohort. However, after clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses could be sustained at least for six months, which may be helpful in resisting re-infection.

The flow near and behind HCW is easily affected by HCW motion. The flow disturbance induced by HCW walking with swinging arms and legs is a mixing process. The walking HCW displaces air in front of it and carries air in the wake forwardly, meanwhile pressure difference drives air from two lateral sides into the wake. HCW motion (0–5.4 s) indeed induces a little gaseous dispersion, but the residual flow disturbance after HCW stops (5.4 s–25.4 s) induces more gaseous agent spread and it requires more than 30–60 s to approximately recover to the initial state after HCW stops. Although HCW motion indeed affects airborne transmission, but its effect is less important than ventilation design. No matter with or without HCW motion, the ceiling-level exhausts perform much better in controlling airborne transmission than the floor-level exhausts with the same air change rate (12.9 ACH). Smaller air change rate of 6 ACH experiences higher concentration and more gaseous spread than 12.9 ACH. In contrast to the realistic human walking, the simplified motion of a rectangular block produces stronger flow disturbance. Finally surface heating of HCW produces a stronger thermal body plume and enhances turbulence near HCW, thus slightly strengthens airborne transmission.","Hang, Jian; Li, Yuguo; Jin, Ruiqiu",Build Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132314000894; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132314000894; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.03.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288027/,226
649258,Origin and characteristics of the recombinant novel avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus isolate ck/CH/LJL/111054,2014-03-05,"Introduction L’infection à SARS-CoV-2 est à l’origine de syndromes respiratoires aigus sévères pouvant nécessiter un recours aux soins intensifs. Un des enjeux de la pandémie survenue début 2020 est de déterminer les facteurs associés à l’aggravation clinique. Le lien éventuel entre le délai d’accès aux soins et la survenue de formes sévères est mal connu. L’objectif de ce travail est de décrire les caractéristiques des patients hospitalisés pour infection à SARS-CoV-2 selon le délai entre le début des symptômes et l’admission en hospitalisation, afin de déterminer les caractéristiques associées à un délai court (<48h) ou long (>10jours). Matériels et méthodes Ce travail repose sur les données de l’étude observationnelle, prospective, multicentrique NOSO-COR dont les objectifs étaient de décrire les cas d’infection par SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisés. L’analyse a été effectuée sur les données des cas communautaires d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 inclus au sein d’un CHU français du 08/02 au 17/05/2020. Les caractéristiques démographiques, les comorbidités sous-jacentes, les paramètres cliniques et biologiques ont été collectés. Le patient a été suivi jusqu’à la sortie de l’hôpital. Les comparaisons entre les groupes ont été effectuées en utilisant le test de Mann–Whitney (variables quantitatives) et le test du Chi2 (variables qualitatives). Les différentes caractéristiques associées au délai entre début des symptômes et admission en hospitalisation ont été évaluées à l’aide de régression logistique ajustée sur l’âge, le sexe, les comorbidités et les principaux symptômes. Résultats Huit cent vingt-deux patients ont été inclus dans l’analyse. L’âge médian était de 73 ans (IQR : 61–84), 453 (55,1 %) étaient des hommes. Comparés aux patients présentant un délai court entre le début des symptômes et l’hospitalisation, les patients présentant un délai long étaient plus jeunes (médiane 68 vs 82 ans, p <0,001), avaient moins fréquemment de comorbidités cardiovasculaires (38,1 % vs 59,7 %, p <0,001), neurologiques (9,9 % vs 34,7 %, p <0,001) et présentaient plus fréquemment une hospitalisation directe en soins intensifs (24,3 % vs 5,6 %, p <0,001). Ils présentaient plus fréquemment une toux (73,3 % vs 47,9 %, p <0,001), des diarrhées (30,0 % vs 12,5 % p <0,001), des difficultés à respirer (64,4 % vs 48,6 %, p =0,004), une fatigue (71,7 % vs 57,6 %, p =0,009), une anosmie (8,9 % vs 0,7 %, p <0,001), une agueusie (11,7 % vs 1,4 %, p <0,001), et un taux plasmatique de CRP plus élevé (médiane 107,0mg/L vs 49,2, p <0,001). Après analyse multivariée, les variables associées à un délai court entre début des symptômes et hospitalisation étaient l’âge>75 ans (p <0,001), les comorbidités cardiovasculaires (p =0,043) et neurologiques (p =0,009). Les variables associées à un délai long étaient la présence d’une toux (p =0,019), le taux plasmatique de CRP>100mg/L (p =0,003), l’anosmie (p =0,008) et l’agueusie (p =0,018). Conclusion Le délai entre début des symptômes et hospitalisation semble être allongé chez les patients<75 ans et ne présentant pas de comorbidités ; cette population est surreprésentée chez les patients bénéficiant d’une hospitalisation d’emblée en soins intensifs. La détection des signes de gravité et l’accès précoce à l’hospitalisation pourrait être un moyen de limiter la survenue de formes cliniques sévères.","Dananché, C.; Elias, C.; Hénaff, L.; Amour, S.; Kuczewski, E.; Escuret, V.; Lina, B.; Saadatian-Elahi, M.; Vanhems, P.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.06.165; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20303292; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20303292,226

While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing fragmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the “German Corona Consensus Dataset” (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data, in particular for university medicine. METHODS: Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats. RESULTS: A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, medical history, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined. CONCLUSION: GECCO provides a compact, interoperable dataset that can help to make COVID-19 research data more comparable across studies and institutions. The dataset will be further refined in the future by adding domain-specific extension modules for more specialized use cases.","Sass, Julian; Bartschke, Alexander; Lehne, Moritz; Essenwanger, Andrea; Rinaldi, Eugenia; Rudolph, Stefanie; Heitmann, Kai U.; Vehreschild, Jörg J.; von Kalle, Christof; Thun, Sylvia",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349259/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01374-w,226

Telehealth has many promised and proven benefits including convenience to the patient, potentially less distraction from the electronic health record (EHR), saves in travel time and expenses, and lowering patients’ wait time in the clinic. However, there could be some unintended negative consequences including increased clinician burnout due to screen fatigue, potential loss of information due to the limitations of the medium, difficulty discussing sensitive issues and impacts on patient-clinician relationship, empathy, and compassion. In this perspective, we discuss some of the positives and potential negatives of telehealth and highlight some considerations that could guide the choice of media.

Due to the high global prevalence of hypogonadism, the relationship between hypogonadism and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection outcomes deserves an in‐depth study. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of serum testosterone with other laboratory parameters on the prognosis of coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19) in male patients with COVID‐19 diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 358 male patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 and 92 COVID‐19 negative patients admitted to the urology outpatient clinics as a control group. The COVID‐19 patients were divided into groups according to prognosis (mild‐moderate and severe group), lung involvement in chest computed tomography (<50% and >50%), intensive care unit needs, and survival. RESULTS: The measured serum total testosterone level of the COVID‐19 patients group was found to be significantly lower than that of the control group (median, 140 ng/dl; range, 0.21–328, 322 ng/dl; range, median, 125–674, p < 0.001, respectively). The serum TT levels were statistically significantly lower in severe COVID‐19 patients compared to mild‐moderate COVID‐19 patients (median, 85.1 ng/dl; range, 0.21–532, median, 315 ng/dl; range, 0.88–486, p < 0.001, respectively), in COVID‐19 patients in need of intensive care compared to COVID‐19 patients who did not need intensive care (median, 64.0 ng/dl; range, 0.21–337, median, 286 ng/dl; range, 0.88–532 p < 0.001, respectively), and in COVID‐19 patients who died compared to survivors (median, 82.9 ng/dl; range, 2.63–165, median, 166 ng/dl; range, 0.21–532, p < 0.001, respectively).

655923,Genetic diversity of avian infectious bronchitis virus in China in recent years,2018-09-19,"The aim of this paper is twofold. First, black hole algorithm (BHA) is proposed as a new training algorithm for feedforward neural networks (FNNs), since most traditional and metaheuristic algorithms for training FNNs suffer from the problem of slow coverage and getting stuck at local optima. BHA provides a reliable alternative to address these drawbacks. Second, complementary learning components and Levy flight random walk are introduced into BHA to result in a novel optimization algorithm (BHACRW) for the purpose of improving the FNNs’ accuracy by finding optimal weights and biases. Four benchmark functions are first used to evaluate BHACRW’s performance in numerical optimization problems. Later, the classification performance of the suggested models, using BHA and BHACRW for training FNN, is evaluated against seven various benchmark datasets: iris, wine, blood, liver disorders, seeds, Statlog (Heart), balance scale. Experimental result demonstrates that the BHACRW performs better in terms of mean square error (MSE) and accuracy of training FNN, compared to standard BHA and eight well-known metaheuristic algorithms: whale optimization algorithm (WOA), biogeography-based optimizer (BBO), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), genetic algorithm (GA), cuckoo search (CS), multiverse optimizer (MVO), symbiotic organisms search (SOS), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Moreover, we examined the classification performance of the suggested approach on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene expression as a coronavirus receptor, which has been overexpressed in human rhinovirus-infected nasal tissue. Results demonstrate that BHACRW-FNN achieves the highest accuracy on the dataset compared to other classifiers.","Pashaei, Elham; Pashaei, Elnaz",Arab J Sci Eng,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13369-020-05217-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520590/,226
656346,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus S1 protein is the critical inducer of apoptosis,2018-11-07,"BACKGROUND: Although the cause of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is unknown, infection control practices have been shown to play an important role in containing many outbreaks. We investigated the etiology of a cluster of NEC in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit and monitored for new cases following the implementation of enhanced infection control measures. METHODS: Investigators performed a chart and laboratory review for neonates with a diagnosis of NEC during January 1, 2007, to February 13, 2007, to identify risk factors. Enhanced environmental cleaning, cohorting of infants and nurses, and increased attention to hand hygiene were instituted. Commercial feeding products in the unit were tested for bacterial contamination. Close monitoring for new cases continued for 2 months following the identification of the cluster. RESULTS: Eleven cases of NEC were identified during the study period. Patients had a median of 5 disease risk factors (range, 3-8). Four distinct pathogens were detected in blood or stool specimens from 4 different patients. One sample of human milk fortifier (HMF) tested contained a colony count of Bacillus cereus at the US Food and Drug Administration's upper microbiologic limit for contamination. Seven (65%) patients received HMF before symptom onset, and 9 (82%) patients received 1 or more types of liquid formula. Only 1 new case was identified during the period of close monitoring. CONCLUSION: A microbiologic cause was not identified, and, although the cluster might have resolved spontaneously, enhanced infection control and changing batches of HMF might have played a role in controlling this outbreak.","Wendelboe, Aaron M.; Smelser, Chad; Lucero, Cynthia A.; McDonald, L.

Numerous reports have shown that COVID‐19 has a variety of long‐term effects on almost all systems including respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, psychiatric, and dermatological systems. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of the post‐COVID syndrome among COVID‐19 survivors and to determine the factors associated with persistent symptoms. This prospective study enrolled in patients with COVID‐19 followed in hospital or outpatient clinics in Ankara City Hospital. We performed a special questionnaire to inquire about the presence of persistent symptoms beyond 12 weeks from the first diagnosis. Demographic data, comorbid diseases, characteristics of acute COVID‐19, presence of persistent symptoms by systems, and knowledge about outpatient clinic visits after recovery were assessed. Of a total of 1007 participants, 39.0% had at least one comorbidity, and 47.5% had persistent symptoms. Fatigue/easy fatigability, myalgia, and loss of weight were the most frequent persistent symptoms (overall 29.3%) followed by respiratory symptoms (25.4%). A total of 235 participants had visited outpatient clinics due to several reasons during the post‐COVID‐19 period, and 17 of them were hospitalized. Severe acute COVID‐19, hospitalization, and presence of comorbidity were independent factors for the development of persistent symptoms. Fully understanding the spectrum of the post‐COVID syndrome is essential for appropriate management of all its long‐term effects. Our study once again underlined the fact that the prevalence of post‐COVID syndrome is higher than expected and concerns many systems, and a multidisciplinary follow‐up should be provided to COVID‐19 survivors in the post recovery period.","Kayaaslan, Bircan; Eser, Fatma; Kalem, Ayse K.; Kaya, Gamze; Kaplan, Betul; Kacar, Duygu; Hasanoglu, Imran; Coskun, Belgin; Guner, Rahmet",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255355/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27198,226

Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer’s rank model, Fotheringham’s competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer’s rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer’s model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets. Author summary The ability to predict how infectious disease will spread is of great importance in the face of the numerous emergent and re-emergent pathogens that currently threatening human well-being. We identified a variety of alternative models that predict human mobility as as a function of population distribution across a landscape. These consider some models that account for pair-wise interactions between population centers, as well as some that allow for higher-order interactions. We trained the models using a uniquely rich spatiotemporal data set on pre-vaccination measles in England and wales (1944-65), which comprises more than a million records from 954 cities and towns. Likelihood rankings of the different models reveal strong evidence for higher-order interactions in the form of competition among cities as destinations for travelers and, thus, dilution of spatial transmission. The currently most commonly used so-called ‘gravity’ models were far from the best in capturing spatial disease dynamics.","Bjørnstad, Ottar N.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Viboud, Cecile; King, Aaron A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.19.882175,226
664562,Downregulation of miR-218 by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus facilitates viral replication via inhibition of type I interferon responses,2021-04-20,"Feline coronaviruses encode five accessory proteins with largely elusive functions. Here, one of these proteins, called 7b (206 residues), was investigated using a reverse genetic approach established for feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79–1146. Recombinant FIPVs (rFPIVs) expressing mutant and/or FLAG-tagged forms of 7b were generated and used to investigate the expression, processing, glycosylation, localization and trafficking of the 7b protein in rFIPV-infected cells, focusing on a previously predicted ER retention signal, KTEL, at the C-terminus of 7b. The study revealed that 7b is N-terminally processed by a cellular signalase. The cleavage site, 17-Ala|Thr-18, was unambiguously identified by N-terminal sequence analysis of a 7b processing product purified from rFIPV-infected cells. Based on this information, rFIPVs expressing FLAG-tagged 7b proteins were generated and the effects of substitutions in the C-terminal (202)KTEL(206) sequence were investigated. The data show that (i) 7b localizes to and is retained in the medial- and/or trans-Golgi compartment, (ii) the C-terminal KTEL sequence acts as a Golgi [rather than an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)] retention signal, (iii) minor changes in the KTEL motif (such as KTE, KTEV, or the addition of a C-terminal tag) abolish Golgi retention, resulting in relocalization and secretion of 7b, and (iv) a KTEL-to-KDEL replacement causes retention of 7b in the ER of rFIPV-infected feline cells. Taken together, this study provides interesting new insights into an efficient Golgi retention signal that controls the cellular localization and trafficking of the FIPV 7b protein in virus-infected feline cells.","Florek, Dominik; Ehmann, Rosina; Kristen-Burmann, Claudia; Lemmermeyer, Tanja; Lochnit, Günter; Ziebuhr, John; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen; Tekes, Gergely",J Gen Virol,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28758629/,226

Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a non-permissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus. The involvement of macrophages in natural resistance to these viruses is discussed in relation to other putative resistance determinants like interferon production and sensitivity and natural killer cell activity.","Mogensen, Søren C.",Immunology Letters,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165247885901713; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165247885901713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3002974/,226

Although several genes linked to PD are currently identified, PD remains primarily an idiopathic disorder. Neuronal protein α-synuclein is a major player in disease progression of both genetic and idiopathic forms of PD. However, it cannot alone explain underlying pathological processes. Recent studies demonstrate that many other risk factors can accelerate or further worsen brain dysfunction in PD patients. Several PD models, including non-mammalian eukaryotic organisms, have been developed to identify and characterize these factors. This review discusses recent findings in three PD model organisms, i.e., yeast, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans, that opened new mechanisms and identified novel contributors to this disorder. These non-mammalian models share many conserved molecular pathways and cellular processes with humans. New players affecting PD pathogenesis include previously unknown genes/proteins, novel signaling pathways, and low molecular weight substances. These findings might respond to the urgent need to discover novel drug targets for PD treatment and new biomarkers for early diagnostics of this disease. Since the study of neurodegeneration using simple eukaryotic organisms brought a huge amount of information, we include only the most recent or the most important relevant data.","Surguchov, Andrei",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10020407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669308/,226

674874,Topographical mapping of epitopes on the glycoproteins of murine hepatitis virus-4 (strain JHM): Correlation with biological activities,1984-01-30,"During the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), there is a huge demand for medical masks. A mask manufacturer often receives a large amount of orders that must be processed within a short response time. It is of critical importance for the manufacturer to schedule and reschedule mask production tasks as efficiently as possible. However, when the number of tasks is large, most existing scheduling algorithms require very long computational time and, therefore, cannot meet the needs of emergency response. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network, which takes a sequence of production tasks as inputs and produces a schedule of tasks in a real-time manner. The network is trained by reinforcement learning using the negative total tardiness as the reward signal. We applied the proposed approach to schedule emergency production tasks for a medical mask manufacturer during the peak of COVID-19 in China. Computational results show that the neural network scheduler can solve problem instances with hundreds of tasks within seconds. The objective function value obtained by the neural network scheduler is significantly better than those of existing constructive heuristics, and is close to those of the state-of-the-art metaheuristics whose computational time is unaffordable in practice.","Wu, Chen-Xin; Liao, Min-Hui; Karatas, Mumtaz; Chen, Sheng-Yong; Zheng, Yu-Jun",Appl Soft Comput,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494620307286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071685/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106790; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620307286?v=s5,226

While the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD) exist as monomers and bind individual carbohydrates with low affinity and are permissive in nature, the full-length receptors form tetramers through their repeat domain and recognize specific ligands with high affinity. To understand the tetramer-based ligand binding avidity, we determined the crystal structure of DC-SIGNR with its last repeat region. Compared to the carbohydrate-bound CRD structure, the structure revealed conformational changes in the calcium and carbohydrate coordination loops of CRD, an additional disulfide bond between the N and the C termini of the CRD, and a helical conformation for the last repeat. On the basis of the current crystal structure and other published structures with sequence homology to the repeat domain, we generated a tetramer model for DC-SIGN/R using homology modeling and propose a ligand-recognition index to identify potential receptor ligands.","Snyder, Greg A.; Colonna, Marco; Sun, Peter D.",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002228360500121X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15784257/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228360500121X,226

Aim We aimed to study the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction of females and males in Egypt and to evaluate possible predictive factors. Methods Married men and females in Egypt were invited to respond to an online questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed medical history, socioeconomic status, sexual performance satisfaction before and during the lockdown in addition to validated Arabic questionnaires for depression, sexual function in males and females, and sexual satisfaction (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function-5, Index of Sexual Satisfaction, respectively). Main outcome measure The main outcome measures were frequency of depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and sexual satisfaction in males and females during COVID-19 lockdown. Results A total of 479 females and 217 males completed the questionnaire. Sexual satisfaction was significantly higher before (91.2%, 73.5%) than during lockdown (70.5%, 56.2%) in both males and females, respectively. During lockdown, significantly more males (70.5%) reported being satisfied with their sexual performance than females (56.2%) (P < .001). More than half of the male subjects (68.2%) had no erectile dysfunction while 97.3% females scored ≤26.5 on the Female Sexual Function Index scale suggestive of sexual difficulties. Sexual stress was significantly greater in females (70.8%) than males (63.1%). Educational level, occupation, anxiety, and erectile dysfunction were independently associated with sexual stress in males. Being a housewife or unemployed, husband's age >35 years, marriage duration of 5-10 years, anxiety, and female sexual dysfunction were predictors of sexual relation stress in females. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower sexual satisfaction in both genders. Females however suffered more anxiety and depression and thereby greater risk of sexual function difficulties and sexual dissatisfaction. Intervention strategies in order to lessen the suffering of affected individuals particularly after the pandemic are recommended. Omar SS, Dawood W, Eid N, et al.

Using a combination of bioinformatics and computational tools, we modelled the 3D structure of the RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) of SARS-CoV2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and predicted its probable GTP binding pocket in the active site. GTP is crucial for the formation of the initiation complex during RNA replication. This site was computationally targeted using a number of small molecule inhibitors of the hepatitis C RNA polymerase reported previously. Further optimizations suggested a lead molecule that may prove fruitful in the development of potent inhibitors against the RdRp of SARS-CoV2.","Ahmad, Mohammed; Dwivedy, Abhisek; Mariadasse, Richard; Tiwari, Satish; Kar, Deepsikha; Jeyakanthan, Jeyaraman; Biswal, Bichitra K.",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c02096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743211/,226
