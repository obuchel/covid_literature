2988,Chasing viruses feverishly,2017,"A number of viral diseases have emerged and re-emerged in India and globally, in the last few years. Effective prevention and control of these diseases require, in addition to a functioning disease surveillance system, interventions both before and after disease occurrence, and a combination of personal and population services. However, the current efforts to control emerging viral diseases in India has major therapeutic focus (and attention on diagnostic and curative services) and there is limited attention on preventive and promotive components. It is proposed that for an effective and successful control, a systematic approach is adopted with an appropriate selection of personal and population health services, delivered by government through participation of private sector. This is possible through commitment and leadership of Government and other public health agencies, supplemented by multi agency coordination, sufficient funding and an accountability mechanism.","Lahariya, Chandrakant",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5749054/,380
11031,An audit to analyse the two-week wait pathway at an oral cancer specialist district general hospital,2020-05-08,"What drives Catholic priests to continue to serve people? That is the main question behind this psychological study. Based on a working model of compassionate love (Underwood 2008), the priestly compassionate love model was tested to determine whether spirituality, social support, priestly commitment, and well-being simultaneously influence compassionate love, which in turn brings out a positive affect in those doing pastoral ministry. The participants were 256 Catholic priests in Indonesia. Using structural equation modeling, the results of the study showed a good fit. Spirituality was the factor that contributed most strongly to compassionate love. Receiving adequate support from multiple sources motivated the priests to love others. Moreover, priestly commitment also influenced the priests to love others compassionately. Although well-being did not significantly influence compassionate love, it still played an important role in the model because it was correlated with all factors. Finally, the results showed that compassionate love powerfully influenced the priests to be enthusiastic and eager in doing pastoral ministry. These findings are discussed theoretically and practically in the context of priestly life and ministry in Indonesia.

11678,A lifesaving update for the dental team,2020-05-22,"The terms of the United Kingdom's (UK's) departure from the European Union (EU) are currently being negotiated. It is therefore uncertain exactly what effect they will have on planning the UK's oral healthcare workforce. Nevertheless, as 16% of dentists currently registered with the Genral Dental Council (GDC) have migrated to the UK from EU countries, this factor must be taken into consideration by workforce planners. However, it is far from being the only factor. This opinion piece therefore describes the current numbers of non-UK EU dentists and DCPs registered with the GDC and poses the question 'will they remain in the UK in the future'? It then comments on the current legislation on recognition of non-UK dental qualifications. It goes on to consider the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendation for dental practitioners, the oral healthcare needs of the population of the UK, who could address them and the implications for the Advancing Dental Care project","Eaton, Kenneth A.",Br Dent J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243224/,380

19499,Perception of safety from workplace violence affects job satisfaction among doctors practicing modern medicine in India: A nationwide survey,2021-07-02,"The ancestor of cetaceans underwent a macroevolutionary transition from land to water early in the Eocene Period >50 million years ago. However, little is known about how diverse retroviruses evolved during this shift from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Did retroviruses transition into water accompanying their hosts? Did retroviruses infect cetaceans through cross-species transmission after cetaceans invaded the aquatic environments? Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) provide important molecular fossils for tracing the evolution of retroviruses during this macroevolutionary transition. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach to study the origin and evolution of ERVs in cetaceans. We identify a total of 8,724 ERVs within the genomes of 25 cetaceans, and phylogenetic analyses suggest these ERVs cluster into 315 independent lineages, each of which represents one or more independent endogenization events. We find that cetacean ERVs originated through two possible routes. 298 ERV lineages may derive from retrovirus endogenization that occurred before or during the transition from land to water of cetaceans, and most of these cetacean ERVs were reaching evolutionary dead-ends. 17 ERV lineages are likely to arise from independent retrovirus endogenization events that occurred after the split of mysticetes and odontocetes, indicating that diverse retroviruses infected cetaceans through cross-species transmission from non-cetacean mammals after the transition to aquatic life of cetaceans. Both integration time and synteny analyses support the recent or ongoing activity of multiple retroviral lineages in cetaceans, some of which proliferated into hundreds of copies within the host genomes. Although ERVs only recorded a proportion of past retroviral infections, our findings illuminate the complex evolution of retroviruses during one of the most marked macroevolutionary transitions in vertebrate history.","Zheng, Jialu; Wang, Jianhua; Gong, Zhen; Han, Guan-Zhu",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297934/,380

37967,Special care in UDCs,2020-08-14,"In recent years, as more and more experience has been gained with prescribing direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), new research initiatives have emerged in the Netherlands to improve the safety and appropriateness of DOAC treatment for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). These initiatives address several contemporary unresolved issues, such as inappropriate dosing, non-adherence and the long-term management of DOAC treatment. Dutch initiatives have also contributed to the development and improvement of risk prediction models. Although fewer bleeding complications (notably intracranial bleeding) are in general seen with DOACs in comparison with vitamin K antagonists, to successfully identify patients with high bleeding risk and to tailor anticoagulant treatment accordingly to mitigate this increased bleeding risk, is one of the research aims of recent and future years. This review highlights contributions from the Netherlands that aim to address these unresolved issues regarding the anticoagulant management in AF in daily practice, and provides a narrative overview of contemporary stroke and bleeding risk assessment strategies.","Chu, G.; Seelig, J.; Trinks-Roerdink, E.

To leverage benefits in larger enterprises, Agile development methods have to be scaled. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is the most commonly used scaling framework. Performing of the Product Owner role has been identified as crucial in project success in large-scale environments. Staffing the right Product Owner is one of the challenges of adopting SAFe. [Motivation] Research papers focused on Product Owner in SAFe are scarce. Our study outcomes help enterprises to understand the Product Owner role in SAFe and therefore contribute to the removal of challenges with finding the right Product Owners. Additionally, we aim to improve the research community’s understanding of the Product Owner role within the context of SAFe. [Method] Qualitative data were collected through three semi-structured interviews and analyzed using deductive content analysis.

Members of this family contain N- or C-terminal domains that serve to tether the serine protease catalytic domain directly to the plasma membrane. These membrane-anchored serine proteases are proving to be key components of the cell machinery for activation of precursor molecules in the pericellular microenvironment, playing vital functions in the maintenance of homoeostasis. Substrates activated by membrane-anchored serine proteases include peptide hormones, growth and differentiation factors, receptors, enzymes, adhesion molecules and viral coat proteins. In addition, new insights into our understanding of the physiological functions of these proteases and their involvement in human pathology have come from animal models and patient studies. The present review discusses emerging evidence for the diversity of this fascinating group of membrane serine proteases as potent modifiers of the pericellular microenvironment through proteolytic processing of diverse substrates.

Patients in this age group present with a spectrum of diseases different from those of older children or adults. These patients can benefit from the full range of nuclear medicine studies. In these young children, nuclear medicine studies are more likely to be used to evaluate a wide range of congenital conditions but also can be helpful for evaluating acquired conditions such as infection, cancer, and trauma. This review first will cover the general aspects of nuclear medicine practice with these patients, including the special considerations that can help achieve successful diagnostic imaging. These topics will include clinical indications, imaging technology, instrumentation, software, positioning and immobilization, sedation, local and general anesthesia, radiopharmaceutical doses, radiation risk, and dose reduction. The review then will discuss the specific nuclear medicine studies that typically are obtained in patients in this age group.

69897,Phenotypic differences of mutation-negative cases in Gitelman syndrome clinically diagnosed in adulthood.,2020-12-21,"The lack of effective therapies for end-stage lung disease validates the need for stem cell-based therapeutic approaches as alternative treatment options. In contrast with exogenous stem cell sources, the use of resident progenitor cells is advantageous considering the fact that the lung milieu is an ideal and familiar environment, thereby promoting the engraftment and differentiation of transplanted cells. Recent studies have shown the presence of multipotent 'mesenchymal stem cells' in the adult lung. The majority of these reports are, however, limited to animal models, and to date, there has been no report of a similar cell population in adult human lung parenchyma. Here, we show the identification of a population of primary human lung parenchyma (pHLP) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from intraoperative normal lung parenchyma biopsies. Surface and intracellular immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed that cultures do not contain alveolar type I epithelial cells or Clara cells, and are devoid of the following hematopoietic markers: CD34, CD45 and CXCR4. Cells show an expression pattern of surface antigens characteristic of MSCs, including CD73, CD166, CD105, CD90 and STRO-1. As per bone marrow MSCs, our pHLP cells have the ability to differentiate along the adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic mesodermal lineages when cultured in the appropriate conditions. In addition, when placed in small airway growth media, pHLP cell cultures depict the expression of aquaporin 5 and Clara cell secretory protein, which is identified with that of alveolar type I epithelial cells and Clara cells, respectively, thereby exhibiting the capacity to potentially differentiate into airway epithelial cells. Further investigation of these resident cells may elucidate a therapeutic cell population capable of lung repair and/or regeneration.","Karoubi, Golnaz; Cortes-Dericks, Lourdes; Breyer, Isabel; Schmid, Ralph A; Dutly, André E",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,https://doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.2009.73; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19652646/,380
71654,Investing your money - what does the future hold?,2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVES The 2019 novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is causing cases of severe pneumonia. Lung ultrasound (LUS) could be a useful tool for physicians detecting a bilateral heterogeneous patchy distribution of pathologic findings in a symptomatic suggestive context. The aim of this study was to focus on the implications of limiting LUS examinations to specific regions of the chest. METHODS Patients were evaluated with a standard sequence of LUS scans in 14 anatomic areas. A scoring system of LUS findings was reported, ranging from 0 to 3 (worst score, 3). The scores reported on anterior, lateral, and posterior landmarks were analyzed separately and compared with each other and with the global findings. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. A higher prevalence of score 0 was observed in the anterior region (44.08%). On the contrary, 21.05% of posterior regions and 13.62% of lateral regions were evaluated as score 3, whereas only 5.92% of anterior regions were classified as score 3. Findings from chest computed tomography performed in 16 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 correlated with and matched the distribution of findings from LUS. CONCLUSIONS To assess the quantity and severity of lung disease, a comprehensive LUS examination is recommended. Omitting areas of the chest misses involved lung.","Smargiassi, Andrea; Soldati, Gino; Torri, Elena; Mento, Federico; Milardi, Domenico; Giacomo, Paola Del; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Burzo, Maria Livia; Larici, Anna Rita; Pompili, Maurizio; Demi, Libertario; Inchingolo, Riccardo",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jum.15428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815618/,380
74952,How eco-friendly are our toothbrushes?,2020-09-01,"Novel wearable devices for heart rhythm analysis using either photoplethysmography (PPG) or electrocardiogram (ECG) are in daily clinical practice. This survey aimed to assess impact of these technologies on physicians' clinical decision-making and to define, how data from these devices should be presented and integrated into clinical practice. The online survey included 22 questions, focusing on the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) based on wearable rhythm device recordings, suitable indications for wearable rhythm devices, data presentation and processing, reimbursement, and future perspectives. A total of 539 respondents {median age 38 [interquartile range (IQR) 34-46] years, 29% female} from 51 countries world-wide completed the survey. Whilst most respondents would diagnose AF (83%), fewer would initiate oral anticoagulation therapy based on a single-lead ECG tracing. Significantly fewer still (27%) would make the diagnosis based on PPG-based tracing. Wearable ECG technology is acceptable for the majority of respondents for screening, diagnostics, monitoring, and follow-up of arrhythmia patients, while respondents were more reluctant to use PPG technology for these indications. Most respondents (74%) would advocate systematic screening for AF using wearable rhythm devices, starting at patients' median age of 60 (IQR 50-65) years. Thirty-six percent of respondents stated that there is no reimbursement for diagnostics involving wearable rhythm devices in their countries. Most respondents (56.4%) believe that costs of wearable rhythm devices should be shared between patients and insurances. Wearable single- or multiple-lead ECG technology is accepted for multiple indications in current clinical practice and triggers AF diagnosis and treatment. The unmet needs that call for action are reimbursement plans and integration of wearable rhythm device data into patient's files and hospital information systems.","Manninger, Martin; Zweiker, David; Svennberg, Emma; Chatzikyriakou, Sofia; Pavlovic, Nikola; Zaman, Junaid A B; Kircanski, Bratislav; Lenarczyk, Radoslaw; Vanduynhoven, Philippe; Kosiuk, Jedrzej; Potpara, Tatjana; Duncker, David","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euab064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842972/,380

The sensitivity of different experiments depends strongly on the ALP mass and its couplings to leptons and photons. For ALPs that can be resonantly produced, the sensitivity of three-body decays such as μ→3e and τ→3μ exceeds by many orders of magnitude that of radiative decays like μ→eγ and τ→μγ. Searches for these two types of processes are therefore highly complementary. We discuss experimental constraints on ALPs with a single dominant lepton-flavor-violating coupling. Allowing for one or more such couplings offers qualitatively new ways to explain the anomalies related to the magnetic moments of the muon or the electron. The explanation of both anomalies requires lepton-flavor-nonuniversal or lepton-flavor-violating ALP couplings.","Bauer, Martin; Neubert, Matthias; Renner, Sophie; Schnubel, Marvin; Thamm, Andrea",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.211803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530685/,380

This plays a major role in COVID-19 severity and poor disease prognosis, even death. Higher levels of inflammatory hallmarks including C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimers, and cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) have been reported. Many anti-viral drugs have been tried, but none were proven fully effective. Supportive care and management of the complications that are caused mainly by inflammation might be the key to greater survival rates and shorter hospitalization (e.g., the use of remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir (arbidol), oseltamivir, ganciclovir, favipiravir, darunavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, anakinra, canakinumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, Type 1 interferon, interferon β-1a, interferon α- 2b, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, fedratinib, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone). However, the efficacy of these treatments still needs well-planned clinical trials. In such trials, careful attention must be paid to the duration of the treatment, the onset of beneficial effects, and the severity of the disease, otherwise, the outcomes may still remain inconclusive.

Less-invasive collection methods are indispensable in a pandemic scenario as large-scale tests are necessary to understand the actual evolution of contagion in different populations, thus enabling decision-making based on scientific evidence. Saliva has been shown to be an alternative for diagnosing viral infections as this biological fluid can be easily and quickly collected without using specific devices and causing less discomfort during collection, which is an important factor for use in children. Despite the smaller percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 among children, they seem to play an important role in the contagion as they have the same potential of transmission as that of adults. Knowing the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in children is extremely important, mainly regarding the changing in rules of social distancing, such as re-opening schools and recreational activities spaces. In addition, countless cases of a severe multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome that shares clinical and laboratory features with Kawasaki's disease have been recently related to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, adolescents and young adults. In view of this scenario, the aim of this study was to present saliva as an alternative for seeking diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19 in children, including adequate sample collection techniques for different age groups.","Santos, Catielma Nascimento; Rezende, Karla Mayra; Oliveira Neto, Nilson Ferreira de; Okay, Thelma Suely; Braz-Silva, Paulo Henrique; Bönecker, Marcelo",Brazilian oral research,https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2020.vol34.0125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237122/,380

The aim of our study is to analyze how the lockdown and its related sanitary policies affected post-bariatric patients' behaviors towards the delay of their procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS A 7-item questionnaire was administered to all patients. Change in the desire to be subjected to body contouring procedures was recorded. Smoking status, level of training during quarantine and psychological co-morbidities were also evaluated. RESULTS 124 patients completed the questionnaire. Data analysis showed that none of them encountered a decrease of the desire to be subjected to post-bariatric plastic surgery procedures.

Finding existing research in LGBT health can prove challenging due to the plethora of terminology used. We sought to describe existing search strategies and to identify more comprehensive LGBT search terminology. We iteratively created a search string to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses about LGBT health and implemented it in Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases on May 28-29, 2015. We hand-searched the journal LGBT Health. Inclusion criteria were: systematic reviews and meta-analyses that addressed LGBT health, used systematic searching, and used independent coders for inclusion. The published search terminology in each record and search strings provided by authors on request were cross-referenced with our original search to identify additional terminology. Our search process identified 19 systematic reviews meeting inclusion criteria. The number of search terms used to identify LGBT-related records ranged from 1 to 31. From the included studies, we identified 46 new search terms related to LGBT health. We removed five search terms as inappropriate and added five search terms used in the field. The resulting search string included 82 terms. There is room to improve the quality of searching and reporting in LGBT health systematic reviews.

103457,EMD for non-surgical periodontal therapy.,2020-11-01,"Myxoma virus (MV) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) are the major causes of lethal viral diseases in the European rabbit. In 2010, a new RHDV genotype (RHDV2) emerged in the field that had limited cross-protection with the classical RHDV (RHDV1). For optimal protection of rabbits and preventing spread of disease, a vaccine providing protection against all three key viruses would be ideal. Therefore, a novel trivalent myxoma vectored RHDV vaccine (Nobivac Myxo-RHD PLUS) was developed similar to the existing bivalent myxoma vectored RHDV vaccine Nobivac Myxo-RHD. The new vaccine contains the Myxo-RHDV1 strain already included in Nobivac Myxo-RHD and a similarly produced Myxo-RHDV2 strain. This paper describes several key safety and efficacy studies conducted for European licensing purposes. Nobivac Myxo-RHD PLUS showed to be safe for use in rabbits from five weeks of age onwards, including pregnant rabbits, and did not spread from vaccinated rabbits to in-contact controls. Furthermore, protection to RHDV1 and RHDV2 was demonstrated by challenge, while the serological response to MV was similar to that after vaccination with Nobivac Myxo-RHD. Therefore, routine vaccination with Nobivac Myxo-RHD PLUS can prevent the kept rabbit population from these major viral diseases.","Reemers, Sylvia; Peeters, Leon; van Schijndel, Joyce; Bruton, Beth; Sutton, David; van der Waart, Leo; van de Zande, Saskia",Vaccines,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764375/,380

104227,Coronavirus and analgesics.,2020-04-01,"Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are members of the family Filoviridae (""filoviruses"") and cause severe hemorrhagic fever with human case fatality rates of up to 90%. Filovirus infection requires fusion of the host cell and virus membranes, a process that is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP). GP contains two subunits, the surface subunit (GP1), which is responsible for cell attachment, and the transmembrane subunit (GP2), which catalyzes membrane fusion. The GP2 ectodomain contains two heptad repeat regions, N-terminal and C-terminal (NHR and CHR, respectively), that adopt a six-helix bundle during the fusion process. The refolding of this six-helix bundle provides the thermodynamic driving force to overcome barriers associated with membrane fusion. Here we report the crystal structure of the MARV GP2 core domain in its postfusion (six-helix bundle) conformation at 1.9 Å resolution. The MARV GP2 core domain backbone conformation is virtually identical to that of EBOV GP2 (reported previously), and consists of a central NHR core trimeric coiled coil packed against peripheral CHR α-helices and an intervening loop and helix-turn-helix segments. We previously reported that the stability of the MARV GP2 postfusion structure is highly pH-dependent, with increasing stability at lower pH [Harrison, J. S., Koellhoffer, J. K., Chandran, K., and Lai, J. R. (2012) Biochemistry51, 2515-2525]. We hypothesized that this pH-dependent stability provides a mechanism for conformational control such that the postfusion six-helix bundle is promoted in the environments of appropriately mature endosomes. In this report, a structural rationale for this pH-dependent stability is described and involves a high-density array of core and surface acidic side chains at the midsection of the structure, termed the ""anion stripe"". In addition, many surface-exposed salt bridges likely contribute to the stabilization of the postfusion structure at low pH. These results provide structural insights into the mechanism of MARV GP2-mediated membrane fusion.","Koellhoffer, Jayne F; Malashkevich, Vladimir N; Harrison, Joseph S; Toro, Rafael; Bhosle, Rahul C; Chandran, Kartik; Almo, Steven C; Lai, Jonathan R",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi300976m; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22935026/,380
109289,A complete disinfection range for dentistry.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Undernutrition is one of the most common problems among people living with HIV, contributing to premature death and the development of comorbidities within this population. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the impacts of these often inter-related conditions appear in a series of fragmented and inconclusive studies. Thus, this review examines the pooled effects of undernutrition on mortality and morbidities among adults living with HIV in SSA. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted from PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus databases. All observational studies reporting the effects of undernutrition on mortality and morbidity among adults living with HIV in SSA were included. Heterogeneity between the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q-test and I2 statistics. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's and Begg's tests at a 5% significance level. Finally, a random-effects meta-analysis model was employed to estimate the overall adjusted hazard ratio. RESULTS Of 4309 identified studies, 53 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Of these, 40 studies were available for the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 23 cohort studies indicated that undernutrition significantly (AHR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8, 2.4) increased the risk of mortality among adults living with HIV, while severely undernourished adults living with HIV were at higher risk of death (AHR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.9, 2.8) as compared to mildly undernourished adults living with HIV. Furthermore, the pooled estimates of ten cohort studies revealed that undernutrition significantly increased the risk of developing tuberculosis (AHR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6, 2.7) among adults living with HIV. CONCLUSION This review found that undernutrition has significant effects on mortality and morbidity among adults living with HIV. As the degree of undernutrition became more severe, mortality rate also increased. Therefore, findings from this review may be used to update the nutritional guidelines used for the management of PLHIV by different stakeholders, especially in limited-resource settings.","Alebel, Animut; Demant, Daniel; Petrucka, Pammla; Sibbritt, David",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05706-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390160/,380

Case Report A 22-year-old man involved in a motor vehicle accident developed a blowout fracture of the left orbital roof penetrating the frontal lobe, inducing oculorrhea. He underwent a supraorbital craniotomy for removal of the bony fragment and skull base reconstruction using a pericranial flap. Methods A systematic review of the database was performed to identify all prior cases of traumatic oculorrhea. Results Twenty-two reported cases met inclusion criteria for subsequent analysis. Oculorrhea developed due to blunt and penetrating head injury in 14 (64%) and 8 patients (36%), respectively. The most common mechanisms were car accidents, stab wounds, falls, and gunshot wounds. Ocular signs and symptoms-including visual loss, ophthalmoplegia, and pupillary dysfunction-were commonly associated findings. Initial conservative management was successful in four patients. Thirteen patients underwent initial surgical intervention, and three additional patients required operative intervention following failed conservative treatment. Conclusion Although oculorrhea rarely develops following severe orbital trauma, suspicion should nevertheless be maintained to facilitate more prompt diagnosis and management. The decision for conservative versus surgical management often depends on the severity of the fracture and dural injury.","Pease, Matthew; Marquez, Yvette; Tuchman, Alex; Markarian, Alex; Zada, Gabriel",Journal of neurological surgery reports,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1347902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23943723/,380

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of mechanical pleurodesis after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. METHODS In our parallel-group, prospective, randomized, controlled trail at 2 hospitals in China, 289 patients were enrolled from January 2010 to January 2013. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive thoracoscopic wedge resection only (WR group) or thoracoscopic wedge resection and mechanical pleurodesis (WR+MP group). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT01463553). RESULTS Intraoperative bleeding and postoperative pleural drainage were significantly lower in the thoracoscopic WR only group. Postoperative recurrence rate did not significantly differ between groups (log-rank test p=0.791; Breslow test p=0.722). In the thoracoscopic WR only group, no recurrences were found when bullae were isolated or limited; recurrence was 7.5% with the presence of multiple bullae. Younger patients had an increased risk of recurrence (relative risk 3.015; 95% confidence interval 1.092 to 8.324). CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic mechanical pleurodesis did not significantly decrease primary spontaneous pneumothorax recurrence compared with simple wedge resection, but intraoperative bleeding and postoperative pleural drainage rates were higher.

Here, we demonstrate that p6 has an N-terminal region-cytoplasm-C-terminal region-cytoplasm configuration with residues 2 to 37 likely membrane embedded. Expression of p6, or of its N-terminal 41-amino-acid region, in the absence of other viral proteins, induced the formation of membranous structures, some of which were similar to double membrane vesicles involved in virus replication. Consistent with a role in virus replication, p6 partially colocalized with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a marker for virus replication complexes. Further, while the C-terminal region is required for preventing STAT1 translocation to the nucleus, our results also indicated that the N-terminal 18 amino acids were necessary for maximal inhibition. Collectively, these results support the notion that p6 is a two-domain protein, although the function of each is not completely independent of the other.","Zhou, Haixia; Ferraro, Debra; Zhao, Jincun; Hussain, Snawar; Shao, Jianqiang; Trujillo, Jonathan; Netland, Jason; Gallagher, Thomas; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02570-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20106914/,380

We contribute to the literature by providing detailed health indicators for homeless Hispanics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine health disparities between housed and homeless Hispanics. Bivariate analysis, as well as data coded from interviews, indicated that homeless Hispanics were more likely to have barriers to care, less likely to have health insurance, slightly more likely than housed Hispanics to experience mental illness, alcoholism, and addiction, and more likely to be underdiagnosed for health problems, including hypertension. This study shows how certain traditional methods for collecting health data, including self-rated health and reported diagnoses, can be ineffective at revealing health disparities.

The present study aimed to investigate the host inflammatory response signature‑caused by SARS‑CoV‑2 in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). The expression level of angiotensin‑converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the human cornea was determined via immunofluorescence. In vitro experiments were performed in HCECs stimulated with the SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein. Moreover, the expression levels of ACE2, IL‑8, TNF‑α, IL‑6, gasdermin D (GSDMD) and IL‑1β in HCECs were detected using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and/or western blotting. It was identified that ACE2 was expressed in normal human corneal epithelium and HCECs cultured in vitro. Furthermore, the expression levels of IL‑8, TNF‑α and IL‑6 in HCECs were decreased following SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein stimulation, while the expression levels of GSDMD and IL‑1β were increased. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that the SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein suppressed the host inflammatory response and induced pyroptosis in HCECs.

OBJECTIVE To perform a follow-up survey to assess changes in PPE-preparedness across six Asia-Pacific countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A prospective follow-up cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between 10/08/2020 to 01/09/ 2020, five months after the initial Phase 1 survey. The survey was sent to the same 231 intensivists across the six Asia-Pacific countries (Australia, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Philippines, and Singapore) that participated in Phase 1. The main outcome measure was to identify any changes in PPE-preparedness between Phases 1 and 2. FINDINGS Phase 2 had responses from 132 ICUs (57%). Compared to Phase 1 respondents reported increased use of PPE-based practices such as powered air-purifying respirator (40.2% vs. 6.1%), N95-masks at all times (86.4% vs. 53.7%) and double-gloving (87.9% vs. 42.9%). The reported awareness of PPE stocks (85.6% vs. 51.9%), mandatory showering policies following PPE-breach (31.1% vs. 6.9%) and safety perception amongst HCWs (60.6% vs. 28.4%) improved significantly during Phase 2. Despite reported statistically similar adoption rate of the buddy system in both phases (42.4% vs. 37.2%), there was a reported reduction in donning/doffing training in Phase 2 (44.3% vs. 60.2%). There were no reported differences HCW training in other areas, such as tracheal intubation, intra-hospital transport and safe waste disposal, between the 2 phases. CONCLUSIONS Overall reported PPE-preparedness improved between the two survey periods, particularly in PPE use, PPE inventory and HCW perceptions of safety. However, the uptake of HCW training and implementation of low-cost safety measures continued to be low and the awareness of PPE breach management policies were suboptimal. Therefore, the key areas for improvement should focus on regular HCW training, implementing low-cost buddy-system and increasing awareness of PPE-breach management protocols.","Gullapalli, Navya; Lim, Zheng Jie; Ramanathan, Kollengode; Bihari, Shailesh; Haji, Jumana; Shekar, Kiran; Wong, Wai Tat; Rajamani, Arvind; Subramaniam, Ashwin",Australian critical care : official journal of the Confederation of Australian Critical Care Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2021.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965312/,380

We conducted an analysis of SAG infections to assist clinicians in understanding their burden and clinical outcomes. METHODS A retrospective study of medical records, identifying invasive SAG bacteria of sterile-site isolates that were managed from May 2015 to April 2017, at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, site of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome were recorded and analyzed to identify factors associated with poor outcome and/or polymicrobial growth. RESULTS We identified 105 cases of SAG infections in adults, with 52% of the patients being male and the mean age of 52.4 years with comorbidities occurring in more than half of the cases such as diabetes (38%) and malignancy (15%). Overall mortality was 6%, and it was statistically associated with age older than 65 years, polymicrobial growth and a history of malignancy. The infection frequencies were skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI; 55%), intra-abdominal infections (24%), bacteremia (14%), genitourinary infections (8.5%), and pleuropulmonary infections (5%). Abscesses accounted for 68% of cases. Polymicrobial infection (46%) with Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative anaerobes coincided with SAG infection. Polymicrobial growth was significantly associated with abscess formation, intra-abdominal source of infections, and poor outcome. In addition, death in patients with SAG was statistically associated with patients older than 65 years of age and those with history of cancer or transplant. CONCLUSION SSTIs and intra-abdominal infections are the most common clinical presentations in our cohort. Bacteremia was uncommon; however, the prognosis is less favorable. Overall susceptibility to penicillin was 91%, therefore β-lactam antibiotics are the drug of choice and additional coverage for anaerobic and gram-negative bacteria should be considered for intra-abdominal collection and solid or organ abscesses.","Al Majid, F; Aldrees, A; Barry, M; Binkhamis, K; Allam, A; Almohaya, A",Journal of infection and public health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.07.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917555/,380

Surgical management using free grafts and guided tissue regeneration.,2011,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In acute ischemic stroke patients treated by intravenous thrombolysis, a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) is an independent factor of functional outcomes. Our aim was to assess the impact of pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS on outcomes after endovascular therapy, with a specific emphasis on recanalization. METHODS We analyzed data collected between April 2007 and March 2013 in a prospective clinical registry of acute ischemic stroke patients treated by endovascular approach. Every patient with a documented internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion who underwent an acute DWI-MRI before treatment was eligible for this study. The primary outcome was a favorable outcome defined by modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 at 90 days. RESULTS Two hundred ten patients were included and median DWI-ASPECTS was 7 (interquartile range, 4-8). DWI-ASPECTS≥5 was the optimal threshold to predict a favorable outcome (area under the curve=0.69; sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 38%). In a multivariate analysis including confounding variables, the adjusted odds ratio for favorable outcomes associated with a DWI-ASPECTS of ≥5 was 5.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.86-13.77; P=0.002). Nonetheless, the occurrence of a complete recanalization was associated with an increased rate of favorable outcomes in patients with DWI-ASPECTS under 5 (50% versus 3%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS DWI-ASPECTS≥5 seems to be the optimal threshold to predict favorable outcomes among patients undergoing endovascular reperfusion within 6 hours. Selected patients with a DWI-ASPECTS of <5 may still benefit when a complete reperfusion is achieved.","Inoue, Manabu; Olivot, Jean-Marc; Labreuche, Julien; Mlynash, Michael; Tai, Waimea; Albucher, Jean-François; Meseguer, Elena; Amarenco, Pierre; Mazighi, Mikael",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.005084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923724/,380

They show low levels of information and of concern regarding the possibility of contagion and infection but presented substantially stable levels of psychotic symptoms and even increased subjective well being during the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, as well as the prolonged social isolation and the spread of misinformation, appear to be responsible in some cases for the onset of psychotic symptoms. SUMMARY Clinicians should inform and educate their patients on the risks related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 and on the precautions that they should adopt to avoid contagion. Particular attention should be devoted to maintaining the continuity of care, especially in frail patients. Telemedicine might represent a valid support, but face-to-face visits in some cases remain essential. The hypothesis of a direct role of viral infection on the onset of psychotic disorders is currently debated, as viral involvement of central nervous system appears to be rather infrequent in COVID-19.","Barlati, Stefano; Nibbio, Gabriele; Vita, Antonio",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587494/,380

199479,Affordable electric toothbrush with LED whitening technology,2021,"OBJECTIVES During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, health care workers (HCWs) experienced unusual stressors. The study hospital introduced psychosocial interventions to help HCWs. This study aimed to examine the coping strategies adopted by the emergency department (ED) HCWs who cared for the SARS patients. METHODS In November 2003, a self-administered questionnaire of physicians and nurses was conducted in the hospital ED that is the national SARS screening center in Singapore. Data collected included demographics and responses to these instruments: 1) the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) to assess coping strategies, 2) the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to measure psychological reactions, and 3) the General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ 28) to measure psychiatric morbidity. RESULTS Thirty-eight of 41 (92.7%) physicians and 58 of 83 (69.9%) nurses responded. The respondents reported a preference for problem-focused and emotion-focused coping measures. The physicians chose humor as a coping response significantly more frequently (p < 0.001) than nurses, scoring 9.61/16 (95% CI = 8.52 to 10.69), compared with the nurses' score of 7.05/16 (95% CI = 6.28 to 7.83). The Filipino HCWs turned to religion as a coping response significantly more frequently (p < 0.001) than the non-Filipino HCWs, scoring 14.38/16 (95% CI = 13.33 to 15.42), compared with 9.93/16 (95% CI = 9.00 to 10.87) for the non-Filipinos. Psychiatric morbidity was 17.7% on the IES and 18.8% on the GHQ 28, with the trend for physicians to report lower psychiatric morbidity. CONCLUSIONS With a supportive hospital environment, ED HCWs chose adaptive coping in response to the outbreak and reported low psychiatric morbidity. Physicians chose humor and Filipinos chose turning to religion as their preferred responses. Psychosocial interventions to help HCWs need to take these preferences into account.","Phua, D H; Tang, H K; Tham, K Y",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15805323/,380

207074,Off-screen learning,2020,"PURPOSE: The Trial of Aggregate Data Exchange for Maintenance of Certification and Raising Quality was a randomized controlled trial which first had to test whether quality reporting could be a by-product of clinical care. We report on the initial descriptive study of the capacity for and quality of exchange of whole-panel, standardized quality measures from health systems. METHODS: Family physicians were recruited from 4 health systems with mature quality measurement programs and agreed to submit standardized, physician-level quality measures for consenting physicians. Identified measure or transfer errors were captured and evaluated for root-cause problems. RESULTS: The health systems varied considerably by patient demographics and payer mix. From the 4 systems, 256 family physicians elected to participate. Of 19 measures negotiated for use, 5 were used by all systems. There were more than 15 types of identified errors including breaks in data delivery, changes in measures, and nonsensical measure results. Only 1 system had no identified errors. CONCLUSIONS: The secure transfer of standardized, physician-level quality measures from 4 health systems with mature measure processes proved difficult. There were many errors that required human intervention and manual repair, precluding full automation. This study reconfirms an important problem, namely, that despite widespread health information technology adoption and federal meaningful use policies, we remain far from goals to make clinical quality reporting a reliable by-product of care.","Phillips, Robert L; Peterson, Lars; Palen, Ted E; Fields, Scott A; Parchman, Michael L; Johannides, John",Ann Fam Med,,380

211163,Estimates of regional infectivity of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom following imposition of social distancing measures,2021,"The use of organic mulch is important for urban green applications. For urban areas in arid and semiarid regions receiving short high-intensive rainfall, rainfall characteristics, and soil slope play an important role for mulch functioning. These properties of mulch were studied. For this purpose, rainfall simulation experiments using organic mulching were conducted in Jiufeng National Forestry Park to analyze the influence of organic mulch under different slope and heavy rainfall events. The results showed that soil water content displayed a decreasing tendency with increasing mulch application. Compared to bare soil, a mulch application of 0.25 kg/m2 and 0.50 kg/m2 led to maximum soil water content and maximum runoff decrease occurred for 0.50 kg/m2 mulch. Higher application rate of mulch displayed less soil water content and greater runoff. The runoff amount and runoff generation rate decreased by 28-83% and 21-83%, respectively, as compared to bare soil. With a mulch application of 0.25-1.00 kg/m2, soil drainage accounted for 56-60% of total rainfall. Overall, an efficient mulch application was found to be 0.25-0.50 kg/m2. The results of this study are relevant for arid and semiarid urban regions that experience heavy rainfall.","Wang, Bing; Niu, Jianzhi; Berndtsson, Ronny; Zhang, Linus; Chen, Xiongwen; Li, Xiang; Zhu, Zhijun",Sci Rep,,380

236523,For patient confidence in your practice,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have prompted more engagement in prosocial activities, such as volunteering and support transactions. The day-to-day affective and social implications of these activities for adults of different ages are unknown. The current study examined associations of daily prosocial activities with affective and social well-being, and whether these associations varied by age. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants ages 18-91 in Canada and the United States (N = 1,028) completed surveys for 7 consecutive evenings about their daily experiences of COVID-19-related prosocial activities (formal volunteering, support provision, support receipt), positive and negative affect, and satisfaction with social activities and relationships. Analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling and accounted for a range of potential confounding factors (e.g., sociodemographics, work, family, caregiving, daily stressors). RESULTS: Older age predicted more frequent formal volunteering, as well as more support provision and support receipt due to COVID-19. In particular, middle-aged and older adults provided more emotional support than younger adults, middle-aged adults provided the most tangible support, and older adults received the most emotional support. All three types of prosocial activities were associated with higher positive affect and greater social satisfaction on days when they occurred. Providing COVID-19-related support further predicted lower same-day negative affect. Age did not significantly moderate these associations. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Older age was related to more frequent engagement in prosocial activities during the COVID-19 crisis. These activities were associated with improved daily affective and social well-being for adults of all ages.","Sin, Nancy L; Klaiber, Patrick; Wen, Jin H; DeLongis, Anita",GerontologistGerontologist,,380
236524,For patient confidence in your practice,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in characteristics and management among ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: Our prospective, monocentric study enrolled all STEMI patients who underwent PPCI during the COVID-19 outbreak (n = 83). This cohort was first compared with a previous cohort of STEMI patients (2008-2017, n = 1,552 patients) and was then dichotomized into a non-COVID-19 group (n = 72) and COVID-19 group (n = 11). RESULTS: In comparison with the pre-outbreak period, patients during the outbreak period were older (59.6 ± 12.9 vs. 62.6 ± 12.2, p = .03) with a delayed seek to care (mean delay first symptoms-balloon 3.8 ± 3 vs. .7.4 ± 7.7, p < .001) resulting in a two-fold higher in-hospital mortality (non COVID-19 4.3% vs. COVID-19 8.4%, p = .07). Among the 83 STEMI patients admitted during the outbreak period, 11 patients were infected by COVID-19. Higher biological markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein: 28 ± 39 vs. 98 ± 97 mg/L, p = .04), of fibrinolysis (D-dimer: 804 ± 1,500 vs. 3,128 ± 2,458 µg/L, p = .02), and antiphospholipid antibodies in four cases were observed in the COVID-19 group. In this group, angiographic data also differed: a thrombotic myocardial infarction nonatherosclerotic coronary occlusion (MINOCA) was observed in 11 cases (1.4% vs. 54.5%, p < .001) and associated with higher post-procedure distal embolization (30.6% vs. 72.7%, p = .007). The in hospital mortality was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (5.6% vs. 27.3%, p = .016). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak implies deep changes in the etiopathogenesis and therapeutic management of STEMI patients with COVID-19. The impact on early and long-term outcomes of systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability in this specific population is warranted.","Popovic, Batric; Varlot, Jeanne; Metzdorf, Pierre Adrien; Jeulin, Hélène; Goehringer, François; Camenzind, Edoardo",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,380

It relies on clinical material and on popular culture. The purpose is twofold. First, to exemplify the unique contribution of psychoanalysis for decoding both the political narrative and its reception thus helping understand and better address societal challenges. Second, to inform the debate in the political sciences as to what is a good crisis management strategy. The main argument is that an effective communication, in general, but especially in emergency situations, needs to allow for the unconscious responses to both the danger itself and to the measures imposed to deal with it. Failure to consider this unconscious dimension impacts on the effectiveness of the policy.

240099,Investing your money - what does the future hold?,2021,"We examined the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cynomolgus macaques for 28 days to establish an animal model of COVID-19 for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed body temperature rises and X-ray radiographic pneumonia without life-threatening clinical signs of disease. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes producing interferon (IFN)-Î³ specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N-protein were detected on day 14 in one of three macaques with viral pneumonia. In the other two macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes producing IFN-Î³ specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14, suggesting that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of similar symptoms to approximately 80% of patients, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs for humans.","Ishigaki, Hirohito; Nakayama, Misako; Kitagawa, Yoshinori; Nguyen, Cong Thanh; Hayashi, Kaori; Shiohara, Masanori; Gotoh, Bin; Itoh, Yasushi",Virology,,380

In Part I, an extensive background of social distancing is provided, and enabling wireless technologies are thoroughly surveyed. In this Part II, emerging technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g., symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact tracing. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges (e.g., privacy-preserving, scheduling, and incentive mechanisms) in implementing social distancing in practice. As an example, instead of reacting with ad-hoc responses to COVID-19-like pandemics in the future, smart infrastructures (e.g., next-generation wireless systems like 6G, smart home/building, smart city, intelligent transportation systems) should incorporate a pandemic mode in their standard architectures/designs.","Nguyen, Cong T.; Saputra, Yuris Mulya; Van Huynh, Nguyen; Nguyen, Ngoc-Tan; Khoa, Tran Viet; Tuan, Bui Minh; Nguyen, Diep N.; Hoang, Dinh Thai; Vu, Thang X.; Dutkiewicz, Eryk; Chatzinotas, Symeon; Ottersten, Bjorn",IEEE Access,,380

An imaging study with objective clinical correlation is needed in COVID-19 anosmia in order to better understand underlying pathogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 23 patients with persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. Patients included in this study had a minimum 1-month duration between onset of olfactory dysfunction and evaluation. Olfactory functions were evaluated with Sniffin' Sticks Test. Paranasal sinus CTs and MRI dedicated to olfactory nerves were acquired. On MRI, quantitative measurements of olfactory bulb volumes and olfactory sulcus depth and qualitative assessment of olfactory bulb morphology, signal intensity, and olfactory nerve filia architecture were performed. RESULTS: All patients were anosmic at the time of imaging based on olfactory test results. On CT, Olfactory cleft opacification was seen in 73.9% of cases with a mid and posterior segment dominance. 43.5% of cases had below normal olfactory bulb volumes and 60.9% of cases had shallow olfactory sulci. Of all, 54.2% of cases had changes in normal inverted J shape of the bulb. 91.3% of cases had abnormality in olfactory bulb signal intensity in the forms of diffusely increased signal intensity, scattered hyperintense foci or microhemorrhages. Evident clumping of olfactory filia was seen in 34.8% of cases and thinning with scarcity of filia in 17.4%. Primary olfactory cortical signal abnormality was seen in 21.7% of cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate olfactory cleft and olfactory bulb abnormalities are seen in COVID-19 anosmia. There was a relatively high percentage of olfactory bulb degeneration. Further longitudinal imaging studies could shed light on the mechanism of olfactory neuronal pathway injury in COVID-19 anosmia.","Kandemirli, Sedat Giray; Altundag, Aytug; Yildirim, Duzgun; Tekcan Sanli, Deniz Esin; Saatci, Ozlem",Acad Radiol,,380

262418,The impact of school reopening on the spread of COVID-19 in England,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious to humans and has caused a pandemic of global proportions. Despite worldwide research efforts, efficient targeted therapies against the virus are still lacking. With the ready availability of the macromolecular structures of coronavirus and its known variants, the search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics through in silico analysis, has become a highly promising field of research. In this study, we investigate the inhibiting potentialities of triazole-based compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is known to play a prominent role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. Compounds were pre-screened from 171 candidates (collected from the DrugBank database). The results showed that four candidates (Bemcentinib, Bisoctrizole, PYIITM and NIPFC) had high binding affinity values and had the potential to interrupt the main protease (Mpro) activities of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pharmacokinetic parameters of these candidates were assessed and they were then put through molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for stability, interaction and conformation analysis. In summary, we successfully identified the most suitable compounds for targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro).

Being essential services, we postulated that there would not be a decrease in elective and emergency neurosurgical presentations and surgeries. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational, epidemiologic study in strict adherence to the ""STROBE"" (Strengthening The Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines. It is a cross-sectional, multicentric study involving 5 tertiary neurosurgical centers to capture all public neurosurgical admissions in Queensland during the past 3 months (February-April, 2020) of significant public health policy changes to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: An analysis of the 1298 admissions for the Queensland population of 5.07 million Australians demonstrated a decrease in the number of elective and emergency admissions. The decline in elective admissions, particularly degenerative spine, benign neoplasms, and vascular pathologies, was a direct response of government strategy to curb activity to urgent surgical interventions only. Moreover, a trend toward fewer emergency admissions was also noted, partly explained by less trauma and also a decline in vascular pathologies including subarachnoid hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with Europe and North America, this study demonstrates the impact of proactive public health measures in Australia that successfully flattened the COVID-19 curve while facilitating ongoing care of acutely unwell neurosurgical patients.","Antony, Joyce; James, William Thomas; Neriamparambil, Anna Jolly; Barot, Dwarkesh Dharmendra; Withers, Teresa",World neurosurgery (Online),,380

Understanding how crisis influence an individual's reactions to stressful events (and vice versa) is important in order to create meaningful and effective interventions. Our literature search have revealed lack of the papers related to psychodynamic approach to recent crisis. Psychodynamic places a large emphasis on defense mechanisms and unconscious mind, where upsetting feelings, urges, and thoughts that are too painful for us to directly look at are housed. Even though these painful feelings and thoughts are outside of our awareness, they still influence our behavior in many ways. Optimal application of psychodynamic approach offers the frame for acceptance of psychological stress in a more positive way and benefits psychological growth. We believe that including psychodynamic approach in the national public and mental health emergency system will empower Croatia and the world during (and after) COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","Marcinko, Darko; Jakovljevic, Miro; Jaksic, Nenad; Bjedov, Sarah; Mindoljevic Drakulic, Aleksandra",Psychiatr Danub,,380

Given the factors included in SDoH, such as education level, race, rurality, and socioeconomic status are interconnected, it is unclear how individual SDoH factors may uniquely impact risk. Lower socioeconomic status often occurs in concert with lower educational attainment, for example. Because literacy provides access to information needed to avoid infection and content can be made more accessible, it is essential to determine to what extent health literacy contributes to successful containment of a pandemic. By incorporating this information into clinical data, we have isolated literacy and geographic location as SDoH factors uniquely related to the risk of COVID-19 infection. For patients with comorbidities linked to higher illness severity, residents of rural areas associated with lower health literacy at the zip code level had a greater likelihood of positive COVID-19 results unrelated to their economic status.","Greer, Melody L; Sample, Steven; Jensen, Hanna K; McBain, Sacha; Lipschitz, Riley; Sexton, Kevin W",Stud Health Technol Inform,,380

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to (1) study and grade TSR in buccal mucosa and tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), (2) grade inflammatory cell infiltrate surrounding the tumor, and (3) correlate the above two parameters with tumor grade, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI). Materials and Methods: Totally, 25 patients of buccal SCC and 16 cases of tongue SCC were included in the study. TSR was assessed visually on the hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections by two independent observers. Cases were categorized into two groups: One with high TSR >50% (stroma poor) and the other with low TSR <50% as the stroma-rich group. TSR was correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, inflammatory cell infiltrate, LVI, and PNI. Data were analyzed by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. The Chi-square and Fischer's exact tests were applied in the analysis of categorical variable. Results and Conclusion: SCC of buccal mucosa showed a significant correlation between TSR and size of the tumor (P = 0.001). We found that smaller the tumor size &#8804;2 cm (Stage T1), lesser the TSR, and size >2 cm was found to be associated with higher TSR. Hence, higher TSR (stroma poor) was associated with an adverse pathological characteristic, i.e., advanced T significantly. There was no significant correlation between TSR and inflammatory infiltrate with grade of the tumor, lymph node metastasis, LVI, and PNI. In 16 cases of SCC of the tongue; no correlation was observed between TSR and inflammatory infiltrate with tumor size, grade of the tumor, lymph node metastasis, LVI, and PNI. TSR has been studied in various malignancies (mostly adenocarcinomas) including laryngeal SCCs; however, it has never been studied on oral SCCs.","Rani, Poonam; Gupta, Amita Jain; Mehrol, Chetna; Singh, Meeta; Khurana, Nita; Passey, J C",J Cancer Res Ther,,380

We aimed to investigate the odds of developing severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers. METHODS: We included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline (2006-2010) and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category) at baseline, health worker only, shift worker only, or both, and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions. RESULTS: Of 235,685 participants (81·5% neither health nor shift worker, 1·4% health worker only, 16·9% shift worker only, and 0·3% both), there were 580 (0·25%) cases of severe COVID-19. The odds of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2·32 [95% CI: 1·33, 4·05]; shift workers (2·06 [1·72, 2·47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7·56 [3·86, 14·79]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the odds of severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Both health and shift work (measured at baseline, 2006-2010) were independently associated with over twice the odds of severe COVID-19 in 2020; the odds were over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts. Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health and key worker status but also shift worker status.","Rowlands, A V; Gillies, C; Chudasama, Y; Davies, M J; Islam, N; Kloecker, D E; Lawson, C; Pareek, M; Razieh, C; Zaccardi, F; Yates, T; Khunti, K",BMC Public Health,,380

405419,A helping hand for practices,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of same-day discharge (SDD) after robotic surgery METHODS: We reviewed our robotic surgeries during COVID-19 restrictions on surgery in Ohio between March 17 and June 5, 2020 and compared them with robotic procedures before COVID-19 and after restrictions were lifted. We followed our formerly described protocol in use since 2016 offering the option of SDD to all robotic urologic surgery patients, regardless of procedure type or patient-specific factors. RESULTS: During COVID-19 restrictions (COV), 89 robotic surgeries were performed and compared with 1667 of the same procedures performed previously (pre-COV) and 42 during the following month (post-COV). Among COV patients 98% (87/89 patients) opted for same-day discharge after surgery versus 52% in the historical pre-COV group (P < .00001). Post-COV, the higher rate of SDD was maintained at 98% (41/42 patients). There were no differences in 30-day complications or readmissions between SDD and overnight patients with only 2 COV (2%) and no post-COV 30-day readmissions. CONCLUSION: SDD after robotic surgery was safely applied during the COVID-19 crisis without increasing complications or readmissions. SDD may allow continuation of robotic surgery despite limited hospital beds and when minimizing hospital stay is important to protect postoperative patients from infection. Our experience suggests that patient attitude is a major factor in SDD after robotic surgery since the proportion of patients opting for SDD was much higher during COV and continued post-COV. Consideration of SDD long-term may be warranted for cost savings even in the absence of a crisis.","Abaza, Ronney; Kogan, Paul; Martinez, Oscar",Urology,,380
407955,"Hard on contamination, gentle on equipment",2020,"In this study, we investigate the flow of money among bank accounts possessed by firms in a region by employing an exhaustive list of all the bank transfers in a regional bank in Japan, to clarify how the network of money flow is related to the economic activities of the firms. The network statistics and structures are examined and shown to be similar to those of a nationwide production network. Specifically, the bowtie analysis indicates what we refer to as a""walnut""structure with core and upstream/downstream components. To quantify the location of an individual account in the network, we used the Hodge decomposition method and found that the Hodge potential of the account has a significant correlation to its position in the bowtie structure as well as to its net flow of incoming and outgoing money and links, namely the net demand/supply of individual accounts. In addition, we used non-negative matrix factorization to identify important factors underlying the entire flow of money; it can be interpreted that these factors are associated with regional economic activities.One factor has a feature whereby the remittance source is localized to the largest city in the region, while the destination is scattered. The other factors correspond to the economic activities specific to different local places.This study serves as a basis for further investigation on the relationship between money flow and economic activities of firms.","Fujiwara, Yoshi; Inoue, Hiroyasu; Yamaguchi, Takayuki; Aoyama, Hideaki; Tanaka, Takuma",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14630v2.pdf,380

The research was conducted by survey method using an adaptation observation sheet from the 2012 Greenstein instrument. Data collection was carried out on modified online Problem Based Learning (PBL) using Zoom meeting and WhatsApp Group (WAG). While presentation and organizing stages were carried out by class discussion on Zoom, the problems that have been formulated were discussed by each group using a WAG. The data obtained were analyzed quantitatively, using the percentage formula (Akbar, 2013) in the book Learning Device Instruments and showed the results that the percentage of oral communication skills was 86.73%, of the skills to understand the intent/purpose of communication was 85.65%, of the skills to use communication strategies was 86.57%, and of presentation skills was 85.19%, with each criterion falling in the category ‘Exceeded Expectations’. Meanwhile, viewing the percentage results and aiming the target of 84.57%, the two receptive communication skills listening and reading were included in the ‘Satisfactory’ category. The general percentage of communication skills of 85.16% as average was included in the category ‘Exceeding Expectations’. This finding suggests that communication which included oral communication skills, receptive communication skills, understanding the purpose of communication, using communication strategies, communicating clearly for a purpose, and presentation skills can be achieved virtually. © 2021 Conscientia Beam.

E-learning system such as Blackboard has several fantastic features that would be valuable for use during this COVID-19 pandemic. However, the successful usage of e-learning system relies on understanding the adoption factors as well as the main challenges that face the current e-learning systems. There is lack of agreement about the critical challenges and factors that shape the successful usage of e-learning system during COVID-19 pandemic; hence, a clear gap has been identified in the knowledge on the critical challenges and factors of e-learning usage during this pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to explore the critical challenges that face the current e-learning systems and investigate the main factors that support the usage of e-learning system during COVID-19 pandemic. This study employed the interview method using thematic analysis through NVivo software. The interview was conducted with 30 students and 31 experts in e-learning systems at six universities from Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

436667,The vital role of ventilation,2021,"Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common disease which represents a considerable burden for many patients. The current urticaria guideline describes the evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of CU. In addition, however, questions often arise in everyday practice that are not addressed by the guideline. Methods: In May 2020, a digital meeting with German urticaria experts was held, in which practical aspects of CU treatment were discussed and supporting aids for everyday clinical treatment formulated. The resulting advice in this document focus on practical questions and the available literature and experiences of the participants. Results: The diagnosis of CU can be made in a short time by means of a thorough anamnesis, a physical examination, and a basic laboratory chemical diagnosis. For this purpose, practical recommendations for everyday practice are given in this paper. An extended diagnosis is only indicated in a few cases and should always be carried out in parallel with an effective therapy. In general, CU should always be treated in the same way, regardless of whether wheals, angioedema or both occur. Symptomatic therapy should be carried out according to the treatment steps recommended by the guidelines. This publication provides practical advice on issues in everyday practice, such as the procedure in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the cardiac risk under higher dosed H1 antihistamines, the self-administration of omalizumab as well as vaccination under omalizumab therapy. In addition to treatment recommendations, topics such as documentation in the practice and family planning with urticaria will be discussed. Discussion: These supporting treatment recommendations serve as an addendum to the current CU guideline and provide support in dealing with CU patients in everyday practice. The aim is to ensure that patients suffering from CU achieve complete freedom of symptoms with the help of an optimal therapy.

However, the ability of a vaccine to prevent infection or disease depends critically on protecting older individuals, who are at highest risk of severe disease. OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively estimated the relative benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, in terms of preventing infection and death, with a particular focus on effectiveness in elderly people. DESIGN: We applied compartmental mathematical modelling to determine the relative effects of vaccines that block infection and onward transmission, and those that prevent severe disease. We assumed that vaccines showing high efficacy in adults would be deployed, and examined the effects of lower vaccine efficacy among the elderly population. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Our mathematical model was calibrated to simulate the course of an epidemic among the entire population of British Columbia, Canada. Within our model, the population was structured by age and levels of contact. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): We assessed the effectiveness of possible vaccines in terms of the predicted number of infections within the entire population, and deaths among people aged 65 years and over. RESULTS: In order to reduce the overall rate of infections in the population, high rates of deployment to all age groups will be critical. However, to substantially reduce mortality among people aged 65 years and over, a vaccine must directly protect a high proportion of people in that group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Effective vaccines deployed to a large fraction of the population are projected to substantially reduce infection in an otherwise susceptible population. However, even if transmission were blocked highly effectively by vaccination of children and younger adults, overall mortality would not be substantially reduced unless the vaccine is also directly protective in elderly people. We strongly recommend: (i) the inclusion of people aged 65 years and over in future trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates; (ii) careful monitoring of vaccine efficacy in older age groups following vaccination.","Sadarangani, Manish; Abu Raya, Bahaa; Conway, Jessica M; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A; Falcao, Rebeca Cardim; Colijn, Caroline; Coombs, Daniel; Gantt, Soren",Vaccine,,380

The main objectives of this paper were to analyse the status of medical waste generation and treatment in recent years, and also address the discussions on the impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on its generation in the first half of 2020. It showed that the reported quantities have slightly increased from 35,747 metric tonnes (Mt) in 2016 to 40,407 Mt in 2019, showing an average increase by 4.17%. This rate of increase was consistent with the hospital services. When classified by the reported codes, the C-type waste (infectious waste) accounted for about 89% of the reported quantities, which indicated an annual increase by 4.14% during the same period. In addition, the medical waste treatment in 2019 was mainly dependent on the commissioned treatment (80.18%), followed by the recycling (18.53%) and the self-treatment (1.29%). Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 on the medical waste generation in Taiwan was not significant in the first half of 2020 compared to the data during the years of 2016-2019. It was indicated that the consistent trend was observed at the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan during this period. Obviously, the reduction in the hospital medical services during the COVID-19 outbreak should be offset by the increase in medical waste generation from the medical services. In order to try to ensure safe and complete destruction of the COVID-19 virus, all the waste generated from the healthcare facilities should be treated in the incineration plants.","Tsai, Wen-Tien",Waste Manag Res,,380

Furthermore, literature review shows the absence of studies on the supply chain in the HoReCa (hotel, restaurant, catering) sector from a sustainability perspective that also addresses economic and social aspects, and not only environmental ones. In this context, the objective of this article is to carry out a prospective analysis on how the changes in the behaviour of consumers during the pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the exit from the health emergency can give rise to social trends with a high impact on the HoReCa sector in the coming years and, specifically, how they will affect the HoReCa supply chain. In the absence of investigations due to the proximity of what has happened, public sources and reports of international relevance have been identified and analysed from the future studies and strategic and competitive intelligence disciplines. The HoReCa sector in Spain has been chosen as field of observation. This analysis draws the future of the HoReCa sector, describes the changes in customer behaviour regarding food and beverages, explains the changes in distribution chains, and reflects on the impact of potential scenarios on the sector. The confluence of all these changes and trends can even configure a new supply chain in the hospitality sector with the emergence of new actors and the increase of access routes to a new final customer for whom security prevails in all its dimensions: physical, emotional, economic, and digital.","García-Madurga, Miguel-Ángel Esteban-Navarro Miguel-Ángel Morte-Nadal Tamara",Sustainability,,380

521993,Fall in love at first try,2020,"Behavior courses face numerous challenges when moving to an online environment, as has been made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges occur largely because behavior courses, like most organismal biology courses, often stress experiential learning through laboratories that involve live animals, as well as a lecture component that emphasizes formative assessment, discussion, and critical thinking. Although online behavior courses may be remote, they can still be interactive and social, and designed with inclusive pedagogy. Here, we discuss some of the key decisions that instructors should consider, provide recommendations, and point out new opportunities for student learning that stem directly from the move to online instruction. Specific topics include challenges related to generating an inclusive and engaging online learning environment, synchronous versus asynchronous formats, assignments that enhance student learning, testing format and execution, grade schemes, design of laboratory experiences including opportunities for community science, design of synthetic student projects, and workload balance for students and instructors. We designed this primer both for animal behavior instructors who need to quickly transition to online teaching in the midst of a pandemic, and for those facing such transitions in upcoming terms. Much of the manuscript's content should also be of general interest and value to instructors from all areas of organismal biology who are attempting to quickly transition to online teaching.","Hughes, Melissa; Bertram, Susan M; Young, Anna M; Merry, Justin W; Kolluru, Gita R; Dunlap, Aimee S; Danielson-Francois, Anne; Weiss, Stacey",Ethology,,380
600673,Association between population density and infection rate suggests the importance of social distancing and travel restriction in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-01-13,"We use a simple model to derive a mortality probability distribution for a patient as a function of days since diagnosis (considering diagnoses made between 25 February and 29 March 2020). The peak of the mortality probability is the 13th day after diagnosis. The overall shape and peak location of this probability curve are similar to the onset-to-death probability distribution in a case study using Chinese data. The total mortality probability of a COVID-19 patient in the US diagnosed between 25 February and 29 March is about 21%. We speculate that this high value is caused by severe under-testing of the population to identify all COVID-19 patients. With this probability, and an assumption that the true probability is 2.4%, we estimate that 89% of all SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were not diagnosed during this period. When the same method is applied to data extended to 25 April, we found that the total mortality probability of a patient diagnosed in the US after 1 April is about 6.4%, significantly lower than for the earlier period. We attribute this drop to increasingly available tests. Given the assumption that the true mortality probability is 2.4%, we estimate that 63% of all SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were not diagnosed during this period (1 - 25 April).","Gao, R.; Rosenlof, K.

637199,A breath of fresh air,2021-03-12,"Unlike other European countries the UK has abandoned widespread testing and tracing of known SARS-CoV-2 carriers in mid-March. The reason given was that the pandemic was out of control and with wide community based spread it would not be possible to contain it by tracing any longer. Like other countries the UK has since relied on a lockdown as the main measure to contain the virus (or more precisely the reproduction number R at significant economic and social cost. It is clear that this level of lockdown cannot be sustained until a vaccine is available, yet it is not clear what an exit strategy would look like that avoids the danger of a second (or subsequent waves). In this paper we argue that, when used within a portfolio of intervention strategies, widespread testing and tracing leads to significant cost savings compared to using lockdown measures alone. While the effect is most pronounced if a large proportion of the infectious population can be identified and their contacts traced, under reasonable assumptions there are still significant savings even if the fraction of infectious people found by tracing is small. We also present a policy optimization model that finds, for given assumptions on the disease parameters, the best intervention strategy to contain the virus by varying the degree of tracing and lockdown measure (and vaccination once that option is available) over time. We run the model on data fitted to the published COVID-19 outbreak figures for Scotland. The model suggests an intervention strategy that keeps the number of COVID-19 deaths low using a combination of tracing and lockdown. This strategy would only require lockdown measures equivalent to a reduction of R to about 1.8--2.0 if lockdown was used alone, at acceptable economic cost, while the model finds no such strategy without tracing enabled.","Grothey, A.; McKinnon, K.

With the increased risk of fatality among older adults with COVID-19, appropriate diagnostic protocols are needed to ensure early diagnosis and management. Recognizing these atypical presentations in nursing homes would also facilitate early screening and cohorting in these congregate living facilities where older adults have had disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates.

One molecule is assumed to be present per asymmetric unit, which gives a Matthews coefficient of 2.89 Å(3) Da(−1) and a solvent content of 56.2%.","Li, Yuanyuan; Ren, Zhilin; Bao, Zehua; Ming, Zhenhua; Li, Xuemei",Acta Crystallographica Section F Structural Biology and Crystallization Communications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21795795/; http://journals.iucr.org/f/issues/2011/07/00/us5031/us5031.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1107/s1744309111017829,380
