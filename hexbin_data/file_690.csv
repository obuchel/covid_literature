This study aimed to examine a moderated mediation model for the association between PBC and BAV mediated by deviant peer affiliation (DPA) and moderated by gender. A total of 3779 adolescents (N(boy) = 1679, M(age) = 14.98 years, SD = 0.95) from southwest China has completed the Peer Bullying, Peer Victimization, PBC, and DPA questionnaires. The results indicated that: (1) PBC significantly predicted adolescents’ BAV (−12%); (2) DPA mediated the effect of PBC on BAV only for those adolescents who were both bullies and victims; (3) the mediating role of DPA was moderated by gender only in the relationship between PBC and victimization, with a relatively stronger effect in girls than in boys.","Chen, Xu; Li, Ling; Lv, Gangwu; Li, Hui",Int J Environ Res Public Health,690,1

Clinical phenotypes associated with this syndrome range from macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorder to Cowden syndrome, which manifests as multiple noncancerous tumor-like growths (hamartomas), and an increased predisposition to certain cancers. It is unclear, however, the basis by which mutations might lead to these very diverse phenotypic outcomes. Here we show that, by considering the molecular consequences of mutations in PTEN on protein structure and function, we can accurately distinguish PTEN mutations exhibiting different phenotypes. Changes in phosphatase activity, protein stability, and intramolecular interactions appeared to be major drivers of clinical phenotype, with cancer-associated variants leading to the most drastic changes, while ASD and non-pathogenic variants associated with more mild and neutral changes, respectively. Importantly, we show via saturation mutagenesis that more than half of variants of unknown significance could be associated with disease phenotypes, while over half of Cowden syndrome mutations likely lead to cancer. These insights can assist in exploring potentially important clinical outcomes delineated by PTEN variation.","Portelli, Stephanie; Barr, Lucy; de Sá, Alex G.C.; Pires, Douglas E.V.; Ascher, David B.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,690,1

Mathematical biology seeks to explain biophysical processes in mathematical terms at, and across, all relevant spatial and temporal scales, through the generation of representative models. While non-spatial, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are often used and readily calibrated to experimental data, they do not explicitly represent the spatial and stochastic features of a biological system, limiting their insights and applications. However, spatial models describing biological systems with spatial information are mathematically complex and computationally expensive, which limits the ability to calibrate and deploy them and highlights the need for simpler methods able to model the spatial features of biological systems. RESULTS: In this work, we develop a formal method for deriving cell-based, spatial, multicellular models from ODE models of population dynamics in biological systems, and vice versa. We provide examples of generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from ODE models of viral infection and immune response. In these models, the determinants of agreement of spatial and non-spatial models are the degree of spatial heterogeneity in viral production and rates of extracellular viral diffusion and decay. We show how ODE model parameters can implicitly represent spatial parameters, and cell-based spatial models can generate uncertain predictions through sensitivity to stochastic cellular events, which is not a feature of ODE models. Using our method, we can test ODE models in a multicellular, spatial context and translate information to and from non-spatial and spatial models, which help to employ spatiotemporal multicellular models using calibrated ODE model parameters. We additionally investigate objects and processes implicitly represented by ODE model terms and parameters and improve the reproducibility of spatial, stochastic models. CONCLUSION: We developed and demonstrate a method for generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from non-spatial population dynamics models of multicellular systems. We envision employing our method to generate new ODE model terms from spatiotemporal and multicellular models, recast popular ODE models on a cellular basis, and generate better models for critical applications where spatial and stochastic features affect outcomes.

Intensive patients are treated with extensive invasive procedures, which may cause a risk of hospital infections in 10–30% of the cases. More than half of these infections can be prevented. The patients are often admitted directly from outside the hospital or from abroad with trauma after accidents, serious heart and lung conditions, sepsis and other life-threatening diseases. Infection or carrier state of microbes is often unknown on arrival and poses a risk of transmission to other patients, personnel and the environment. Patients that are transferred between different healthcare levels and institutions with unknown infection may be a particular risk for other patients. In spite of the serious state of the patients, many ICUs have few resources and are overcrowded and understaffed, with a lack of competent personnel. ICU should have a large enough area and be designed, furnished and staffed for a good, safe and effective infection control.

Diagnosis and management are often complex due in part to the remarkably diverse nature of the septic patient. Indeed, sepsis can range in severity from mild systemic inflammation of little clinical importance through to a widespread severe inflammatory response with multiple organ failure and a mortality rate in excess of 50%. Sepsis can affect individuals of any age group, with no or multiple co-morbidities, and with many different ongoing diagnoses. It can occur as the result of infection by one or more of a multitude of microbial pathogens impacting on any of numerous different sites within the body. Given the huge complexity of sepsis and the diverse populations of patients it affects, simple definitions are of relatively little use and a more detailed framework which can be used to better characterize patients with sepsis has been proposed, much as the TNM classification (tumor size, nodal spread, metastases) has been successfully used in clinical oncology.

It is essential to identify the subset of helpful reviews from the large number of reviews of varying quality. This paper aims to build a model to predict review helpfulness automatically. Our work is inspired by the observation that a customer’s expectation of a review can be greatly affected by review sentiment and the degree to which the customer is aware of pertinent product information. Consequently, a customer may pay more attention to that specific content of a review which contributes more to its helpfulness from their perspective. To model such customer expectations and capture important information from a review text, we propose a novel neural network which leverages review sentiment and product information. Specifically, we encode the sentiment of a review through an attention module, to get sentiment-driven information from review text. We also introduce a product attention layer that fuses information from both the target product and related products, in order to capture the product related information from review text. Our experimental results show an AUC improvement of 5.4% and 1.5% over the previous state of the art model on Amazon and Yelp data sets, respectively.","Qu, Xianshan; Li, Xiaopeng; Farkas, Csilla; Rose, John",Advances in Information Retrieval,690,1

Twitter is the most popular form of social media used for ID communication. We will review the power of Twitter in ID. RECENT FINDINGS: Twitter allows for real-time sharing of educational resources at ID scientific conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend conferences to follow conferences anytime anywhere and stimulate discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. Further, Twitter chats are a valuable tool for stewardship, with different accounts periodically hosting chats on various stewardship topics. Several studies have also demonstrated the strong relationship between dissemination and citation impact of publications with the help of Twitter. There is great value in engaging with non-ID people on Twitter via dissemination of ID knowledge to other disciplines. Lastly, when used appropriately, Twitter is a useful site for distributing vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities) and allows one to keep up with ongoing ID outbreaks in real time. SUMMARY: Twitter has transformed how we communicate in healthcare. Particularly in ID, where bacteria and viruses can enter/exit borders anytime anywhere, global real-time information about outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance for clinicians and the public is critical. Twitter has no hierarchy or barriers, is a conduit for global collaboration, and is a way for HCPs and the public to “social”ize on healthcare topics, if used appropriately.","Kullar, Ravina; Goff, Debra A.; Gauthier, Timothy P.; Smith, Tara C.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,690,17

We give a detailed characterization of the accept and strong space complexity measures for checking stack automata. Exactly one of three cases can occur: the complexity is either bounded by a constant, behaves (up to small technicalities explained in the paper) like a linear function, or it grows arbitrarily larger than the length of the input word. However, this result does not hold for non-erasing stack automata; we provide an example when the space complexity grows with the square root of the input length.

The clinical impact of preceding RVIs on the development of bacterial superinfection in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients may be significant although data are limited. Furthermore, the impact of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) on this outcome has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether URTI due to specific respiratory viruses was associated with increased risk of developing bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia post-HCT. METHODS: In a longitudinal surveillance study of RVIs among allogeneic HCT recipients conducted from 2005-10, weekly post-HCT nasal washes were collected through day 100. Nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were tested by multiplex PCR for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV)1–4, Flu A/B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. URTI was defined as having respiratory virus detected from nasal samples with respiratory symptoms. Bacteremia and bacterial pneumonia were defined as growth of significant bacteria (e.g., Coagulase-negative staphylococci was defined as insignificant bacteria) from blood and lower respiratory tract samples including bronchoalveolar lavage, respectively. Separate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between first URTI for individual viruses and the subsequent development of first bacteremia and/or bacterial pneumonia by 100 days post-HCT. RESULTS: We identified 471 HCT recipients (median age: 51 years, range 8 months-75 years). Number of patients for each first outcome event by 100 days post-HCT included the following: Gram-positive bacteremia (n=64), Gram-negative bacteremia (n=53), Gram-positive pneumonia (n=46), Gram-negative pneumonia (n=8), and either bacteremia or pneumonia (n=152). After adjusting for pre-transplant factors only and pre- and post-transplant factors, significant URTI variables for outcomes in both models were (1) Flu A for gram-positive bacteremia, (2) HMPV for gram-positive pneumonia, and (3) HMPV for bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia (Figure). The association between PIV URTI and development of bacteremia or pneumonia approached statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In HCT recipients, URTIs due to Flu A and HMPV are significant risk factors for the development of gram-positive bacteremia and pneumonia, respectively. Further studies are needed to assess whether prevention or early diagnostic and treatment strategies for RVIs can reduce the risk of bacterial infection.","Ogimi, Chikara; Xie, Hu; Campbell, Angela P; Waghmare, Alpana; Kuypers, Jane M; Jerome, Keith R; Chien, Jason; Callais, Cheryl; Cheng, Guang-Shing; Pergam, Steven A.; Leisenring, Wendy M; Englund, Janet A; Boeckh, Michael J",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,690,1

The aim of the current study was to evaluate, in a larger sample of Swedish clergy (N = 871), two possible antecedents of burnout, namely prosocialness and relational-interdependent self-construal. A further aim was to explore potential gender differences in the investigated associations. The direct and indirect relationships of prosocialness and relational-interdependent self-construal to two dimensions of burnout, exhaustion, and disengagement were investigated in a structural equation-modelling framework. The results showed that clergy who reported higher prosocialness experienced more stress in their work, in terms of both quantitative and emotional demands, which in turn was associated with higher levels of exhaustion and disengagement. But prosocialness was also found to be directly associated with lower levels of disengagement, as well as indirectly associated with higher levels of role clarity. However, no direct or indirect associations were found between relational-interdependent self-construal and any dimension of burnout. Regarding gender differences, female clergy reported higher levels of prosocialness and job demands, less role clarity, and in turn more exhaustion compared to male clergy. This indicated a more stressful situation for female clergy.

To assess mastery, some technologies utilize data-driven models while others use simple heuristics. Prior work has suggested that heuristics may often perform comparably to model-based algorithms. But is there any reason we should expect these heuristics to be reasonable? In this paper, we show that two prominent mastery learning heuristics can be reinterpreted as model-based algorithms. In particular, we show that the N-Consecutive Correct in a Row heuristic and a simplified version of ALEKS’ mastery learning heuristic are both optimal policies for variants of the Bayesian knowledge tracing model. By putting mastery learning heuristics on the same playing field as model-based algorithms, we can gain insights on their hidden assumptions about learning and why they might perform well in practice.","Doroudi, Shayan",Artificial Intelligence in Education,690,13

FER is a very challenging problem due to the subtle differences that exist between its categories. Even though convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved impressive results in several computer vision tasks, they still do not perform as well in FER. Many techniques, like bilinear pooling and improved bilinear pooling, have been proposed to improve the CNN performance on similar problems. The accuracy enhancement they brought in multiple visual tasks, shows that their is still room for improvement for CNNs on FER. In this paper, we propose to use bilinear and improved bilinear pooling with CNNs for FER. This framework has been evaluated on three well known datasets, namely ExpW, FER2013 and RAF-DB. It has shown that the use of bilinear and improved bilinear pooling with CNNs can enhance the overall accuracy to nearly 3% for FER and achieve state-of-the-art results.","Mahmoudi, M.

Novel adaptations are made to an ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated Brief) based image matching system that deals with quantifying the confidence of a match to ensure that even identical pages in the incorrect orientation are rejected during book binding operations. The program is subjected to a variety of quantitative tests to evaluate its performance and from these tests the effects of various parameters used in the program are discovered, allowing tuning to be performed. Potential paths for development of the analysis program are discussed, with the implementation of machine learning, highlighted as a possibility, to provide automated parameter tuning, and suggestions for further optimisation of the software are made, with a view to creating an even more bespoke version that retains performance whilst cutting computational overhead to a minimum.","Ockmore, Ross; Xu, Wei; Wei, Hong",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,690,1

Hundreds of alphanumeric and math symbols need to be recognized, many are so similar in appearance that some use of context is necessary for disambiguation. Analysis of the spatial relationships between symbols is challenging. In this work, we focus on handwritten math symbols and propose to recognize them by a deep learning approach. The symbol images, used for train, validation, and test are generated from Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions dataset (CROHME) 2019’s online patterns of mathematical symbols. As the large dataset is crucial for the performance of the deep learning model and it is labor-intensive to obtain a large amount of labeled data in real applications, we first augmented the database. Standing on the transfer learning technique, we then tested and compared several pre-trained Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) like VGGNet, SqueezeNet, DenseNet, and Xception network and we tuned them to better fit our data. An accurate classification of 91.88% (train), 88.82% (validation), and 83.68% (test) for 101 classes is achieved, using only off-line features of the symbols.","Ayeb, Kawther Khazri; Meguebli, Yosra; Echi, Afef Kacem",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,690,1

HoG is applied to four basic gait representations, i.e. Gait Energy Image (GEI), Gait Entropy Image (GEnI), Gait Gaussian Image (GGI), and newly developed Gait Gaussian Entropy Image (GGEnI). Hence their corresponding secondary gait representations, Gradient Histogram Gait Images (GHGI), are generated. Due to the nature of HoGs, the secondary gait representations contain rich information of images from different scales and orientations. The optimized HoG parameters are investigated to establish appropriate parameter settings in the HoG operations. Evaluations are conducted by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as classifier swith CASIA dataset B. Experimental results have shown that HoG associated secondary representations are superior to the originally basic representations in gait recognition, especially in case of coping with appearance changes, such as walking with bag and walking with coat when using normal walking samples in training. GHGIs have increased the gait recognition rate approximately of 17% to GEI, 12% to GEnI, 24% to GGI and 20% to GGEnI.","Wattanapanich, Chirawat; Wei, Hong; Xu, Wei",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,690,1

Blood product transfusions are used to prevent anemia-related tissue hypoxia and correct coagulopathy. Direct harm associated with transfusions has been greatly decreased due to infection control and leukoreduction. However, there is growing evidence concerning the indirect effects resulting in transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated cardiac overload, and transfusion-related immunomodulation, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Approximately half of all cardiac surgeries result in transfusion, but there are wide discrepancies in transfusion rates among cardiac surgical centers.

To accommodate these, we propose a unary semigroup trace algebra that is weaker than the monoid algebra. This structure satisfies some of the axioms of restriction semigroups and is a right P-Ehresmann semigroup.

A 38-year Myanmar immigrant female presented with nocturnal fever, fatigue, nausea, sore throat, appetite and weight loss for 1 week with dysphagia, neck swelling, dyspnea, and watery diarrhea. Medical history included renal transplant due to ESRD from IgA nephropathy, DM and treated latent TB with no prior or family history of thyroid disease. She had COVID 7 months ago, complicated by allograft rejection. She was tachycardic, febrile but not in acute distress. Neck exam revealed diffuse thyromegaly with tenderness on right lobe without bruit, palpable cervical lymphadenopathy nor tremors. Labs showed WBC 12.8x10(9)/L (4.8-10), and ESR 50 ml/hr (20-40). On admission, she developed AKI and immunosuppressant meds were discontinued. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotic. CT chest reported moderate loculated right pleural effusion with mid and lower lobe consolidation. Blood and urine culture, pleural fluid, sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and QuantiFERON-TB were negative. Upon persistent fever, RIPE therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) was started and stopped after 10 days due to transaminitis and negative TB PCR. Further labs showed TSH 0.04 mIU/ml (0.27-4.2), FT4 2.81 ng/dl (0.93-1.7), TT3 127 ng/dl (80-200), negative TPO and TSI. Endocrinology was consulted for thyroiditis. Ibuprofen and Propranolol were initiated with continuation of prednisone. Repeat thyroid labs normalized in 4 days. US thyroid noted diffuse, heterogenous thyromegaly without hypervascularity or abscess. CT neck showed diffuse thyromegaly 4.2x7.2x7.5 cm in size; right thyroid lobe extended to posterior clavicle with enhanced capsule, without discrete lymph node or vascularity changes, suggestive of thyroiditis. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of left thyroid lobe drained 3 ml purulent fluid and AFB were seen on direct smear. She was diagnosed as TT, but unable to restart RIPE therapy due to worsening liver function. She expired after cardiac arrest due to intracranial bleeding and brain abscess. Thyroid tuberculosis is a rarely reported clinical entity. This is the first reported case of secondary TB (TT) in post-COVID infected patient from reactivation of latent TB. In our case, follicular destruction caused initial hyperthyroidism with later recovery. It can be difficult to distinguish subacute from suppurative thyroiditis due to TB. Imaging may not always show clear abscess formation. FNA is crucial for diagnosis, and drainage of any abscess. Anti-TB meds can be given, surgery is rarely required. TT should be considered in any immunocompromised patient with fever and neck pain. Imaging should also include evaluation for any CNS spread of TB.

DESIGN: A prospective cross-sectional multicentre study. SETTING: Two EDs at two European clinical teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 760 patients with suspected infection who met SIRS criteria or had a qualifying qSOFA score who were treated at two EDs in the Netherlands from 1 January to 1 March 2018 were included. METHODS: SIRS criteria and qSOFA score were calculated for each patient. The first hospital treated the patients who met SIRS criteria following the worldwide Surviving Sepsis Campaign protocol. At the second hospital, only patients who met the qualifying qSOFA score received this treatment. Therefore, patients could be divided into five groups: (1) SIRS+, qSOFA−, not treated according to protocol (reference group); (2) SIRS+, qSOFA−, treated according to protocol; (3) SIRS+, qSOFA+, treated according to protocol; (4) SIRS−, qSOFA+, not treated according to protocol; (5) SIRS−, qSOFA+, treated according to protocol. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: To prove culture-positive sepsis was present, cultures were used as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: 98.9% met SIRS criteria and 11.7% met qSOFA score. Positive predictive values of SIRS criteria and qSOFA score were 41.2% (95% CI 37.4% to 45.2%) and 48.1% (95% CI 37.4% to 58.9%), respectively. HRs were 0.79 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.56, p=0.500), 3.42 (95% CI 1.82 to 6.44, p<0.001), 18.94 (95% CI 2.48 to 144.89, p=0.005) and 4.97 (95% CI 1.44 to 17.16, p=0.011) for groups 2–5, respectively. CONCLUSION: qSOFA score performed as well as SIRS criteria for identifying culture-positive sepsis and performed significantly better for predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission. This study shows that SIRS criteria are no longer necessary and recommends qSOFA score as the standard for identifying culture-positive sepsis in the ED.

However, surgical outcomes of this operation have been poorly described compared with current techniques. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the surgical outcomes of single-port LC compared with needlescopic and conventional LC. METHODS We reviewed the surgical outcomes of consecutive patients with symptomatic gallbladder stone disease who underwent single-port LC (31 cases), needlescopic LC (26 cases) and conventional LC (32 cases) from March 2009 to January 2010. Operation time, hospital stay, conversion, complications, and postoperative pain using visual analog scale were analyzed. In addition, patients were interviewed for overall satisfaction and cosmetic results. RESULTS BMI in the single-port group was significantly lower than in the conventional group (26.0 ± 4.0 vs 30.8 ± 7.3 kg/m(2) , P=0.0017). Operation time in the single-port group was significantly longer than in the conventional group (65.1 ± 20.1 minutes vs 52.2 ± 19.6 minutes, P=0.012). There was one conversion in the single-port group. In nine cases in the single-port group (29%), a Kirschner wire or a suture retractor helped visualization. There was one complication in the single-port group (wound infection) and one in the needlescopic group (bile leak, requiring laparoscopy). Hospital stay, visual analog scale scores, and overall satisfaction did not vary among these groups. Greater cosmetic satisfaction was shown in the single-port group compared with the conventional group (P=0.039). CONCLUSION Single-port LC is feasible and secure, with better cosmetic results than conventional LC.

HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are two of the four HCoVs that circulate worldwide and are close phylogenetic relatives. HCoV infections can lead to hospitalization of children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients. Globally, approximately 5% of all upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children are caused by HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. The latter virus has recently been associated with the childhood disease croup. Thus, differentiation between the two viruses is relevant for epidemiology studies. The aim of this study was to develop a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) as a potential tool for identification and differentiation between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were expressed in an Escherichia coli system and used to immunize mice in order to obtain monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for each virus. Three specific MAbs to HCoV-NL63, one MAb specific to HCoV-229E, and four MAbs that recognized both viruses were obtained. After their characterization, three MAbs were selected in order to develop a differential DAS-ELISA. The described assay could detect up to 3 ng/ml of N protein and 50 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml of virus stock. No cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses or closely related animal coronaviruses was found. The newly developed DAS-ELISA was species specific, and therefore, it could be considered a potential tool for detection and differentiation of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E infections.","Sastre, Patricia; Dijkman, Ronald; Camuñas, Ana; Ruiz, Tamara; Jebbink, Maarten F; van der Hoek, Lia; Vela, Carmen; Rueda, Paloma",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,690,1

METHODS A survey was sent to participating academic adult cardiac surgery centers in North America. Data regarding the effect of COVID-19 on cardiac surgery training were analyzed. RESULTS Responses were received from 53 academic institutions with diverse geographic distribution. Cardiac surgery trainee re-deployment to alternative clinical duties peaked at the height of the pandemic. We stratified institutions based on high (n = 20) and low burden (n = 33) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The majority of institutions have converted didactics (high burden 90% vs low burden 73%) and interviews for jobs/fellowships (high burden 75% vs low burden 73%) from in-person to virtual. Institutions were mixed in preference for administration of the licensing examination, with the most common preference for examinations to be held remotely on normal timeline (high burden 45% vs low burden 30%) or in person with more than 3-month delay (high burden 20% vs low burden 33%). Despite the challenges experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic on trainee clinical experience, re-deployment, and decreased operative volume, institutions expected their trainees to graduate on schedule (high burden 95% vs low burden 91%). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that actions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in cardiac surgery training with transition of didactics and interviews virtually and re-deployment to alternative duties. Despite this, institutions remain optimistic that their trainees will graduate on schedule.","Luc, Jessica G Y; Nguyen, Tom C; Ad, Niv",Innovations,690,20

The paper device was prepared with lamination for easy sample handling and coated with the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. This assay employed a colorimetric reaction, which is followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated detecting antibody in the presence of the 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. The colorimetric readout was evaluated and quantified for specificity and sensitivity. The characterization of this assay includes determining the linear regression curve, the limit of detection (LOD), the repeatability, and testing complex biological samples. We found that the LOD of the assay was 9.00 ng μL-1 (0.112 IU mL-1). The relative standard deviation was approximately 10% for a sample number of n = 3. We believe that our proof-of-concept assay has the potential to be developed for clinical screening of the SARS-CoV-2 humanized antibody as a tool to confirm infected active cases or to confirm SARS-CoV-2 immune cases during the process of vaccine development.","Kasetsirikul, Surasak; Umer, Muhammad; Soda, Narshone; Sreejith, Kamalalayam Rajan; Shiddiky, Muhammad J A; Nguyen, Nam-Trung",The Analyst,690,25

Continuous transmission of the virus is mostly due to insufficient infection control measures and a lack of vaccines. Therefore, this review aimed to identify and describe possible vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed through electronic searches of the main databases to identify published reports or studies on vaccines under development against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Websites from international organizations, institutes of health and research, Google, and references from identified studies were also reviewed. Studies examining the mechanisms of infection, immunopathology, and genomics were excluded. Results A total of 141 vaccines in development against SARS-CoV-2 were identified. The technologies used include weakened and inactive viruses, viral vectors, nucleic acids, and proteins. So far, 13 vaccines (9.2%) are under clinical evaluation; only the AZD1222 vaccine is under clinical evaluation Phase II-III. Ad5-nCoV and mRNA-1273 vaccines showed to produce neutralizing antibodies and also to be safe. Conclusions Despite efforts invested in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, more research is still required. The vaccine developers, international health organizations, and the decision-makers of health policies must carry out conjunct cooperation to face the different challenges and guarantee the development of an effective vaccine.","Barajas-Nava, Leticia A",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,690,1

The requirement to reassign space has created challenges for obstetric services. We describe the nature of that challenge for an obstetric service in New York City. This experience raised an ethical challenge: whether it would be consistent with professional integrity to respond to a public health emergency with a plan for obstetric services that would create an increased risk of rare maternal mortality. We answered this question using the conceptual tools of professional ethics in obstetrics, especially the professional virtue of integrity. A public health emergency requires frameshifting from an individual-patient perspective to a population-based perspective. We show that an individual-patient-based, beneficence-based deliberative clinical judgment is not an adequate basis for organizational policy in response to a public health emergency. Instead, physicians, especially those in leadership positions, must frameshift to population-based clinical ethical judgment that focuses on reduction of mortality as much as possible in the entire population of patients served by a healthcare organization.","Chervenak, Frank A; Grünebaum, Amos; Bornstein, Eran; Wasden, Shane; Katz, Adi; Rochelson, Burton L; McCullough, Laurence B",Journal of perinatal medicine,690,15

Several drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and remdesivir, have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 during the past year. While most of the drugs failed to display efficacy in treating COVID-19, scientists have encouraged herd immunity to control the pandemic. Immunity generated after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is precarious, as indicated by real-world evidence in the form of epidemiological data from Manaus, Brazil. Vaccines using different platforms are therefore the most promising approach to help us return to normality. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, there are still many concerns regarding their accessibility, the vaccination rate, and most importantly, their efficacy in preventing infection with emerging virus variants. Continued virus surveillance and rapid redesign of new vaccines to counter new variants are crucial to fighting COVID-19. Rapid production and extensive vaccination are also essential to preventing the emergence of new variants. Nevertheless, antivirals including monoclonal antibodies and oral medicines need to be developed in light of uncertainties with regard to vaccination. In the battle between humans and SARS-CoV-2, the speed with which we fight the virus, and especially its emerging variants, is the key to winning.","Chen, Jun; Lu, Hongzhou",Bioscience trends,690,16

Fungi are also widespread in epiphytic orchid roots, but there have been no attempts to determine if epiphytes accept organic matter from the living stems of their phorophytes. We hypothesise that such transfer does not exist because epiphytes and phorophytes harbour different fungal communities. To test this hypothesis, we tagged three short Randia sp. trees with 13C-enriched CO2 and examined 13C transfer from the phorophyte into the epiphytic orchids Grosourdya appendiculata, Dendrobium oligophyllum and Gastrochilus sp. in Cat Tien National Park, (South Vietnam, Cat Tien National Park, plot size approx. 1 ha). The coincidence of fungal sequences in the orchid roots and in the branches on which they grew was also examined. We did not detect 13C label moving from phorophytes to epiphytes. Using Illumina sequencing, 162 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected. The fungal communities were significantly different between the roots of epiphytes and branches of phorophytes, although no strict fungal specificity at the species level was found in either epiphytes or phorophytes.","Eskov, Alen K; Voronina, Elena Yu; Tedersoo, Leho; Tiunov, Alexey V; Manh, Vu; Prilepsky, Nikolay G; Antipina, Violetta A; Elumeeva, Tatiana G; Abakumov, Evgeny V; Onipchenko, Vladimir G",Mycorrhiza,690,31

The atomic pair distributions show the first peak at 1.90 Å due to the Te-O equatorial bonds and the Te-O peak is asymmetrical due to the range of Te-O bond lengths in glass, anti-glass and crystalline samples. The short-range structural properties of glasses such as Te-O bond lengths, Te-O speciation, Te-Te distances and O-Te-O bond angle distributions were determined by RMC simulations. The average Te-O coordination number (NTe-O) for 5SrO-95TeO2 glass is 3.93 which decreases to 3.59 on increasing the SrO concentration to 10 mol.%. The changes in NTe-O revealed that the glass network predominantly contains TeO4 units with a small amount of TeO3 units and there is a structural transformation TeO4 → TeO3 with an increase in SrO concentration. The O-Te-O bond angle distributions have a peak at 79° and reveal that the Oequatorial-Te-Oequatorial bonds are the most abundant linkages in the tellurite network. Two glass samples containing 7.5 and 8.5 mol.% of SrO were annealed at 350°C for 1 h to produce anti-glass phases; they were further annealed at 450°C for 4 h to transform them into crystalline phases. The anti-glass samples are disordered cubic SrTe5O11 and the disordered monoclinic SrTeO3 phases, whereas the crystalline samples contain monoclinic SrTeO3 and the orthorhombic TeO2 phases. The unit-cell parameters of the anti-glass and crystalline structures were determined by Fullprof Rietveld refinement.

DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL from inception to December 2019. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Observational population-based studies in which the relationship between dysmenorrhea and the presence or severity of chronic pain was examined. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS Each study was double-coded and evaluated for bias based on the modified Newcastle and Ottawa Scale. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted to quantify the associations between dysmenorrhea and the presence of chronic pelvic and non-pelvic pain. RESULTS Out of 9,452 records, 32 studies were included, with 14 reporting associations between dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain, and 20 for dysmenorrhea and chronic non-pelvic pain. Primary dysmenorrhea and endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea were examined in 7 studies, respectively. Over 30% of the studies were categorized as poor quality, 56% as moderate, and 12.5% as high. Dysmenorrhea was positively associated with both the presence and severity of chronic pelvic and non-pelvic pain conditions. Based on 6,689 women from 8 studies, those with chronic pelvic pain had 2.43 (95% confidence interval = 1.98, 2.99, I2 = 42%) times the odds of having dysmenorrhea compared to those without. Based on 3,750 women from 11 studies, those with chronic non-pelvic pain had 2.62 (95% confidence interval = 1.84, 3.72, I2 = 72%) times the odds of having dysmenorrhea compared to those without. Overall, dysmenorrhea was associated with 2.50 (95% confidence interval = 2.02, 3.10) times the odds of chronic pain, which did not differ by chronic pelvic vs chronic non-pelvic pain, community vs clinical populations, or different geographical regions. CONCLUSIONS Dysmenorrhea may be a general risk factor for chronic pain, although whether primary dysmenorrhea increases the risk for chronic pain is unclear. Given that adolescence is a sensitive period for neurodevelopment, elucidating the role of primary dysmenorrhea in pain chronicity in future longitudinal studies is important for preventing both chronic pelvic and non-pelvic pain.","Li, Rui; Li, Beixi; Kreher, Donna A; Benjamin, Amy R; Gubbels, Ashley; Smith, Shannon M",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,690,7

METHODS The literature search in Medline and PsycInfo was based on a defined search string and strict exclusion and inclusion criteria. Evaluation of the 5,599 initially identified search hits by two independent reviewers and a detailed quality assessment resulted in six methodologically adequate cohort studies considering the relationship between psychosocial working conditions and burnout (one study) as well as the burnout core component emotional exhaustion (five studies). RESULTS The results of our systematic review point to a relationship between psychosocial working conditions and the development of emotional exhaustion/burnout. Particularly high job demands seem to play a role in the development of emotional exhaustion. However, strong intercorrelations between workplace factors, as a matter of principle, make the identification of a single psychosocial workplace factor (being associated with an especially high or low risk of burnout) difficult. CONCLUSIONS Multidimensional approaches including reduction of work demands, enhancement of decision latitude and improving the social climate might be promising for preventing burnout and emotional exhaustion.

METHODS Six male newborn piglets were subjected to euthanasia and their kidneys were harvested. Necropsy revealed no injury and no underlying pathology in any of the animals used in the experiment. RESULTS The analysis of the renal cortex evidenced in all the animals studied the presence of active nephrogenesis. The sequence of events identified during porcine nephrogenesis was characterized by the appearance, in the metanephric mesenchyme, of nodules undergoing mesenchymal-epithelial transition originating a specific picture that we named the tubulo-glomerular nodule. This peculiar developmental structure gives rise to the precursor of tubular and glomerular structures, till the extrusion of developing glomeruli that progressively migrate toward the mid and deep cortex.

In spite of wide fundamental interest, however, studies providing insights into this adaptation are scarce, because of practical difficulties inherent to the purification and characterization of halophilic enzymes. In this work, we describe the evolutionary history of malate dehydrogenases (MalDH) within Halobacteria (a class of the Euryarchaeota phylum). We resurrected nine ancestors along the inferred halobacterial MalDH phylogeny, including the Last Common Ancestral MalDH of Halobacteria (LCAHa) and compared their biochemical properties with those of five modern halobacterial MalDHs. We monitored the stability of these various MalDHs, their oligomeric states and enzymatic properties, as a function of concentration for different salts in the solvent. We found that a variety of evolutionary processes such as amino acid replacement, gene duplication, loss of MalDH gene and replacement owing to horizontal transfer resulted in significant differences in solubility, stability and catalytic properties between these enzymes in the three Halobacteriales, Haloferacales and Natrialbales orders since the LCAHa MalDH.We also showed how a stability trade-off might favor the emergence of new properties during adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. Altogether, our results suggest a new view of halophilic protein adaptation in Archaea.","Blanquart, Samuel; Groussin, Mathieu; Le Roy, Aline; Szöllosi, Gergely J; Girard, Eric; Franzetti, Bruno; Gouy, Manolo; Madern, Dominique",Molecular biology and evolution,690,1

Medical education has shifted to online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating challenges in adequate training of US. Objectives: In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the discontinuation of traditional classroom teaching, a tele-didactic US course for undergraduate medical students was developed. This study is examining the educational outcome of a new digital US course of the abdomen, thorax and the thyroid gland with the implementation of a modern portable US system. Methods: A tele-guided US course was established between April 1st and June 20th, 2020, at the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Students completed preand post-course surveys and underwent six US organ modules. Each module took place in a flipped-classroom concept including a digital learning platform. An objective structured assessment of US skills (OSAUS) [2] was implemented as final exam. Further, US images of the course and exam were rated by the Brightness Mode Quality Ultrasound Imaging Examination Technique (B-QUIET) [3]. Achieved points in image rating were compared to the OSAUS exam and survey results. Results: A total of 15 medical students were enrolled. There was a significant increase in self-assessed theoretical and practical ability (p < 0.001). Students achieved an average score of 154.5 (SD ± 11.72) out of 175 points (88.29%) in OSAUS, which corresponded to the image rating using B-QUIET and self-assessment data obtained in surveys. Interrater analysis of US images showed a favorable agreement with an ICC (2,1) of 0.895 (95% confidence interval 0.858 < ICC < 0.924). Conclusion: US training via teleguidance should be considered in medical education. Our pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of this concept that can be used in the future to improve US training of medical students even during a pandemic. The digital implementation with an affordable, portable point-of-care-US device could be an incredible opportunity to expedite US training worldwide.","Hohne, E.; Recker, F.; Schmok, E.; Brossart, P.; Raupach, T.; Schafer, V.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,690,28

The Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a domain of Nsp3 – a large multidomain protein that is an essential component of the replication-transcription complex, making it a good therapeutic target. PLpro is a multi-functional protein encoded in coronaviruses that can cleave viral polyproteins, poly-ubiquitin and protective Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 product, ISG15, which mimics a head-to-tail linked ubiquitin (Ub) dimer. PLpro across coronavirus families showed divergent selectivity for recognition and cleavage of these protein substrates despite sequence conservation. However, it is not clear how sequence changes in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro alter its selectivity for substrates and what outcome this has on the pathogenesis of the virus. We show that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro preferentially binds ISG15 over Ub and K48-linked Ub2. We determined crystal structures of PLpro in complex with human K48-Ub2 and ISG15 revealing that dual domain recognition of ISG15 drives substrate selectivity over Ub and Ub2. We also characterized the PLpro substrate interactions using solution NMR, cross-linking mass spectrometry to support that ISG15 is recognized via two domains while Ub2 binds primarily through one Ub domain. Finally, energetic analysis of the binding interfaces between PLpro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with ISG15 and Ub2 define the sequence determinants for how PLpros from different coronaviruses recognize two topologically distinct substrates and how evolution of the protease altered its substrate selectivity. Our work reveals how PLpro substrate selectivity may evolve in PLpro coronaviruses variants enabling design of more effective therapeutics.","Osipiuk, Jerzy; Wydorski, Pawel M.; Lanham, Benjamin T.; Tesar, Christine; Endres, Michael; Engle, Elizabeth; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Mullapudi, Vishruth; Michalska, Karolina; Fidelis, Krzysztof; Fushman, David; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Joachimiak, Lukasz A.",bioRxiv,690,16

To help create safe communities, we aimed to analyze the factors affecting the public’s anxiety and efficacy to overcome crises. The results show that efficacy is associated with sex, education, central government support, the public hygiene environment, and public hygiene behaviors. Anxiety was shown to have a negative relationship with central government support, a positive relationship with civilian support, and a negative relationship with efficacy. For a country to prevent the spread of a novel infectious disease, alleviate the anxiety of the population, and construct a safe community in the midst of a global pandemic, active central government support and response, protection of vulnerable populations, publicization of policies, and crisis management communication are essential. In particular, identifying an evidence-based method to understand and address the psychological and social influences of COVID-19, such as excessive fear and discrimination, providing insight into risk factors associated with future society for policy makers, and establishing potential and sustainable public health communication strategies are of paramount importance.","Lee, Jae-Eun Kwon Seol-A",Sustainability,690,1

In April 2020, Scripps Health, a five-hospital health system in southern California created a subcutaneous Diabetes Ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment option for use with adults, admitted with mild to moderate DKA. Primary aims were to achieve DKA resolution and glycemic targets similar to the intravenous (IV) insulin treatment option, and no hypoglycemia <70 mg/dL. The new order set utilized weight-based dosing, with similar orders for labs, electrolyte and IV fluid replacement, and resolution criteria. Differences included automatic insulin dosing and basal/bolus insulin. Key changes were a reduced frequency of point of care testing (POCT) and ≤140 mg/dL hypoglycemia prevention orders. Post-implementation audits between April - July 2020 showed no hypoglycemia and resolution time similar to IV insulin. However, only 6% (N=17) of DKA cases were managed with subcutaneous, as compared to IV insulin. To help understand why there was such a limited uptake, a detailed retrospective chart review was undertaken on a subset of twenty-two DKA cases managed with IV insulin. Findings showed that 17 (77%) had type 2 diabetes, 5 (23%) had type 1 diabetes. 47% of cases had opportunities for subcutaneous management based on DKA classification and no contraindications for subcutaneous therapy. Findings indicate organizations should consider a DKA subcutaneous option. Lack of knowledge of DKA severity may be a factor in low utilization, therefore an EHR DKA Classification tool was implemented to support providers. Research is needed to determine if this increases utilization of the subcutaneous treatment option and what other barriers exist.","Meehan, Doris Talavera Laura Philis-Tsimikas Athena Fortmann Addie L.",Diabetes,690,1

Perfectionistic characteristics are common among physicians and recent work suggests that perfectionism may play a role in physician burnout. The current study aims were to assess the prevalence of burnout among pediatric emergency medicine physicians (PEMP) during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine the effects of demographics and perfectionism on burnout. Methods: Participants included 20 attending PEMP (50% female) within a children’s hospital. Participants completed self-report behavioral instruments between August 2020 and February 2021. Perfectionism was assessed via the Socially Prescribed (ie, beliefs that others impose unrealistic standards) and Self-Oriented Perfectionism (ie, high self-standards) subscales of the Big Three Perfectionism Scale. Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment Burnout levels were assessed via the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Mean difference and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: In this sample, 5% of PEMP endorsed high levels of emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment burnout, and 35% reported high levels of depersonalization burnout. Demographic factors were not associated with burnout. PEMP who endorsed high depersonalization burnout also reported significantly higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism (11.14 vs. 8.00, Z =-2.02, p =.028). The odds of experiencing high depersonalization burnout was 1.64 (95% CI 1.05-2.54) higher with each unit increase in socially prescribed perfectionism ( X 2 =6.39, p =.012). No other factors were associated with burnout. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 35% of PEMP reported high levels of depersonalization burnout, which reflects interpersonal detachment from patients and peers. Socially prescribed perfectionism was the only PEMP characteristic associated with burnout. Collectively, results suggest that stronger beliefs that others expect perfect performance may have contributed to interpersonal detachment while navigating stressors during the pandemic. Future work in larger PEMP samples is needed to confirm the current findings and address individual and system-level factors that may promote detrimental perfectionistic expectations.","Martin, S.

The relationship between CT-CTA features and arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters is not fully understood. Methods: Chest CT images were acquired with Dual Source 384-slice (2×192) CT (Siemens SOMATOM Force). Quantitative volumetric assessment of lung lesions and the CT severity score were calculated by using a deep learning algorithm trained on COVID-19 pneumonia and correlated with ABG parameters. Assessment of pulmonary vascular tree was performed on CTA images. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney U test and non-parametric Spearman’s Rho test, with significance threshold at P<0.05. Results: Out of the 36 patients referred to the Covid Center, 30.6% (11/36) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 69.4% (25/36) to the non-ICU low-cure Covid Medicine. We found a significant inverse relationship between the P/F ratio and lung lesion volume relative percentages (r=–0.52;95% CI: –0.72, –0.23;P=0.001), absolute volume (r=–0.58;95% CI: –0.76, –0.31;P<0.001) and the CT severity score (r=–0.60;95% CI: –0.77, –0.34;P<0.001) at day 0. At day 7, CTA showed pulmonary embolism in 2/10 patients (20%). In 9/10 patients (90%) CTA detected vascular wall thickening/irregularity and stenoses of segmental and/or subsegmental branches of pulmonary artery. CTA demonstrated subsegmental tubular vessel dilation in all cases (100%) and the presence of subsegmental focal vessel dilations in 6/10 patients (60%). Conclusions: In conclusion, 384-row Chest CTA is able to capture the full spectrum of vascular pathology in COVID-19, comprising pulmonary embolism and stenoses together with tubular and focal dilations of segmental and/or subsegmental branches of pulmonary artery. © Journal of Xiangya Medicine.

It has varied clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to critical illness. It has led to the mortality of several affected individuals. However, the prognosis seems to vary from one person to the other and efforts are being made to identify the prognostic factors. Hypocalcaemia has been identified as a poor prognostic factor with a high frequency among individuals affected with COVID-19. This review aims to estimate the prevalence of hypocalcaemia among COVID-19 patients and identify the poor prognostic factors associated with the presence of hypocalcaemia in COVID-19 patients. Electronic medical databases were searched for publications on the prognostic implications of hypocalcaemia in COVID-19 infection, and relevant articles were selected for systematic review following PRISMA algorithm. The prevalence of hypocalcaemia among patients with COVID-19 was 40.0-74.4%. There was a significant association between the rate of hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as septic shock and hypocalcaemia in patients with COVID-19. Hypocalcaemia is also associated with a higher mortality rate in these patients. COVID-19 patients with hypocalcaemia tend to have elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, alanine transaminase, procalcitonin, serum creatinine and low albumin. Hypocalcaemia is common in COVID-19 patients and is a poor prognostic factor in these patients. Presence of hypocalcaemia is associated with a severe illness and even death.","Azeez, T.

By way of exploring and operationalizing disease forecasting, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted FluSight since the 2013/14 flu season, an annual flu forecasting challenge. Since FluSight’s onset, forecasters have developed and improved forecasting models in an effort to provide more timely, reliable, and accurate information about the likely progression of the outbreak. While improving the predictive performance of these forecasting models is often the primary objective, it is also important for a forecasting model to run quickly, facilitating further model development, improvement, and scalability. In this vein I introduce Inferno, a fast and accurate flu forecasting model inspired by Dante, the top performing model in the 2018/19 FluSight challenge. When compared to all models that participated in FluSight 2018/19, Inferno would have placed 2nd in both the national and state challenges, behind only Dante. Inferno, however, runs in minutes and is trivially parallelizable, while Dante takes hours to run, representing a significant operational improvement with minimal impact to performance. A future consideration for forecasting competitions like FluSight will be how to encourage improvements to secondarily important properties of forecasting models, such as runtime, generalizability, and interpretability.","Osthus, Dave",bioRxiv,690,1

This bottleneck is particularly pronounced when interrogating long-range co-evolution given the read-length limitations of next-generation sequencing platforms. This has hampered the direct observation of long-range genetic interactions that code for protein-protein interfaces with relevance in both drug and vaccine development. Here we overcome these technical limitations by developing a nanopore-based long-range viral sequencing pipeline that yields accurate single molecule sequences of circulating virions from clinical samples. We demonstrate its utility in observing the evolution of individual HIV Gag-Pol genomes in response to antiviral pressure. Our pipeline, called Multi-read Hairpin Mediated Error-correction Reaction (MrHAMER), yields >1000s viral genomes per sample at 99.9% accuracy, maintains the original proportion of sequenced virions present in a complex mixture, and allows the detection of rare viral genomes with their associated mutations present at <1% frequency. This method facilitates scalable investigation of genetic correlates of resistance to both antiviral therapy and immune pressure, and enable the identification of novel host-viral and viral-viral interfaces that can be modulated for therapeutic benefit.","Gallardo, CM; Wang, S; Montiel-Garcia, DJ; Little, SJ; Smith, DM; Routh, AL; Torbett, BE",bioRxiv,690,10

This study examines equality in the regional distribution of medical imaging devices within the scope of health expenditures. Turkey's Nomenclature of Territorial Units Level 1 regions' data have been used as a representative dataset. Regions were compared in terms of the number of medical imaging devices and imaging numbers. According to the indicator of the total number of medical imaging devices per 1 million people, the highest number of medical imaging devices was in Istanbul and least in the Middle East Anatolia Region. According to the imaging number indicators for every 1,000 examinations, it was found that the highest and lowest regions were in Istanbul and the Eastern Black Sea, respectively. The findings of this study show that there is an inequality in the regional distribution of medical imaging devices. Based on the findings, it can be argued that the main reason for this inequality is that private sector investments are concentrated in some regions. In addition, higher public health expenditure per capita in some regions can be argued as another reason.","Nak, Hayrettin Sağbaş amp; Iacute,; sa,",Maliye Arastirma Merkezi Konferanslari,690,20

We sequenced and genotyped 189 white-bellied pangolins from 18 forests and 12 wildlife markets using one mitochondrial fragment and 20 microsatellites loci. Tree-based assignment procedure showed the ‘endemicity’ of the pangolin trade, as strictly fed by the lineage endemic to the DG (DGL). DGL populations were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity, an overall absence of equilibrium, inbreeding depression and lack of geographic structure. We identified a 92-98% decline in DGL effective population size 200-500 ya –concomitant with major political transformations along the ‘Slave Coast’– leading to contemporaneous estimates inferior to minimum viable population size. Genetic tracing suggested that wildlife markets from the DG sourced through the entire DGL range. Our loci provided the necessary power to distinguish among all the genotyped pangolins, tracing the dispatch of same individuals on the markets and within local communities. We developed an approach combining rarefaction analysis of private allele frequencies and cross-validation with observed data that could trace five traded pangolins to their forest origin, c. 200-300 km away from the markets. Although the genetic toolkit that we designed from traditional markers can prove helpful to trace the pangolin trade, our tracing ability was limited by the lack of population structure within DGL. Given the deleterious combination of genetic, demographic and trade-related factors affecting DGL populations, the conservation status of white-bellied pangolins in the DG should be urgently re-evaluated.","Zanvo, Stanislas; Djagoun, Sylvestre C.A.M.; Azihou, Akomian F.; Djossa, Bruno; Afiademanyo, Komlan; Olayemi, Ayodedji; Agbangla, Clément; Sinsin, Brice; Gaubert, Philippe",bioRxiv,690,19

One of their potential applications is the customization of plant metabolome through the activation of selected enzymes in a given metabolic pathway. Using the previously described multiplexable CRISPR activator dCasEV2.1, we assayed the selective enrichment in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves of four different flavonoids, namely naringenin, eriodictyol, kaempferol and quercetin. After careful selection of target genes and guide RNAs combinations, we created successful activation programs for each of the four metabolites, each program activating between three and seven genes, and with individual gene activation levels ranging from 4- to 1500-fold. Metabolic analysis of the flavonoid profiles of each multigene activation program showed a sharp and selective enrichment of the intended metabolites and their glycosylated derivatives. Remarkably, principal component analysis of untargeted metabolic profiles clearly separated samples according to their activation treatment, and hierarchical clustering separated the samples in five groups, corresponding to the expected four highly enriched metabolite groups, plus an un-activated control. These results demonstrate that dCasEV2.1 is a powerful tool for re-routing metabolic fluxes towards the accumulation of metabolites of interest, opening the door for custom-made design of metabolic contents in plants.","Selma, S; Sanmartín, N; Espinosa-Ruiz, A; Gianoglio, S; Lopez-Gresa, MP; Vázquez-Vilar, M; Flors, V; Granell, A; Orzaez, D",bioRxiv,690,1

Both are critical nucleotide metabolizing enzymes of the adenosine generating pathway and are secreted by neuronal or immune cells. Adenosine plays a role in energy processes, neurotransmission, and endogenous regulation of inflammatory responses. Istradefylline is a selective adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) antagonist used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We have reported that adenosine primes hypersecretion of interleukin (IL)-17A via A2aR. Istradefylline, as well as an inhibitor of CD39 (ARL67156) and an inhibitor of CD73 (AMP-CP), suppressed IL-17A production, and the administration of istradefylline to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) led to the marked amelioration of the disease. These previous results suggest that adenosine is an endogenous modulator of neutrophilic inflammation. We investigated the effect of istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP-CP on other mouse models of neutrophilic inflammation. Methods We tested the effect of istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP-CP on OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation or imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis in mice. These two model mice received these drugs orally or percutaneously, respectively. The production of IL-17A in the lung and ear thickness were used as an index of the effects. Results We show that istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP-CP suppressed the OVA-induced IL-17A production in the lung and imiquimod-induced psoriasis. Conclusion These results indicate that adenosine-mediated IL-17A production plays a role in neutrophilic inflammation models, and moreover, istradefylline, ARL67156, and AMP-CP are effective in animal models of neutrophilic inflammation.

The analysis uses particle and gas concentrations from surface in situ sampling, column aerosol and gas properties from photometer/spectrometers, and satellite NO2 determinations at five sites distributed over the whole Italian territory: Aosta, Milan, Bologna, Rome, and Taranto. These data are related to meteorological conditions to identify the numerous events of long-range transport and separate local from remote influences. Four different types of long-range transport over Italy are identified during the lockdown period, affecting PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations, and aerosol optical depths: fires plumes from Eastern Europe and Montenegro, dust from the Caspian area and from the Sahara, and pollution from the Po Valley. Once the long-range transport events are identified and excluded, the variation of gas and particle concentrations occurring during the containment period is calculated with respect to the period 2015–2019. A general decrease of PM10 (ranging from a maximum of −52% in Aosta to a minimum of −4% in Taranto), PM2.5 (from −46% in Aosta and Milan to −0.6% in Bologna), BC (from −77% in Aosta to −25% in Milan), NO2 (from −72% in Rome to −4% in Taranto), and benzene (about −50%) concentration is found. A positive variation of PM2.5 is conversely found during March in the southern sites due to some stagnation events, and a strong increase of benzene (up to +104%) in the industrial area of Taranto. Ozone is found to increase by an average of about 30% in all sites. The removal of the long-range transport contributions affects the variations with respect to the reference period reducing the concentrations by up to 22% for PM10 and 29% for PM2.5 in the northern sites, and 18% for PM10 and 16% for PM2.5 in the southern sites. For NO2 the reduction due to the removal is up to 14% in Milan and 6% in the southern sites, while for the aerosol optical depth it is up to 70% in Aosta and 50% in Rome.","Campanelli, M.; Iannarelli, A.

Consider the risks facing executives in 2021 as cataloged in a recent Forbes article:[12] The virus causing COVID-19 mutates (external risk);Business suffers in the fallout from a government action (political risk);Diversity programs fail (reputation risk);Startups disrupt markets (competitive risk);Growth is stymied (business risk);Key talent leaves (operating risk);Plain vanilla competition wins market share (competitive risk);A sudden market pivot trips planning (strategic risk);IT security is threatened (IT risk);The business needs to pivot again – HARD (pivot risk).

Lung CT can be analysed with the support of deep learning methods for both aforementioned tasks. We have developed a U-net based algorithm to segment the COVID-19 lesions. Unfortunately, public datasets populated with a huge amount of labelled CT scans of patients affected by COVID-19 are not available. In this work, we first review all the currently available public datasets of COVID-19 CT scans, presenting an extensive description of their characteristics. Then, we describe the design of the U-net we developed for the automated identification of COVID-19 lung lesions. Finally, we discuss the results obtained by using the different publicly available datasets. In particular, we trained the U-net on the dataset made available within the COVID-19 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge 2020, and we tested it on data from the MosMed and the COVID-19-CT-Seg datasets to explore the transferability of the model and to assess whether the image annotation process affects the detection performances. We evaluated the performance of the system in lesion segmentation in terms of the Dice index, which measures the overlap between the ground truth and the predicted masks. The proposed U-net segmentation model reaches a Dice index equal to 0.67, 0.42 and 0.58 on the independent validation sets of the COVID-19 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge 2020, on the MosMed and on the COVID-19-CT-Seg datasets, respectively. This work focusing on lesion segmentation constitutes a preliminary work for a more accurate analysis of COVID-19 lesions, based for example on the extraction and analysis of radiomic features.

A strict lockdown from early 2021 combined with an aggressive vaccination programme enabled a gradual easing of lockdown measures to be introduced whilst both deaths and reported case numbers reduced to less than 3% of their peak. The emergence of the Delta variant in April 2021 has reversed this trend, and the UK is once again experiencing surging cases, albeit with reduced average severity due to the success of the vaccination rollout. This study presents the results of a modelling exercise which simulates the progression of the pandemic in the UK through projection of daily case numbers as lockdown lifts. Methods: A simulation model based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered structure was built. A timeline of UK lockdown measures was used to simulate the changing restrictions. The model was tailored for the UK, with some values set based on research and others obtained through calibration against 16 months of historical data. Results: The model projects that if lockdown restrictions are lifted in July 2021, UK COVID-19 cases will peak at hundreds of thousands daily in most viable scenarios, reducing in late 2021 as immunity acquired through both vaccination and infection reduces the susceptible population percentage. Further lockdown measures can be used to reduce daily cases. Other than the ever-present threat of the emergence of new variants, the most significant unknown factors affecting the profile of the pandemic in the UK are the length and strength of immunity, with daily peak cases over 50% higher if immunity lasts 8 months compared to 12 months. Another significant factor is the percentage of unreported cases. The reduced case severity associated with vaccination may lead to a higher proportion of unreported mild or asymptomatic cases, meaning that unmanaged infections resulting from unknown cases will continue to be a major source of infection. Conclusions: Further research into the length and strength of both recovered and vaccinated COVID-19 immunity is critical to delivering more accurate projections from models, thus enabling more finely tuned policy decisions. The model presented in this article, whilst by no means perfect, aims to contribute to greater transparency of the modelling process, which can only increase trust between policy makers, journalists and the general public.","Brereton, Claire Pedercini Matteo",Systems,690,1

Patients with pernicious anemia have a higher incidence of other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid issues. Therefore, the disease has a clear autoimmune basis, although the genetic susceptibility factors have thus far remained poorly studied. We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in 2,166 cases and 659,516 European controls from population-based biobanks and identified genome-wide significant signals in or near the PTPN22 (rs6679677, p=1.91 x 10-24, OR=1.63), PNPT1 (rs12616502, p=3.14 x 10-8, OR=1.70), HLA-DQB1 (rs28414666, p=1.40 x 10-16, OR=1.38), IL2RA (rs2476491, p=1.90 x 10-8, OR=1.22) and AIRE (rs74203920, p=2.33 x 10-9, OR=1.83) genes, thus providing the first robust associations between pernicious anemia and genetic risk factors.

The aim of this study was to audit a high-risk neonate home care program during the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive-analytical study was conducted with the participation of 158 high-risk neonates discharged from neonatal intensive care units of hospitals. Data collection was performed through questionnaire and a researcher-made checklist. The researcher observed and evaluated 7 areas of healthcare. The study was first performed in person, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, the researcher evaluated these cares in absentia. The results of the study showed that the mean score of in-person “conduction” was 56.7 and in-absentia conduction was 52.5 and the mean score of in-person “education” was 63.6 and in-absentia conduction was 65.6. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the in-person and in-absentia methods. Moreover, while 53.2% of caregivers performed well, 33.5% of them performed poorly. According to the results, the implementation of home care program for high-risk neonates is relatively desirable. However, some regular evaluation and review need to be conducted on instructions and implementations. Regular education of caregivers and, finally, regular in-person and in-absentia monitoring is essential. In-absentia home care during the COVID-19 pandemic was not an obstacle to the implementation of the program and it was implemented through telephone and follow-up.

Materials and methods. Information search was carried out in PubMed, MedLine, Scopus, Web of Science, RSCI. The work included data from literature and information sources that were published before February 2021. Results. The data of retrospective and prospective clinical studies are analyzed. This paper reflects considerations and recommendations for the vaccination of cancer patients by Russian and foreign specialists in the context of COVID?19 pandemic. The review presents current recommendations for vaccination against SARS-COV?2 in patients with solid tumors, hematological malignancies, recipients of hematopoietic stem cells and cell therapy. Conclusion. To date, groups at increased risk of infection with the new coronavirus have been identified. These groups include patients with cancer. The presence of tumor does not allow a delay in start of therapy, and requires careful monitoring and observation. In this regard, despite the pandemic, the treatment of cancer patients must be continued regardless of the circumstances. Cancer patients should not be deprived of the opportunity to be vaccinated against SARS-COV?2. Every patient should be decided individually. At the moment, there are no officially approved recommendations for vaccination against SARS-COV?2 for cancer patients. Before the creation and approval of final recommendations for cancer patients, it is necessary to focus on compliance with sanitary and anti-epidemic measures and the prevention of COVID?19 infection. The global cancer community continues to actively develop recommendations for the optimal vaccination against SARS-COV?2 in cancer patients.

However, urban destinations can also offer outdoor winter sports and an integrated set of urban tourism product bundles not only sports-related. Previous research has strongly focused on highly developed rural winter sports destinations but has barely explored the case of urban destinations offering winter sports as an integrated activity in their urban tourism product bundles. This paper, therefore, investigates the potential for market innovations that combine urban assets with winter sports activities by segmenting urban winter sports tourists and extending the understanding of urban tourism attractiveness. This paper identifies skiers’ motivation factors for visiting urban destinations with a winter sports infrastructure. It builds on a three-step quantitative approach (N = 338) with factor analysis, cluster analysis and posthoc testing to compare cluster means. The results highlight five push (exciting, knowledge, relaxation, achievement and family) and six pull factors (basic assets, urban assets, natural scenery, social events, economic aspects and winter sports activities), which can be clustered into three unique and statistically different groups: “moderate skiers”, “urban recreational skiers” and “focused skiers”. Addressing these identified clusters highlights the market potential of bundling winter sports and urban tourism, thereby addressing customers who have not been of strategic relevance for winter destinations. Additionally, urban winter destinations can gain a unique selling proposition and help to counteract crowding tendencies in rural alpine winter sports while also improving urban destination attractiveness post-COVID-19. Management implications Our findings deliver empirical support for destination managers' efforts in establishing urban destinations as alternative skiing hotspots (cf. Grenoble and Innsbruck). Urban destination managers should evaluate destinations' profiles and consider including (winter) sports as an integrated activity in their urban tourism product bundles. Winter sports can help to diversify urban destinations and improve their strategic positioning. Segmentation studies help marketers to address specific target groups;in the urban winter tourism context, these often include “moderate skiers”, “urban recreational skiers” and “focused skiers”. Empirical findings show that skiers' request multi-optional holidays with urban assets and not only sports-related activities. An innovative combination of urban tourism with winter sports offers new experiences and helps to increase visibility and customer satisfaction in competitive markets. Urban areas offer touristic infrastructure and authentic local assets which contribute to the overall tourism experience of winter sports tourists","Bichler, Bernhard Fabian Pikkemaat Birgit",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,690,16

As providers of education, Universities must adapt to this rapidly changing environment. The emergence of exciting, “disruptive” technologies has provided the tools needed for educators to revolutionize the delivery of higher education. The University of Florida, through UF Online, provides students the opportunity to enroll in fully online four-year undergraduate degrees. In this report, we describe the development of fully online laboratories for the upper-division course Evolutionary Developmental Biology, which fulfill the University of Florida’s laboratory requirement. This course is taken by Biology, Zoology, and related majors, including majors in the 100% online Biology degree. The experiments in the virtual laboratories would have been impossible to teach in a residential setting due to time constraints, cost, student safety issues, and regulatory/certification requirements. The ability to perform these experiments online provided University of Florida undergraduates located throughout the world access to unique, one-of-a-kind laboratory experiences. The virtual laboratories allowed students to undertake in-depth exploration and application of course content that is not possible in a residential setting. Completion of the Evolutionary Developmental Biology course provided undergraduate students the opportunity to obtain a science degree without ever visiting the university’s residential campus.

Post-COVID, the commercial rent gradient falls by roughly 15% in transit cities, and the premium for proximity to transit stops also falls.

Objectives: The present research aimed to evaluate the outcome of diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection, and the clinical and biochemical characteristics in survived and non-survived patients. Patients and Methods: The present single-center, cross-sectional study examined laboratory and clinical features of 160 patients with diabetes who had moderate to severe criteria. The obtained data were categorized as survived or non-survived patients and then we compared the clinical characteristics in two groups. Results: In this study, 160 diabetic patients (75 men and 85 women) admitted with moderate to severe Covid-19 were evaluated. The mean age of studied patients was 51-90 years old, with diabetes duration of 5 to 15 years. One hundred thirty-one patients (81.9%) survived, but twenty-nine patients (18.1%) did not survive. Regarding the comparison of symptoms, only the loss of consciousness on admission was higher in non- survived patients;however, a majority of the non-survivors have been admitted to ICU, 23(79.3%) and 26 (89.6%) needed invasive mechanical ventilation;in comparison to survived patients also had a shorter duration of hospital stay (5.5 +/- 5.1 versus 8.4 +/- 6.1days).

This study investigates the mental health challenges that socially vulnerable populations often face during crises and presents the factors affecting these populations during (and following) the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on an analysis of these factors, several recommendations are made to aid emergency managers, public health officials, policymakers, and academics in better addressing mental health challenges as we continue to battle COVID-19 and in preparation for future public health crises. © 2021 Weston Medical Publishing.

Dentists are at a great risk of contracting and transmitting this fatal disease. However, as health care personnel this is our duty to treat patients especially in emergency situations when treatment is inevitable. Equipping ourselves with adequate knowledge and safety measures will not only protect us but our patients as well. The routes of transmission of nCOVID-19 include direct and indirect contact with the infected person. Dental operatory offers plethora of opportunities for transmission because of the nature of the work done so it is important that clinical management should begin even before the patient enters the dental clinic.

We analysed the data of the death tolls provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics in April 2020 with the aim to provide reliable estimates and maps of deaths due to Covid-19 at the local scale, and hence better guiding decisions on spatial planning. Firstly, we performed a statistical analysis at the national level, carried out on a region-by-region basis, to compare the total number of deaths in 2020 to the average values of the previous five years. We focused on the last three weeks of March when the lockdown restrictions have been fully applied. We observed that the mortality rate has been much higher than the average recorded in recent years (2015-2019), both in Italy and Lombardy. Additionally, we estimated that the ‘excess deaths’ in March 2020 are more than fourfold (325% in Italy) the official number of deaths due to Covid-19 reported by the Ministry of Health. This leads to the dramatic consideration that most of the Covid-19-related deaths occurred at home. Lastly, using geo-referenced data by Geographic Information System analysis at the municipality scale, we investigated the Covid-19 effects by grouping the deceased into five age-groups, aiming to map the correlation between geography and population age. Lombardy is a wide region, characterized by various territories, such as mountains, flat landscapes, metropolitan and touristic areas. The Covid-19 pandemic affected each area in a specific way. For each of them, according to the demographic pyramid’s reconfiguration, we should assume an urban planning scenario that is place-based, sustainable and resilient.","Fior, Marika Mpampatsikos Vassilis",Journal of Urban Management,690,1

However, some governments are allegedly manipulating social media by hiring online commentators (also known as trolls) to spread propaganda and disinformation. In particular, an alleged system of professional trolls operating both domestically and internationally exists in Russia. In 2018, Twitter released data on accounts identified as Russian trolls, starting a wave of research. However, while foreign-targeted English language operations of these trolls have received significant attention, no research has analyzed their Russian language domestic and regional-targeted activities. We address this gap by characterizing the Russian-language operations of Russian trolls. We first perform a descriptive analysis, and then focus in on the trolls' operation related to the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Among other things, we find that Russian-language trolls have run 163 hashtag campaigns (where hashtag use grows abruptly within a month). The main political sentiments of such campaigns were praising Russia and Putin (29%), criticizing Ukraine (26%), and criticizing the United States and Obama (9%). Further, trolls actively reshared information with 76% of tweets being retweets or containing a URL. Additionally, we observe periodic temporal patterns of tweeting suggesting that trolls use automation tools. Further, we find that trolls' information campaign on the MH17 crash was the largest in terms of tweet count. However, around 68% of tweets posted with MH17 hashtags were likely used simply for hashtag amplification. With these tweets excluded, about 49% of the tweets suggested to varying levels that Ukraine was responsible for the crash, and only 13% contained disinformation and propaganda presented as news. Interestingly, trolls promoted inconsistent alternative theories for the crash.","Vesselkov, Alexandr; Finley, Benjamin; Vankka, Jouko",,690,24

In our analysis, we outline collective insecurity at two levels: the micro level of migrant workers' daily, subjective experiences of insecurity;and the macro level, in which insecurity is a consequence of structural forces, specifically the globalization of labor. These two levels interact symbiotically, producing states of insecurity that are concretely experienced as anxiety and fear. Migrant workers in Malaysia also practice agency through small forms of resistance that they use to bolster one another and reduce their insecure experiences. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia, migrant workers have been further marginalized by the state, but they have also become connected to one another through acts of solidarity and resistance.

The primary impediments to achieving this goal in any interaction between students and vulnerable peoples are: (1) the belief that a student’s reflection on their experience is sufficient, both to evaluate community impact and to promote student learning;(2) the assumption that service always has positive results;and most critically;(3) the concept of service itself. While something new and positive can be created to replace international service-learning, the changes required to do so are so fundamental that the result will be something completely different from the way that international service-learning is conducted today. We argue for the need to reframe international service-learning with a focus on reciprocal learning or risk continuing to function as a neocolonial practice with likely harm to communities and to our students as we engage in practices that reify global inequality.","Gregory, Lynn Schroeder Kathleen Wood Cynthia",Sustainability,690,16

This was associated with a case fatality rate decrease from 9.33% to 2.97%. No decrease was seen in Mexico, a similar Latin American country that did not introduce multi-drug treatment protocols at that time. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to use statistical process control to assess the likelihood that the decrease in case fatality rate in Honduras was due to chance, using Mexico as a control country. METHODS: Fourteen day running average COVID-19 case fatality rates in Honduras and Mexico were used to create Shewhart control charts during the first 6 months of the epidemic. The date of implementation in Honduras of the inpatient and outpatient multi-drug COVID-19 protocols were plotted on control charts, with a Mexican COVID-19 case fatality control chart for comparison. RESULTS: The case fatality rate for COVID-19 in Honduras dropped below the lower control limit 9 days after implementation of an inpatient and outpatient multi-drug therapeutic protocol, from an average 9.33% case fatality rate to 5.01%. The Honduran COVID-19 case fatality rate again dropped below the lower control limit to 2.97%, 17 days after launching a substantial government program to make the protocol medications accessible to underserved areas. Shewhart control chart plots of case fatality rates in Honduras suggest a plausible temporal association between the implementation dates of both the initial protocol implementation on May 3, 2020, and the outreach effort on June 10, 2020, and statistically significant control chart anomalies. No control chart anomalies were seen during that time in Mexico. CONCLUSION: Decreases in COVID-19 case fatality rates in Honduras were associated with both the initial publication a multi-drug COVID-19 therapeutic protocol and a subsequent outreach program.","Ontai, S.

Even though ‘symmetrical’ and other object-agency approaches are still growing in mainstream archaeological debate, much of the source literature upon which they draw has been around for several decades, and accumulated a fair amount of critique. At the very least, therefore, we need to learn from the way the materiality debate is playing out in other sub-fields.

Regular exposure to such stressful news may elicit different emotions in people and engage them in using strategies to control their emotions. In the present study, we aimed at exploring the most common negative emotion(s) experienced by individuals, as well as the most frequent Emotion Regulation (ER) strategies used facing the COVID-19-related news. We also examined whether the variable of personal relevance can moderate these emotional responses. Methods: 617 individuals living in Tehran who regularly read the news about the COVID-19 from the early stages of spread completed an online survey. After excluding the participants with high scores from the Beck Depression Inventory (&gt;18), data obtained from 443 participants were analyzed in terms of the experienced negative emotions and ER strategies. Results: Anxiety (55.8%) was the most common negative emotion reported by participants facing COVID-19-related news and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy used to control negative emotions. Both groups with high and low personal relevance indicated a similar pattern in experiencing high and low arousal emotions, as well as using ER strategies, and no significant differences were found (X 2=0.006, p=0.51; X 2=0.14, p=0.39, respectively). We also found that participants with high scores in the resilience scale used an integrative rather than a single approach of the ER strategies (rbp=0.15, p=0.01). Conclusion: We found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, news media may have important role in triggering anxiety in people who regularly read the relevant news, and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy among them. Being directly involved with COVID-19 in personal life did not make any differences in the way that individuals emotionally respond to the news.

Design: Content analysis of primary, qualitative data collection, informed by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation (COM-B) theory of behaviour, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) approach. Setting: Health facilities and local communities in five LMICs in Africa and Asia. Participants: Health facility prescribers and local community adults. Intervention: Febrile illness is a common presentation among adults and children in primary care settings, but diagnosing the cause of fever is challenging, especially in low-resource settings. Prescribers and patients behaviours underpin treatment practices, and antibiotics are the customary fallback choice for lack of better alternatives. However, in most cases antibiotics would not be required, do not cure the ongoing infection, and may have short-term (toxicity, costs) and long-term (drug resistance) untoward effects. Trialling new approaches including point-of-care tests and diagnostic algorithms alone would provide limited information on real-life applicability if behaviours are not accounted for. Accordingly, we designed an innovative, multiphase, mixed methods study, combining qualitative and behaviour approaches, with a quantitative two-arm, clinic based, randomised controlled trial. Qualitative and behavioural methods are used to: support the development of the Training & Communication component of the clinical trial, collect patient information on adherence, and support recommendations for future behaviour change interventions. This paper describes the qualitative research methods used to generate the clinical trial training and communication interventions, in support of adherence to prescriptions.","Horgan, P.; Salami, O.; Otmani del Barrio, M.; Tomar, A.; Chadha, S.

The fast progression of COVID-19 has been mainly related to the high contagion rate of the virus and the worldwide mobility of humans. In the absence of pharmacological therapies, governments from different countries have introduced several non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce human mobility and social contact. Several studies based on Anonymised Mobile Phone Data have been published analysing the relationship between human mobility and the spread of coronavirus. However, to our knowledge, none of these data-sets integrates cross-referenced geo-localised data on human mobility and COVID-19 cases into one all-inclusive open resource.

In recent years, epigenetic modifications induced by BCG have been demonstrated to reflect a state of trained immunity. The concept of trained immunity is now explored as a potential prevention strategy for a variety of infections. Studies on human TB immunity are dominated by those using peripheral blood as surrogate markers for immunity. Here, we instead studied the lung compartment by obtaining induced sputum from subjects included in a TB contact tracing. CD3- and HLA-DR-positive cells were isolated from the collected sputum and DNA methylome analyses performed. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that DNA methylomes of cells from TB-exposed individuals and controls appeared as separate clusters, and the numerous genes that were differentially methylated were functionally connected. The enriched pathways were strongly correlated to previously reported epigenetic changes and trained immunity in immune cells exposed to the BCG vaccine in human and animal studies. We further demonstrated that similar pathways were epigenetically modified in human macrophages trained with BCG in vitro. Finally, we found evidence of an M. tuberculosis-triggered emergence of a non-macrophage cell population from BCG-trained macrophage cultures. These cells did not phagocytose M. tuberculosis, but corralled the bacteria into focal points, resulting in limitation of bacterial growth. Altogether, our study demonstrates that similar epigenetic changes are induced by M. tuberculosis and BCG and suggests that the modifications promote transformation of macrophages (or an unknown progenitor) to establish a yet undescribed cellular defense mechanism which we term corralling, based on the metaphorical resemblance to sheepdog herding.","Pehrson, I.; Braian, C.; Karlsson, L.; Idh, N.; Danielsson, E.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 179 consecutive patients at an academic hospital in Chicago, Illinois. A sample of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 21st, 2020 and January 12th, 2021were divided in 3 groups according to the clinical severity of COVID: 1) Mild (outpatient treatment only);2) Moderate (hospital admission);3) Severe (ventilatory support and/or death). Results: Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) before COVID-19 was 8.43 (±2.0) %. Mean age was 59.6 (±11.9) years, 57.54% were male, 51.9% Hispanic and 41.9% African Americans. Sixty-four patients (35.8%) had mild disease (outpatient treatment, group 1), 93 (52%) moderate (hospital admission without the need for ventilatory support, group 2), and 22 (12.3%) severe disease (intubation and/or death, group 3). Baseline glycemic control was not associated with the clinical outcomes of COVID. Among various therapeutic agents, only metformin use was significantly associated with mild disease versus moderate and severe forms of COVID, controlling for GFR. Fifty-four patients (84.4%) in group 1 were taking metformin, compared with 63 (35%) and 11 (50%) in the moderate and severe groups, respectively. Conclusion: Here we report that use of metformin was associated with a lower chance of developing moderate (hospitalization) or severe forms (ventilatory support and/or death) of COVID-19 in ethnic minority patients with diabetes.

A study was conducted to understand the impact on mental and sexual wellbeing among Male and Gender-Diverse People who have Sex with Men.MethodsA structured anonymous survey was conducted online, advertised via social media using a convenience sampling approach. Participants were asked about use of sexual health interventions and sexual networking apps, sexual behaviour and COVID-19. Qualitative interview participants were purposively sampled from survey participants who provided contact details for that purpose.ResultsN=1429 MGDPSM completed the survey (March-July 2020). N=15 survey respondents who reported having casual sex partners during lockdown participated in an interview (August 2020-February 2021). N=331 (26.5%) reported feeling anxious about COVID-19 more than half of the time. N=155 (12.1%) reported 1 casual sex partner during lockdown, and n=156 (12.2%) reported 2+. N=1014 (77.6%) reported decreasing their number of casual sex partners during lockdown. This was not associated with COVID-19 anxiety (Chi-square=0.82 p=0.36) or belief about being infected (Chi-square=1.77 p=0.41). Qualitative findings suggest desire to comply with guidance was a key motivator in reducing casual partner numbers, and that this was facilitated by using COVID-19 risk-reduction strategies such as having virtual sex.ConclusionThe majority of survey respondents reduced casual partner numbers. This may be explained by desire to adhere to physical distancing measures which was not measured but which emerged as a key motivator among interviewees. As the pandemic continues alongside growing lockdown fatigue, future research is needed to identify and monitor motivations to reduce casual partner numbers during future physical distancing requirements, and to ensure health promotion highlights self-protective strategies available to MGDPSM.","Edelman, N.; Nutland, W.; Witzel, T.; Samba, P.; Nadarzynski, T.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,690,22

Data sources An electronic search was performed on seven databases: CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Emcare, British Nursing Index, and Web of Science. Study selection and data extraction Seventy-six peer-reviewed, English language studies that investigated fatigue or vitality in adult patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and followed up for any period were included. Extracted data were split into three datasets for analysis: data from vitality domain of SF-36 (dataset A), other quantitative data (dataset B), and qualitative data (dataset C). Methodological quality was assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) tools. Data synthesis We adopted a segregated approach to mixed-methods synthesis. We merged all datasets, attributing all results to one of four qualitative themes. These were prevalence and severity, contributing factors, impacts on quality of life, assessment and management. Results The prevalence of fatigue ranged from 13.8 to 80.9 %. Fatigue severity reached its nadir at approximately one month post ICU discharge, improved over time but seldom reached reference population scores. Various biological, disease related and psychological factors associated with fatigue were identified including age, poor pre-morbid status and sleep disturbance. No critical illness specific tool to assess fatigue in ICU survivors was identified. A paucity of evidence based interventions for management of fatigue in ICU survivors were identified despite fatigue negatively impacting on survivors quality of life. Conclusions This mixed method review shows that fatigue is highly prevalent in ICU survivors, negatively impacting their recovery. To date, no ICU specific fatigue assessment tool or targeted intervention has been designed to manage this symptom. Our review has identified factors, which may increase or mitigate against fatigue, along with potential management strategies, which should be used to inform future research and practice.","Bench, S.; Stayt, L.; Shah, A.; Dhinan, P.; Czuber-Dochan, W.",,690,7

We combine this approach with a streamlined screening strategy to identify numerous anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, and use neutralization assays and Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) epitope mapping to characterize their potency and specificity. Epitope mapping revealed that the binding site is a key determinant of neutralization potency, rather than affinity alone. The most potent nanobodies bind to the receptor binding motif of the RBD, directly preventing interaction with the host cell receptor ACE2, and we identify two exceptionally potent members of this category (with monomeric IC50s around 13 and 16 ng/ml). Other nanobodies bind to a more conserved epitope on the side of the RBD, and are able to potently neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 founder virus (42 ng/ml), the beta variant (B.1.351/501Y.V2) (35 ng/ml), and also cross-neutralize the more distantly related SARS-CoV-1 (0.46 μg/ml).

To target GPC2 on these pediatric brain tumors with adoptive cellular therapies and mitigate potential inflammatory neurotoxicity, we developed four mRNA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell constructs using the highly GPC2-specific fully human D3 single chain variable fragment. First, we validated and prioritized these CARs using in vitro cytotoxicity and T cell degranulation assays with GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma cells. Next, we expanded the testing of the two most potent GPC2-directed CAR constructs prioritized from these studies to GPC2-expressing medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma cell lines, showing significant GPC2-specific cell death in multiple models. Finally, locoregional delivery bi-weekly of two to four million GPC2-directed mRNA CAR T cells induced significant and sustained tumor regression in two orthotopic medulloblastoma models, and significantly prolonged survival in an aggressive orthotopic thalamic diffuse midline glioma model.

Heterogeneous social contact patterns associated with the social structures of schools (i.e. classes/grades) are likely to influence the within-school transmission dynamics, but data-driven evidence on fine-scale transmission patterns between students has been limited. Using a mathematical model, we analysed a large-scale dataset of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Matsumoto city, Japan to infer social interactions within and between classes/grades from observed transmission patterns. While the relative contribution of within-class and within-grade transmissions to the reproduction number varied with the number of classes per grade, tThe overall within-school reproduction number, which determines the initial growth of cases and the risk of sustained transmission, was only minimally associated with class sizes and the number of classes per grade. This finding suggests that interventions that change the size and number of classes, e.g. splitting classes and staggered attendance, may have limited effect on the control of school outbreaks. We also found that vaccination and mask-wearing of students were associated with reduced susceptibility (vaccination and mask-wearing) and infectiousness (mask-wearing) and hand washing with increased susceptibility.

Most pharmacological agents available to treat these disorders target monoamine systems. Currently, finding the most effective treatment for an individual is a process of trial and error. Therefore, to better understand how disease etiology may predict treatment response, we studied mice exposed developmentally to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (FLX). These mice show the murine equivalent of anxiety- and depression-like symptoms in adulthood and here we report that these mice are also behaviorally resistant to the antidepressant-like effects of adult SSRI administration. We investigated whether tianeptine (TIA), which exerts its therapeutic effects through the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) instead of directly targeting monoaminergic systems, would be more effective in this model. We injected C57BL/6J (C57) pups with either FLX (10 mg/kg, i.p) or vehicle from postnatal (PN) day 2 to 11, a period in which mouse brain development parallels that of the third trimester of a human pregnancy. Prior work established that adult 129SvEv (129) mice exposed to FLX in this time period (PN-FLX) showed increased avoidant and decreased hedonic behaviors, which correspond to anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms in humans, respectively. We performed baseline testing in adulthood in C57 PN-FLX animals and confirmed a similar avoidant phenotype to that reported in 129 PN-FLX mice. We then treated these animals with chronic FLX (18 mg/kg in the drinking water) and evaluated effects on two tasks that measure avoidant behavior – the open field and novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) tasks. This administration failed to improve, and even exacerbated, avoidance symptoms in PN-FLX mice. The same animals then underwent chronic administration with TIA (30 mg/kg, 2x/day, i.p.) as an alternative treatment strategy. TIA administration decreased avoidance behavior as measured in the open field and NSF. Overall, this demonstrates that TIA may be a promising alternative treatment to typical antidepressants, especially in patients whose serotonergic system has been altered.","Pekarskaya, Elizabeth A; Holt, Emma S; Gingrich, Jay A; Ansorge, Mark S; Javitch, Jonathan A; Canetta, Sarah E",bioRxiv,690,25

This study investigates how the pandemic has impacted the poultry production and distribution network (PDN), analyses stakeholders' changing circumstances, and provides recommendations for rapid and long-term resilience. This is based on a literature review, social media monitoring, and key informant interviews (n = 36) from across the poultry sector in Bangladesh. These included key informants from breeder farms and hatcheries, pharmaceutical suppliers, feed companies, dealers, farmers, middlemen, and vendors. We show that the poultry sector was damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, partly as a result of the lockdown and also by rumors that poultry and their products could transmit the disease. This research shows that hardly any stakeholder escaped hardship. Disrupted production and transportation, declining consumer demand and volatile markets brought huge financial difficulties, even leading to the permanent closure of many farms. We show that the extent of the damage experienced during the first months of COVID-19 was a consequence of how interconnected stakeholders and businesses are across the poultry sector. For example, a shift in consumer demand in live bird markets has ripple effects that impact the price of goods and puts pressure on traders, middlemen, farmers, and input suppliers alike. We show how this interconnectedness across all levels of the poultry industry in Bangladesh makes it fragile and that this fragility is not a consequence of COVID-19 but has been revealed by it.

The level and depth of these changes vary and depend on the power of external influence and system reservation mechanisms. The art of managing system processes consists of two main aspects. The first aspect involves the sagacity of managers and predicting general environmental change trends (and their impacts on the managed system). The second involves adjusting to these trends, maximizing possible benefits, and minimizing the negative manifestations of this process. Innovation plays an important role, contributing to system transformations with maximal effect and minimal loss. Public transport systems are important elements in cities, as they provide spatial mobility for at least half of the citizens of a city who cannot use individual transportation. Modern urbanization and peculiarities of the social–economic statuses of many citizens contribute to the fact that organized public transportation is unprofitable. The low solvency of citizens who use public transportation services means that passenger transport systems do not work with enough profitability. As a result, governing institutions often choose to subsidize unprofitable transporter activities, thereby prolonging the functioning of unprofitable routes. This is possible only in conditions of sustainability (in regards to a non-optimal system), when the environment is calm, and its negative impact is low. “Black swans” (according to N. Taleb) are bifurcation factors that break the sustainability of non-optimal system. Urban public transport (UPT) of a large Russian city, Tyumen, experienced it in 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 lockdown. The sharp decrease in population mobility in Tyumen, in 2020–2021, caused the need for a complete transformation of the transport service system. However, managers did not want to fundamentally change a system that consensually suited most counterparties. The search for new balances in a system that demands transformation is one way for sustainable provision. This article looks at the transformation and sustainability of a UPT system in the large Russian city of Tyumen, under conditions affected by the negative impact of COVID-19. Results of a comparative (i.e., pre-crisis (2019) and crisis (2020)) Pareto analysis of the contributions of different UPT routes are presented. Transformation of the structure of the UPT route system can overcome the “crisis” COVID-19 period and minimize its financial-economic costs.","Petrov, Artur I.; Petrova, Daria A.","Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",690,5

However, only a small fraction is recycled. Conventionally, the used plastics are either disposed in landfills or inadequately incinerated. These practices impart an adverse effect on our environment. Plastics are indispensable part of the medical sector owing to their high versatility. The outbreak of COVID-19 clearly showed the growing demand for single use plastics. Hence, completely avoiding plastics can be challenging at this point of time. Recycling of plastics is undoubtedly a solution to solve the crisis of plastic pollution. Medical plastic recycling is limited mainly due to difficulties involved in sorting or cleaning. Recycling medical plastic wastes is possible only through proper coordination between healthcare sector and recycling industries. New recycling technologies are to be adopted in a sustainable manner. Moreover, the plastics used in medical applications should be designed such that recycling is possible.

Design: Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and PRS construction and validation. Setting: GWAS summary statistics from three European datasets and individual-level data from Estonian Biobank, including phenotype questionnaire and measurement panel, together with follow-up data from linkage with national health-related registries. Participants: A total of 28,086 women with POP and 546,321 controls of European ancestry. Genetic risk scores were derived from a dataset of 20,118 cases and 427,426 controls of European ancestry and validated in a target dataset of 7,896 cases and 118,895 controls. Cases were defined using ICD codes and classical risk factors were derived from questionnaire data and ICD10 codes. Results: The identified novel loci reinforce the role of connective tissue abnormalities, urogenital tract development and point towards association with a range of cardiometabolic traits. A novel PRS combining 3,242,959 variants demonstrated that women in the top 5 % have 1.63 (95% CI: 1.37 to 1.93) times the hazard of developing POP compared to the rest of the women. When analyzing PRS in incident disease, it showed similar predictive ability (Harrell C-statistic 0.583, sd=0.007) than five established clinical risk factors (number of children, body mass index (BMI), ever smoked, constipation and asthma) combined (Harrell C-statistic 0.588, sd=0.007) and demonstrated its incremental value in combination with these (Harrell C-statistic 0.630, sd=0.007). Conclusions: The largest GWAS meta-analysis in POP to date identified 26 genetic loci which establish links between POP and connective tissue abnormalities, urogenital development and cardiometabolic health. We present a PRS for POP which provides the first potential tool for preventive strategies and early detection of higher risk susceptibility to POP including genetic risk factors.","Pujol-Gualdo, N.; LaÌll, K.; Lepamets, M.; Estonian Biobank Research Team,; Rossi, H.-R.; Arffman, R.

This obligation to provide palliative care has grown significantly due to the immense suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to patients and their carers. The successful delivery of palliative care, however, requires a healthcare workforce that is trained to provide palliative care at all levels. It is especially important to be able to train healthcare workers in basic-level palliative care to expand the health system’s capacity to provide palliative care. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this training programme on the participants’ interest and knowledge in palliative care, and their preparedness to deliver basic-level palliative care. Methods: We developed a novel training programme for basic palliative care using didactic and participatory learning methods, along with a mentoring system. The programme was delivered over 6 months. 38 physicians were trained. A survey to evaluate the participants’ interest and knowledge of palliative care, as well as their preparedness to provide palliative care was conducted at 3 timepoints–pre-training, post-training, and 3 months post-training. Results: Improvements in the interest (4.05 vs 4.24, p<0.05) and knowledge of palliative care (83.05 vs 93.10, p<0.001), and the preparedness to provide various aspects of palliative care were observed post-training.

With the continuing transmission of the virus worldwide and the rapidly evolving situation globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March. Currently, there is no proven specific treatment for this potentially deadly disease beyond supportive care. However, a massive effort has been put globally into the investigation of medications and other interventional measures to fight COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy from recovered patients has recently drawn considerable interest. Several alternative medical treatments, although evidence of their efficacy still lacking, have also gained popularity, especially in countries with such traditions such as India and China. Rapid repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 has revealed a few promising candidate antiviral agents, but further research, especially high quality randomized controlled trials, will be needed to prove their efficacy and safety in the clinical use to treat COVID-19. Vaccine development has been the imperative task in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. While clinical trials have been launched for several candidate vaccines, research on COVID-19 vaccines is still at an early stage.

Until now little is known about the incidence and the course of the disease in a routine setting of rheumatology outpatient care. Objectives: Aim of the study was to identify cases with COVID-19, to analyse course and outcome of the disease and the potential role of antirheumatic medication. Methods: On the occasion of a routine follow-up examination all consecutive patients of our rheumatology outpatient center were questioned about the history of established COVID-19, about typical symptoms or about contacts with patients in the period from March to the end of December 2020. Diagnostic work-up (results of PCR or antibody testing, imaging) was documented. Antibody ELISA-tests (IgG, IgA, IgM, Euroimmun) were performed in patients reporting typical signs and symptoms. Course and outcome of COVID-19 were divided in 5 groups (mild, moderate, severe, most severe, and lethal). Results: About 2.000 patients were screened. Positive findings for SARSCoV-2 confirmed by PCR or serological testing were detected in n=33/2000 (1.65%) patients (n=14/33 (43%) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), n=8/33 (24%) psoriatic arthritis (PsA), n=7/33 (21%) spondyloarthritis (SpA), n=4/33 (12%) other diseases). No patient died and no patient required intensive care or invasive mechanical ventilation. N=2/33 patients (6%) suffered a severe course with hospitalization, one of these required intermittent oxygen administration. Both patients had no ongoing therapy with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). One patient suffered from SpA, one patient from RA. Both patients had relevant comorbidities with chronic lung disease and breast cancer. Symptoms were absent or mild in n=21/33 (64%) patients, moderate in n=10/33 (30%). N=22/31 (71%) of patients with absent, mild or moderate symptoms were treated at least with one DMARD. Conclusion: For an at-risk population, the incidence of COVID-19 was unexpectedly low. Overall, patients had a mild course despite immunosuppressive therapy. This finding is consistent with published data from a single university center (1) and other university outpatient clinics (2). Possibly DMARD-therapy may protect against the occurrence of cytokine storm and vasculitic complications, which lead to severe courses and lethal outcomes in some of the patients. The data support the recommendation not to discontinue DMARDs for fear of COVID-19.","Werner, S. G.; Höhenrieder, P.; Chatelain, R.; Langer, H. E.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,690,26

As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","Sang, Eric R.; Tian, Yun; Gong, Yuanying; Miller, Laura C.; Sang, Yongming",bioRxiv,690,1

Its need has been further emphasized due to the current COVID 19 crisis. Organizations find it challenging to prepare the internal logistics and supply chain, and quickly respond to such unexpected events, due to low visibility. Against this backdrop, the paper, which is a work-in-progress, systematically documents different factors influencing supply chain visibility and crucial information that should be collected and shared among supply chain partners for better visibility. A Delphi analysis is being conducted with twenty-six supply chain experts from various globally recognized enterprises with manufacturing units located worldwide. The study starts with a short open-ended questioner to collect a comprehensive list of antecedents, drivers, barriers, effects, and visibility information based on the qualitative response from the experts. The preliminary results from the first round of the Delphi analysis indicate that risk management, environmental sustainability, and supply chain control are some of the key drivers. Lack of IT infrastructure and maturity are some of the barriers, integrated systems, and technology maturity are among the key antecedents and gaining planning capability and better customer service are some of the positive effects of supply chain visibility as per the experts’ opinion. In addition, information related to planning, supplier location, and deviation are among the crucial ones that require the collection and sharing for better supply chain visibility.

In this paper, we leverage inputs from IMF desk economists to construct a novel narrative index of containment measures for 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A key innovation in our index is that it distinguishes between economic sectors (services, industry, retail), thus providing a more granular view of restrictions related to economic activity. Using this index, along with other high-frequency data, we find that containment measures have been successful in reducing the spread of the virus (though with some heterogeneity) but have also been associated with large short-term economic costs. Furthermore, exploiting the granularity of our index, we find that differences in strategies across countries regarding the closing of the industrial sector have mattered: imposing less severe restrictions on industry has been associated with lower economic costs without leading to worse health outcomes, possibly reflecting the less contact intensive nature of industrial activity.","Furceri, Davide Kothari Siddharth Zhang Longmei",Pacific Economic Review,690,25

Herein, we found an enrichment of CD14highCD16- monocytes displaying inflammasome activation evidenced by caspase-1/ASC-speck formation in severe COVID-19 patients when compared to mild ones and healthy controls, respectively. Those cells also showed aberrant levels of mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) and lipid peroxidation, both hallmarks of the oxidative stress response, which strongly correlated with caspase-1 activity. In addition, we found that NLRP3 inflammasome-derived IL-1{beta} secretion by SARS-CoV-2-exposed monocytes in vitro was partially dependent on lipid peroxidation.

Quantitative descriptions of such states are inherently elusive. The measures adopted by governments to contain COVID-19 have provided empirical data, which may serve as a proxy for such states of minimum service. Here, we systematize the impact of the adopted COVID-19 measures on the electricity demand. We classify the measures into three phases of increasing stringency, ranging from working from home to soft and full lockdowns, for four major electricity consuming countries of Europe. We use readily accessible data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity as a basis. For each country and phase, we derive representative daily load profiles with hourly resolution obtained by k-medoids clustering. The analysis could unravel the influence of the different measures to the energy consumption and the differences among the four countries. It is observed that the daily peak load is considerably flattened and the total electricity consumption decreases by up to 30% under the circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 restrictions. These demand profiles are useful for the energy planning community, especially when designing future electricity systems with a focus on system resilience and a more digitalised society in terms of working from home.","Manjunath, Smruti Yeligeti Madhura Fyta Maria Haas Jannik Gils Hans-Christian",Data,690,13

However, less research has specifically addressed the elderly. This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics and evaluate the relationship between comorbidities, and the rates of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 in the elderly. Methods & Materials This retrospective study was conducted in elderly patients with COVID-19 admitted to Baharloo Hospital. Demographic information, types of underlying diseases, and need for hospitalization in the ICU or death in hospital among the hospitalized patients from March 2020 to July 2020 was extracted from the COVID-19 hospital database. The logistic regression model was used to estimate the Odds Ratio (OR), as a separate measure of the association between the research variables' outcomes (death & hospitalization outcomes in the ICU). Results A total of 522 elderly patients were included in the study. Approximately 77% (n=422) of the elderly survived and 23% (n=100) died. The study participants' mean +/- SD age was 72.55 +/- 8.44 years. besides, and about 54%(n=281) were males. Logistic regression model results suggested that the odds of death in the study participants with >= 2 underlying diseases equaled 1.69 (OR=1.69, 95%CI: 0.97-2.91, P=0.04). Moreover, the odds of ICU hospitalization in them was 2.26 (OR=2.26, 95%CI: 1.34-3.81, P=0.002) time higher than their counterparts who did not have underlying diseases, i.e., statistically significant. Conclusion Our results are expected to impact preventive interventions and take a more targeted approach to prioritize older patients with risk factors, rather than adopting calendar age policies as a general indicator for risk assessment.","Akhavizadegan, H.; Aghaziarati, M.; Balalemi, M.

In the absence of specific drugs or safe and effective vaccines for these infections, their control relies mainly on vector control measures. The emergence of insecticide resistance in vectors, especially against pyrethroids, is a serious threat to the insecticide-based vector control programme. This study reports the presence of multiple knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations present in an Ae. aegypti population from Bengaluru (India), including a new mutation F1534L. Methods Aedes aegypti collected from Bengaluru were subjected to insecticide susceptibility tests with DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. The DNA sequencing of partial domain II, III and IV of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) was performed to screen kdr mutations present in the population and PCR-based assays were developed for their detection. Genotyping of kdr mutations was done using PCR-based assays, allelic frequencies were determined, and tests of genetic association of kdr mutations with the insecticide resistance phenotype were performed. Results The Ae. aegypti population were resistant to DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. The DNA sequencing of the VGSC revealed the presence of four kdr mutations, i.e., S989P and V1016G in domain II and two alternative kdr mutations F1534C and F1534L in domain III. Allele-specific PCR assays (ASPCR) were developed for the detection of kdr mutations S989P and V1016G and an existing PCR-RFLP based strategy was modified for the genotyping of all three known kdr mutations in domain III (F1534L, F1534C and T1520I). Genotyping of Ae. aegypti samples collected between October 2014 and April 2015 revealed a moderate frequency of S989P/V1016G (18.27%) and F1534L (17.48%), a relatively high frequency of F1534C (50.61%) and absence of T1520I in the population. Mutations S989P and V1016G were in complete linkage disequilibrium in this population while they were in linkage equilibrium with kdr mutations F1534C and F1534L. The alleles F1534C and F1534L are genetically associated with permethrin resistance. Conclusions A new kdr mutation, F1534L, was found in an Ae. aegypti population from Bengaluru (India), co-occurring with the other three mutations S989P, V1016G and F1534C. The findings of a new mutation and development of PCR-based diagnostics have implications for insecticide resistance management. Monitoring of F1534L-kdr in other populations and studies on their functional role in altering neuro-sensitivity is warranted.","Kushwah, Raja Babu S.; Kaur, Taranjeet; Dykes, Cherry L.; Kumar, Ravi H.; Kapoor, Neera; Singh, Om P.",bioRxiv,690,1

Existing air decontamination technologies suffer from demerits such as toxicity of exposure, species specificity, noxious gas emission, environment-dependent performance and high power consumption. Here, we present a novel technology called “ZeBox” that transcends the conventional limitations and achieves high microbicidal efficiency. In ZeBox, a non-ionizing electric field extracts naturally charged microbes from flowing air and deposits them on engineered microbicidal surfaces. The surface’s three dimensional topography traps the microbes long enough for them to be inactivated. The electric field and chemical surfaces synergistically achieve rapid inactivation of a broad spectrum of microbes. ZeBox achieved near complete kill of airborne microbes in challenge tests (5-9 log reduction) and >90% efficiency in a fully functional stem cell research facility in the presence of humans. Thus, ZeBox fulfills the dire need for a real-time, continuous, safe, trap-and-kill air decontamination technology.","Phadke, Kruttika S.; Madival, Deepak G.; Venkataraman, Janani; Kundu, Debosmita; Ramanujan, K.

However, the impacts of the pandemic on POCUS training during this time have not been well studied. AIM: This was a retrospective observational study of the 1st year of emergency medicine (EM) residents at the Department of EM who had received POCUS training at a tertiary university hospital in Thailand. METHODS: The study was conducted throughout the 2019–2020 Academic year. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the new POCUS training methodology, which, due to health and safety protocols, was carried out through virtual learning. RESULTS: A total of 18 1st-year EM residents were evaluated. The average pre-training scores in the 2019–2020 academic years were 5.25 and 5, respectively. The average post-training scores in the 2019 and 2020 academic years were 8.5 and 8.67, respectively. In terms of the ultrasound (US) skills test, the total average scores in the 2019–2020 academic year were 17 out of 20 (85%) and 14.875 out of 20 (74.38%), respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual learning is effective for teaching theoretical US knowledge. However, it was not suitable for teaching practical skills, including US skills.","Ienghong, K.; Suzuki, T.; Tiamkao, S.; Bhudhisawasdi, V.; Gaysonsiri, D.; Apiratwarakul, K.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,690,8

In this manner, fermented dairy products represent a significant subcategory of functional foods with established positive health benefits. Likewise, kefir—a fermented milk product manufactured from kefir grains—has been reported by many studies to be a probiotic drink with great potential in health promotion. Existing research data link regular kefir consumption with a wide range of health-promoting attributes, and more recent findings support the link between kefir’s probiotic strains and its bio-functional metabolites in the enhancement of the immune system, providing significant antiviral effects. Although it has been consumed for thousands of years, kefir has recently gained popularity in relation to novel biotechnological applications, with different fermentation substrates being tested as non-dairy functional beverages. The present review focuses on the microbiological composition of kefir and highlights novel applications associated with its fermentation capacity.

Several control strategies have been proposed; however, the global efficacy of local measures implemented at the ward level may depend on hospital-level organizational factors. We aimed at better understanding the role of between-ward interactions on nosocomial outbreaks and their control in a multi-ward psychiatric hospital in Western France. We built a stochastic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in the 24-wards hospital, accounting for the various infection states among patients and staff, and between-ward connections resulting from staff sharing. We first evaluated the potential of hospital-wide diffusion of local outbreaks, depending on the ward they started in. We then assessed control strategies, including a screening area upon patient admission, an isolation ward for COVID-19 positive patients and changes in staff schedules to limit between-ward mixing. Much larger and more frequent outbreaks occurred when the index case originated in one of the most connected wards with up to four times more transmissions when compared to the more isolated ones. The number of wards where infection spreads was brought down by up to 53 % after reducing staff sharing. Finally, we found that setting up an isolation ward reduced the number of transmissions by up to 70 %, while adding a screening area before admission seemed ineffective.","Oodally, A.; Hammami, P.; Reilhac, A.; Guerineau de Lamerie, G.; Opatowski, L.; Temime, L.",,690,24

Although, it’s quit is challen-ging, but with the advancement of communication technologies propagations and the increasing engagement of the youth on social media towards social drives made this achievable. There exists a need to examine the influencing factors that peoples express when such drives are promoted on any social media forum in order to evaluate their sentiments. The objective of this research is to explore the influencing factors of pandemic Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) when it has been promoted as a social drive on social media forums. In this research effort, sentiment analysis along with novel similarity measures such as THINKMAP, VADER++ and lexicons have been utilized to analyze the influencing factors of those peoples who are affected by COVID-19 when social media forums promote it as a common social drive. The significance of this research is that it would help to demonstrate that participation of youth of different countries could boost up the promotion of social drives and fasten the process which leads towards the positive awareness about any common social drive. Moreover, it would cover the gap of common issues on social media that are not in practice in past studies. It also strengthens the awareness phenomena in youth beyond boundaries.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical data of 217 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and 86 sex-matched and age-matched healthy controls without this infection. The patient group was divided into the following two subgroups: the severe (n=93) group and the non-severe (n=124) group. We compared the demographic characteristics, admission complaints, and admission blood parameters of the patient group with those of the control group. We also compared the above-mentioned parameters of the two patient subgroups. Results: The patient group had a significantly lower white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and platelet count (p=0.002, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively) and a significantly higher C-reactive protein level (p<0.001) than the control group did. The leucocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and ferritin level were significantly higher in the severe disease subgroup than those in the nonsevere subgroup (p<0.001). The lymphocyte count and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) were significantly lower in the severe disease subgroup than those in the non-severe subgroup (p<0.001). We performed a logistic regression analysis and obtained the odds ratios (OR) of several factors. This analysis showed that NLR was positively correlated with the COVID-19 risk (adjusted OR 1.438, p=0.012). However, the association of PLR and LMR with COVID-19 risk remained unclear. Conclusion: The ability to predict prognosis using blood parameters that are routinely assessed at admission can save considerable time and financial resources. We believe that we can predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using the admission NLR levels.

TSCs and STs, but not EVTs, were highly permissive to productive infection with ZIKV strain DAK AR 41524. The impact of ZIKV on the cellular transcriptome showed that infection of TSCs and STs increased expression of immune related genes, including those involved in type I and type III interferon responses. ZIKV exposure altered extracellular vesicle (EV) protein, mRNA, and miRNA cargo, regardless of productive infection. These findings suggest that early gestation macaque TSCs and STs are permissive to ZIKV infection, and that EV analysis may provide a foundation for identifying non-invasive biomarkers of placental infection in a highly translational model.","Block, Lindsey N.; Schmidt, Jenna Kropp; McKeon, Megan C.; Bowman, Brittany D.; Wiepz, Gregory J.; Golos, Thaddeus G.",bioRxiv,690,1

In this study, we aimed to compare the laboratory findings of the patients with negative and positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests results due to COVID-19-like findings in chest computed tomography (CT). Material and Methods: The study included 49 patients admitted to the emergency department with the suspicion of COVID-19 due to the positive findings on chest CT. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from each patient. Whole blood count and biochemical parameters were examined, and as a result of swab investigations, the laboratory values of positive and negative results were compared in order to diagnose COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 49 patients were included in the study. The swab specimensobtained from the nasopharynx were evaluated using the reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test. While the RT-PCR positivity was observed in 13 patients (Group 1), the RT-PCR negativity was found in 36 (Group 2). The mean age of all participants was 55.7±17.3 years;in Group 1, however in Group 1, the values of leukocyte, lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin were observed to be higher and lymphocyte count was significantly lower, compared with thosein Group 2. Dicussion: Previous studies have shown that the diagnosis of new COVIDV-19 disease and its clinical features should be based on a comprehensive understanding of radiographic features and laboratory investigations. Patients with clinical suspicion and those with exposure, fever and a history of positive findings on chest CT should be rapidly diagnosed with molecular technology. The RT-PCR test was developed as a widely used method to detect viral RNA. Although the RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard diagnostic method, this method has some limitations. Clinical findings, history, physical examination and radiological findings were compatible with COVID 19 in our study, the RT-PCR test results were negative in some patients. The new COVID-19 disease is a very contagious condition leading to devastating consequences. Therefore, the clinical, radiological and laboratory findings should be taken into account as a holistic approach in the diagnosing process of new COVID-19 disease.","Ucar, K.; Ucar, Y.; Ozden, H.

Methods This study proposed a deterministic SEIRV model with contact tracing and vaccination components. We initialized some parameters using the Malaysian COVID-19 data to inform the model. We defined contact tracing effectiveness as the proportion of contacts of a positive case that was successfully traced and vaccination rate as the proportion of daily doses administered per population in Malaysia. Sensitivity analyses on the untraced and infectious populations were conducted. The study presented in silico findings on multiple scenarios by varying the contact tracing effectiveness and daily vaccination rates. Results At a vaccination rate of 1.4%, a contact tracing with the effectiveness of 70% could delay the peak of untraced asymptomatic cases by 17 days and reduced the highest number of daily cases by 70% compared with 30% contact tracing effectiveness. A similar trend was observed for symptomatic cases when a similar experiment setting was used. We also performed sensitivity analyses by using different combinations of contact tracing effectiveness and vaccination rates. In all scenarios, the effect of contact tracing on COVID-19 incidence persisted for both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. Conclusion While vaccines are progressively rolled out, efficient contact tracing must be rapidly implemented concurrently to reach, find, test, isolate, and support the affected populations to bring the pandemic under control.","Raja, D.

It has been normally observed that personality and job satisfaction has been the main causes which can motivate employees. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of changes, and the main aim of this study is to analyze the determinants of employee engagement during Covid-19 pandemic with the mediating role of Perceived organizational support and Perceived family support. Through a survey instrument, data was collected from 216 employees working at corporate offices in Hanoi, Vietnam. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to test the study hypotheses using Smart-PLS. The study underlined the significant positive effect of Perceived Organizational support and Perceived Family Support on Employee Engagement. Moreover, Employee engagement also measures the indirect effects from factors such as colleague support, supervisor support, organizational support, spousal support and family members supports on Employee Engagement.

We report that including bi-weekly loaded plyometric and short sprints training in standard training during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic improved the physical fitness of young soccer players. Particularly, the ability to repeatedly change direction benefited most from the intervention. We investigated adding 8 weeks of bi-weekly loaded plyometric and short sprints (LPaSS) training into training for under 19 (U19) soccer players. An experimental group (EG, n = 18, age: 17.5 +/- 0.58 years, body mass: 67.4 +/- 4.37 kg, height: 1.76 +/- 0.05 m, body fat: 11.4 +/- 1.55%), and a control group (CG, n = 16, age: 17.5 +/- 0.58 years, body mass: 68.7 +/- 3.65 kg, height: 1.78 +/- 0.03 m, body fat: 11.6 +/- 1.14%) participated. The pre- and postintervention measures were: the squat-jump (SJ);the countermovement-jump with arm swing (CMJA);the five jump test (5JT);10 m and 30 m sprint;the ability to change direction (sprint with 90 degrees turns (S90 degrees) and sprinting 9-3-6-3-9 m, involving running both backwards and forwards (SBF);repeated sprint ability (RSA), and balance (Y-balance test). The EG experienced superior jump (p < 0.001;d(range): 1.69-1.89), sprint (p < 0.001;d(range): 1.82-2.56), S90 degrees (p < 0.001;d(range): 1.64-2.25), RSA (p < 0.001;d(range): 3.90-4.17), and balance (p < 0.001;d(range): 1.11-2.54) improvement. Comparatively, the pre- to postchanges in the CG ranged from d = 0.36 (dynamic balance) to d = 1.00 (10 m sprint).

The prior 2008–09 recession had already decimated many state unemployment programs, and along with major shifts in the workforce (including the gig economy), major policy questions surrounded the structure and funding of this state-national program. Stimulus efforts in early 2020 provided some temporary relief, but offered no permanent structural change on par with this shift in the workforce. As these programs end and no definitive structural changes are in sight, a number of think tanks including the Economic Policy Institute and the Century Foundation are advocating for major changes in unemployment insurance.

Studien baseras på 33 intervjuer med vårdpersonal genomförda under de första veckorna av pandemin. Genom att i analysen knyta narrativt meningsskapande till hur tid används och ordnas i berättelser om arbetsvillkor just nu – under de första veckorna för coronapandemin – ser vi hur dessa berättelser relaterar till tiden för hanteringen av pandemin, såväl som tiden före och efter densamma. Den narrativa analysen visar att olika perspektiv på tid används som stöd för argumentationen i deltagarnas utsagor. Det ena perspektivet knyts till den specifika situationen under den första tiden för coronapandemin och det andra relaterar till arbetssituationen under coronapandemin som en del av ett, i tid, utsträckt sammanhang. Analysen av hur tid används och ordnas i berättelserna skapar en öppning för att förstå coronapandemin som en händelse som uppmärksammar någonting mer än arbetssituationen just nu, nämligen en kritik av arbetsvillkor inom vården över tid och på en övergripande, generell, nivå.Alternate abstract:In the present study, we focus on stories about working conditions in the Swedish health care sector during the initial phase of the corona pandemic in the spring of 2020 .

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Caribbean countries attempted large-scale e-learning for the first time. This study investigates how an emergent system of e-learning that started during crisis conditions affects the linguistic access of deaf students in Trinidad and Tobago. The framework for investigation encompasses the learning management system, course materials and language and communication involved in e-learning. A phenomenological method of inquiry is employed to understand the processes of receiving and providing online deaf education in terms of those who experience it. Data are triangulated from deaf primary and secondary school students, their teachers, interpreters and parents. Deaf learners encountered unique modality-specific barriers since e-learning in the country was not prepared to convey the full range of communication available in sign language. Challenges also stemmed from institutional support issues, existing social inequalities and the unique sociolinguistic history of the local deaf community. These conditions have implications for deaf students' language learning and academic success. These are important considerations of e-learning or blended learning practices for deaf learners that deserve further empirical scrutiny.","Mohammed, N. U.

The study also analyzes the moderating effect of employee involvement on the link between transformational leadership and role ambiguity. Online survey data were collected from employees at three public universities in the Philippines (n = 522). The data were analyzed using Partial Least-Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The results confirm the effect of transformational leadership on lowering role ambiguity and promoting the work–life balance of Filipino employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the moderating effect analysis shows that employee involvement appears to increase role ambiguity and weaken the effect of transformational leadership on role ambiguity. The results imply that, for employees characterized by high-power distance culture like the Filipinos, the practice of employee involvement in conjunction with transformational leadership appears to weaken the effectiveness of the leaders in lessening role ambiguity of the Filipino employees. The study also implies that leaders who possess transformational leadership characteristics may need to be aware of some management practices that are not in alignment with the cultural characteristics of their employees.

Many faculty staff members were not adequately equipped with knowledge and skills of facilitating remote teaching. This made the establishment of social, cognitive and teacher presences difficult for them. The purpose of this study is to examine ways in which certified online instructors established social, cognitive and teacher presences during emergency remote teaching at a university in the United Arab Emirates. The study is guided by one critical question: How did certified online instructors establish social, cognitive and teacher presences in their online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic? The study adopted a qualitative case study within an interpretivist paradigm. Two certified online instructors were purposely selected to reflect on their experiences in establishing social, cognitive and teaching presences in their remote classes. It was found that students’ engagement, critical thinking and self-directed learning and continual engagement play an indispensable role in students’ remote learning.

Based on available data from the selected city of Rzeszow, Poland, it was decided to assess changes in vehicle traffic and the impact of these changes on roadside environmental pollution. As part of the research, data from the first half of 2020 regarding vehicle traffic on selected streets of the city and on the city’s inlet routes were analyzed. For the selected road sections, changes in hourly traffic volume in 2020, compared with 2019, were also determined. With data on traffic volume, an attempt was made to estimate the impact of changes in traffic volume on air pollution in the city. Research on air pollution from motor vehicles was focused on a selected section of a city road that was equipped with an automatic air pollution measurement station located very close to the road. Additionally, at the road intersection and in the vicinity of the measuring station, a sensor was installed in the roadway to count passing vehicles. A preliminary analysis of air pollution data revealed that factors such as wind speed and direction and outside temperature had a large impact on measurement results. To eliminate the influence of these factors and to obtain data concerning only contamination originating from motor vehicles traveling along the road, an appropriate mathematical model of the traffic flow–roadside environment system was built. This model was designed to determine the air pollution in the vicinity of the road generated by traffic flow. The constructed model was verified, and the conditions for its use were determined in order to study the impact of traffic and roadside environment on the level of air pollution from harmful exhaust substances. It was shown that at certain times of the day, especially at low temperatures, other sources of harmful emissions related to home heating play a major role in air pollution in the city.","Smieszek, Miroslaw Mateichyk Vasyl Dobrzanska Magdalena Dobrzanski Pawel Weigang Ganna",Energies,690,33

Here, we describe the results of five years of citizen science and standardised field surveys of wild bees conducted at the Friche Josaphat, a 24-ha urban wasteland in the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium). These field surveys were initiated following the planned restructuring and partial destruction of this site by the regional authorities. We recorded a total of 2,507 specimens belonging to 127 species of wild bees, i.e. 60.5% of the 210 species recorded regionally, including nine that are threatened with extinction at national or European scales. The Friche Josaphat encompasses a significant share of the functional and phylogenetic diversity of wild bees known from the Brussels-Capital Region and is one of the most species-rich localities known to date for wild bees in Belgium. Collectively, our results highlight the strong complementarity of citizen science and academic approaches in biodiversity surveys, and they reaffirm that wastelands are essential components of urban biodiversity.

The genome of COVID19 codes for the main protease 6LU7, is essential for viral replication and multiplication. To get a possible antiviral drug(s), nowadays is the major concern. In our study we screened ten fungal metabolites such as Aspirochlorine, Aflatoxin B1, Alpha-Cyclopiazonic acid, Sporogen, Asperfuran, Aspergillomarasmine A, Maltoryzine, Kojic acid, Aflatrem and Ethyl 3-nitropropionic acid against main protease 6LU7. These molecules were of fungal origin from Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus oryzae. Aspergillomarasmine A exhibited the docking score of - 6.02 Kcal/mol, almost nearer to presently used drug Chloroquine (-6.29 Kcal/mol). Second highest docking score was found for Asperfuran (-5.5 Kcal/mol), whereas Aflatoxin B1 provided docking score was -5.0 Kcal/mol. We found similar docking score -5.4 Kcal/mol for Asperfuran, Maltoryzine and Kojic acid. Aspirochlorine and Ethyl 3-nitropropionic acid exhibited docking score were -5.3 Kcal/mol and -5.1 Kcal/mol respectively. These natural bioactive compounds could be tested in near future for their ability to inhibit viral growth both in invitro as well as invivo study.","Sarkar, D.",International Journal of Pharma and Bio Sciences,690,1

This analysis is conducted in order to identify the spillover effect of volatility and correlation among these financial markets, and to provide a scientific basis that shows the interest of incorporating sustainable assets in the design of minimum risk strategies of investment. To achieve this goal, we have used a Vector Autoregressive-Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (VAR-DCC-GARCH) model that also incorporates a stock index of industrial companies as a leading indicator of the level of economic activity. In addition, the paper conducts an impulse response analysis to determine how unexpected shocks to prices are propagated along time, and, in particular, how they affect prices of the others, both in mean, variance and correlation. Therefore, the results of this one- and two-dimensional analysis allow for the study of short and long run dynamics of the relationship among those prices, thus, providing greater meaning and information for investors, which has implications for building their portfolios. The analyzed period was from January 2010 to February 2021, so that the data include half of phase II, full phase III and the onset of phase IV of the EU ETS, as well as the COVID-19 outbreak in the European context. We also analyzed whether the EUA price impulses the demand of clean energy stocks, which has important implications for the objective of triggering the investment in clean energy. Our results show the transmission mechanism of all of those prices, which are relevant not only for investors but also for policymakers to construct an early-warning system, revealing the most important transmission channels. Moreover, from an investment viewpoint, we observe a decline in dirty energies and a rise in the clean energy market, which might be an indication of the progress towards the energy transition to renewables sources within a circular economy perspective. Therefore, this shows that the EU ETS is achieving its goals, and that clean energy companies, aligned with their role towards socially responsible initiatives, are also gaining acceptance in terms of investments, which would be beneficial for the environment.","Gargallo, Pilar Lample Luis Miguel Jesús A.; Salvador, Manuel",Mathematics,690,1

Conventional manufacturing methods are highly unsustainable regarding carbon emissions, energy consumption, material wastage, costly shipment and complex supply management. Besides, during global COVID-19 pandemic, advanced fabrication and management strategies were extremely required to fulfill the shortfall of basic and medical emergency supplies. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) reduces global energy consumption and CO2 emissions related to industrial manufacturing. Various renewable energy harvesting mechanisms utilizing solar, wind, tidal and human potential have been fabricated through additive manufacturing. 3D printing aided the manufacturing companies in combating the deficiencies of medical healthcare devices for patients and professionals globally. In this regard, 3D printed medical face shields, respiratory masks, personal protective equipment, PLA-based recyclable air filtration masks, additively manufactured ideal tissue models and new information technology (IT) based rapid manufacturing are some significant contributions of 3DP. Furthermore, a bibliometric study of 3D printing research was conducted in CiteSpace. The most influential keywords and latest research frontiers were found and the 3DP knowledge was categorized into 10 diverse research themes. The potential challenges incurred by AM industry during the pandemic were categorized in terms of design, safety, manufacturing, certification and legal issues.

At the same time, there are a large number of problems in determining the underlying cause of death (UCD) in multimorbid pathology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic when filling out a medical certificate of death (MCC). Objective. To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on preliminary mortality rates in the constituent regions of the Russian Federation. Material and methods. The data of Rosstat were used available on 02.02.21. Unstandardized all-cause mortality rates were compared with the averages for similar periods for 2017—2019. for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. The difference is defined as a percentage of the previous period. The comparison of mortality rates was carried out for the year, as well as from April to December, since it was from April 2020 that Rosstat began to publish data for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, taking into account the indication in the MSS of the presence of COVID-19 in four groups. Results. The absolute value of excess deaths was 306,862 cases (or +17% in relation to the average value for 2017—2019). The Republic of Dagestan (+29.7%) and the Chechen Republic (+42.3%) significantly differed from other regions in terms of excess mortality. Only in St. Petersburg, the number of deaths with any mention of COVID-19 exceeded the number of excess deaths in April— December 2020.The regional average share of deaths with COVID-19 as UCD for 2020 was 4.1±2.8% (in April—December 5.3±3.5%);any mention of COVID-19 in the MCC — 6.4±3.3%. The proportion of deaths indicating COVID-19 as UCD from the number of excess deaths for the entire 2020 was 33.9±22.4% (for April—December 30.9±19.9%);with any mention in the MSS — 52.3±22.0% (for April—December 47.4±21.9%;minimum 2.6% in the Republic of Bashkortostan, maximum 98.7% in the Republic of Tyva and 97.7% in Moscow). No correlation was found between excess mortality in 2020 and the proportion of deaths from COVID-19 as PPP. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to excess mortality in all regions of the Russian Federation. The causes of excess mortality need to be clarified, there is no evidence of an unambiguous and direct effect of COVID-19 on excess mortality. Clarification of the reasons for regional differences is necessary for the correction of prevention programs and the organization of medical care.

It uses input information that can be gleaned without need for medical procedures. Both statistical data and the knowledge base were garnered from publicly available databases and datasets. The fuzzy logic system implemented here is functional, but it is fairly inaccurate and illustrates that more information, both symptomatic and epidemiological is needed, to predict COVID-19 infections through an expert system.

SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.","Ju, Bin; Zhang, Qi; Ge, Xiangyang; Wang, Ruoke; Yu, Jiazhen; Shan, Sisi; Zhou, Bing; Song, Shuo; Tang, Xian; Yu, Jinfang; Ge, Jiwan; Lan, Jun; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Haiyan; Zhao, Juanjuan; Zhang, Shuye; Wang, Youchun; Shi, Xuanling; Liu, Lei; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Zheng; Zhang, Linqi",bioRxiv,690,6

With newer waves and variants of COVID-19, we conducted a systematic review to assess the determinants and disease spectrum of COVID-19 reinfection. Methods A comprehensive search covering relevant databases was conducted for observational studies reporting Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed infection and reinfection cases. Quality assessment tool developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) for assessment of case series was used. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 for pooled proportions of findings in first infection and reinfection with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Eighty-one studies reporting 577 cases were included from 22 countries. The mean age of patients was 46.2{+/-}18.9 years with males accounting for 45.8% of the study population while 179 (31.0%) cases of comorbidities were reported. The average time duration between first infection and reinfection was 63.6{+/-}48.9 days. During first infection and reinfection, fever was the most common symptom (41.4% and 36.4%,respectively) whilst anti-viral therapy was the most common treatment regimen administered (44.5% and 43.0%, respectively). Overall, comparable odds of symptomatic presentation and management were reported in the two infections. However, a higher Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate was observed in reinfection compared to first infection (10 vs 3). Ten deaths were reported with 565 patients fully recovering. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death (7/10 deaths). Seventy-two studies were determined to be of good quality whilst nine studies were of fair quality. Conclusion As the first global-scale systematic review of its kind, our findings support immunization practices given increased ICU admissions and mortality in reinfections. Our cohort serves as a guide for clinicians and authorities for devising an optimal strategy for controlling the pandemic.","Dhillon, R. A.; Qamar, M. A.; Irfan, O.; Gilani, J.

This phenomenon is found in all taxonomic domains, but is particularly common in viruses, where it may increase the information content of compact genomes or influence the creation of new genes. Here we report a global comparative study of overlapping reading frames (OvRFs) of 12,609 virus reference genomes in the NCBI database. We retrieved metadata associated with all annotated reading frames in each genome record to calculate the number, length, and frameshift of OvRFs. Our results show that while the number of OvRFs increases with genome length, they tend to be shorter in longer genomes. The majority of overlaps involve +2 frameshifts, predominantly found in ds-DNA viruses. However, the longest overlaps involve no shift in reading frame (+0), increasing the selective burden of the same nucleotide positions within codons, instead of exposing additional sites to purifying selection. Next, we develop a new graph-based representation of the distribution of OvRFs among the reading frames of genomes in a given virus family. In the absence of an unambiguous partition of reading frames by homology at this taxonomic level, we used an alignment-free k-mer based approach to cluster protein coding sequences by similarity. We connect these clusters with two types of directed edges to indicate (1) that constituent reading frames are adjacent in one or more genomes, and (2) that the reading frames overlap. These adjacency graphs not only provide a natural visualization scheme, but also a novel statistical framework for analyzing the effects of gene- and genome-level attributes on the frequencies of overlaps.","Muñoz-Baena, Laura; Poon, Art F.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors provide an evaluation of the impact that Lean Six Sigma implementations have had on the ability of Dutch healthcare institutions to respond adequately to healthcare needs during the COVID-19 crisis. Findings: Process improvement in healthcare has had a tendency to cut capacity and flexibility which are needed to deal with excessive demand shocks, such as during a pandemic. The main reason for this failure seems to be an overly strong focus on cost reduction instigated by Lean Six Sigma during stable times. Research limitations/implications: Besides the research method being an inferential procedure, the research focuses on the Netherlands and so the generalizability might be limited. However, using Lean Six Sigma to improve healthcare processes has found broad acceptance, so the implications may well carry over to other countries.

How premature collagen proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) route as specialized cargos for secretion remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we report that TMEM39, an ER-localized transmembrane protein, regulates production and secretory cargo trafficking of procollagen. We identify the C. elegans ortholog TMEM-39 from an unbiased RNAi screen and show that deficiency of tmem-39 leads to striking defects in cuticle collagen production and constitutively high ER stress response. RNAi knockdown of the tmem-39 ortholog in Drosophila causes similar defects in collagen secretion from fat body cells. The cytosolic domain of human TMEM39A binds to Sec23A, a vesicle coat protein that drives collagen secretion and vesicular trafficking. TMEM-39 regulation of collagen secretion is independent of ER stress response and autophagy. We propose that roles of TMEM-39 in collagen secretion and preventing ER stress are likely evolutionarily conserved.","Zhang, Zhe; Luo, Shuo; Barbosa, Guilherme Oliveira; Bai, Meirong; Kornberg, Thomas B.; Ma, Dengke K.",bioRxiv,690,1

The Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (THH) produced trust guidelines for the initial blood investigation of COVID-19 inpatients. However, lack of awareness and education on these guidelines meant adherence could be improved.AimsTo improve adherence to the local trust guidelines, targeting clinicians involved in the initial assessment of patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms where appropriate.MethodsBetween 16th April 2020 and 14th April 2020, investigations performed for positive COVID-19 cases were compared to guidelines. Results were presented locally and a COVID-19 panel was added to the electronic order-request system that allowed prompts for appropriate investigations. A re-audit between 15th May 2020 and 14th June 2020 was conducted to assess adherence post-intervention.Results383 patients were identified in the initial audit cohort, and 20 patients were identified in the re-audit cohort. Adherence to Full Blood Count, Urea and Electrolytes, C-Reactive Protein and Liver Function Tests increased to 100% (from 99.7%, 99.2%, 98.7%, and 96.6% respectively). Coagulation screen adherence increased from 72.8% to 90%. D-dimers were appropriately requested more often, increasing from 19.9% to 50%. Inappropriate troponin requisition decreased from 38.9% to 26.3%.ConclusionsReduced COVID-19 admissions meant that the re-audit cohort was not as large as the initial audit cohort. However, a user-friendly COVID-19 panel of investigations resulted in better-targeted management of patients, and improved adherence to guidelines. This showed the importance of disseminating information effectively. Education is essential during times of uncertainty, especially during a pandemic.","Jegatheeswaran, Lavandan Choi Byung Minocha Amal Alhilani Michel Cohn Martin Zala Ashik Mutengesa Ernest",BMJ Leader,690,16

As the group with the most significant number of online education users, their participation attitude and participation intention directly determine the teaching performance of online education. This research will incorporate playfulness teaching and scenario variables that reflect the universities’ ability to respond to emergencies. Based on the technology acceptance model, this research proposes an integrated research model of online education participation intention to investigate university students’ online education participation intention to reveal the key factors and mechanisms that affect online education participation intention. A structural equation model of participation intention is constructed, and 342 valid samples are obtained by questionnaire survey. The empirical results of PLS-SEM show that: (1) students’ participation attitude positively affects their participation intention;(2) the perceived ease of use and usefulness positively affect their participation attitude, and the perceived usefulness and ease of use affect their participation intention through the complete mediation of participation attitude;(3) the perceived playfulness does not have a significant impact on participation attitude but has a positive impact on participation intention;(4) the innovative discovery university support positively moderates the relationship between participation attitude and intention during such emergencies. The research found that improving students’ attitudes toward participation, perceived ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, and strengthening university support are all helpful to optimize students’ participation intention in online education. At the same time, it also explored operability suggestions for improving the quality of online education and optimizing future education.","Wang, Shaofeng Tlili Ahmed Zhu Lixin Yang Junfeng",Sustainability,690,30

This paper provides unique insight into the disaster planning and management that was undertaken by the City of Cape Town government in response to its most severe hydrological drought on record. It describes how risk was understood and why decisions were made on key elements of the plan, including trigger points, risk prioritisation and mitigation, and the location and design of points of distribution of water rations for the public. Reflecting upon the authors’ experience and interviews with senior City officials who worked on the drought disaster planning and response, the paper extracts five key lessons learnt that have since been applied during the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) the need for cross-functional planning and response skills, (ii) the need for integrated, up-to-date and scale-appropriate data;(iii) the importance of scenario-based simulations, communication and rapid costing to enable the rapid scaling-up of a response;(iv) the value of being able to use outsourced expert capacity effectively;and (v) the application of previously used disaster management and planning experience to build resilience in cities. These lessons, captured in a visual framework, help reflect on capabilities required for responding to future city-scale disasters.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are essential weapons that a patient with COVID-19 has to combat the disease. When now repurposing a drug, namely an aptamer that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteins for COVID-19 treatment (BC 007), which is, however, a neutralizer of pathogenic autoantibodies in its original indication, the possibility of also binding and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies must be considered. Here, the highly specific virus-neutralizing antibodies have to be distinguished from the ones that also show cross-reactivity to tissues. The last-mentioned could be the origin of the widely reported SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmunity, which should also become a target of therapy. We, therefore, used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology to assess the binding of well-characterized publicly accessible anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (CV07-209 and CV07-270) with BC 007. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetric titration, and circular dichroism spectroscopy were additionally used to test the binding of BC 007 to DNA-binding sequence segments of these antibodies. BC 007 did not bind to the highly specific neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody but did bind to the less specific one. This, however, was a lot less compared to an autoantibody of its original indication (14.2%, range 11.0-21.5%). It was also interesting to see that the less-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody also showed a high background signal in the ELISA (binding on NeutrAvidin-coated or activated but noncoated plastic plate). These initial experiments suggest that the risk of binding and neutralizing highly specific anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies by BC 007 should be low.","Haberland, A.; Krylova, O.; Nikolenko, H.; Gottel, P.; Dallmann, A.; Muller, J.; Weisshoff, H.",Viruses,690,1

The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified existing vulnerabilities felt by communities, especially susceptible to environmental degradation through furthering their socioeconomic disadvantage. Faced with challenges related to the national implementation of certain rule of law concepts and practices, and the lack of access to sufficient domestic remedies, regional plaintiffs have often reached out to the Inter-American system as an arbiter for human rights abuses. Recent jurisprudence of both the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has broadened the scope of recognized rights infringed by State Parties to the Inter-American human rights system, particularly in fields relating to environmental issues, natural resource rights and the rights of vulnerable and marginalized communities. Critical to this is the Inter-American Court’s development of the inter-dependence of green human rights in Indigenous cases. Set against this backdrop, the Covid-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to analyze existing and evolving legal trends, giving the Inter-American human rights system fertile ground to address emerging legal topics on human rights and the environment.

Resistance to the ""new normal"" appeared, as routines and common sense understandings of everyday life were threatened. Health-care professionals were put in a paradoxical situation, living in accordance with the ""new normal"" outside work and legitimately deviating from it at work. The ""new normal"" calls for individuals' ""oughtonomy"" rather than autonomy. Social media were used to push individual's re-socialisation into the ""new normal"".

In particular, it focuses on the learning associated with changes in the sustainability initiatives of emerging economy suppliers. Design/methodology/approach: Through studying three scenarios (pre-outbreak, buyer-centred peak and supplier-centred peak) over a nine-month period, a multi-case study strategy was used to gain an understanding of the learning of export-oriented Brazilian coffee producers, using both exploitation and exploration capabilities. Content analysis was developed after each data collection phase to investigate how sustainability initiatives had changed. Findings: Social sustainability was observed to be the main priority by suppliers facing this unprecedented outbreak, in ways that go beyond expected sustainability certification requirements. For instance, there was evidence of outstanding contributions to the local community. Suppliers initially developed their sustainability initiatives during the outbreak without any support from global buyers, certification bodies or government. In spite of this, stronger relationships with buyers ultimately emerged facilitating greater SC sustainability. Consequently, by using both exploitation and exploration learning capabilities, multiple levels of learning were observed (i.e. individual, organisational and SC) as related to planning, new procedures and social awareness. Practical implications: A greater awareness of supplier learning processes will aid buyers in developing recovery plans that are appropriate for their global SC partners. Originality/value: This paper provides an understanding of how emerging economy suppliers of global SCs are coping with this unprecedented outbreak in regard to sustainability management. Moving the spotlight from buyers to suppliers, the research demonstrates that supplier learning is central to global SC sustainability. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Pereira, M. M.

Furthermore, the relationship between parents' attitudes about the importance of physical activity and their children's motivation to engage in it was examined. The online questionnaire was completed by 25,274 parents of primary school students and 5,169 high school graduates from the Republic of Croatia. The results show a trend of decreasing motivation to engage in physical activities, as well as an increase in the number of meals consumed per day among all students. Furthermore, there was a low positive correlation between parental attitudes and the motivation of their children to engage in physical activity both before and during social isolation. In conclusion, this large-scale study showed that due to social isolation there was a significant decrease in the motivation for physical activity and an increase in the number of daily meals.","Curkovic, N.; Lukacin, L.; Katavic, I.",Drustvena Istrazivanja,690,1

Methods: From February 2020 to April 2021, trained nurses recorded age, gender, and symptoms in an outpatient COVID-19 testing center. All positive patients were followed up by phone for 14 days or until symptom-free. We calculated the symptoms odds ratio for positive results and hospitalization and proposed a random forest machine-learning model to predict positive testing. Results: A total of 8,998 patients over 16 years old underwent COVID-19 RT-PCR, with 1,914 (21.3%) positives. Fifty patients needed hospitalization (2.6% of positives), and three died (0.15%). Most common symptoms were: cough, headache, sore throat, coryza, fever, myalgia (57%, 51%, 44%, 36%, 35%, 27%, respectively). Cough, fever, and myalgia predicted positive COVID-19 test, while others behaved as protective factors. The best predictors of positivity were fever plus anosmia/ageusia (OR=6.31), and cough plus anosmia/ageusia (OR=5.82), both p<0.0001. Our random forest model had an ROC-AUC of 0.72 (specificity=0.70, sensitivity=0.61, PPV=0.38, NPV=0.86). Having steady fever during the first days of infection and persistent dyspnea increased the risk of hospitalization (OR=6.66, p<0.0001 and OR=3.13, p=0.003, respectively), while anosmia-ageusia (OR=0.36, p=0.009) and coryza (OR=0.31, p=0.014) were protective. Conclusion: Present study and algorithm may help identify patients at higher risk of having SARS-COV-2 (online calculator http://wdchealth.covid-map.com/shiny/calculator/), and also disease severity and hospitalization based on symptoms presence, pattern, and duration, which can help physicians and health care providers.","Jalalizadeh, M.; Leme, P.

Given persistently poor progress towards tackling health inequalities, and recent calls to reframe this agenda in the UK and Europe, the possible contribution of intersectionality deserves attention. Yet, no existing research has examined professional stakeholder understandings and perspectives on applying intersectionality to this field. In this paper we seek to address that gap, drawing upon a consultation survey and workshop undertaken in the UK. The survey included both researchers (n=53) and practitioners (n=20) with varied roles and levels of engagement in research and evaluation. Topics included: familiarity with the term and concept intersectionality, relevance to health inequalities work, and issues shaping its uptake. Respondents were also asked to comment on two specific policy suggestions; targeting and tailoring interventions to intersectional sub-groups, and evaluating the intersectional effects of policies. 23 people attended the face-to-face workshop. The aims of the workshop were to: share examples of applying intersectionality within health inequalities research and practice; understand the views of research and practice colleagues on potential contributions and challenges; and identify potential ways to promote intersectional approaches. Findings indicated a generally positive response to the concept and a cautiously optimistic assessment that intersectional approaches could be valuable. However, opinions were mixed and various challenges were raised, especially around whether intersectionality research is necessarily critical and transformative and, accordingly, how it should be operationalised methodologically. Nonetheless, there was general agreement that intersectionality is concerned with diverse inequalities and the systems of power that shape them. We position intersectionality within the wider context of health inequalities policy and practice, suggesting potential ways forward for the approach in the UK context.","Holman, D.; Salway, S.; Bell, A.; Beach, B.; Adebajo, A.; Ali, N.; Butt, J.",,690,24

Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are emerging as critical determinants of both SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and long-term immunity, either after recovery or vaccination. A hallmark of COVID-19 is its highly variable severity and breadth of immune responses between individuals. To address the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon we analyzed the proteolytic processing of S1 spike glycoprotein precursor antigenic peptides by 10 common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), a polymorphic intracellular enzyme that can regulate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses by generating or destroying antigenic peptides. We utilized a systematic proteomic approach that allows the concurrent analysis of hundreds of trimming reactions in parallel, thus better emulating antigen processing in the cell. While all ERAP1 allotypes were capable of producing optimal ligands for MHC class I molecules, including known SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, they presented significant differences in peptide sequences produced, suggesting allotype-dependent sequence biases. Allotype 10, previously suggested to be enzymatically deficient, was rather found to be functionally distinct from other allotypes. Our findings suggest that common ERAP1 allotypes can be a major source of heterogeneity in antigen processing and through this mechanism contribute to variable immune responses to COVID-19.","Stamatakis, George; Samiotaki, Martina; Temponeras, Ioannis; Panayotou, George; Stratikos, Efstratios",bioRxiv,690,13

Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) for the SA elderly were developed to address this need. These thirteen guidelines for the elderly collectively offer a basis of health practices that the elderly can follow to ensure that they are taking the right steps toward maintaining their health. While the guideline ‘Eat clean and safe food’ is not included in the current SA FBDGs, this recommendation is of particular importance to the elderly, who face a much higher risk of foodborne illness than most of the general population due to a number of factors. Reduced immunity and other physiological changes are a result of ageing, malnutrition, diseases and and/or medication side effects. All these factors play a role in the elderly’s risk of foodborne illness. Increased susceptibility to certain pathogens also causes higher rates of foodborne illness infection. Lastly, elderly people’s food safety knowledge and pre-established beliefs and practices regarding food handling and preparation can be influential in their sensitivity to foodborne disease. These risk factors, coupled with the heavy burden of foodborne illness and existing gaps in food safety policy, practices and education in SA, substantiate the need for a dietary guideline to address the importance of clean and safe food consumption among the elderly in SA.","Miller, M.; Oldewage-Theron, W.; Napier, C.",South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition,690,33

Furthermore, selection diluting the mutation was induced in vitro by triggering T and B cell antigen receptors. While C5024T dysregulated naive CD8+ T cell respiration and metabolic remodeling post-activation, these phenotypes were partially ameliorated by selection. Analogous to mice, peripheral blood memory T and B lymphocyte subsets from human MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephelomyopathy with Lactic Acidoses and Stroke-like episodes) patients - carrying heteroplasmic A3243G in mt-tRNA Leu - displayed a reduced mutation burden, compared to naive cells. In both humans and mice, mtDNA selection was observed in IgG+ antigen-specific B cells after SARS-CoV-2 Spike vaccination, illustrating an ongoing process in vivo.

Three household scenarios were analyzed: one for providing basic electricity access with no electric cooking;another for cooking with electricity;and the third for cooking half of the meals with electricity and half with another fuel, with a clean stacking process. Results of the application of REM to the three scenarios were obtained for the Nyagatare District, Rwanda. The case study showed that electric cooking substantially changes the mix of technologies and the total cost of the least-cost electrification plan. It also showed that electric cooking can be cost competitive compared to LPG and charcoal in grid-connected households and can reduce greenhouse emissions. Stacking with energy-efficient electric appliances provides most of the benefits of full electric cooking at a lower cost and is a pathway worthy of further consideration.","Sánchez-Jacob, Eduardo González-García Andrés Mazorra Javier Ciller Pedro Lumbreras Julio Pérez-Arriaga José Ignacio",Energies,690,5

The Asian miracle has few precedents in the modern era, with billions lifted from poverty in a generation. The region's openness to trade and investment aligned perfectly with the tailwinds of globalisation. However, in recent years Asia has become a victim of its own success with commentators not differentiating between a utopian high-income Asia and a dystopian middle- and low-income Asia, where a significant majority of the region's population live. Asia today can be divided into countries which have a lot, have a little, and have none. The continent's dream run is also coming to an end as Covid-19 exposes sharp weaknesses in state capacity and structural challenges like the U.S.-China trade war is putting globalisation into reverse gear, jeopardising the region's hard-earned economic success. Asia's growth-obsessed policymakers have also ignored social pressures from the impact of technology on jobs, rising inequality, fabulous wealth accumulation by a favoured billionaire class, a deepening demographic divide, climate distress, and gender disparity, which threaten to destabilise the region's famed cohesiveness.

It is defined by kidney tissue injury [with or without a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and /or a decrease in kidney function over a period of three or more months. When the glomerular filtration rate [GFR] is below 15ml./min./1.73m2, the patient is in the terminal stage or dialysis, requiring renal replacement therapy [RRT], dialysis or transplant as alternative treatments. Renal failure is the inability of the kidney to excrete wastes, concentrate urine, and conserve electrolytes. Renal failure is precipitated from a variety of etiological factors. It is treatable but not curable, which means that the patient needs a long term therapies or transplantation. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in this study found to be 22.9%, 19.2%, and 28.2%, respectively. Forty nine (13.84%) respondents had mild depression twenty eight (7.91%) has moderate depression. Depression and anxiety are frequent comorbid disorders among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, with estimated prevalence of approximately 25% in this population, [1] and are associated with worse outcomes, such as progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality [2,3,4,5]. The transition from predialysis management to renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a stressful event in the course of CKD, leading to challenges and decisions that might increase their susceptibility to anxiety, mood disorders or even exacerbate psychological issues that already exist [6]. Aims: The researcher aim to assess the level of depression, anxiety and stress among chronic kidney disease patient in selected hospital of Nadiad City, Gujarat.

The study will also investigate the cytokine storm and the role of both dendritic cells and Natural Killer T cells, and will provide ample references for researchers who need immunological data on SARS-CoV-2. The review collects data from 60 different review and research articles. Viral antigens are predictable by the B cells or introduced to the T cells by MHC complexes, leading to the assembly of antibodies, magnified production of cytokines, and lysis during the acute stage of infection. In MHC, genetic polymorphism helps it to show a number of T lymphocyte epitopes over different MHCs. Their gene association and downregulated expression are related to the seriousness of COVID-19 and evaluated by special markers such as IL-1ra, MCP-3, IL-17, IP-10, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-10, IL-1 beta, and IL-6.

However, the mechanism of its intervention in severe stage of COVID-19 at molecular level is still unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the mechanism of Shengmai decoction in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. Methods: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology, BATMAN, UniProt databases and the published literatures which contain the reported compounds that have therapeutic effects on COVID-19 were used to screen out the active ingredients and targets of Shengmai decoction, and the ""drug-active compound-target"" network was constructed. The GeneCards database was used to screen out the targets of COVID-19. The protein-protein interaction network map was constructed by mapping two genes, and the network of active ingredients, targets and disease was constructed using Cytoscape software. Thereafter, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses of the key targets were performed using the Metascape Site Maintenance website and David databases. The Gene Ontology function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment of the mapping targets were analyzed. Results: The active component-target network contained 73 main compounds and 457 targets. The first five main active components (hydroquinone, guanosine, ophiopogon C, ophiopogon B, ophiopogon D) were obtained by topological analysis of 33 common targets. Using the Matthews correlation coefficient algorithm, the key targets included albumin, tumor necrosis factor, and cyclic adenosine response element binding. Compounds in Shengmai decoction were found to have good binding effect and strong interaction with caspase-8, caspase-3, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2, tumor necrosis factor, C-C motif chemokine 3, to inhibit the inflammatory response and improve lung injury. Additionally, 31 biological processes were obtained by Gene Ontology enrichment, mainly related to lipopolysaccharide response and cytokine-mediated signal pathways, and 71 biological processes were obtained by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, mainly related to pulmonary tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathways. Conclusion: Shengmai decoction has multicomponent, multitarget and multichannel characteristics, which can provide an important theoretical basis to treat patients with severe COVID-19.","Su, J.

The paper aims to investigate the factors that impact communication and collaboration in a distance learning environment in and outside of the virtual classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of social media in this process. The online survey was used to collect the data and test the research hypotheses. In total, 234 students' answers were analyzed. The study findings indicate that the increasing use of Facebook (FB) for professional purposes improves students' communication and collaboration during distance learning courses. High activity on FB and LinkedIn (LKND) is important for communication with educators. In line with engagement theory, active participation in distance classes and high assessment of the online tools used positively influence the processes of communicating and collaborating among students. The study contributes to the distance learning literature as it adds to our understanding of distance learning in the midst of a pandemic through the lenses of engagement theory. It also has practical implications for all active participants in the educational process.","Zarzycka, E.; Krasodomska, J.; Mazurczak-Maka, A.; Turek-Radwan, M.",Cogent Arts &amp; Humanities,690,16

Precise identification of SLiMs remains a challenge, being the main drawback of most bioinformatic prediction tools their low specificity (high number of false positives). An important, usually overlooked, aspect is the relation between SLiMs mutations and disease. The presence of variants in each residue position can be used to assess the relevance of the corresponding residue(s) for protein function, and its (in)tolerance to change. In the present work, we combined sequence variant information and structural analysis of the energetic impact of single amino acid substitution (SAS) in SLiM-Receptor complex structure, and showed that it significantly improves prediction of true functional SLiMs. Our strategy is based on building a SAS tolerance matrix that shows, for each position, whether one of the possible 19 SAS is tolerated or not. Herein we present the MotSASi strategy and analyze in detail 4 SLiMs involved in intracellular protein trafficking. Our results show that inclusion of variant and sequence information significantly improves both prediction of true SLiMs and rejection of false positives, while also allowing better classification of variants inside SLiMs, a results with a direct impact in clinical genomics.","Martín, Mariano; Modenutti, Carlos P.; Nicola, Juan P.; Marti, Marcelo A.",bioRxiv,690,1

With these technologies, the goals of reducing emissions in the aviation industry can be achieved while passenger numbers are growing at the same time. In order to fulfill the quality requirements of the components, the AM process chain includes many further process steps in addition to melting, such as heat treatment. Furthermore, the functional surfaces must be machined and the support structures removed. These are essential for selective laser melting. The paper shows how the deflection of the workpiece can be minimized by milling thin-walled functional surfaces using a clamping device with support points. This increases the geometric accuracy considerably. Finally, the paper shows the results for milling support structures. The design of the support structure has a high effect on the machining behavior. Finally, results are presented that show the influence of different milling strategies on the surface quality of AM components, considering the support structures.","Hintze, Wolfgang; von Wenserski, Robert; Junghans, Sebastian; Möller, Carsten",Procedia Manufacturing,690,24

A retrospective cohort study of 68 children was performed. Critical illness was defined as any child requiring respiratory or cardiovascular support or renal replacement therapy. PcHIS was developed by using six variables: fever, hematological dysfunction, coagulopathy, hepatic injury, macrophage activation, and cytokinemia. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were used to identify MIS-C, and three classes of MIS-C were identified based on the findings of recently published latent class analysis (Class 1: MIS-C without Kawasaki like disease, Class 2: MIS-C with respiratory disease, and Class 3: MIS-C with Kawasaki like disease). The median age was 6.4 years. Fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal were common presenting symptoms. MIS-C was present in 32 (47%), critical COVID-19 illness in 11 (16%), and 17 (25%) were admitted to the PICU. Children with critical illness were adolescents with elevated body mass index and premorbid conditions. PcHIS score of 3 had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 77% for predicting critical COVID-19 illness. Among MIS-C patients, 15 (47%) were in Class 1, 8 (25%) were in Class 2, and 9 (28%) were in Class 3. We conclude that most children with COVID-19 have mild-to-moderate illness. Critical COVID-19 is mainly seen in obese adolescents with premorbid conditions. Three Classes of MIS-C are identifiable based on clinical features. Validation and clinical implication of inflammation score in pediatric COVID-19 need further investigation.","Totapally, B.

This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. Methods: Between 5th April and 28th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. Results: We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19; mistrust in the government; concern about taking a test; perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy; and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others; positive perceptions of tests; a desire to return to normal; and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. Conclusions: Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing; 2) provide information about the accuracy of tests; 3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and; 4) emphasise accessibility of testing.","Dennis, A.; Robin, C.; Carter, H.",,690,1

Mental disorders have become a major cause for disturbances in social adjustment, primarily due to disorders that fall into three clusters: Prolonged fatigue (asthenia) with cognitive impairment;anxiety disorders with sleep disorders;and depression. The last two are also found in individuals who have not contracted SARSCoV- 2;they are seen as a result of their exposure to the stress of the pandemic. Therefore, to successfully manage the consequences of the pandemic, it is necessary to develop a cohesive clinical interpretation of mental disorders related to COVID-19 infection.

Regulatory fit theory holds that persuasiveness is influenced by how well the framing of a message resonates with fundamental motivations that influence recipients’ behavior. People who are motivated to approach desirable outcomes generally respond best to health messages having a promotion frame, whereas people who are motivated to avoid undesirable outcomes respond best to health messages having a prevention frame. In the research presented in this article, we show that the effectiveness of COVID-19-related directives is influenced by the fit between promotion or prevention framing and the recipients’ identity—whether they view themselves as independent actors or as part of a larger community. We found that an appeal that highlighted health promotion and benefits to the individual (as in “what you can do to help you stay healthy”) or one that highlighted disease prevention and protection of society (as in “what you can do to keep America safe”) led to greater intent to practice social distancing than did appeals using other pairings of framing and identity, particularly in people who were not already practicing rigorous social distancing. The findings suggest that policymakers should consider regulatory fit—and specifically, the pairings described above—when designing public health communications relating to COVID-19 and other directives. © 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

Design/methodology/approach The research process involved an online self-administrated method created with one of the leading research and web-based survey tools called Qualtrics. The questionnaire was filled by 402 respondents. Findings The findings indicate that the impact of COVID-19 on cutting down travel plans, certain personal values and structural constraints have a positive relationship with the leisure travel intention to various destinations. Moreover, risk perceptions and intrapersonal constraints have a positive relationship with domestic leisure travel intentions. However, these factors have a negative connection with the leisure travel intention to some international destinations. Further, decreased perceptions of risks have a negative relationship with the domestic leisure travel intentions. Research limitations/implications Using questionnaires in the form of online, self-administrated surveys made it impossible to get an insight in and have control over who responded to the questionnaire. Gaining an insight into the factors impacting the leisure travel intentions following a period of crisis will make it possible for the tourism industry to respond adequately to future crises and will make it easier for destination marketers and managers to attract new tourists during the recovery process. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, no analysis has been so far published with a focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the Dutch population and their intention to travel. It is crucial for gaining an insight into leisure travel intention and the factors impacting this intention following a period of crisis since travel intention is an under-researched topic of academic tourism literature.

Indeed, the first step in viral entry is the binding of the viral trimeric spike protein to ACE2. Abundantly present in human epithelial cells of many organs, ACE2 is also expressed in the human brain. ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular 44-residues segment. This C-terminal segment contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) targeting protein interacting domains called PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ). Here, we identified the human PDZ specificity profile of the ACE2 PBM using the high throughput holdup assay and measuring the binding intensities of the PBM of ACE2 against the full human PDZome. We discovered 14 human PDZ binders of ACE2 showing significant binding with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 to 81 μM. NHERF, SHANK, and SNX27 proteins found in this study are involved in protein trafficking. The PDZ/PBM interactions with ACE2 could play a role on ACE2 internalization and recycling that could benefit for the virus entry. Interestingly, most of the ACE2 partners we identified are expressed in neuronal cells, such as SHANK and MAST families, and modifications of the interactions between ACE2 and these neuronal proteins may be involved in neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","Caillet-Saguy, Célia; Wolff, Nicolas",bioRxiv,690,5
182489,182489,182489,Enhanced Deep Learning Approach For IoT Enabled Sensitive Clinical Data Analytics,13.241954,1.0410985,2021,"Effective prophylactic vaccines usually induce the immune system to generate potent antibodies that can bind to an antigen and thus prevent it from infecting host cells. B cells produce antibodies by a Darwinian evolutionary process called affinity maturation (AM). During AM, the B cell population evolves in response to the antigen to produce antibodies that bind specifically and strongly to the antigen. Highly mutable pathogens pose a major challenge to the development of effective vaccines because antibodies that are effective against one strain of the virus may not protect against a mutant strain. Antibodies that can protect against diverse strains of a mutable pathogen have high “breadth” and are called broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). In spite of extensive studies, an effective vaccination strategy that can generate bnAbs in humans does not exist for any highly mutable pathogen. Here we study a minimal model to explore the mechanisms underlying how the selection forces imposed by antigens can be optimally chosen to guide AM to maximize the evolution of bnAbs. For logistical reasons, only a finite number of antigens can be administered in a finite number of vaccinations; that is, guiding the non-equilibrium dynamics of AM to produce bnAbs must be accomplished non-adiabatically. The time-varying Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the existing B cell population distribution and the fitness landscape imposed by antigens is a quantitative metric of the thermodynamic force acting on B cells. If this force is too small, adaptation is minimal. If the force is too large, contrary to expectations, adaptation is not faster; rather, the B cell population is extinguished for reasons that we describe. We define the conditions necessary for the force to be set optimally such that the flux of B cells from low to high breadth states is maximized. Even in this case we show why the dynamics of AM prevent perfect adaptation. If two shots of vaccination are allowed, the optimal protocol is characterized by a relatively low optimal KLD during the first shot that appropriately increases the diversity of the B cell population so that the surviving B cells have a high chance of evolving into bnAbs upon subsequently increasing the KLD during the second shot. Phylogenetic tree analysis further reveals the evolutionary pathways that lead to bnAbs. The connections between the mechanisms revealed by our analyses and recent simulation studies of bnAb evolution, the problem of generalist versus specialist evolution, and learning theory are discussed.","Ganti, Raman S.; Chakraborty, Arup K.",bioRxiv,690,16

OBJECTIVE To survey hospital personnel regarding their attendance at work in the hypothetical event of avian influenza pandemic, and what factors might influence this decision. METHODS A voluntary, confidential, institutional review board-approved survey was offered to a convenience sample of hospital workers regarding their willingness to report to work and what issues would be important in making this decision. Surveys not returned and individuals declining to participate were recorded. RESULTS Of 187 surveys offered, 169 were completed (90% response rate): 34% were doctors, 33% were nurses, and 33% were clerical and other associates (other). The average age of the participants was 38 years, and 32% were males. Participants were asked: ""In the event of an avian pandemic, and patients were being treated at this hospital, would you report to work as usual?"". Of those who responded to the survey, 50% reported ""yes"", 42% reported ""maybe"", and 8% reported ""no"". Doctors were more likely than nurses or others to respond ""yes"" (73%), as were males (66%). For the ""maybe"" responders, the most important factor (83%) was: ""How confident I am that the hospital can protect me"". For 19% of the ""maybe"" responders, financial incentives would not make a difference for them to work, even up to triple pay. CONCLUSIONS Personnel absenteeism during a pandemic due to fear of contracting an illness may result in a significant personnel shortage. Ensuring worker confidence in adequate personal protection may be more important than financial incentives.","Irvin, Charlene B; Cindrich, Lauren; Patterson, William; Southall, Anthony",Prehospital and disaster medicine,690,1

The present study used the mouse model to examine in detail the host immune response in the lung. After an aerosol challenge with 20 c.f.u. of the type A strain FSC033, all mice developed clinical signs of severe disease, showed weight loss by day 4 of infection and died the next day. Histopathological findings in the lung revealed acute inflammation and intense vasculitis and perivasculitis on day 4. Gene transcriptional changes in the mouse lung samples were examined on days 1, 2 and 4 of infection using a cDNA microarray with 20,600 mouse clones representing 18,500 genes. In total, 424 genes were found to be differentially expressed, some of which were both up- and downregulated at different time points, 192 of which were upregulated and 234 of which were downregulated for at least one time point. A high percentage of selected genes identified by the microarray analysis were confirmed to be differentially regulated by quantitative real-time PCR. Categorization of the differentially expressed genes showed that those preferentially involved in host immune responses were activated extensively on day 4 but hardly or not at all on days 1 and 2. Further analysis revealed that several of the genes upregulated on day 4 are known to depend on gamma interferon or tumour necrosis factor alpha for their regulation. In keeping with this finding, tumour necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon levels were found to be increased significantly in bronchoalveolar lavage on day 4.","Andersson, Henrik; Hartmanová, Blanka; Kuolee, Rhonda; Rydén, Patrik; Conlan, Wayne; Chen, Wangxue; Sjöstedt, Anders",Journal of medical microbiology,690,1

The causative agent has been identified in a virus belonging to theCoronaviridae family, similar to the agent of SARS, referred to as SARS-CoV-2. This epidemic spread rapidly globally with high morbidity and mortality. Although vaccine development is at a very advanced stage, there are currently no truly effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we present systematic and integrative antiviral drug repurposing effort aimed at identifying, among the drugs already authorized for clinical use, some active inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The most important result of this analysis is the demonstration that ethacrynic acid, a powerful diuretic, is revealed to be an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Even with all the necessary cautions, given the particular nature of this drug, these data can be the starting point for the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2.","Isgrò, Camilla; Sardanelli, Anna Maria; Palese, Luigi Leonardo",Viruses,690,1

By using a mean-field approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for SIS and SIR epidemic models for a general adaptive strategy, which strongly depends on the correlations between activity and attractiveness in the susceptible and infected states. We focus on a strong adaptive behaviour, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards non-quarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one, and that in SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to reach containment.","Mancastroppa, Marco; Burioni, Raffaella; Colizza, Vittoria; Vezzani, Alessandro",,690,12

Few studies have prospectively examined the association between physiological responses to acute psychological stress prior to a traumatic event with later PTSD symptoms. The present prospective study examined whether cardiovascular responses to an acute psychological stress task prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic predicted PTSD symptoms related to the ongoing pandemic. METHOD: Participants (N = 120) were a subsample of an ongoing research study. Phase 1 consisted of a 10-minute baseline and 4-minute acute psychological stress task with blood pressure and heart rate recorded throughout. Phase 2 was initiated two weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the ongoing pandemic. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to examine whether cardiovascular stress reactivity predicted COVID-19 PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: Heart rate reactivity significantly predicted IES-intrusion, b = -.208, t = -2.28, p = .025, DR = .041, CI: [-.021 - -.001] and IES-hyperarousal b = -.224, t = -2.54, p = .012, DR = .047, CI: [-0.22 - - .003], but not IES-avoidance (p = .077). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for gender, socioeconomic status, baseline cardiovascular activity, neuroticism, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and adverse childhood experiences. There were no statistically significant associations between blood pressure with any of the IES-R subscales (p's > .12). CONCLUSIONS: Diminished heart rate responses (i.e., lower physiological arousal) to acute psychological stress prior to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly predicted reported PTSD symptoms during the crisis.","Ginty, Annie T; Young, Danielle A; Tyra, Alexandra T; Hurley, Page E; Brindle, Ryan C; Williams, Sarah E",Psychosom. med,690,16

Both were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on polymerase chain reaction. They both had obvious characteristic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT. However, CT findings in the younger brother were non-specific and similar to other pneumonias. The older brother required longer treatment because of a longer shedding period of SARS-CoV-2 detected in nasopharyngeal samples. Both boys were discharged without complications.

Designing these tests for broad, long-term detection was complicated by limited information about the novel virus' genome sequence and how it might mutate during global spread and adaptation to humans. METHODS: We assessed eight widely adopted lab developed PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 against 15,001 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Using a custom bioinformatic pipeline called PCR_strainer, we identified all mismatches and sequence variants in genome locations targeted by 15 sets of primer/probe oligonucleotides from these assays. RESULTS: For 12 out of 15 primer/probe sets, over 98 % of SARS-CoV-2 genomes had no mismatches. Two primer/probe sets contained a single mismatch in the reverse primer that was present in over 99 % of genomes. One primer/probe set targeted a location with extensive polymorphisms with 23 sequence observed variants at the forward primer location. One of these variants, which contains three nucleotide mismatches, arose in February as part of the emergence of a viral clade and was present in 18.8 % of the genomes we analyzed. DISCUSSION: Most early PCR diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 remain inclusive of circulating viral diversity, but three assays with extensive mismatches highlight assay design challenges for novel pathogens and provide valuable lessons for PCR assay design during future outbreaks. Our bioinformatics pipeline is also presented as a useful general-purpose tool for assessing PCR diagnostics assays against circulating strains.","Kuchinski, Kevin S; Jassem, Agatha N; Prystajecky, Natalie A",J Clin Virol,690,16

In particular, substantial research investment has advanced monoclonal antibody therapies to the clinic where they have shown partial efficacy in reducing viral burden and hospitalization. An alternative is to use the host entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a soluble decoy that broadly blocks SARS-associated coronaviruses with limited potential for viral escape. Here, we summarize efforts to engineer higher affinity variants of soluble ACE2 that rival the potency of affinity-matured antibodies. Strategies have also been used to increase the valency of ACE2 decoys for avid spike interactions and to improve pharmacokinetics via IgG fusions. Finally, the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 for the turnover of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II may directly address COVID-19 symptoms and protect against lung and cardiovascular injury, conferring dual mechanisms of action unachievable by monoclonal antibodies. Soluble ACE2 derivatives therefore have the potential to be next generation therapeutics for addressing the immediate needs of the current pandemic and possible future outbreaks.","Jing, Wenyang; Procko, Erik",Proteins,690,30

Here I answer this question in humans, using publicly available data of a recent study on 1969 participants from India and 1615 from the USA. The apparent health of a male stranger, as estimated from his face, and the comfort with contact with him were a direct function of his similarity to the men in the local community. This held true regardless of whether the face carried overt signs of infection. I conclude that our behavioral immune system is finely tuned to degrees of outgroupness - and that cues of outgroupness are partly processed as cues of infectiousness.

However, for the more than 20 million people who do not have broadband access, a different set of barriers has been experienced. These challenges are especially prominent in rural communities throughout various states. The present commentary addresses how health disparities for preexisting conditions place rural residents at greater risk for morbidity during COVID-19. Reasons for physical and mental health disparities, such as limited access to hospitals or specialty providers (e.g., psychiatrists), are described. Whereas telehealth is promoted as a way to meet health access needs, especially during a pandemic, this luxury is not readily available for all U.S. residents.

We mainly focused on teachers’ experiences with technology use (change and variety of the use) and their willingness to use technology in teaching. We designed an interview-based study. The participants were Estonian science teachers who voluntarily agreed to share their experiences about teaching in new and—for most of them—unexpected, distanced learning conditions. Based on teachers’ reflections on technology use we could distinguish between three groups in which teachers described different levels of willingness to use technology, change in technology use from pre-COVID to distanced learning, and variety in the use of technology. Our results revealed that the higher teachers’ perceived willingness to use technology, the easier it was for them to overcome potential obstacles and cope with the unexpected distanced learning. The main obstacles there were grouped as external (e.g., issues with internet connection, lack of students’ digital skills) and internal (e.g., teachers’ beliefs about technology use for teaching). I was observed that some obstacles were shared by all teachers (such as limitations on students’ digital skills) whereas others where more prevalent in separate groups. This highlights the importance of understanding and considering the variability in the possible obstacles that emerge in using technology in education for teachers with different levels of experience.","Adov, Liina Mäeots Mario",Education Sciences,690,10

Higher stress and burnout in health professionals is linked with the delivery of poorer quality, less safe patient care across healthcare settings. In order to understand how we can better support healthcare professionals in the workplace, this study evaluated a tailored resilience coaching intervention comprising a workshop and one-to-one coaching session addressing the intrinsic challenges of healthcare work in health professionals and students. METHODS: The evaluation used an uncontrolled before-and-after design with four data-collection time points: baseline (T1); after the workshop (T2); after the coaching session (T3) and four-to-six weeks post-baseline (T4). Quantitative outcome measures were Confidence in Coping with Adverse Events ('Confidence'), a Knowledge assessment ('Knowledge') and Resilience. At T4, qualitative interviews were also conducted with a subset of participants exploring participant experiences and perceptions of the intervention. RESULTS: We recruited 66 participants, retaining 62 (93.9%) at T2, 47 (71.2%) at T3, and 33 (50%) at T4. Compared with baseline, Confidence was significantly higher post-intervention: T2 (unadj. ß = 2.43, 95% CI 2.08-2.79, d = 1.55, p < .001), T3 (unadj. ß = 2.81, 95% CI 2.42-3.21, d = 1.71, p < .001) and T4 (unadj. ß = 2.75, 95% CI 2.31-3.19, d = 1.52, p < .001). Knowledge increased significantly post-intervention (T2 unadj. ß = 1.14, 95% CI 0.82-1.46, d = 0.86, p < .001). Compared with baseline, resilience was also higher post-intervention (T3 unadj. ß = 2.77, 95% CI 1.82-3.73, d = 0.90, p < .001 and T4 unadj. ß = 2.54, 95% CI 1.45-3.62, d = 0.65, p < .001). The qualitative findings identified four themes. The first addressed the 'tension between mandatory and voluntary delivery', suggesting that resilience is a mandatory skillset but it may not be effective to make the training a mandatory requirement. The second, the 'importance of experience and reference points for learning', suggested the intervention was more appropriate for qualified staff than students. The third suggested participants valued the 'peer learning and engagement' they gained in the interactive group workshop. The fourth, 'opportunities to tailor learning', suggested the coaching session was an opportunity to personalise the workshop material. CONCLUSIONS: We found preliminary evidence that the intervention was well received and effective, but further research using a randomised controlled design will be necessary to confirm this.","Johnson, Judith; Simms-Ellis, Ruth; Janes, Gillian; Mills, Thomas; Budworth, Luke; Atkinson, Lauren; Harrison, Reema",BMC Health Serv Res,690,16

Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y León, Spain (865,096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2<300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or those who died in the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then, we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses (250 mg of methylprednisolone for three days), and 133 were not. 30.3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulse group and 42.9% (57/133) in the nonexposed cohort. These differences (12.6%, 95% CI [8·54-16.65]) were statically significant (log-rank 4.72, p = 0, 03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5.31, p = 0.021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0.561; p = 0.039). Conclusions: This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria with that selection process set a reliable frame to compare mortality in both the exposed and nonexposed groups.","Cusacovich, Ivan; Aparisi, Álvaro; Marcos, Miguel; Ybarra-Falcón, Cristina; Iglesias-Echevarria, Carolina; Lopez-Veloso, Maria; Barraza-Vengoechea, Julio; Dueñas, Carlos; Juarros Martínez, Santiago Antonio; Rodríguez-Alonso, Beatriz; Martín-Oterino, José-Ángel; Montero-Baladia, Miguel; Moralejo, Leticia; Andaluz-Ojeda, David; Gonzalez-Fuentes, Roberto",Mediators Inflamm,690,16

Our proposed approach only requires in-domain monolingual data and can be quickly applied to a preexisting translation system trained on general domain, reaching significant gains on in-domain translation quality with little or no drop on general-domain. We also propose an effective procedure of simultaneous adaptation for multiple domains and languages.

We conducted a study among the lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, online-based survey study between January 28, 2020, and February 2, 2020 among the adult lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify factors associated with psychological impacts. RESULTS: Among the 4100 participants investigated, a total of 15.9% were compliant with all the five household prevention measures, whereas 74.4% were compliant with all the three community prevention measures investigated. By demographics, participants of younger age, higher income, residing in an urban area, knowing neighbors infected with COVID-19 reported significantly higher psychological impact score. Participants with a lower level of support for quarantine were more likely to have a higher psychological impact score (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96). Participants with a lower level of compliance with preventive measures (score of 0-19) reported higher psychological impact (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.22-1.60 vs. score 20-24). Participants who had been out of house socializing and attended public events expressed higher psychological impact. CONCLUSIONS: Support, understanding of the rationale for quarantine are essential in ensuring appropriate psychological well-being during the quarantine.

Geometric considerations of rigid rod packing imply that a domain of sufficiently short rods in a background membrane of long rods is more susceptible to twist than the inverse structure, a long-rod domain in a short-rod membrane background. The tilt at the inter-domain edge forces splay, which in turn manifests as a spontaneous edge curvature whose energetics are controlled by the length asymmetry of constituent rods. A thermodynamic model of such tilt-curvature coupling at inter-domain edges explains a number of experimental observations, including a non-monotonic dependence of the edge twist on the domain radius, and annularly shaped domains of long rods. Our work shows how coupling between orientational and compositional degrees of freedom in two-dimensional fluids give rise to complex shapes and thermodynamics of domains, analogous to shape transitions in 3D fluid vesicles.","Miller, Joia M.; Hall, Doug; Robaszewski, Joanna; Sharma, Prerna; Hagan, Michael F.; Grason, Gregory M.; Dogic, Zvonimir",,690,16

During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of staff required re-training to manage unfamiliar situations. We present a set of medical student-led clinical simulation sessions and evaluate their effects on (i) confidence among redeployed healthcare workers managing COVID-19 patients and (ii) medical students' confidence as educators. METHODS: Half-day simulation training sessions consisting of three COVID-related clinical scenarios were devised by senior medical students and delivered to a group of approximately 150 healthcare workers over six repeated sessions prior to redeployment to COVID-19 wards. We distributed an anonymous pre- and post-simulation questionnaire to 36 participants in the final group exploring their experiences. The confidence scores were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Following the delivery of teaching, medical students completed a questionnaire assessing their personal experiences of designing and delivering the exercises. RESULTS: Data are available for 35/36 participants approached. Respondents reported being significantly more confident after the training in all aspects of managing COVID-19 patients, including triage, complex discharge, recognising deterioration, initiating basic life support, managing symptoms and advising on visiting policies (p < 0.001); 97% of respondents rated the training as useful. Thematic analysis of medical students' responses demonstrated mutual benefit. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the strengths of simulation training in helping to build staff confidence in a rapidly evolving situation and highlights the value of medical students in supporting a hospital's response to an outbreak.

The Organizational Identification and Well-being Framework reflects this assertion, illustrating leadership functions to create an organization's in-group identity that satisfies the needs of members in response to a crisis. It further outlines the SPRInT (Social support, Purpose and meaning, Relatedness, In-group norms, and Trust) pathways, which mediate the effect of organizational identification on member well-being.

Whereas zinc might affect SARS-COV-2 replication and cell entry, the link between zinc deficiency and COVID-19 severity could also be attributed to the effects of COVID-19 on the body metabolism and immune response. Zinc deficiency is more prevalent in the elderly and patients with underlying chronic diseases, with established deleterious consequences such as the increased risk of respiratory infection. We reviewed the expected effects of zinc deficiency on COVID-19-related pathophysiological mechanisms focusing on both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems. Mechanisms and effects were extrapolated from the available scientific literature. Zinc deficiency alters angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) function, leading to the accumulation of angiotensin II, des-Arg9-bradykinin and Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin, which results in an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, vasoconstriction and pro-thrombotic effects. Additionally, zinc deficiency blocks the activation of the plasma contact system, a protease cascade initiated by factor VII activation. Suggested mechanisms include the inhibition of Factor XII activation and limitation of high-molecular-weight kininogen, prekallikrein and Factor XII to bind to endothelial cells. The subsequent accumulation of Factor XII and deficiency in bradykinin are responsible for increased production of inflammatory mediators and marked hypercoagulability, as typically observed in COVID-19 patients. To conclude, zinc deficiency may affect both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems, leading to the exaggerated inflammatory manifestations characteristic of severe COVID-19.","Gouda, Ahmed S; Adbelruhman, Fatima G; Elbendary, Reham N; Ahmed Alharbi, Fadiyah; Qalit Alhamrani, Sultan; Mégarbane, Bruno",,690,23

Decisions about how to allocate limited supplies of vaccines need to be clear about the criteria used in setting priorities, with a specific commitment to transparency and communication. The aim of our study was to think through these competing demands, focusing on the opinion of healthcare workers (HCWs). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the opinion of all the HCWs in a University based Italian Hospital about the fairest priority order to COVID 19 vaccines and to understand on which criteria the prioritization preferences of HCWs are implicitly based. The secondary endpoints were to assess whether HCWs approach differs from national guidelines and to assess the attitude of HCWs towards mandatory vaccination. An online survey accounting with multiple choice single answer questions and ranking questions was administered to all the HCWs of the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo (Italy) and completed by a total of 465 participants. Almost all respondents confirmed the need for prioritization in COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs (n = 444; 95.5%), essential services and law enforcement (both n = 428; 92%). Clinically vulnerable individuals, HCWs and population over 65 years have been considered the first three groups to be involved in getting vaccination, being indicated as first position group by 26.5%, 32.5% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. A large majority of respondents (85%) asked for a consistent, transparent and detailed order of priority at a national level. After adjusting for potential confounding due to sex and age, physicians have been found to be statistically significantly associated with the choice of mandatory vaccination (odds ratio (OR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7-39.1) or with other strategies different from voluntary (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.9-27.3). The broad consensus expressed by respondents towards mandatory vaccination for HCWs is extremely relevant at a time when vaccination hesitation is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving herd immunity. Data show a mismatch in the position attributed to long-term care residents compared to the position of absolute priority assigned by most of national distribution plans, impelling us to reflect on the issue of maximizing benefit from limited healthcare resources. Our findings clearly indicate a preference for COVID-19 frontline health professionals as the first tier of recipients, since they better meet all the criteria (higher risk, immediate system stability). As the guidelines are likely to directly affect a considerable number of citizens, our results call for policy interventions to inform people on the ethical rationale behind vaccine distribution decisions, to avoid resentment and feelings of unfairness.","Craxì, Lucia; Casuccio, Alessandra; Amodio, Emanuele; Restivo, Vincenzo",,690,20

Since the virus is novel, pre-existing CoV2-specific immunity is not expected to exist in humans, although studies have shown presence of CoV2 cross-reactive T cells in unexposed individuals. Lack of effective immunity in most individuals along with high infectiousness of the virus has resulted in massive global public health emergency. Intense efforts are on to study viral pathogenesis and immune response to help guide prophylactic and therapeutic interventions as well as epidemiological assessments like transmission modeling. To develop an effective vaccine or biologic therapeutic, it is critical to understand the immune correlates of COVID-19 control. At the same time, whether immunity in recovered individuals is effective for preventing re-infection will be important for informing interventions like social distancing. Key questions that are being investigated regarding immune response in COVID-19 which will help these efforts include, investigations of immune response that distinguishes patients with severe versus mild infection or those that recover relative to those that succumb, durability of immunity in recovered patients and relevance of developed immunity in a cured patient for protection against re-infection as well as value of convalescent plasma from recovered patients as a potential therapeutic modality. This is a broad and rapidly evolving area and multiple reports on status of innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV2 are emerging on a daily basis. While many questions remain unanswered for now, the purpose of this focused review is to summarize the current understanding regarding immune correlates of COVID-19 severity and resolution in order to assist researchers in the field to pursue new directions in prevention and control.","Poonia, Bhawna; Kottilil, Shyam",Front Immunol,690,20

During the previous financial crisis, organisations have already determined the elements of crisis management so they could met the new corona crisis readily. Global changes, like the current pandemic situation, provide a different view toward the future expectations. The pandemic has caused new way of functioning under special circumstances such as various restrictions in many European countries, restrictions on people's mobility and other novelties that have encountered for the first time. Characteristics of this crisis include novelty and pressure in a business environment, which can reveal various vulnerabilities in organisations. Managers were affected by major business changes, and there appeared a need for rapid reorganisation of the current way of functioning. Management had to introduce new control systems that refer to their strategies for exchanging information and decision-making. In general, each crisis is a new opportunity for seeking modern and appropriate models and tools for business improvement. When business situations are challenging, managers are more oriented toward controlling. Therefore, organisations that focus on traditional management models are not very successful in normal circumstances, and even less so in a crisis. This study aims to examine the extent of the structure and function of management control systems in pandemic conditions in Croatian organisations. An overview of current systems in organizations was given, as well as management challenges of the pandemic situations. This study includes the analysis of management control system during the pandemic times. The research was conducted using survey method what referred to analyses of strategic plans, perfor- mance evaluation systems, and management controls for performance evaluation in Croatian organisations. The factor analysis of the main components was conducted in order to examine the contribution of predictor variables in explaining the broad-scope management control sys- tem. In order to examine the contribution of gender, age, work experience, education, company size, aggregation, timeliness, and integration for explaining of broad-scope the management control system hierarchical regression analysis was conducted. The results confirm that integration is significant predictor in the crisis controlling model, but at the same time, when the integration and timeliness should have positive connection, greater timeliness does not increase to the greater availability. This withdraws the conclusion that un- certainty of environment extents the speed of business processes. Despite of the equal integration during pandemic crises the remote working conditions caused the decrease of the promptness of reporting collected information, which requires new models of controlling in unpredictable situations.","Galić, Matej PhD Biškupec Petra Popek PhD Galić Marko MSc",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,690,16

Although some equipment is available, the ICTs for education at the National Public Health School (NPHS) of Burkina Faso have many shortcomings. These shortcomings were clearly revealed during the search for responses to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, to curb the spread of COVID-19, some measures were taken, such as closure of educational institutions. This resulted in a 2.5-month suspension of educational activities. Despite its willingness, the NPHS was unable to use ICTs to continue teaching during the closure period of educational institutions. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to propose practical solutions to promote ICT use in teaching at the NPHS by analyzing the weaknesses and challenges related to its use. METHODS: We conducted a critical analysis based on information from the gray literature of NPHS. This critical analysis was preceded by a review of systematic reviews on barriers and facilitating factors to using ICTs in higher education and a systematic review of ICT use during the COVID-19 pandemic in higher education. An ICT integration model and a clustering of ICT integration factors guided the analysis. RESULTS: The weaknesses and challenges identified relate to the infrastructure and equipment for the use of ICTs in pedagogical situations in face-to-face and distance learning; training of actors, namely the teachers and students; availability of qualified resource persons and adequate and specific financial resources; motivation of teachers; and stage of use of ICTs. CONCLUSIONS: To promote the use of ICTs in teaching at the NPHS, actions must be performed to strengthen the infrastructure and equipment, human resources, the skills of actors and the motivation of teachers in the pedagogical use of ICTs.","Pilabré, Arzouma Hermann; Ngangue, Patrice; Barro, Abibata; Pafadnam, Yacouba",JMIR Med Educ,690,1

Climate-driven drought is one of the main contributing factors to AFI, and timely and appropriate actions can be taken to mitigate impacts of AFI on lives and livelihoods through early warning systems. To support this goal, we use observations of peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of seasonal drought conditions following a rainy season to show that delays in the onset of the rainy season (onset date) can be an effective early indicator of seasonal drought conditions. The core of this study is an evaluation of the relationship of the onset dates and peak NDVI, stratified by AFI risks, calculated using AFI reports by the United States Agency of International Development (USAID)-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Several parts of SSA, mostly located in East Africa (EA), reported the ""Crisis"" phase of AFI-requiring emergency food assistance-at least one-third of the time between April 2011 to present. The results show that the onset date can effectively explain much of the interannual variability in peak NDVI in the regions with the highest AFI risk level, particularly in EA where the median of correlation (across all the Administrative Unit 2) varies between -0.42 to -0.68. In general, an onset date delay of at least 1 dekad (10 days) increases the likelihood of seasonal drought conditions. In the regions with highest risks of AFI, an onset delay of just 1 dekad doubles the chance of the standardized anomaly of peak NDVI being below -1, making a -1 anomaly the most probable outcome. In those regions, a 2-dekads delay in the onset date is associated with a very high probability (50%) of seasonal drought conditions (-1 standardized anomaly of NDVI). Finally, a multivariate regression analysis between standardized anomaly and onset date anomaly further substantiates the negative impacts of delay in onset date on NDVI anomaly. This relationship is statistically significant over the SSA as a whole, particularly in the EA region. These results imply that the onset date can be used as an additional critical tool to provide alerts of seasonal drought development in the most food-insecure regions of SSA. Early warning systems using onset date as a tool can help trigger effective mid-season responses to save human lives, livestock, and livelihoods, and, therefore, mitigate the adverse impacts of drought hazards.","Shukla, Shraddhanand; Husak, Greg; Turner, William; Davenport, Frank; Funk, Chris; Harrison, Laura; Krell, Natasha",PLoS One,690,11

METHODS: A descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study conducted on 258 pregnant women who were hospitalized due to confirmed COVID-19 from March 2020 to January 2021 at the Forghani Hospital in Qom, Iran. Demographic and obstetric characteristics, laboratory findings, and adverse maternal outcomes were recorded from the patients' medical records. The Fisher exact test, one-way analysis of variance, and regression logistics were used to assess the relationship between variables. RESULTS: Of the total study population, 206 (79.8%) pregnant women had mild to moderate disease, 43 (16.7%) had severe disease, and 9 (3.5%) were in the critical stage of the disease. Eight women (3.1%) died and 33 (12.8%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The most important demographic factors associated with the severity of the disease were ethnicity, underlying conditions, maternal age, and parity. The severity of the disease was significantly associated with increased cesarean delivery and admission to the ICU. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with severe and critical disease had a high rate of cesarean delivery and admission to the ICU. There were eight cases of maternal mortality.","Samadi, Parisa; Alipour, Zahra; Ghaedrahmati, Maryam; Ahangari, Roghayeh",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,690,9

A metodologia foi estabelecida com base em estudo prévio usando modelo de elementos finitos de fêmur de bovino para simular fratura estabilizada pela haste proposta. Em um primeiro experimento, a biocompatibilidade do compósito foi avaliada após inserção de um fragmento no tecido subcutâneo de sete ratos Wistar. No segundo experimento, avaliou-se o compósito em forma de haste intramedular em bovinos. Anestesia geral foi induzida em seis bezerros, a fratura foi induzida por incisão oblíqua no terço médio da diáfise, sendo o fêmur imediatamente estabilizado pela inserção retrógrada da haste. O bloqueio ocorreu pela aplicação transversal de quatro parafusos de aço inox, dois aplicados proximais e dois distais à fratura. No primeiro experimento, o compósito considerado aceitável, produzindo irritação discreta. No segundo, cinco dos seis bezerros obtiveram consolidação completa da fratura após 60 dias. Não se observaram sinais de incompatibilidade ou toxidade do compósito. Contudo, algumas limitações foram observadas durante a cirurgia, como dificuldade de perfuração da haste e de se realizar a apara da sobra que excedia o canal medular. Pequenos fragmentos produzidos por essas manobras foram considerados irritantes e associados à ocorrência de seromas no pós-operatório. Também verificou-se que pequenas falhas na haste tinham tendência de se propagar em forma de fraturas longitudinais. Em conclusão, a haste intramedular de resina de poliéster e fibra de vidro (material de baixo custo e fácil aquisição) foi considerada biocompatível e capaz de permitir a consolidação óssea de fraturas femorais em bovinos jovens. Entretanto, o desenvolvimento de soluções para as limitações relatadas se faz necessário antes que seu uso clínico seja recomendado.","JUNIOR, SERGIO DA SILVA ROCHA",,690,16

The transversus abdominis release (TAR) is a versatile and durable solution gaining popularity amongst both abdominal wall specialists and general surgeons. However, several preoperative factors and specific intraoperative pitfalls can have a major impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: The authors review the current literature and draw upon their own practice experience to highlight key preoperative and perioperative steps for avoiding common pitfalls or ""error traps"" often performed by a surgeon new to this surgical technique. RESULTS: We discuss preoperative factors that influence the outcomes of patients undergoing incisional hernia repair. We show how a TAR that preserves the neurovascular bundles supplying the rectus complex and dissection in the correct plane prevents the formation of new, challenging unintended hernia defects and provides for wide prosthetic overlap offering the patient a sustainable repair. Lastly, we highlight key postoperative factors that affect a patient's recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance of surgical error traps combined with technique mastery can lead to the successful repair of challenging abdominal wall defects using the TAR approach.","Kushner, B; Holden, S; Blatnik, J",Hernia,690,20

The synthesis of remdesivir is, however, challenging, and the overall cost is relatively high. Particularly, the stereoselective assembly of the P-chirogenic center requires recrystallization of a 1:1 isomeric p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate mixture several times to obtain the desired diastereoisomer (39%) for further coupling with the d-ribose-derived 5-alcohol. To address this problem, a variety of chiral bicyclic imidazoles were synthesized as organocatalysts for stereoselective (S)-P-phosphoramidation employing a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of phosphoramidoyl chloridates as the coupling reagent to avoid a waste of the other diastereomer. Through a systematic study of different catalysts at different temperatures and concentrations, a mixture of the (S)- and (R)-P-phosphoramidates was obtained in 97% yield with a 96.1/3.9 ratio when 20 mol % of the chiral imidazole-cinnamaldehyde-derived carbamate was utilized in the reaction at -20 °C. A 10-g scale one-pot synthesis via a combination of (S)-P-phosphoramidation and protecting group removal followed by one-step recrystallization gave remdesivir in 70% yield and 99.3/0.7 d.r. The organocatalyst was recovered in 83% yield for reuse, and similar results were obtained. This one-pot process offers an excellent opportunity for industrial production of remdesivir.","Gannedi, Veeranjaneyulu; Villuri, Bharath Kumar; Reddy, Sivakumar N; Ku, Chiao-Chu; Wong, Chi-Huey; Hung, Shang-Cheng",J Org Chem,690,25

Haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC) can expand the volume and provide oxygen for tissues. Vascular leakage is common complication in the process of haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of HBOC (a bovine-derived, cross-linked tetramer haemoglobin oxygen-carrying solution, 0.5 g/L) on vascular leakage in rats after haemorrhagic shock. A haemorrhagic shock rat model and hypoxic vascular endothelial cells (VECs) were used. The role of intercellular junctions and endothelial glycocalyx in the protective effects of HBOC and the relationship with mitochondrial function were analysed. After haemorrhagic shock, the pulmonary vascular permeability to FITC-BSA, Evans Blue was increased, endothelial glycocalyx was destroyed and the expression of intercellular junction proteins was decreased. After haemorrhagic shock, a small volume of HBOC solution (6 ml/kg) protected pulmonary vascular permeability, increased structural thickness of endothelial glycocalyx, the levels of its components and increased expression levels of the intercellular junction proteins ZO-1, VE-cadherin and occludin. Moreover, HBOC significantly increased oxygen delivery and consumption in rats, improved VEC mitochondrial function and structure. In conclusion, HBOC mitigates endothelial leakage by protecting endothelial glycocalyx and intercellular junctions through improving mitochondrial function and tissue oxygen delivery.","Zhao, Hong Liang; Zhang, Jie; Zhu, Yu; Wu, Yue; Yan, Qing Guang; Peng, Xiao Yong; Xiang, Xin Ming; Tian, Kun Lun; Li, Tao; Liu, Liang Ming",Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,690,25

Based on the stress-sensitization theory, we hypothesize that greater historical trauma will predict greater increases in levels of psychological stress from before the onset of the pandemic to after. METHOD: Our analytic sample consisted of 205 AI adults. We measured historical trauma and levels of psychological stress before and after the onset of the pandemic. RESULTS: Using hierarchical regression models controlling for age, biological sex, income, symptoms of depression and anxiety, psychological stress at Time 1, COVID-19 specific stress, and childhood trauma, we found that greater historical trauma preceding the pandemic predicted greater increases in psychological stress (ß = 0.38, t = 5.17 p < .01, &#916;R2 = 0.12), and levels of social support interacted with historical trauma to predict changes in psychological stress (ß = -0.19, t = -3.34, p = .001, &#916;R2 = 0.04). The relationship between historical trauma and changes in stress was significant for individuals with low levels of social support. CONCLUSIONS: Historical trauma may contribute to AI mental health disparities, through heightened psychological stress responses to life stressors and social support appears to moderate this relationship.","John-Henderson, Neha A; Ginty, Annie T",J Psychosom Res,690,1

The pandemic has affected over 200 countries and has become a major concern. India also faced a stiff challenge in terms of controlling the virus outbreak and through some strict measures such as nationwide lockdown was able to control the further spread of COVID-19 towards the latter part of 2020. Therefore, it is imperative to predict the spread of this virus along with causality analysis of parameters that play a significant role in its spread. The present study employs a series of univariate and multivariate time series forecasting techniques namely MSARIMA, ARMAX and extended VAR models to predict COVID-19 cases in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. Besides, providing a robust forecasting performance for COVID-19 cases, the study also deals with finding the causal relationship of the spread of COVID-19 with various mobility and weather parameters. Outcomes of our study establish that the spread of COVID-19 can be associated with mobility and weather parameters apart from the various precautions that are taken by the people to reduce community transmission. However, the type of mobility (residential, retail and workplace) and type of weather conditions (air quality, temperature and humidity) associated with the causality differ with cities. For New Delhi, air quality, residential, retail are the parameters affecting the spread of the COVID-19 cases, whereas masks, temperature, residential and workplace were the significant mobility and weather parameters for Mumbai. In addition, for Bengaluru, the statistically significant causal variables were air quality, masks and residential. Outcomes of this study would help the concerned authorities to predict and contain future COVID-19 spreads in Indian cities efficiently.","Krishna, Aditya",Vision,690,16

A comparison of results from different data sources is important to increase understanding of the data and to further optimise current and future surveillance. We compared results from the three data sources from March to June 2020. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We analysed the number of new admissions, as well as the total number of hospitalised patients and those on ventilatory support, reported per day and by regional health authority. The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: The cumulative number of new admissions according to NPR-MSIS (n=1260) was higher than NIPaR (n=1153). The discrepancy was high early in the epidemic (93 as of 29 March). The trend in the number of hospitalised patients was similar for all three sources throughout the study period. NPR-MSIS overestimated the number of hospitalised patients on ventilatory support. INTERPRETATION: The discrepancy in new admissions between NIPaR and NPR-MSIS is primarily due to missing registrations for some patients admitted before NIPaR became operational. Basic information retrieved daily by the Directorate of Health give comparable results to more comprehensive daily information retrieval undertaken in NIPaR and NPR-MSIS, adjusted retrospectively. Further analysis is necessary regarding whether NIPaR and NPR-MSIS provide timely data and function as required in an emergency preparedness situation.","Whittaker, Robert; Grøsland, Mari; Buanes, Eirik Alnes; Beitland, Sigrid; Bryhn, Bente; Helgeland, Jon; Sjøflot, Olav Isak; Berild, Jacob Dag; Seppälä, Elina; Tønnessen, Ragnhild; Telle, Kjetil",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,690,26

Hyponatremia has been associated with a worse outcome in several pathologic conditions The main objective of this study was to determine whether serum sodium alterations may be independent predictors of the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design and methods: In this observational study, data from 441 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a University Hospital were collected. After excluding 61 patients (no serum sodium at admission available, saline solution infusion before sodium assessment, transfer from another hospital), data from 380 patients were analyzed. Results: 274 (72.1%) patients had normonatremia at admission, 87 (22.9%) patients had hyponatremia and 19 (5%) patients had hypernatremia. We found an inverse correlation between serum sodium and IL-6, whereas a direct correlation between serum sodium and PaO2/FiO2 ratio was observed. Patients with hyponatremia had a higher prevalence of non-invasive ventilation and ICU transfer than those with normonatremia or hypernatremia. Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (2.7-fold increase vs normonatremia) and each mEq/L of serum sodium reduction was associated with a 14.4% increased risk of death. Conclusions: These results suggest that serum sodium at admission may be considered as an early prognostic marker of disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Berni, Andrea; Malandrino, Danilo; Corona, Giovanni; Maggi, Mario; Parenti, Gabriele; Fibbi, Benedetta; Poggesi, Loredana; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Lavorini, Federico; Fanelli, Andrea; Scocchera, Giulia; Nozzoli, Carlo; Peris, Adriano; Pieralli, Filippo; Pini, Riccardo; Ungar, Andrea; Peri, Alessandro",Eur J Endocrinol,690,6

In Scotland, lockdown measures during the first wave of the pandemic commenced on 23rd March 2020 and only began to ease after 29th May 2020. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and type of referrals made to the adult psychiatric liaison nursing service (PLNS) at University Hospital Hairmyres, NHS Lanarkshire.MethodWe collated all of the archived referrals made by our local emergency department to the PLNS at University Hospital Hairmyres for adults (aged 18–65 years) during the period of the first COVID-19 national lockdown (April-July 2020) and the corresponding period one-year prior (April-July 2019) to analyse differences in referral numbers and demographics. Additionally, for referrals made during 2020, we conducted a qualitative review of electronic records to determine the reason for referral, contributory stressors to presentation, and in particular any effect from COVID-19.ResultA total of 549 referrals were made over the study period, with 320 in 2019 and 229 in 2020, a decrease of almost 30%. In 2019, referrals fell each month from April (n = 89) to July (n = 74), while this trend was reversed in 2020, rising from April (n = 45) to near-usual levels by July (n = 68). Compared to baseline, referrals in April 2020 were for a higher proportion of men (62.2%). On qualitative analysis, 26 records (11.3%) could not be found. Otherwise, the most common reasons for referral were suicidal ideation (43.3%) and/or deliberate self-harm (39.9%). Many patients presented with comorbid substance misuse (54.2%) and the majority were not known to community services (64.5%). COVID-19 was implicated in 48 referrals (23.6%), but only 2 of these arose as a direct result of infection.ConclusionWe have observed clear differences in the pattern of referrals made to the adult PLNS during the first COVID-19 national lockdown. COVID-19 was implicated in a minority of referrals, but most were related to secondary effects of lockdown restrictions rather than COVID-19 infection. Possible reasons for fewer referrals during this time could be non-presentation through fears of contracting COVID-19 or altruistic avoidance of putting “pressure on the NHS”. Further studies would be insightful;in particular, equivalent analysis of contacts with community services;and qualitative patient perspectives regarding reasons for non-presentation during this time.","Paton, Cristina Hills James Hegde Rekha",BJPsych Open,690,16

Purpose: As bone and mineral conditions are seen by a variety of specialists there is a close connection with the European Registries for Rare Endocrine Conditions (EuRRECa) and its affiliated ERN Rare Endocrine Diseases (Endo-ERN). EuRR-Bone is open not only to centres within these ERNs but also to others and consists of a core registry for all cases and an e-reporting registry for new cases. Methods: The latter is accomplished via an electronic reporting platform, e-REC (e-Reporting of Rare Conditions), a light touch approach that does not collect personally identifiable information. Unique IDs for reported cases are generated instantaneously and emailed to users to be stored locally at reporting centres. Data are available to all collaborators following approval by the joint Data Access Committee of EuRRECa and EuRR-Bone. Results: Until July 2020, 12 centres from 9 different countries joined, of which 5 are ERN BOND members and 10 are Endo-ERN members.

We aimed to assess outbreak-related psychological distress and symptoms of acute stress reaction (ASR) in health professional students and to characterize individuals with potential need for interventions. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1442 health professional students at Sichuan University, China. At baseline (October 2019), participants were assessed for childhood adversity, stressful life events, internet addiction, and family functioning. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations of the above exposures with subsequent psychological distress and ASR in response to the outbreak. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-four (26.63%) participants demonstrated clinically significant psychological distress, while 160 (11.10%) met the criterion for a probable ASR. Individuals who scored high on both childhood adversity and stressful life event experiences during the past year were at increased risks of both distress (ORs 2.00-2.66) and probable ASR (ORs 2.23-3.10), respectively. Moreover, internet addiction was associated with elevated risks of distress (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.60-2.64) and probable ASR (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.50-3.10). By contrast, good family functioning was associated with decreased risks of distress (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55) and probable ASR (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69). All associations were independent of baseline psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 related psychological distress and high symptoms burden of ASR are common among health professional students. Extended family and professional support should be considered for vulnerable individuals during these unprecedented times.","Li, Yuchen; Wang, Yue; Jiang, Jingwen; Valdimarsdóttir, Unnur A; Fall, Katja; Fang, Fang; Song, Huan; Lu, Donghao; Zhang, Wei",Psychol Med,690,31

However, its mathematical optimization, especially finding when and how much of the population should be transported, is still a fundamental unresolved issue. We propose a new impulse control framework to tackle this issue based on a simple but new stochastic growth model of individual fishes. The novel growth model governing individuals' body weights uses a Wright-Fisher model as a latent driver to reproduce plausible growth dynamics. The optimization problem is formulated as an impulse control problem of a cost-benefit functional constrained by a degenerate parabolic Fokker-Planck equation of the stochastic growth dynamics. Because the growth dynamics have an observable variable and an unobservable variable (a variable difficult or impossible to observe), we consider both full-information and partial-information cases. The latter is more involved but more realistic because of not explicitly using the unobservable variable in designing the controls. In both cases, resolving an optimization problem reduces to solving the associated Fokker-Planck and its adjoint equations, the latter being non-trivial. We present a derivation procedure of the adjoint equation and its internal boundary conditions in time to efficiently derive the optimal transporting strategy.

It is important to train nursing students on GBV, especially in vulnerable situations, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of our study is to explore the perceptions of third-year nursing students about simulated nursing video consultations for providing assistance to potential cases of GBV victims using a high-fidelity clinical simulation methodology. After all of the simulated scenarios were completed, 48 scripted interviews were carried out following a guide composed of four open-ended questions to facilitate in-depth discussion. A descriptive qualitative study based on the interpretative paradigm was conducted. The nursing students indicated that they improved their knowledge on GBV victim management (mainly their awareness of the problem, recognition of the role of nursing professionals, and performance of non-technical skills), although they also mentioned the need for continuous training (particularly in socio-emotional skills, interview techniques, a holistic nursing care approach, and not presupposing). This innovative high-fidelity simulation methodology allows nursing students to improve their awareness of the GBV problem, acquire a realistic view about their role in addressing GBV, and build their non-technical skills (such as active listening, communication skills, empathy, and generating confidence) required to adequately care for victims of GBV.","Jiménez-Rodríguez, Diana; Belmonte García, María Teresa; Santillán García, Azucena; Plaza Del Pino, Fernando Jesús; Ponce-Valencia, Alicia; Arrogante, Oscar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),690,21

It is well documented that troponin predicts the prognosis of patients. Myoglobin is not only an important marker of myocardial injury, but it indicates systemic muscle damage. However, its relationship with COVID-19 was rarely reported. The present study compared the predictive value of troponin and myoglobin on the final prognosis of COVID-19 patients by analyzing the clinical characteristics and serum levels of myoglobin and troponin in severe/critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We enrolled 499 consecutive eligible hospitalized patients with severe/critical COVID-19 from February 14 to March 24, 2020 at Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected and compared between the patients who died and survived. We analyzed the receiver operating characteristic curves of myoglobin and troponin. Then, the patients were divided into myo+ group, myo- group, tro+ group, and tro- group, and survival curves were analyzed. The prognostic predictable values of myoglobin and troponin were further analyzed using Cox multifactorial analysis. RESULTS: Myoglobin and troponin were significantly elevated in the death group (134.4 [interquartile range (IQR) 24.80, 605] vs 38.02 [IQR 3.87, 11.73]ng/ml, p<0.001), and troponin was also significantly elevated in the death group (0.01 [IQR 0.01, 0.01] vs 0.04 [IQR 0.02, 0.15]ng/ml, p<0.001). The ROC curves demonstrated that the area under the curve when using myoglobin to predict patient death was 0.911, with a threshold of 1.17, which was equivalent to troponin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly lower survival curve in the myo+ group than the myo- group. Multifactor Cox survival analysis showed that troponin was no longer significant (HR=0.98, 95% CI 0.92-1.03, p=0.507), but elevated myoglobin was an independent predictor of death in COVID-19 patients (HR=1.001, 95% CI 1.001-1.002, p<0.001). The analysis of the Cox model for predicting patient death and plotting decision curves suggested that the single factor myoglobin model was superior to troponin, and the predictive value of the multifactor model was superior to the single-factor analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, myoglobin and troponin were predictors of mortality and the probability of conversion to critical illness, and myoglobin may be superior to troponin for predictive value.","Zhu, Feng; Li, Weifeng; Lin, Qiuhai; Xu, Mengdan; Du, Jiang; Li, Hongli",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),690,25

In order to reduce the diffusion of the current""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)""pandemic, the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can play an important role; for instance, they can be effectively used for implementing a real-time patient tracking and warning system at a city scale. Crucial places to install the tracking IoT devices are the public/private vehicles that, augmented with multiple connectivity solutions, can implement the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm. In such a ubiquitous network environment, vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors, including regular cameras that can be replaced with thermal cameras. Therefore, this paper proposes a new design for widely detecting respiratory viral diseases that leverages IoV to collect real-time body temperature and breathing rate measurements of pedestrians. This information can be used to recognize geographic areas affected by possible COVID-19 cases and to implement proactive preventive strategies that would further limit the spread of the disease.","Sahraoui, Yesin; Korichi, Ahmed; Kerrache, Chaker Abdelaziz; Bilal, Muhammad; Amadeo, Marica",,690,22

Currently, this information is often derived from an empirical model (Henssge's nomogram) describing posthumous body cooling under standard conditions. However, nonstandard conditions necessitate the use of subjective correction factors or preclude the use of Henssge's nomogram altogether. To address this, we developed a powerful method for early PMI reconstruction using skin thermometry in conjunction with a comprehensive thermodynamic finite-difference model, which we validated using deceased human bodies. PMIs reconstructed using this approach, on average, deviated no more than ±38 minutes from their corresponding true PMIs (which ranged from 5 to 50 hours), significantly improving on the ±3 to ±7 hours uncertainty of the gold standard. Together, these aspects render this approach a widely applicable, i.e., forensically relevant, method for thermometric early PMI reconstruction.","Wilk, Leah S; Hoveling, Richelle J M; Edelman, Gerda J; Hardy, Huub J J; van Schouwen, Sebastiaan; van Venrooij, Harry; Aalders, Maurice C G",Sci.

The study used an insider action research design. There were two arms of the study, faculty and student. Ten faculty-led learning circles with four faculty and three family nurse practitioner student focus groups, each with six students, were held over the course of the study. Thematic findings were developed from both student and faculty data. The results revealed that family nurse practitioner students had a positive attitude toward FL. Many expressed FL provided perceptions of gained confidence, personalized learning, increased engagement, and preparedness for classroom instruction. Overall, faculty preferred FL over traditional teaching approaches. Several active learning activities were used by faculty with clinical case studies being the most preferred by student participants. This study confirms FL is a plausible and promising approach to traditional classroom instruction. However, more robust studies are needed to determine its benefits in advanced practice nursing education.","Murphy, Nancy; Strong, Caron; Jones, Gloria",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),690,24

Online teaching has suddenly become the main form of medical education, a form that may be used as long as the pandemic continues. We aimed at analyzing how online teaching was perceived by both teachers and learners to help determine how to adapt curricula in the next few years. An anonymous cross-sectional survey of medical students, pediatric residents, neonatal fellows, and their respective teachers was conducted between June and August 2020 to assess feelings about quality, attendance, equivalence, and sustainability of online teaching programs. 146 Students and 26 teachers completed the survey. 89% of students agreed that the offered online teaching was an appropriate way of teaching during the pandemic. Less than half of learners and teachers felt they have received or provided a training of an equivalent level and quality as in usual courses. About one-third thought that this online teaching should continue after the crisis ends. Medical school students had significantly more mixed opinions on online teaching than residents and fellows did. Attendance of learners significantly improved with synchronous online classes (p < 0.001), and among more advanced learners (p < 0.002).

INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Homeopathy: 1 globule of Natrum muriaticum LM2 diluted in 20 mL of alcohol 30% and dispensed in a 30 ml bottle. Placebo: 20 mL of alcohol 30% dispensed in a 30 ml bottle. Posology: one drop taken orally every 4 hours (6 doses/day) while there is fever, cough, tiredness, or pain (headache, sore throat, muscle aches, chest pain, etc.) followed by one drop every 6 hours (4 doses/day) until the fourteenth day of use. The bottle of study medication should be submitted to 10 vigorous shakes (succussions) before each dose. Posology may be changed by telemedicine, with no break in blinding. Study medication should be maintained during home isolation. According to the Primary Care protocol, the home isolation period lasts until the 10th day after the appearance of the first symptom, or up to 72 hours without symptoms. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint will be time to recovery, defined as the number of days elapsed before all COVID-19 Influenza-like symptoms are recorded as mild or absent during home isolation period. Secondary measures are recovery time for each COVID-19 symptom; score of the scale created for the study (COVID-Simile Scale); medicines used during follow-up; number of days of follow-up; number of visits to emergency services; number of hospitalizations; other symptoms and Adverse Events during home isolation period. RANDOMISATION: The study Statistician generated a block randomization list, using a 1:1 ratio of the two groups (denoted as A and B) and a web-based tool ( http://www.random.org/lists ). BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical investigators, the statistician, the Primary Care teams, the study collaborators, and the participants will remain blinded from the identity of the two treatment groups until the end of the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): One hundred participants are planned to be randomized (1:1) to placebo (50) or homeopathy (50). TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version/date May 21, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing. First participant was recruited/included on June 29,2020. Due to recruitment adaptations to Primary Care changes, the authors anticipate the trial will finish recruiting on April 10, 2021.

METHODS: We performed a scoping review on PubMed, Cochrane, the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Clinical Trial Register, and the Grey Literature Repository databases, to identify reports on viral transmission via surgical smoke or aerosolisation. A systematic review of all available national and international guidelines was also performed to report their recommendations. Additionally, a worldwide transdisciplinary survey was performed to capture the actual compliance to dedicated guidelines and their impact on MIS activity. RESULTS: Based on a selection of 17 studies, there was no evidence to support the concerns of an intraoperative viral transmission via pneumoperitoneum aerosolisation. Most national surgical and urological societies either did address this topic or referred to international guidelines. The guidelines of the American College of Surgery, the Royal College of Surgeons, and the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section, recommended an avoidance of MIS due to an increased risk of intraoperative aerosol-enhanced transmission. The results of the survey completed by 334 respondents, from different surgical abdominal specialties, suggested a lack of compliance with the guidelines. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a dissonance between contemporary guidelines and ongoing surgical activity, possibly due to the perceived lack of evidence. Recommendations regarding changes in clinical practice should be based on the best available research evidence and experience. A scoping review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms together with a survey showed that laparoscopic procedures do not seem to increase the risk of viral transmission. Nevertheless, the few publications and low quality of existing evidence limits the validity of the review.","Mun, Dong-Ho; Pradere, Benjamin; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Remzi, Mesut",BJU int,690,24

METHODS: Data collection was performed on a retrospective cohort of patients surgically treated for primary HNC between March and May 2020, using data from two tertiary hospitals: the European Institute of Oncology (Milan) and Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London). RESULTS: We included 77 patients with HNC. More patients with COVID-19 were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and had Clavien-Dindo Classification grade I compared to negative patients, respectively (60% vs 22% [p = 0.058] and 40% vs 8% [p = 0.025]). Multivariate logistic regression analyses confirmed our data (p = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Sex and age were statistically significantly different (p = 0.05 and <0.001 respectively), showing more male patients (75% vs 53.66%, respectively) and more elderly patients in Italy than in the United Kingdom (patients aged >63 years: 69.44% vs 29.27%). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a large cohort of patients with HNC with nasopharyngeal swab during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Patients with HNC with COVID-19 appeared more likely to develop postsurgical complications and to be taking ACE inhibitors. The preventive measures adopted guaranteed the continuation of therapeutic surgical intervention.","Tagliabue, Marta; Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; De Berardinis, Rita; Chu, Francesco; Jeannon, Jean-Pierre; Pietrobon, Giacomo; Haire, Anna; Grosso, Enrica; Wylie, Harriet; Zorzi, Stefano; Proh, Michele; Brunet-Garcia, Aina; Cattaneo, Augusto; Oakley, Richard; De Benedetto, Luigi; Arora, Asit; Riccio, Stefano; Fry, Alistair; Bruschini, Roberto; Townley, William; Giugliano, Gioacchino; Orfaniotis, Georgios; Madini, Marzia; Dolly, Saoirse; Borghi, Ester; Aprile, Danila; Zurlo, Valeria; Bibiano, Debora; Mastrilli, Fabrizio; Chiocca, Susanna; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke; Gandini, Sara; Simo, Ricard; Ansarin, Mohssen",Tumori,690,20

While states had broadly the same information about the virus at the start of the crisis, responses were very different. What caused such disparity in policy actions and outcomes? While various factors may account for divergent responses, we highlight the importance of narratives employed by key policy actors. First, we review the literature on policy narratives. We suggest it can be usefully augmented with consideration of localisation and public justification. We apply this augmented framework using case studies of Germany and the United Kingdom. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s narrative was more successful at persuading German citizens to embrace government policies to counter COVID-19 than was Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s in the United Kingdom. This difference held important implications for policy outcomes in each country. We conclude by discussing the benefits of this augmented approach to analysis of policy narratives.

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multicenter, open-label 2-arm (1:1 ratio) randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients will be recruited from 3 hospitals in Wenzhou China: the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and Wenzhou Center Hospital. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria 1. Participants are 18-85 years of age, either male or female. 2. Diagnosed as positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3. Symptomatic. Mild (mild clinical symptoms without signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray) and Moderate (fever or respiratory symptom with signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray) . 1. Signed the informed consent before treatment. 2. Agreed not to enroll in any other clinical trials. 3. Inpatients Exclusion criteria 1. < 18 or > 85 years old. 2. Pregnancy and lactation. 3. Serious heart, liver, kidney and hematopoietic system diseases, abnormal liver or kidney function. 4. Suffering from other known virus pneumonia. 5. Allergic to Chinese herbal medicine or suffering from allergies. 6. Critical patients (respiratory failure treated by mechanical ventilation or shock or multiple organ failure). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the control group will receive routine supportive clinically care including the therapies of anti-viral, anti-bacterial and ameliorating the related symptoms, while patients in TCM group will be asked to take maxingshigan-weijing decoction (composed of 14 Chinese herbal medicines), orally 200 mL 2 times daily, for 14 consecutive days in addition to routine supportive care as mentioned above. Maxingshigan-weijing decoction consists of 10 g of Herba Ephedra (Mahuang), 10 g of Amygdalus Communis Vas (Xingren), 45 g of Gypsum Fibrosum (Shigao), 30 g of Rhizoma phragmitis (Lugen), 20 g of Peach kernel (Taoren), 20 g of Winter Melon kernel (Dongguaren), 30 g of Trichosanthes Kirilowii Maxim (Gualou), 12 g of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chenpi), 12 g of Rhizoma Pinelliae (Jiangbanxia), 12 g of caulis bambusae in taeniis (Zhuru), 30 g of semen lepidii (Tingliz), 15 g of semen lepidii (Shichangpu), 10 g of curcuma zedoary (ezhu) and 5 g of Radix Glycyrrhizae (Gancao). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be the number of days until the clinical symptom of fever improves in the first 14 days of treatment following randomisation. Fever will be defined as an improvement when the temperature is less than 37°C. Secondary outcomes will be TCM Syndrome Scores, the time it takes until individuals have negative test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, the proportion of cases with chest X-ray improvements and the rate of symptom (fever, cough, malaise, shortness of breath) recovery. TCM Syndrome Scoring System is a checklist covering 4 main, 7 secondary and 13 accompanying items. The 4 main items consisting of fever, cough, malaise and shortness of breath, use a four-point scale (0, 2, 4 and 6) depending on the severity; the 7 secondary items including dysphoria, diarrhea, pharyngalgia, expectoration, muscular soreness, nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea use 0-3-point scale; the 13 accompanying items contain chest pain, headache, aversion to cold, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, abdominal distension, dry mouth, anxiety, spontaneous sweating, insomnia, wheezing and blood tinged sputum, and each item is rated on 0-1 scale ( 0 stands for asymptomatic, 1 stands for symptomatic ). The total scores sum up to a range from 0 to 58, with higher scores indicating more severe levels of disease. RANDOMIZATION: Minimization method will be used, balancing the two arms for pneumonia severity. Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group. Clinical researchers will get a random sequence number which is automatically generated by a random number generator (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and sequentially number them in an opaque envelope. Researchers will open random allocation envelopes and assign participants accordingly. Eligible patients will be randomly divided into a routine supportive care group and a routine supportive care plus oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine group, with 70 patients in each group. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label study. The statistical analysis will be carried out by the Professor of Statistics at Wenzhou Medical University, who is blinded to patient allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The previous study reported the efficacy of TCM for COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza patients, the median survival time in the TCM group is estimated as 3 days; this time will be 1.5 times longer in the control group. Accordingly, Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test will be used. And assuming a statistical power of 70% (one-sided type-1 error of &#945; = 5%, ß = 30%) and a rate of withdrawal and loss to follow-up of 10%, we plan to include 140 participants in both groups ( TCM group = 70, control group = 70).

A 24 years old patient, recently exposed to measles (unvaccinated), presented in the emergency department with severe agitation, compatible with an acute psychotic episode, during the measles epidemic which spread in Israel in 2018-2019. Upon hospital admission, strict isolation was instructed, yet, without compliance, probably due to the patient's status. Measles diagnosis was promptly confirmed. As measles transmission was eminent, public health measures were employed through immediate implementation of the section 15 of the Public Health Ordinance, allowing for compulsory short-term isolation. The patient's condition improved within a few days and the measures were no longer necessary. This measles case occurred in the pre-Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic when use of a Public Health Ordinance was considered an extreme measure. This is in contrast to the current global use of Public Health laws to enforce strict quarantine and isolation on persons infected or potentially exposed to COVID-19. Nevertheless, minimizing infectious diseases transmission is a core function of public health law. Utilizing legal enforcement in circumstances of immediate public health hazard, such as nosocomial measles transmission, necessitates careful consideration. The integrative clinical and public health approach and prompt measures employed in this exceptional case, led to prevention of further infection spread.","Stein-Zamir, Chen; Abramson, Nitza; Sonnenfeld-Alroey, Hagit; Charnes, Jacob; Eckstein, Dana; Dienstag, Aryeh; Wolf, Dana; Moses, Allon E; Weiss, Yoram G",Isr J Health Policy Res,690,26

We aimed to compare the mortality rates in COVID-19 patients who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) and those who did not. In this retrospective cohort study, mortality was considered as the main outcome measure. All underlying diseases were assessed by the chronic use of medications related to each condition. We defined two main groups based on the ACEIs/ARBs administration. A logistic regression model was designed to define independent predictors of mortality as well as a Cox regression analysis. In total, 2553 patients were included in this study. The mortality frequency was higher in patients with a history of underlying diseases (22.4% vs 12.7%, P value < 0.001). The mortality rate in patients who received ACEIs/ARBs were higher than non-receivers (29.3% vs. 19.5%, P value = 0.013, OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.7) in the univariate analysis. However, the use of ACEIs/ARBs was a protective factor against mortality in the model when adjusted for underlying conditions, length of stay, age, gender, and ICU admission (P value < 0.001, OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed an overall survival of approximately 85.7% after a 120-day follow-up. ACEIs/ARBs are protective factors against mortality in COVID-19 patients with HTN, and these agents can be considered potential therapeutic options in this disease. The survival probability is higher in ACEIs/ARBs receivers than non-receivers.","Yahyavi, Ashkan; Hemmati, Nima; Derakhshan, Pegah; Banivaheb, Behrooz; Karimi Behnagh, Arman; Tofighi, Rozhin; TehraniYazdi, Alireza; Kabir, Ali",Intern. emerg. med,690,16

The Distress Thermometer is a short screening tool developed for use in oncology, to detect individuals who would benefit from further psychological assessment. However the optimal cut-off to detect indicative psychological morbidity in patients with advanced cancer receiving specialist palliative care is unclear. AIM: To provide the first validation of the Distress Thermometer in an advanced cancer population receiving specialist palliative care in a UK hospice setting. DESIGN: Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of cut-offs indicative of psychological morbidity on the Distress Thermometer in comparison to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Data were derived from 202 patients with advanced cancer who were approached on admission to inpatient or day hospice care, with 139 patients providing complete data on both measures. RESULTS: The area under the curve was optimal using a Distress Thermometer cut-off score of â©¾6 for total distress and for anxiety, and a cut-off score of â©¾4 optimal when screening for depression. CONCLUSIONS: The Distress Thermometer is a valid, accurate screening tool to be used in advanced cancer but with caution in relation to the lack of specificity. With little variation between the area under the curve scores, arguably a Distress Thermometer cut-off score of â©¾5 is most appropriate in screening for all types of psychological morbidity if sensitivity is to be prioritised.","Graham-Wisener, Lisa; Dempster, Martin; Sadler, Aaroon; McCann, Luke; McCorry, Noleen K",Palliat Med,690,1

Despite relevant management guidelines, the way in which cancer care has been affected has yet to be described for thoracic surgical populations. Routine lung cancer physiologic and staging assessments are unique in that they are droplet producing and aerosolizing procedures. Our objective was to quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical lung cancer care as perceived by practicing thoracic surgeons during the first wave of the pandemic in Canada. METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to members of the Canadian Association of Thoracic Surgeons. The survey was designed to determine surgeon perception of lung cancer preoperative care during the Canadian pandemic-instilled period of resource reallocation compared to standard care. Planned analyses were exploratory in nature; with count and frequency distributions of responses quantified. RESULTS: Fifty-three thoracic surgeons completed the survey. Responses were collected from all Canadian provinces. Little change in access to preoperative imaging was noted. However, a significant decrease in access to lung function and bronchoscopy testing occurred. Pulmonary surgery was perceived to be lengthier with reduced operating theater availability. Despite decreased OR access, only 40% of surgeons were aware of respective institutional mitigation strategies. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on standard lung cancer care preoperative workup. Further inquiry using institutional data is warranted to quantify its impact on cancer patient outcomes. Assessing the extent and effects of newly present barriers to standard lung cancer care is essential in forming appropriate mitigation strategies and planning for future pandemic waves.","Hilzenrat, Roy A; Deen, Shaun A; Yee, John; Grant, Kyle A; Ashrafi, Ahmad S; Coughlin, Shaun; McGuire, Anna L",Curr Oncol,690,26

Health care-initiated Twitter hashtags regarding major public health topics have gained national attention, but their content has not been systematically examined. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that Twitter discourse on two epidemics (firearm injury and COVID-19) would differ between tweets with health care-initiated hashtags (#ThisIsOurLane and #GetUsPPE) versus those with non-health care-initiated hashtags (#GunViolence and #COVID19). METHODS: Using natural language processing, we compared content, affect, and authorship of a random 1% of tweets using #ThisIsOurLane (Nov 2018-Oct 2019) and #GetUsPPE (March-May 2020), compared to #GunViolence and #COVID19 tweets, respectively. We extracted the relative frequency of single words and phrases and created two sets of features: (1) an open-vocabulary feature set to create 50 data-driven-determined word clusters to evaluate the content of tweets; and (2) a closed-vocabulary feature for psycholinguistic categorization among case and comparator tweets. In accordance with conventional linguistic analysis, we used a P<.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, to identify potentially meaningful correlations between language features and outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 67% (n=4828) ofâ¯#ThisIsOurLane tweets and 36.6% (n=7907) of #GetUsPPE tweets were authored by health care professionals, compared to 16% (n=1152) of #GunViolence and 9.8% (n=2117) of #COVID19 tweets. Tweets using #ThisIsOurLane and #GetUsPPE were more likely to contain health care-specific language; more language denoting positive emotions, affiliation, and group identity; and more action-oriented content compared to tweets with #GunViolence or #COVID19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tweets with health care-led hashtags expressed more positivity and more action-oriented language than the comparison hashtags.

RESULT: In this study, 5 genes of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MKK) and 16 genes of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MPK) in Camellia sinensis were found through a genome-wide search taking Arabidopsis thaliana as the reference genome. Also, phylogenetic relationships along with structural analysis which includes gene structure, location as well as protein conserved motifs and domains, were systematically examined and further, predictions were validated by the results. The plant species taken for comparative study clearly displayed segmental duplication, which was a significant candidate for MAPK cascade expansion. Also, functional interaction was carried out in C. sinensis based on the orthologous genes in Arabidopsis. The expression profiles linked to various stress treatments revealed wide involvement of MAPK and MAPKK genes from Tea in response to various abiotic factors. In addition, the expression of these genes was analysed in various tissues.

METHODS: Using retrospective data from January-June 2020, compared to a similar 2019 period, we calculated weekly 2020-2019 ratios of Non-COVID-19 ED visits for adults and children (age 18 years or less) by age range. Outcomes were pediatric ED visit rates before and after the onset of pandemic, by age, disposition, and diagnosis. RESULTS: We included data from 2,213,828 visits to 144 EDs and 4 urgent care centers in 18 U.S. states, including 7 EDs in children's hospitals. During the pandemic period, adult non-COVID-19 visits declined to 60% of 2019 volumes and then partially recovered but remained below 2019 levels through June 2020. Pediatric visits declined even more sharply, with peak declines through the week of April 15 of 74% for children age < 10 years and 67% for 14-17 year. Visits recovered by June to 72% for children age 14-17, but to only 50% of 2019 levels for children < age 10 years. Declines were seen across all ED types and locations, and across all diagnoses, with an especially sharp decline in non-COVID-19 communicable diseases. During the pandemic period, there was 22% decline in common serious pediatric conditions, including appendicitis. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED visits fell more sharply than adult ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and remained depressed through June 2020, especially for younger children. Declines were also seen for serious conditions, suggesting that parents may have avoided necessary care for their children.","Pines, Jesse M; Zocchi, Mark S; Black, Bernard S; Carlson, Jestin N; Celedon, Pablo; Moghtaderi, Ali; Venkat, Arvind",Am. j. emerg. med,690,21

It manifests as high blood pressure and proteinuria in women at more than 20 weeks of gestation. Abnormal levels of anti- and pro-angiogenesis factors are known to be associated with PE. In the present study, we aimed to determine the localisation of angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) in the placenta and to compare the expression levels of AGGF1 in the third-trimester placentas of preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Placental tissue samples were collected from women with PE (n = 28) and without PE (n = 28). The normotensive controls without PE were matched for gestational age at delivery with the patients with PE. The expression levels of AGGF1 in the placental tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. RESULTS: The immunoexpression of AGGF1 was localised in the syncytiotrophoblast tissue. Notable, the mRNA and protein expression levels of AGGF1 were decreased in preeclamptic placentas as compared with the normotensive control group (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the decreased AGGF1 in preeclamptic placentas may be related to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.","An, Lan-Fen; Chi, Shu-Qi; Zhang, Jun; Wang, Hong-Bo; Ouyang, Wei-Xiang",Folia Histochem Cytobiol,690,24

Therefore, the objective of this review was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of IgG and IgM based point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLIA), fluorescence enzyme-linked immunoassay (FIA) and ELISA systems that detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Medline complete and MedRxiv. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 were eligible. Study selection and data-extraction were performed by two authors independently. QUADAS-2 checklist tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The bivariate model and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve model were performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the serological tests. Subgroup meta-analysis was performed to explore the heterogeneity. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 17), IgM (n = 16) and IgG-IgM (n = 24) based LFIA tests were 0.5856, 0.4637 and 0.6886, respectively compared to rRT-PCR method. The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 9) and IgM (n = 10) based CLIA tests were 0.9311 and 0.8516, respectively compared to rRT-PCR. The pooled sensitivity the IgG (n = 10), IgM (n = 11) and IgG-IgM (n = 5) based ELISA tests were 0.8292, 0.8388 and 0.8531 respectively compared to rRT-PCR. All tests displayed high specificities ranging from 0.9693 to 0.9991. Amongst the evaluated tests, IgG based CLIA expressed the highest sensitivity signifying its accurate detection of the largest proportion of infections identified by rRT-PCR. ELISA and CLIA tests performed better in terms of sensitivity compared to LFIA. IgG based tests performed better compared to IgM except for the ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: We report that IgG-IgM based ELISA tests have the best overall diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type independently. Given the poor performances of the current LFIA devices, there is a need for more research on the development of highly sensitivity and specific POC LFIA that are adequate for most individual patient applications and attractive for large sero-prevalence studies.

The changes in the column averages are substantial in a few places of the model global grid, but the induced gradients are most often less than the random errors of the retrievals. The current necessity to restrict the quality-assured column retrievals to almost cloud-free areas appears to be a major obstacle in identifying changes in CO2 emissions. Indeed, large changes have occurred in the presence of clouds and, in places that were cloud-free in 2020, the comparison with previous years is hampered by different cloud conditions during these years. We therefore recommend to favor all-weather CO2 monitoring systems, at least in situ, to support international efforts to reduce emissions.","Chevallier, Frédéric; Zheng, Bo; Broquet, Grégoire; Ciais, Philippe; Liu, Zhu; Davis, Steven J; Deng, Zhu; Wang, Yilong; Bréon, François-Marie; O039,; Dell, Christopher W",Geophys Res Lett,690,17

Among its major functions are conservation of energy during starvation, recycling organelles, and turnover of long-lived proteins. Besides, autophagy plays a critical role in removing intracellular pathogens and very likely represents a primordial intrinsic cellular defence mechanism. More recent findings indicate that it has not only retained its ability to degrade intracellular pathogens, but also functions to augment and fine tune antiviral immune responses. Interestingly, viruses have also co-evolved strategies to manipulate this pathway and use it to their advantage. Particularly intriguing is infection-dependent activation of autophagy with positive stranded (+)RNA virus infections, which benefit from the pathway without succumbing to lysosomal degradation. In this review we summarise recent data on viral manipulation of autophagy, with a particular emphasis on +RNA viruses and highlight key unanswered questions in the field that we believe merit further attention.","Wong, Ho Him; Sanyal, Sumana",Semin.

The latest employment is the utilisation of drones during the global pandemic for crowd dispersal, infection monitoring, facial recognition, and logistical roles. Drones with artificial intelligence are unique devices that enhance the economy and are capable of completing tasks that humans cannot. The issue is that companies have disregarded the security of these machines, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Furthermore, a compromised drone can be used as a malicious offensive weapon system for tasks such as illegal imagery, videography, and as a functioning autonomous weapon system. This paper critically analyses the amalgamation of drones and artificial intelligence, reviews the current threat landscape, and studies drone vulnerabilities in regard to attack methods. Finally, a robust framework with secure countermeasures is proposed and therefore recommended for the drone industry to adopt and implement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Butt, U.

The immediate suggested solution to prevent the spread of this virus was to avoid traveling around. In this study, the correlation between traveling between cities with new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran is demonstrated. The data, used in the study, consisted of the daily inter-state traffic, air traffic data, and daily new COVID-19 confirmed cases. The data is used to train a regression model and voting was used to show the highest correlation between travels made between cities and new cases of COVID-19. Although the available data was very coarse and there was no detail of inner-city commute, an accuracy of 81% was achieved showing a positive correlation between the number of inter-state travels and the new cases of COVID-19. Consequently, the result suggests that one of the best ways to avoid the spread of the virus is limiting or eliminating traveling around.","Shirvani, Soheil; Ghandehari, Anita; Moradi, Hadi",,690,16

In the present study, we have evaluated the phytochemical profile, including terpene and terpenophenolic compounds, of the essential oils (EOs) of Futura 75, Carmagnola selezionata and Eletta campana hemp varieties. The EOs were also tested for antifungal properties toward Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, Arthroderma crocatum, Arthroderma quadrifidum, Arthroderma gypseum, Arthroderma curreyi, and Arthroderma insingulare. In parallel, we investigated the inhibitory effects of the EOs against tyrosinase, and the production of prostaglandin E2 in isolated mouse skin exposed to hydrogen peroxide. In human H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells, we also evaluated the influence of the EOs on the gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry in human host. E-caryophyllene and &#945;-pinene were the prominent terpenes in the EOs, whereas the cannabidiolic acid was the terpenophenol present at higher concentration. The EOs inhibited the growth of all tested dermatophytes species. In isolated skin specimens, EOs prevented the hydrogen-peroxide-induced synthesis of prostaglandin E2, consistent with the intrinsic antityrosinase activity. Finally, in H1299 cells, all tested EOs reduced the gene expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, as well. Therefore, the present findings highlight the rationale for the use of the present EOs against infectious diseases.","Orlando, Giustino; Adorisio, Sabrina; Delfino, Domenico; Chiavaroli, Annalisa; Brunetti, Luigi; Recinella, Lucia; Leone, Sheila; D039,; Antonio, Marianna; Zengin, Gokhan; Acquaviva, Alessandra; Antico, Mirko; Angelini, Paola; Angeles Flores, Giancarlo; Venanzoni, Roberto; Tacchini, Massimo; Di Simone, Simonetta Cristina; Menghini, Luigi; Ferrante, Claudio",,690,20

However, few studies have investigated telemedicine from the perspective of the patient experience. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction scores of telemedicine outpatient clinic visits in neurosurgery in comparison with in-person visits. METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, Press Ganey surveys from 3/1/2019 to 9/15/2020 were evaluated retrospectively from single-institution, academic neurosurgical clinics. Due to the non-normality of our data, stratified Wilcoxon tests were performed with correction for care provider differences. Domain score probability values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Average scores (range 20-100) are documented as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS: The response rates were 20% (97 responders) for telemedicine visits and 19% (589 responders) for in-person visits. Patient overall satisfaction score was slightly higher with telemedicine visits compared to in-person corrected for care provider differences (94.2 ± 12.2 vs 93.1 ± 13.4, p = 0.085). The care provider domain demonstrated no statistically significant difference in telemedicine compared to in-person (94.7 ± 14.4 vs 92.4 ± 16.5, p = 0.096). The access domain (93.7 ± 12.3 vs 93.4 ± 12.4, p = 0.999) and overall domains (94.1 ± 12.1 vs 94.4 ± 13.4, p = 1.000) were not found to be different between visit types. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appears to be a valuable option for neurosurgical patients and is not significantly different to in-person visits in all domains. This study demonstrates that telemedicine visits result in comparable satisfaction scores by neurosurgical patients, and providers should continue offering this option to their patients as we approach the post-COVID era.","Porche, Ken; Vaziri, Sasha; Mehkri, Yusuf; Christie, Carlton; Laurent, Dimitri; Wang, Yu; Rahman, Maryam",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,690,20

However, little research has investigated the association between EL, ADHD and comorbid symptoms in preschoolers. This study assessed dimensional EL in preschoolers and its link with ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention) and behavioural and emotional problems (e.g. aggression and anxiety). METHOD: One hundred and fifty-four preschoolers aged 3-6 years old were rated on questionnaires by parents. EL was assessed with the index from the Conners Rating Scale-Revised and behavioural and emotional problems with an adapted version of the Social Behavior Questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Higher EL was associated with higher hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, anxiety and aggression problems. After controlling for other behavioural and emotional problems and sociodemographic variables, EL remained associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional lability seems to be a potential marker for ADHD symptoms with internalizing problems in preschoolers and could be a target for diagnosis and early interventions. This finding should be treated with caution as the study was limited by the low response rate of the participants and consequently the small sample size.","Maire, Jenna; Galéra, Cédric; Meyer, Eric; Salla, Julie; Michel, Grégory",Child Adolesc Ment Health,690,2

METHODS: Patients and caregivers were prospectively assessed from April 2020-July 2020 by a 10-item comprising interview over the phone, including qualitative and quantitative questions. They were quantitatively evaluated i.a. by the distress thermometer (DT, score 1-10). The qualitative questions were analyzed using structured content analysis: The interview questions defined the main categories. Subcategories were derived by an inductive approach assessing the frequency of patients' and caregivers' answers. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients and 20 caregivers were interviewed; n = 36 were female (49%), mean age was 53 years (range 32-81). Patients' disease-related DT scores were higher than the COVID-19-related DT scores: the median of the disease-related DT score was 7 (range 2-10) versus median of COVID-19-related distress: 5.0 (range 2-7). Caregivers perceived a higher burden due to the disease (DT median disease: 8; range 2-10 vs. DT pandemic: 3, range 0-10). A total of five main and 21 subcategories were elaborated, most frequently mentioned were ""restrictions in public and private affairs"" (28%), ""changes in the psychological well-being"" (23%), ""limited social interaction by contact restriction"" (25%). Subcategories relevant for caregivers were similar to those of BTPs. CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of patients and caregivers still perceived the brain tumor disease as more burdensome than the pandemic. We established main and subcategories of interview items possibly of great relevance to patients during these difficult times, which could be implemented in the content-related adaption of the psychosocial assessment.","Binswanger, Julia; Kohl, Carolin; Behling, Felix; Noell, Susan; Hirsch, Sophie; Hickmann, Anne-Katrin; Tatagiba, Marcos Soares; Tabatabai, Ghazaleh; Hippler, Melina; Renovanz, Mirjam",Psycho-oncol.

423651,423651,423651,Mobile Usage during COVID-19,13.430321,1.2815353,2020,"GUIDELINE 1: A pathophysiological taxonomy: A pathophysiological classification of membrane dysfunction, which provides mechanistic links to functional characteristics, should be used when prescribing individualized dialysis or when planning modality transfer (e.g. to automated peritoneal dialysis (PD) or haemodialysis) in the context of shared and informed decision-making with the person on PD, taking individual circumstances and treatment goals into account. (practice point). GUIDELINE 2A: Identification of fast peritoneal solute transfer rate (PSTR): It is recommended that the PSTR is determined from a 4-h peritoneal equilibration test (PET), using either 2.5%/2.27% or 4.25%/3.86% dextrose/glucose concentration and creatinine as the index solute. (practice point) This should be done early in the course dialysis treatment (between 6 weeks and 12 weeks) (GRADE 1A) and subsequently when clinically indicated. (practice point). GUIDELINE 2B: Clinical implications and mitigation of fast solute transfer: A faster PSTR is associated with lower survival on PD. (GRADE 1A) This risk is in part due to the lower ultrafiltration (UF) and increased net fluid reabsorption that occurs when the PSTR is above the average value. The resulting lower net UF can be avoided by shortening glucose-based exchanges, using a polyglucose solution (icodextrin), and/or prescribing higher glucose concentrations. (GRADE 1A) Compared to glucose, use of icodextrin can translate into improved fluid status and fewer episodes of fluid overload. (GRADE 1A) Use of automated PD and icodextrin may mitigate the mortality risk associated with fast PSTR. (practice point). GUIDELINE 3: Recognizing low UF capacity: This is easy to measure and a valuable screening test. Insufficient UF should be suspected when either (a) the net UF from a 4-h PET is <400 ml (3.86% glucose/4.25% dextrose) or <100 ml (2.27% glucose /2.5% dextrose), (GRADE 1B) and/or (b) the daily UF is insufficient to maintain adequate fluid status. (practice point) Besides membrane dysfunction, low UF capacity can also result from mechanical problems, leaks or increased fluid absorption across the peritoneal membrane not explained by fast PSTR. GUIDELINE 4A: Diagnosing intrinsic membrane dysfunction (manifesting as low osmotic conductance to glucose) as a cause of UF insufficiency: When insufficient UF is suspected, the 4-h PET should be supplemented by measurement of the sodium dip at 1 h using a 3.86% glucose/4.25% dextrose exchange for diagnostic purposes. A sodium dip &#8804;5 mmol/L and/or a sodium sieving ratio &#8804;0.03 at 1 h indicates UF insufficiency. (GRADE 2B). GUIDELINE 4B: Clinical implications of intrinsic membrane dysfunction (de novo or acquired): in the absence of residual kidney function, this is likely to necessitate the use of hypertonic glucose exchanges and possible transfer to haemodialysis. Acquired membrane injury, especially in the context of prolonged time on treatment, should prompt discussions about the risk of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. (practice point). GUIDELINE 5: Additional membrane function tests: measures of peritoneal protein loss, intraperitoneal pressure and more complex tests that estimate osmotic conductance and 'lymphatic' reabsorption are not recommended for routine clinical practice but remain valuable research methods. (practice point). GUIDELINE 6: Socioeconomic considerations: When resource constraints prevent the use of routine tests, consideration of membrane function should still be part of the clinical management and may be inferred from the daily UF in response to the prescription. (practice point).","Morelle, Johann; Stachowska-Pietka, Joanna; Öberg, Carl; Gadola, Liliana; La Milia, Vincenzo; Yu, Zanzhe; Lambie, Mark; Mehrotra, Rajnish; de Arteaga, Javier; Davies, Simon",Perit Dial Int,690,16

Up to now, the development of vaccine is still in the stage of clinical research, and there is no clinically approved specific antiviral drug for human coronavirus infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the key molecules involved in response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide references for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We conducted in-depth and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of human proteins identified with SARS-CoV-2, including functional enrichment analysis, protein interaction network analysis, screening of hub genes, and evaluation of their potential as therapeutic targets. In addition, we used the gene-drug database to search for inhibitors of related biological targets. RESULTS: Several significant pathways, such as PKA, centrosome and transcriptional regulation, may greatly contribute to the development and progression of COVID-2019 disease. Taken together 15 drugs and 18 herb ingredients were screened as potential drugs for viral treatment. Specially, the trans-resveratrol can significantly reduce the expression of N protein of MERS-CoV and inhibit MERS-CoV. In addition, trans-resveratrol, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and BX795 all show good anti multiple virus effects. CONCLUSION: Some drugs selected through our methods have been proven to have antiviral effects in previous studies. We aim to use global bioinformatics analysis to provide insights to assist in the design of new drugs and provide new choices for clinical treatment.","Wang, Ting; Zhao, Minghui; Ye, Pingping; Wang, Qian; Zhao, Yongshan",Arch. med. res,690,16

During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the LTCF an effective screening tool is essential to identify the patients at risk for severe disease. We explored the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a predictor for severe disease during the outbreak of Covid-19 in one LTCF in Slovakia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of cases of COVID-19, diagnosed during the outbreak in one LTCF in Slovakia between April 11, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Within 24 h after the diagnosis of Covid-19, clinical and laboratory screening was performed in the LTCF to identify patients in need of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen saturation below 90% were immediately referred to the hospital. Patients staying in the LFTC were monitored daily and those that developed hypoxemia were transferred to the hospital. We analyzed the association between the IL-6 at the initial assessment and development of hypoxemia during follow up and determined the cut-off of the IL-6 able to predict the development of hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (11 men, 42 women) with diagnosed Covid-19 were included in the analysis. 19 (53%) patients developed hypoxemia during the disease. Patients with hypoxemia had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at initial screening. ROC analyses identified IL-6 as the most robust predictor of hypoxemia. The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL predicted the development of hypoxemia with the sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.9%. The positive and negative predictive values were 76.9, and 100% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL at initial assessment predicted the development of hypoxemia requiring hospitalization with excellent sensitivity and good specificity. IL-6 appears as a potential predictor for the development of the severe Covid-19 and might serve for early identification of patients in need of hospitalization. Further studies are needed to evaluate the robustness of the use of IL-6 as an effective screening tool for the severe course of Covid-19.","Sabaka, P; Koscálová, A; Straka, I; Hodosy, J; Lipták, R; Kmotorková, B; Kachlíková, M; Kusnírová, A",BMC Infect Dis,690,21

The sensitivity of CLIA-RBD assay reached 96%, while LFIA-S demonstrated the lowest sensitivity, 71% (95% CI: 58%-80%). CLIA assays targeting antibodies against RBD considered the best DTA. The antibody positivity rate increased corresponding with DPSO, but there was some decrement when moving from acute phase to convalescent phase of infection. As immunoglobulin isotope-related DTA was heterogeneous, our data have insufficient evidence to recommend CLIA/ELISA for clinical decision-making, but likely to have comparative advantage over RT-qPCR in certain circumstances and geographic regions.","Mekonnen, Daniel; Mengist, Hylemariam Mihiretie; Derbie, Awoke; Nibret, Endalkachew; Munshea, Abaineh; He, Hongliang; Li, Bofeng; Jin, Tengchuan",Rev Med Virol,690,15

This is the first study to assess risk factors of adverse mental health outcomes during lockdown in a SUD population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted through an online survey that was completed by 303 individuals with SUD, attended in the Addiction Unit of University of Barcelona Clínic Hospital. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected and descriptive analyses were carried out. Depending on whether individuals reported a worsening or no change/improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms during lockdown, the sample was divided in two groups. A logistic regression was then carried out to identify risk factors associated with adverse mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, frequency of use for the majority of individuals with SUD remained stable during lockdown in comparison to the pre-lockdown era, although a reduction was found in frequency of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and cocaine use in a small fraction of individuals with SUD. Symptoms of clinical anxiety were found in 58.7% of the sample while 48.2% of participants scored above the clinical threshold for depression. In addition, 50.3% of the sample reported a deterioration in depression and anxiety symptoms during lockdown that was associated with the following risk factors: previous trauma-exposure, female gender, distress and isolation, income reduction and alcohol use. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of patients with SUD experienced adverse mental health outcomes during lockdown that were associated with several risk factors, which should be taken into account in policy making and prevention strategies, as well as in clinical practice, in order to provide personalized care to SUD patients during the time of the pandemic.","Blithikioti, C; Nuño, L; Paniello, B; Gual, A; Miquel, L",J Psychiatr Res,690,24

In this study we investigated the role of S1PR2 internalization in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Clinical data of randomly selected 60 CRC specimens showed the correlation between S1PR2 internalization and increased intracellular uracil (P < 0.001). Then we explored the regulatory mechanisms in CRC model of villin-S1PR2-/- mice and CRC cell lines. We showed that co-administration of S1P promoted S1PR2 internalization from plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus blunted 5-FU efficacy against colorectal tumors in WT mice, compared to that in S1PR2-/- mice. In HCT116 and HT-29 cells, application of S1P (10 µM) empowered S1PR2 to internalize from PM to ER, thus inducing 5-FU resistance, whereas the specific S1PR2 inhibitor JTE-013 (10 µM) effectively inhibited S1P-induced S1PR2 internalization. Using Mag-Fluo-AM-labeling [Ca2+]ER and LC-ESI-MS/MS, we revealed that internalized S1PR2 triggered elevating [Ca2+]ER levels to activate PERK-eLF2&#945;-ATF4 signaling in HCT116 cells. The activated ATF4 upregulated RNASET2-mediated uracil generation, which impaired exogenous 5-FU uptake to blunt 5-FU therapy. Overall, this study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism of 5-FU resistance resulted from S1PR2 internalization-upregulated uracil generation in colorectal cancer, and provides the novel insight into the significance of S1PR2 localization in predicting the benefit of CRC patients from 5-FU-based chemotherapy.","Zhang, Yu-Hang; Cui, Shu-Xiang; Wan, Sheng-Biao; Wu, Shu-Hua; Qu, Xian-Jun",Acta pharmacol.

Understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry and replication has become a key aspect of such interventions. The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential for viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry. Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of hACE2 expressed in HEK293 cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100%) at all seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site. To deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 that may be involved in viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc, and the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectrum, in addition to using bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2 glycosylation. Our elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the hACE2 receptor, along with the modeling of hACE2 glycosylation sites can aid in understanding the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and assist in the development of novel therapeutics to prevent viral entry.

METHOD: We assessed user response to an electronic system designed to self-report symptoms. Endpoints included compliance, postoperative symptoms, patient satisfaction. An 8-item symptom inventory (pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, fever, swelling, discharge, redness) was developed and made available on postoperative days (POD) 2-6. Responses exceeding defined thresholds of severity triggered alerts to healthcare providers. Symptoms, alerts, actions taken, urgent care center (UCC) visits, hospital admissions were tracked until POD 30. Patient satisfaction was evaluated on POD 7. A patient was defined as ""responder"" if at least 5/8 items on at least 3 PODs were completed. The assessment method was deemed successful if 64/100 patients responded. RESULTS: 97/102 patients were evaluable; 65 met ""responder"" criteria (67% responder rate; 95% CI 57-76%). 321 surveys were completed (median 4/patient), 248 (77%) in &#8804;2 min. Involving caregivers and allowing additional symptom-reporting improved the responder rate to 72% (95% CI 58-84%). Most commonly-reported moderate, severe, very severe symptoms were pain, nausea, swelling; 71% reported moderate to very severe pain on POD 2. Phone calls and adjustment of medications adequately addressed most symptoms. Two patients (2%) presented at UCC before, 6 (6%) after, POD 6; 1 (1%) was admitted. Most agreed or strongly agreed that electronic symptom-tracking was helpful, easy to use, and would recommend it to others. CONCLUSION: Electronic symptom-tracking is feasible for patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic cancer surgery. Symptom burden is high in the early postoperative period. Addressing patient-reported symptoms in a timely, automated manner may prevent severe downstream adverse events, reduce UCC visits and admission rates, and improve outcomes.","Zivanovic, Oliver; Chen, Ling Y; Vickers, Andrew; Straubhar, Alli; Baser, Raymond; Veith, Mitchell; Aiken, Nate; Carter, Jeanne; Curran, Katherine; Simon, Brett; Mueller, Jennifer; Jewell, Elizabeth; Chi, Dennis S; Sonoda, Yukio; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Leitao, Mario M",Gynecol. oncol,690,15

Older adults have been identified as being at higher risk of poor outcomes if infected and in many countries have been subjected to greater restrictions on physical contacts with others. Most research so far points towards an increase in loneliness during the pandemic. However, there has been a lack of prospective studies based on representative samples of older adults, with the oldest old, older adults with low or no Internet usage, and those in poor health currently underrepresented. Despite the significance of cultural norms for individuals' standards for social relations and, thus, the experience of loneliness, there has been a lack of comparative research on loneliness in older adults during the pandemic. Reviews have found little evidence for what interventions and what elements of interventions are effective in reducing loneliness. There is potential for social relations to be maintained via technology-based solutions, although there is a risk of excluding older adults with limited resources who are both least likely to use technology and most vulnerable to loneliness. Furthermore, remote social contacts cannot fully compensate for the loss of physical contacts. Where stay-at-home orders are not imposed, supporting neighbourliness and the community use of accessible open spaces are other options. Finally, policy responses to the pandemic need to be more nuanced and non-ageist in order to avoid unnecessary increases in loneliness in older adults.","Dahlberg, Lena",Aging Ment Health,690,16

The previous report has demonstrated that chitosan mediates the differentiation of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through insulin-like growth factors and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 axis in an in vitro model. However, whether chitosan can further treat olfactory dysfunction in vivo remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of chitosan on a 3-methylindole-induced anosmic rat model. Intraperitoneal injection of 3-methylindole is performed to induce anosmia in rats. Experimental results demonstrate that the food-finding duration after chitosan treatment gradually decrease to around 80 s, and both the olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) thickness and mature ORNs (expressing olfactory marker protein) are significantly restored. Furthermore, proliferating cells (expressing bromodeoxyuridine) are mainly co-expressed with immature ORNs (expressing ßIII tubulin) below the intermediate layer of the ON in the chitosan-treated group on day 28 following 3-methylindole treatment. Conversely, proliferating cells are scattered over the ON, and co-localized with immature ORNs and sustentacular cells (expressing keratin 18) in the sham group, and even immature ORNs go into apoptosis (expressing DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-3), possibly causing incomplete regeneration. Consequently, chitosan regenerates the ON by regulating olfactory neural homeostasis and reducing ORN apoptosis, and serves as a potential therapeutic intervention for olfactory dysfunction in the future.","Li, Sheng-Tien; Young, Tai-Horng; Huang, Tsung-Wei",Biomaterials,690,4

In this context, specific alterations of the levels and homeostatic function of the tripeptide glutathione have been reported to play a causal role in the pro-oxidant and cytopathic effects (CPE) of the virus. In this study, these aspects were investigated for the first time in SARS-CoV2-infected Vero E6 cells, a reliable and well-characterized in vitro model of this infection. SARS-CoV2 markedly decreased the levels of cellular thiols, essentially lowering the reduced form of glutathione (GSH). Such an important defect occurred early in the CPE process (in the first 24 hpi). Thiol analysis in N-acetyl-Cys (NAC)-treated cells and membrane transporter expression data demonstrated that both a lowered uptake of the GSH biosynthesis precursor Cys and an increased efflux of cellular thiols, could play a role in this context. Increased levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and protein glutathionylation were also observed along with upregulation of the ER stress marker PERK. The antiviral drugs Remdesivir (Rem) and Nelfinavir (Nel) influenced these changes at different levels, essentially confirming the importance or blocking viral replication to prevent GSH depletion in the host cell. Accordingly, Nel, the most potent antiviral in our in vitro study, produced a timely activation of Nrf2 transcription factor and a GSH enhancing response that synergized with NAC to restore GSH levels in the infected cells. Despite poor in vitro antiviral potency and GSH enhancing function, Rem treatment was found to prevent the SARS-CoV2-induced glutathionylation of cellular proteins. In conclusion, SARS-CoV2 infection impairs the metabolism of cellular glutathione. NAC and the antiviral Nel can prevent such defect in vitro.","Bartolini, Desirée; Stabile, Anna Maria; Bastianelli, Sabrina; Giustarini, Daniela; Pierucci, Sara; Busti, Chiara; Vacca, Carmine; Gidari, Anna; Francisci, Daniela; Castronari, Roberto; Mencacci, Antonella; Di Cristina, Manlio; Focaia, Riccardo; Sabbatini, Samuele; Rende, Mario; Gioiello, Antimo; Cruciani, Gabriele; Rossi, Ranieri; Galli, Francesco",Redox Biol,690,23

But in other than healthcare facilities, mechanical ventilation is designed for comfort, not airborne infection control, and cannot achieve the 6 to 12 room air changes per hour recommended for airborne infection control. More efficient air filters have been recommended in ventilation ducts despite a lack of convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads through ventilation systems. Most transmission appears to occur in rooms where both an infectious source COVID-19 case and other susceptible occupants share the same air. Only two established room-based technologies are available to supplement mechanical ventilation: portable room air cleaners and upper room germicidal UV air disinfection. Portable room air cleaners can be effective, but performance is limited by their clean air delivery rate relative to room volume.

Objetivou-se avaliar o quadro de acidose ruminal e da fase inicial de laminite induzidas pela administração de oligofrutose em bezerros. Foram usados seis bezerros mestiços (Bos taurus X Bos indicus) de um ano de idade e pesando em média 175 ± 22,6 kg. Inicialmente usaram-se três animais em um grupo piloto (GP) recebendo oligofrutose na dose de 13 g/kg e em seguida um grupo experimental (GE) recebendo o açúcar na dose de 17 g/kg. Avaliaram-se alterações clínicas, laboratoriais e histológicas, de fragmentos do casco. A sobrecarga de oligofrutose provocou acidose ruminal caracterizada por baixo pH em ambos os grupos, menor no GE. Observou-se também acidose metabólica com redução de pH, PCO2, bicarbonato e excesso de base. Não se observou aumento da sensibilidade dos cascos ou claudicação. Apesar disso, muitos animais apresentaram apatia e marcha mais lenta, possivelmente devido a acidose metabólica. Histologicamente observaram-se alterações circulatórias e infiltrado inflamatório na derme, irregularidades de membrana basal e alterações morfológicas na epiderme basal. As alterações clínicas e histológicas foram semelhantes as descritas em outros trabalhos, entretanto, todos realizados em animais taurinos. O protocolo de indução de laminite com administração intrarruminal de oligofrutose se mostrou eficaz em bezerros mestiços de um ano de idade. Na fase inicial a laminite se caracterizou por sinais clínicos da enfermidade primária, no caso acidose ruminal, e por alterações histológicas indicativas de inflamação aguda e comprometimento de membrana basal e epiderme.","FILHO, ANTONIO DIONISIO FEITOSA NORONHA",,690,18

In the context of the rapid global dissemination of the Covid-19 pandemic, describing viral infection rates in relation to international air travel early during the pandemic can help inform future public health policy. The objective of this study is to determine whether proximity to an international airport predicted higher infection rates during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (US). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined the incidence of Covid-19 in areas near US international airports in the first weeks after detection of Covid-19 in all 50 states, using publicly available county-level incidence of Covid-19 data. They performed a multiple regression to determine the relative effects of population density and air traffic in the Counties Containing Airports (CCA) and the number of Covid-19 cases, and determined the odds of Covid-19 in CCA compared to the rest of the state. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that air traffic was significantly correlated with Covid-19 cases during the initial phase of pandemic while population density was not significantly correlated. Three weeks into the pandemic, the pooled odds of Covid-19 cases in CCA was 2.66 (95% CI [2.64, 2.68], p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The counties in the US containing international airports represented initial hotspots for Covid-19 transmission. Early public health containment efforts focused on these areas may help mitigate disease transmission during future similar novel respiratory virus epidemics.","Chokshi, Aastha; DallaPiazza, Michelle; Zhang, Wei Wei; Sifri, Ziad",Travel Med Infect Dis,690,20

SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus genome of around 30Kb. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced at an unprecedented rate and being deposited in public repositories. For the de novo assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a myriad of assemblers is being used, although their impact on the assembly quality has not been characterized for this virus. In this study, we aim to understand the variabilities on assembly qualities due to the choice of the assemblers. RESULTS: We performed 6648 de novo assemblies of 416 SARS-CoV-2 samples using eight different assemblers with different k-mer lengths. We used Illumina paired-end sequencing reads and compared the assembly quality of those assemblers. We showed that the choice of assembler plays a significant role in reconstructing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two metagenomic assemblers, e.g. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes, performed better compared with others in most of the assembly quality metrics including, recovery of a larger fraction of the genome, constructing larger contigs and higher N50, NA50 values, etc. We showed that at least 09% (259/2873) of the variants present in the assemblies between MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes are unique to one of the assembly methods. CONCLUSION: Our analyses indicate the critical role of assembly methods for assembling SARS-CoV-2 genome using short reads and their impact on variant characterization. This study could help guide future studies to determine the best-suited assembler for the de novo assembly of virus genomes.","Islam, Rashedul; Raju, Rajan Saha; Tasnim, Nazia; Shihab, Istiak Hossain; Bhuiyan, Maruf Ahmed; Araf, Yusha; Islam, Tofazzal",Brief. bioinform,690,24

Objective: To evaluate baseline QTc interval on 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and ensuing changes among patients with and without COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 3050 patients aged 18 years and older who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had ECGs at Columbia University Irving Medical Center from March 1 through May 1, 2020. Patients were analyzed by treatment group over 5 days, as follows: hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, and neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin. ECGs were manually analyzed by electrophysiologists masked to COVID-19 status. Multivariable modeling evaluated clinical associations with QTc prolongation from baseline. Exposures: COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean QTc prolongation, percentage of patients with QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater. Results: A total of 965 patients had more than 2 ECGs and were included in the study, with 561 (58.1%) men, 198 (26.2%) Black patients, and 191 (19.8%) aged 80 years and older.

Multivariable analysis revealed that age 80 years and older compared with those younger than 50 years (mean difference in QTc, 11.91 [SE, 4.69; 95% CI, 2.73 to 21.09]; P = .01), severe chronic kidney disease compared with no chronic kidney disease (mean difference in QTc, 12.20 [SE, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.89 to 22.51; P = .02]), elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.05 [SE, 1.19; 95% CI, 2.72 to 7.38]; P < .001), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.31 [SE, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.06 to 10.57]; P = .04) were associated with QTc prolongation. Torsades de pointes occurred in 1 patient (0.1%) with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, COVID-19 infection was independently associated with significant mean QTc prolongation at days 5 and 2 of hospitalization compared with day 0. More patients with COVID-19 had QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater compared with patients without COVID-19.","Rubin, Geoffrey A; Desai, Amar D; Chai, Zilan; Wang, Aijin; Chen, Qixuan; Wang, Amy S; Kemal, Cameron; Baksh, Haajra; Biviano, Angelo; Dizon, Jose M; Yarmohammadi, Hirad; Ehlert, Frederick; Saluja, Deepak; Rubin, David A; Morrow, John P; Avula, Uma Mahesh R; Berman, Jeremy P; Kushnir, Alexander; Abrams, Mark P; Hennessey, Jessica A; Elias, Pierre; Poterucha, Timothy J; Uriel, Nir; Kubin, Christine J; LaSota, Elijah; Zucker, Jason; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Schwartz, Allan; Garan, Hasan; Waase, Marc P; Wan, Elaine Y",JAMA Netw Open,690,16

This is called the inversion effect. It suggests that these two species use a specific way to process faces and bodies. Previous research has suggested that humans also show the inversion effect to objects that they have expertise about, and this is called the expert effect. We investigated whether chimpanzees show the expert effect and how humans and chimpanzees differ by testing chimpanzees (human experts) with human body stimuli and testing humans (chimpanzee experts) with chimpanzee and human body stimuli in body recognition tasks. The main finding was that humans (chimpanzee experts) showed the expert effect to chimpanzee bodies, while chimpanzees partially showed it to human bodies. This suggests that compared with chimpanzees, the special processing in humans can be more flexibly tuned for other objects. We also tested humans that were not chimpanzee experts using chimpanzee body stimuli. Although they showed similar performances as the chimpanzee experts, the two groups had differences in some situations, indicating the effect of expertise. This study revealed the important role of experience in object processing in humans, and our evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees.","Gao, Jie; Kawakami, Fumito; Tomonaga, Masaki",Sci Rep,690,5

To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples1-3 while simultaneously testing for many pathogens4-6. Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents7 self-organize in a microwell array8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health9-11.","Ackerman, Cheri M; Myhrvold, Cameron; Thakku, Sri Gowtham; Freije, Catherine A; Metsky, Hayden C; Yang, David K; Ye, Simon H; Boehm, Chloe K; Kosoko-Thoroddsen, Tinna-Sólveig F; Kehe, Jared; Nguyen, Tien G; Carter, Amber; Kulesa, Anthony; Barnes, John R; Dugan, Vivien G; Hung, Deborah T; Blainey, Paul C; Sabeti, Pardis C",Nature,690,16

While vaccinomics concerns the effectiveness of vaccines, adversomics concerns their side effects. This area has great potential to address public concerns about vaccine safety and to promote increased public confidence, higher vaccination rates, and fewer serious adverse events in genetically predisposed individuals. The aim here is to explore the contemporary scientific literature related to the vaccinomic and adversomic aspects of the three most-controversial vaccines: those against hepatitis B, against measles, mumps, and rubella, and against human Papilloma virus.

We found that the Roche Elecsys assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts. Extracts of dried blood from Mitra devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as compared to neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type.

This special issue was organised at the time when the entire globe was affected by the Coronavirus and accordingly, this paper has taken this opportunity to discuss the implications of this pandemic on accounting for non-financial issues, especially in relation to sustainability accounting research and practice. Design/methodology/approach: An analysis of public documents and limited academic research on the Coronavirus was undertaken in this paper to highlight how life as it existed has fundamentally changed. The authors also review the papers published in this special issue and identifies research opportunities arising from the current environment. Findings: The onslaught of the Coronavirus provides both challenges and opportunities for the practice of, and research into, accounting for non-financial matters, such as sustainability. The papers published in this special issue promote understanding and linking of sustainability reporting practices, to creating firm values, as well as identifying current and emerging challenges. The special issue explores criteria for the construction of accounting technology that is consistent with agnostic-based critical accounting and accountability, a business case for managers and practitioners to formulate strategic and management control systems in response to climate change issues, legitimacy and the use of photographs in sustainability reporting to create value, effective disclosures of business and sustainability ethics practiced by the firm for reputation building and value creation, indigenous accounting in mining companies, public sector policy framing of non-financial value, the barriers to sustainability reporting because of lack of awareness and knowledge and inadequate regulatory support in developing countries and the significance of sustainability accounting education to improve sustainability reporting practices in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: Future research opportunities in relation to the impact of the Coronavirus on accounting for non-financial value are identified. Given that COVID-19 is a societal matter, the practical implications of the Coronavirus in accounting for non-financial value creation are highlighted. The Coronavirus has challenged the existing economic paradigm and non-financial issues will capture the attention of corporations, other institutions, civil society and governments.

Empirical estimates of their direct and spill-over effects however remain challenging to identify. In this study, we propose the use of a novel synthetic control framework to obtain causal estimates for direct and spill-over impacts of these events. The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the event's spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the election's direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the election's spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale. Relaxations of mass gathering restrictions must therefore be carefully considered, even in the context of low community transmission and enforcement of safe distancing guidelines.","Lim, Jue Tao; Maung, Kenwin; Tan, Sok Teng; Ong, Suan Ee; Lim, Jane Mingjie; Koo, Joel Ruihan; Sun, Haoyang; Park, Minah; Tan, Ken Wei; Yoong, Joanne; Cook, Alex R; Dickens, Borame Sue Lee",PLoS Comput Biol,690,16

Recent studies have reported high rates of alcohol use during this time; however, longitudinal data remain scarce and factors associated with increases in high-risk drinking observed over time are unknown. AIMS: The current study examined changes in high-risk drinking patterns across four 7-day observation periods, prior to and following a university wide campus closure. Additionally, factors associated with changes in alcohol use patterns were examined including financial distress, psychological distress, impact of racial tensions and virus-related fears. METHOD: Students (N = 1001) in the Midwestern USA completed repeated assessments between March and June 2020. Each survey included a timeline follow-back measure of alcohol use. Pandemic-related distress spanning several factors was assessed at the final follow-up. RESULTS: Risky drinking patterns increased significantly over time. Overall, psychological distress and impact of racial tensions were associated with higher rates of risky drinking, whereas COVID-19-related fears were associated with lower rates. However, only financial-related distress was associated with an increase in risky drinking patterns over time. CONCLUSIONS: Increased risky drinking patterns observed in the current study may signal problems that are likely to persist even after the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life ends. Individuals experiencing financial distress may represent a particularly high-risk group. Interventions targeting the cross-section of job loss, financial stress and problematic alcohol use will be important to identify.","Lechner, William V; Sidhu, Natasha K; Jin, Jackson T; Kittaneh, Ahmad A; Laurene, Kimberly R; Kenne, Deric R",Alcohol alcohol,690,22

Moreover, it plays a preventive role in development of cancer, obesity and type-2 diabetes. Recently a role of NEP in COVID-19 pathogenesis has also been suggested. Despite intensive research into NEP structure and functions in different organisms, changes in its expression and regulation during brain development and ageing, especially in age-related pathologies, is still not fully understood. This prevents development of pharmacological treatments from various diseases in which NEP is implicated although recently a dual-acting drug sacubitril-valsartan (LCZ696) combining a NEP inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker has been approved for treatment of heart failure. Also, various natural compounds capable of upregulating NEP expression, including green tea (EGCG), have been proposed as a preventive medicine in prostate cancer and AD.

International travel bans in March 2020 dampened viral spread and resulted in an overnight global economic crisis. As countries ease travel and social distancing restrictions, viral resurgences are expected. This study was carried out in order to delineate the development of a second wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths due to lockdown easements in June-July 2020. METHODS: Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to September 2020 was obtained from ""Our World In Data"" website and analysed with Pearson correlation. RESULTS: At global level, both datasets exhibited three distinct time periods. Cases rose to mid-April, plateaued till mid-May then rose again. Almost all of the slopes in these three time periods were statistically significant. Deaths followed a similar three-part pattern, albeit more pronounced, with values lagging circa one week after new cases and a middle time period when numbers (of deaths) actually decreased, with all periods exhibiting significant slopes. At continent level, for new cases, Asia rose steadily, Europe is increasing again, the Americas and Africa are declining. Deaths follow a similar pattern. Oceania shows a bimodal pattern, with a first and second wave of cases shortly followed by deaths in a similar pattern. The monthly ratio of detected cases to deaths (case fatality ratio) initially rose to 0.08, then fell to 0.02.

RESULTS: Respondent demographics were unrelated to one's willingness to be vaccinated (p value 0.533), but those with less education were more likely to be unwilling (p < 0.001). Among those willing, uptake ranged from 61.70 to 97.75%, depending on the vaccination attributes. Effectiveness and safety had the largest effects. Offering proof of vaccination and a choice of setting increased uptake as much as increasing immunity from 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize uptake, the CDC Program should standardize proof of vaccination and offer a choice of setting, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. If the first-generation vaccines are efficacious, widely available, and free, overall predicted uptake is 68.81% by the end of Phase 2 (August 2021), which is well below the 75-90% needed for herd immunity. Further health preference research is necessary to uncover and address unwillingness and reluctance to vaccinate against COVID-19.","Craig, Benjamin Matthew",Patient,690,10

COVID-19 or Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a single stranded RNA virus. COVID -19 is highly contagious and has resulted in current global pandemic with almost no country of the world unaffected by this virus. Owing to the lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines, the best measures to control human coronaviruses remain a strong public health surveillance system coupled with rapid diagnostic testing and quarantine/social; distancing/lockdowns as and when necessary. In the present study, we have used the insilico approach for the prediction of novel drug molecules from available antiviral drugs and also from natural compounds that can be best target against RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (Pol/RdRp) protein of SARS-CoV-2 which can be suitable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 virus. From the current study we observed that three antiviral and three phyto-chemicals have minimum binding energy with the target protein which were further evaluated in molecular dynamics studies and could specifically bind to RdRp protein of COVID-19. Based on results we suggest that these drugs may act as best or novel inhibitor that may be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive study, comprised of three online surveys conducted between April to December, 2020. We recruited sites from email lists of national abortion and family planning organizations. RESULTS: Seventy-four sites opted to participate. We analyzed 55/74 sites (74%) that provided medication abortion and completed all three surveys. The total number of abortion encounters reported by the sites remained consistent throughout the study period, though medication abortion encounters increased while first-trimester aspiration abortion encounters decreased. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sites reduced the number of in-person visits associated with medication abortion and confirmation of successful termination. In February 2020, considered prepandemic, 39/55 sites (71%) required 2 or more patient visits for a medication abortion. By April 2020, 19/55 sites (35%) reported reducing the total number of in-person visits associated with a medication abortion. As of October 2020, 37 sites indicated newly adopting a practice of offering medication abortion follow-up with no in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Sites quickly adopted protocols incorporating practices that are well-supported in the literature, including forgoing Rh-testing and pre-abortion ultrasound in some circumstances and relying on patient report of symptoms or home pregnancy tests to confirm successful completion of medication abortion. Importantly, these practices reduce face-to-face interactions and the opportunity for virus transmission. Sustaining these changes even after the public health crisis is over may increase patient access to abortion, and these impacts should be evaluated in future research. IMPLICATIONS STATEMENT: Medication abortion serves a critical function in maintaining access to abortion when there are limitations to in-person clinic visits. Sites throughout the country successfully and quickly adopted protocols that reduced visits associated with the abortion, reducing in-person screenings, relying on telehealth, and implementing remote follow-up.","Tschann, Mary; Ly, Elizabeth S; Hilliard, Sara; Lange, Hannah L H",Contraception,690,30

Both RT-PCR and Computed Tomography (CT) scan are costly diagnosis tool, thus computed diagnostic chest x-ray (CXR) is seen as fast and affordable option to perform Covid-19 diagnosis for underdeveloped countries. Despite of other works suggest to perform Local binary Pattern (LBP) and recent feature extraction methods such as Local Phase Quantization (LPQ), this works employed Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) because it is a powerful method to extract textured features from gray-level images of chest x-ray. The learner to classify Covid-19 detection is tested via non tree-based learner such as k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN). This work also compared the performance especially in the tree-based and voting approach classifier. The experimentation shows that tree-based which uses voting and ensemble approach to detect Covid-19 from CXR images is a possible candidate learner to be improved for the underdeveloped countries.","Yasmin binti Mohd, Yacob Rafikha Aliana A.

In January 2020, a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in these patients. The disease caused by this virus has been given the name of COVID-19. During the initial stages of the pandemic, and given the scarcity of studies published about this, it was believed that this coronavirus only caused respiratory symptoms. However, as the number of patients increased, it was observed that cardiovascular disease had a fundamental role in the development and prognosis of the infection. The most important risk factors associated with mortality are age and the presence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular ones. The increase in the levels of troponin, natriuretic peptides, and D-dimer are of prognostic values in patients with an infection due to SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death, in relation to the systematic response to the virus and to the treatments needed in the acute phase. A review is presented in this article of the cardiovascular involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","Figueroa Triana, Juan Francisco; Salas Márquez, Diego Alfredo; Cabrera Silva, Juan Sebastián; Alvarado Castro, Cristian Camilo; Buitrago Sandoval, Andrés Felipe",Rev.

Previously, the most dominant pretraining method is transfer learning (TL), which uses labeled data to learn a good representation network. Recently, a new pretraining approach -- self-supervised learning (SSL) -- has demonstrated promising results on a wide range of applications. SSL does not require annotated labels. It is purely conducted on input data by solving auxiliary tasks defined on the input data examples. The current reported results show that in certain applications, SSL outperforms TL and the other way around in other applications. There has not been a clear understanding on what properties of data and tasks render one approach outperforms the other. Without an informed guideline, ML researchers have to try both methods to find out which one is better empirically. It is usually time-consuming to do so. In this work, we aim to address this problem. We perform a comprehensive comparative study between SSL and TL regarding which one works better under different properties of data and tasks, including domain difference between source and target tasks, the amount of pretraining data, class imbalance in source data, and usage of target data for additional pretraining, etc. The insights distilled from our comparative studies can help ML researchers decide which method to use based on the properties of their applications.","Yang, Xingyi; He, Xuehai; Liang, Yuxiao; Yang, Yue; Zhang, Shanghang; Xie, Pengtao",,690,1

Similar activities have also been instituted worldwide, as the global threat of a radiological or nuclear incident continues to be a concern. Much of the USG's efforts to plan for the unthinkable has centered on establishing clear lines of communication between agencies with responsibility for triage and medical response, and external stakeholders. There have also been strong connections made between those parts of the government that establish policies, fund research, oversee regulatory approval, and purchase and stockpile necessary medical supplies. Progress made in advancing preparedness has involved a number of subject matter meetings and tabletop exercises, publication of guidance documents, assessment of available resources, clear establishment of anticipated concepts of operation for multiple radiation and nuclear scenarios, and identification/mobilization of resources. From a scientific perspective, there were clear research gaps that needed to be addressed, which included the need to identify accurate biomarkers and design biodosimetry devices to triage large numbers of civilians, develop decorporation agents that are more amenable for mass casualty use, and advance candidate products to address injuries caused by radiation exposure and thereby improve survival. Central to all these activities was the development of several different animal constructs, since efficacy testing of these approaches requires extensive work in research models that accurately simulate what would be expected in humans. Recent experiences with COVID-19 have provided an opportunity to revisit aspects of radiation preparedness, and leverage those lessons learned to enhance readiness for a possible future radiation public health emergency.","DiCarlo, Andrea Lynn; Homer, Mary J; Coleman, C Norman",J. radiol. prot,690,1

Rural communities often have a higher proportion of residents who lack health insurance, live with comorbidities or disabilities, are aged &#8805;65 years, and have limited access to health care facilities with intensive care capabilities, which places these residents at increased risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality (2,3). To better understand COVID-19 vaccination disparities across the urban-rural continuum, CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among adults aged &#8805;18 years who received their first dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or a single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) during December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021 in 50 U.S. jurisdictions (49 states and the District of Columbia [DC]). Adult COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower in rural counties (38.9%) than in urban counties (45.7%) overall and among adults aged 18-64 years (29.1% rural, 37.7% urban), those aged &#8805;65 years (67.6% rural, 76.1% urban), women (41.7% rural, 48.4% urban), and men (35.3% rural, 41.9% urban). Vaccination coverage varied among jurisdictions: 36 jurisdictions had higher coverage in urban counties, five had higher coverage in rural counties, and five had similar coverage (i.e., within 1%) in urban and rural counties; in four jurisdictions with no rural counties, the urban-rural comparison could not be assessed. A larger proportion of persons in the most rural counties (14.6%) traveled for vaccination to nonadjacent counties (i.e., farther from their county of residence) compared with persons in the most urban counties (10.3%).

The nano-SiC has good cross-linking with MUF shell. When the nano-SiC was added in microPCMs, it behaves superior thermal conductivity and thermal storage properties. When the content of nano-SiC arrives 6 wt%, the performance of the microPCMs whose encapsulation efficiency is 65.7% is the best, and thermal conductivity increase by 59.2%. Due to the proper amount of nano-SiC added into the MUF shell, it can effectively fill the tiny holes on the MUF shell. Therefore, the microPCMs with appropriate nano-SiC have better leakage prevention. It is worth noting that MicroPCMs-6% and MicroPCMs-8% show excellent photothermal conversion property, and the photothermal conversion rate is 74.4% and 71.1% respectively in the photothermal conversion experiment. Because nano-SiC can effectively capture and absorb photons under light irradiation and convert light into heat through internal molecular vibration, the microPCMs with appropriate nano-SiC behaves well in photothermal conversion.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle may reflect frailty and functional decline in cancer patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation may improve phase angle values and physical function. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory analysis from a phase II randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in prostate cancer patients (age &#8805; 60 yrs). Fifty-nine patients were randomized to high-dose vitamin D (600 IU/day plus 50,000 IU/week) or low-dose: RDA for vitamin D (600 IU/day plus placebo weekly) for 24 weeks. Phase angle was measured by BIA. Physical function measures included handgrip strength, 6-minute walk test, Short Performance Physical Battery and leg extension. All testing was completed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. RESULTS: Phase angle values were wider over the entire study in the high-dose vitamin D arm indicating healthier muscle cells. The low-dose vitamin D arm had phase angle values consistent with frailty cutoffs in older men (<5.7°). CONCLUSION: Patients in the high-dose vitamin D arm experienced wider phase angle values over the course of the study which may indicate less frailty.

Excessive inflammation, exaggerated immune response, with ultimate apoptosis contribute to COVID-19 pathology that progress to acute lung acute respiratory distress. OBJECTIVE: To shed a light on the likely beneï¬ts of the oral phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor adjuvant role in combating COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A literature review was performed in the PubMed/Medline database, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, and CINAHL databases using the keywords COVID-19; phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors; cytokine storm; respiratory distress. RESULTS: Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, still no drugs are validated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in large-scale studies. While the progress toward a curative agent and/or vaccine is certainly hopeful, the principal limiting factor in such public health emergencies is always the time. Therefore, a preexisting licensed therapeutic(s) might offer a reprieve to the healthcare systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this context, the innovation of oral PDE5 inhibitors with their valuable effects on erection have provided a breakthrough in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and opened new fields of clinical application for this class of drugs. Oral PDE5 inhibitors have been demonstrated to possess many beneficial useful additional implications with acknowledged anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties have been elucidated through the nitric oxide/soluble guanylyl cyclase/cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway in addition to the emerged hemeoxygenase-1 enzyme as well as hydrogen sulfide pathways. These properties could support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in targeting different aspects of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Oral PDE5 inhibitors retain several acknowledged off-labeled useful implications with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties may support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in the protocols combating COVID-19 manifestations. Mostafa T.

When performing chest sonography of patients with symptoms such as respiratory infection, dyspnea and chest pain, the primary goal is to find or exclude significant diagnoses such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, tumors, pulmonary emboli, etc. as the cause of the symptoms. If infection with SARS-CoV-2 is present, COVID-19 pneumonia can be confirmed or excluded as the cause of the symptoms with a high degree of probability based on the sonographic signs. COVID-19 pneumonia shows typical changes in the lungs, which are easily accessible to ultrasound due to their usually peripheral location. These are ubiquitous signs, such as a thickened, fragmented pleura with subpleural consolidations, multiple comet tail artifacts of varying size and thickness, some of which are coascent, broad bright light beams, and possibly small encapsulated pleural effusions. The more of these sonographic signs are present and the more pronounced they are, the sooner the patient must be hospitalized and possibly intubated. Ultrasound is also useful as a follow-up tool, together with clinical and laboratory findings.","Horn, Rudolf; Mathis, Gebhard",Praxis (Bern 1994),690,29

This study integrates Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with four different machine learning (ML) techniques to assess the efficiency and evaluate the U.S.'s COVID-19 response performance. First, DEA is applied to measure the efficiency of fifty U.S. states considering four inputs: number of tested, public funding, number of health care employees, number of hospital beds. Then, number of recovered from COVID-19 as a desirable output and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as a undesirable output are considered. In the second stage, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Boosted Tree (BT), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to predict the COVID-19 response performance based on fifteen environmental factors, which were classified into social distancing, health policy, and socioeconomic measures. The results showed that 23 states were efficient with an average efficiency score of 0.97. Furthermore, BT and RF models produced the best prediction results and CART performed better than LR. Lastly, urban, physical inactivity, number of tested per population, population density, and total hospital beds per population were the most influential factors on efficiency.","Xu, Yuan; Park, Yong Shin; Park, Ju Dong",,690,20

There is currently no consensus on the incidence of cardiac injury, its relationship to prognosis, or its possible cause. This article provides a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the incidence, comorbidities, outcomes and possible mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies that evaluated cardiac injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Demographic information, co-morbidities, and relevant laboratory values were extracted and a meta-analysis was performed. Results: Sixteen studies from China, Italy and the US with 2224 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The incidence of cardiac injury was 24.4% (542/2224 patients) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac injury was 72.6% (OR=17.32, 95% CI 9.21-32.57) compared to those without cardiac injury (14.5%). In subgroup analyses, factors associated with increased risk of developing cardiac injury were older age and history of hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD). Conclusion: Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is significantly associated with mortality. Patients who were older with HTN and COPD were prone to develop cardiac injury. Early screening, triage and cardiac monitoring are recommended for these patients.","Zou, Fengwei; Qian, Zhiyong; Wang, Yao; Zhao, Yang; Bai, Jianling",,690,17

Which lessons can we learn? We identified relevant publications (until 26 July 2020) using systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid EMBASE with predefined search strings. A total of 4571 unique publications were retrieved, out of which 378 publications were selected for in-depth analysis by two raters, including a total of 17549 (out of which were 14418 SARS-CoV-2) patients. Neurological complications and associated neuroradiological manifestations are prevalent for all HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2). Moreover there are similarities in symptomatology across different HCoVs, particularly between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Common neurological manifestations include fatigue, headache, and smell/taste disorders. Additionally, clinicians need to be attentive for at least five classes of neurological complications: (1) Cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke and macro/micro-hemorrhages, (2) encephalopathies, (3) para-/postinfectious immune-mediated complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, (4) (meningo-)encephalitis, potentially with concomitant seizures, and (5) neuropsychiatric complications such as psychosis and mood disorders. Our systematic review highlights the need for vigilance regarding neurological complications in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoVs, especially since some complications may result in chronic disability. Neuroimaging protocols should be designed to specifically screen for these complications. Therefore, we propose practical imaging guidelines to facilitate the diagnostic workup and monitoring of patients infected with HCoVs.","Almqvist, Jesper; Granberg, Tobias; Tzortzakakis, Antonios; Klironomos, Stefanos; Kollia, Evangelia; Öhberg, Claes; Martin, Roland; Piehl, Fredrik; Ouellette, Russell; Ineichen, Benjamin V",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,690,20

Three pathways were created to allow patients to undergo urgent elective operations in NHS Tayside as soon as it was deemed safe to do so. METHODS: We examined elective orthopaedic activity in NHS Tayside during and immediately after the Scottish lockdown. Elective operations performed between 27 March 2020 and 10 August 2020 were included and compared with cases performed between 27 March and 10 August in both 2018 and 2019. Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 30-day complications, and nosocomial infection rates of COVID-19. FINDINGS: Fewer elective operations were performed in 2020 (258) compared with 2019 (1196) and 2018 (1261). The rate of nosocomial infection in the 2020 cohort was 0%. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%. Over 98% of patients agreed to undergo surgery after a detailed consenting process. INTERPRETATION: We were able to re-start a safe elective orthopaedic service in the early stages of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, compatible with the guidelines set by the Royal College of Surgery of England and the British Orthopaedic Association. Our findings will serve to reassure regions with sufficient resources that it is acceptable to restart elective surgery for urgent priority cases.

Increasing recognition of its cellular, molecular, and functional heterogeneity prompted us to review the latest advancements in cardiac health and disease at single-cell resolution. RECENT FINDINGS: Single-cell RNA profiling of cardiac lineage commitment events uncovered immense heterogeneity amongst ostensibly homogeneous cell populations. Classic cardiac transcription factors and new regulatory genes exhibit cell subtype-specific and temporally controlled expression patterns that serve the phenotypic changes in development, disease progression, and regeneration. Dissection of dynamically changing cell-cell communications and cardiac cell plasticity offers new opportunities in disease intervention and cardiac repair. Finally, updates in research models, platforms, and pipelines are continuously increasing the efficiency and reliability in data generation and interpretation. Transcriptional profiling of cardiac lineage cells, especially cardiomyocytes, has tremendously enriched our knowledge of the cellular milieu and the transcriptional network in the heart. Implementing technical standards and interrogating underexplored research areas will further our understanding of this organ and increase the likelihood of finding tractable therapeutic targets.","Zhou, Bingying; Wang, Li",Curr Cardiol Rep,690,1

Since the creation of SEM in 1945 (Pérez Prieto, NoticiaSEM 98:1, 2016) Latin American microbiologists have been participants, both as individuals and as members of the national associations that are currently integrated into the Latin American Association for Microbiology (ALAM). Thus, the histories of Spanish and Latin American microbiology (Chica and Skinner, Int Microbiol 13:159–164, 2010; Chica, Int Microbiol 11:221–225, 2008) have been closely linked over the last 75 years. In order to provide our perspective on the topic, we decided to provide answers to three questions: What are key aspects of the history of Spanish and Latin American Microbiology interactions? What have been some of our personal experiences in which these interactions shaped our careers? What is our outlook for the future of such interactions?","Ayala, Juan A.; Kolter, Roberto",Int Microbiol,690,18

The medical interview is still considered the most effective diagnostic tool available to physicians today, despite decades of rapid advancements in medical technology. When the physician-patient interaction is successful, outcomes are improved. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using an Appreciative Inquiry approach, which seeks to uncover strengths from positive experiences. The inquiry sought to identify the elements that comprise the participating physicians’ most successful patient interviews. Subsequent qualitative analysis revealed eight themes: social support, mutual respect, trust, active listening, relationships, nonverbal cues, empathy, and confidentiality. These themes do not each exist separately or in a vacuum from one another; they are in fact strongly interconnected and equally important. For instance, if a physician and a patient cannot at least maintain mutual respect, then building a relationship, or even trust, is impossible. Given the qualitative nature of this study, future quantitative research should seek to validate the results. As patients assume a more participatory role in modern medical encounters, communication and other soft skills will be key in satisfying patients and improving their medical outcomes.","Khawaja, Masud",Behav Sci (Basel),690,6

Sample pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used to detect community transmission of SARS CoV-2. Nevertheless, this procedure may decrease the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen dilution. We evaluated the efficacy of this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 using a sensitive commercially-available RT-PCR targeting SARS CoV-2 E and RdRp genes in a single reaction. A total of 20 mini-pools containing either 5 (n=10) or 10 (n=10) nasopharyngeal exudates collected in universal transport medium were made, each of which including a unique positive NP specimen. Positive specimens yielding CT <32 for the E gene (6 out of 10) or <35.2 for the RdRP gene (7 out of 10) were detected in mini-pools of both sizes. In contrast, most NP samples displaying CTs > 35.8 for the E gene or 35.7 for the RdRP gene remained undetected in mini-pools of 5 specimens (3/4 and 2/3, respectively) or in mini-pools of 10 samples (4/4 and 3/3, respectively.","Torres, Ignacio; Albert, Eliseo; Navarro, David",,690,21

Composite Indicators have increasingly been recognised as useful tools in the measurement of this concept. In the absence of rigorous and comprehensive empirical studies in Greece on this topic, the paper assesses and reveals the developmental transformations of the regional economies at NUTS 2 and 3 levels in the period 1991–2011. In this way, this study provides a more comprehensive and integrative perspective of regional development in Greece presenting empirical evidence not only from a country with large and persistent regional inequalities but also from a cohesion country of the European Union for which regional policy has been of critical importance in the last decades. Moreover, the study adds to the literature shedding light on an under-researched topic; the importance of spatial heterogeneity in the construction of Composite Indicators. The results reveal a heterogeneous regional pattern of development for the Greek case. The findings can be used by policymakers as a way to better understand and improve the regional development process.","Artelaris, Panagiotis",Qual Quant,690,31

An instant processing method was adopted in a ready-to-eat instant soup using egusi grit, hydrocolloid, and defatted flour. A D-optimal quadratic mixture model was used to study the effect of the independent variables (grit, flour, and hydrocolloid) qualities. The quadratic model was adequate to navigate the design space for taste and appearance. The numerical optimization for appearance and taste of instant soup (IES) was used to obtain the optimal soup mix of 10 g of hydrocolloid, 57.2 of defatted flour and 17 g of grits. Sixteen trace and five major mineral elements were found in the egusi soup, with a high concentration of phosphorus (1220.4, 1326.2 and 1277.9 mg/100 g), potassium (1220.4, 1326.2 and 1277.9 mg/100 g), magnesium (822.2, 905.3 and 863.70 mg/100 g), calcium (172.3, 190.9 and 183.4 mg/100 g) and iron (53.7, 57.5 and 29.5 mg/100 g), and for instant egusi soups from boiled egusi grit (IESBG), instant egusi grit from spherified grit (IESSG) and instant egusi grit from extruded grit (IESEG), respectively. The amino acid profile of instant egusi soup offers all essential amino acids necessary to nourish the body. Phosphorus content was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) high across the three soups: 1742, 1836 and 1838 mg/100 g for IESBG, IESSG, and IESEG, respectively; IESSG and IESEG were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in minerals when compared with IESBG.

A significant number of patients require admission to intensive care unit (ICU) services due to severe respiratory, thrombotic and septic complications and require long-term hospitalization. Neuromuscular weakness is a common complication in critically ill patients who are treated in ICUs and are mechanically ventilated. This complication is frequently caused by critical illness myopathy (CIM) or critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and leads to difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. It is thought to represent an important neurologic manifestation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). COVID-19 infection is known to trigger strong immune dysregulation, with an intense cytokine storm, as a result, the frequency of CIP is expected to be higher in this setting. The mainstay in the diagnosis of this entity beside the high level of clinical awareness is the electrophysiological examination that provides evidence of axonal motor and sensory polyneuropathy. The present article presents the case of a 54-year-old woman with severe COVID 19 infection who developed neuromuscular weakness, which turned out to be secondary to CIP and was treated successfully with a high dose of human intravenous immunoglobulins. Related to this case, we reviewed the relevant literature data regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical features of this important complication and discussed also the treatment options and prognosis.","Stoian, Adina; Bajko, Zoltan; Maier, Smaranda; Cioflinc, Roxana Adriana; Grigorescu, Bianca Liana; Moțățăianu, Anca; Bărcuțean, Laura; Balașa, Rodica; Stoian, Mircea",Exp Ther Med,690,20

Thus, they have caused huge losses to the swine-breeding industry worldwide. Nowadays, they are easily transmitted among the continents via vehicles, equipment, and cargo. Both viruses establish an infection in porcine enterocytes in the small intestine, and their spike (S) proteins play a key role in the virus-cell binding process under unfavorable conditions when the intestine with a low pH is filled with a thick layer of mucus and proteases. Sialic acid, proteases, and low pH are three main inducers of coronavirus infection. However, the details of how sialic acid and low pH affect virus binding to the host cell are not determined, and the functions of the proteases are unknown. This review emphasizes the role of three factors in the invasion of TGEV and PEDV into porcine enterocytes and offers more insights into Alphacoronavirus infection in the intestinal environment.","Yuan, Peng; Yang, Zhou; Song, Han; Wang, Kai; Yang, Yang; Xie, Luyi; Huang, Shilei; Liu, Jia; Ran, Lin; Song, Zhenhui",Intervirology,690,10

Deltacoronaviruses (DCoVs) have been identified in various songbird species and in leopard cats in China. In 2009, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was detected in fecal samples from pigs in Asia, but its etiologic role was not identified until 2014, when it caused major diarrhea outbreaks in swine in the United States. Studies have shown that PDCoV uses a conserved region of the aminopeptidase N protein to infect cell lines derived from multiple species, including humans, pigs, and chickens. Because PDCoV is a potential zoonotic pathogen, investigations of its prevalence in humans and its contribution to human disease continue. We report experimental PDCoV infection and subsequent transmission among poultry. In PDCoV-inoculated chicks and turkey poults, we observed diarrhea, persistent viral RNA titers from cloacal and tracheal samples, PDCoV-specific serum IgY antibody responses, and antigen-positive cells from intestines.","Boley, Patricia A.; Alhamo, Moyasar A.; Lossie, Geoffrey; Yadav, Kush Kumar; Vasquez-Lee, Marcia; Saif, Linda J.; Kenney, Scott P.",Emerg Infect Dis,690,24
