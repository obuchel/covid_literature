However, brain RAS is an independent form of RAS expressed locally in the brain, which is known to be involved in brain functions and disorders. There is strong evidence for a major involvement of excessive brain angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (Ang II)/Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT-1R) axis in increased activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in several brain disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated strong neuroprotective effects by blocking AT1R in these brain disorders. Additionally, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin (1–7)/Mas receptor (MASR), is another axis of brain RAS which counteracts the damaging effects of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on neurons in the brain. Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and activation of ACE2/Angiotensin (1–7)/MASR axis may serve as an exciting and novel method for neuroprotection in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here in this review article, we discuss the expression of RAS in the brain and highlight how altered RAS level may cause neurodegeneration. Understanding the pathophysiology of RAS and their links to neurodegeneration has enormous potential to identify potentially effective pharmacological tools to treat neurodegenerative diseases in the brain.","Abiodun, Oyesiji A.; Ola, Mohammad Shamsul",Saudi J Biol Sci,445,5

Unfortunately, effective therapeutics against ZIKV infection are not available thus far. METHODS: We screened the compounds collection consisting of 1789 FDA-approved drugs by a computational docking method to obtain anti-ZIKV candidate compounds targeting ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). SPR (BIAcore) assay was employed to demonstrate the candidate compounds’ direct binding to ZIKV RdRp, and polymerase activity assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect on ZIKV RdRp-catalyzed RNA synthesis. The antiviral effects on ZIKV in vitro and in vivo were detected in infected cultured cells and in Ifnar1(−/−) mice infected by ZIKV virus using plaque assay, western blotting, tissue immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Here, we report that a first-in-class macrocyclic antibiotic, which has been clinically used to treat Clostridium difficile infection, fidaxomicin, potently inhibits ZIKV replication in vitro and in vivo. Our data showed that fidaxomicin was effective against African and Asian lineage ZIKV in a wide variety of cell lines of various tissue origins, and prominently suppressed ZIKV infection and significantly improved survival of infected mice. In addition, fidaxomicin treatment reduced the virus load in the brains and testes, and alleviated ZIKV-associated pathological damages, such as paralysis, hunching, and neuronal necrosis in the cerebra. Furthermore, our mechanistic study showed that fidaxomicin directly bound ZIKV NS5 protein and inhibited the RNA synthesis-catalyzing activity of ZIKV RdRp. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that fidaxomicin may represent an effective anti-ZIKV agent. In the light that fidaxomicin is already a clinically used drug, there might be a promising prospect in the development of fidaxomicin to be an antiviral therapeutic.","Yuan, Jie; Yu, Jianchen; Huang, Yun; He, Zhenjian; Luo, Jia; Wu, Yun; Zheng, Yingchun; Wu, Jueheng; Zhu, Xun; Wang, Haihe; Li, Mengfeng",BMC Med,445,1

We hypothesized that in bat white-nose syndrome (WNS), species-specific host–pathogen interactions may partly explain varying disease outcomes among host species. We characterized bat and pathogen transcriptomes in paired samples of lesion-positive and lesion-negative wing tissue from bats infected with Pseudogymnoascus destructans in three parallel experiments. The first two experiments analyzed samples collected from the susceptible Nearctic Myotis lucifugus and the less-susceptible Nearctic Eptesicus fuscus, following experimental infection and hibernation in captivity under controlled conditions. The third experiment applied the same analyses to paired samples from infected, free-ranging Myotis myotis, a less susceptible, Palearctic species, following natural infection and hibernation (n = 8 sample pairs/species). Gene expression by P. destructans was similar among the three host species despite varying environmental conditions among the three experiments and was similar within each host species between saprophytic contexts (superficial growth on wings) and pathogenic contexts (growth in lesions on the same wings). In contrast, we observed qualitative variation in host response: M. lucifugus and M. myotis exhibited systemic responses to infection, while E. fuscus up-regulated a remarkably localized response. Our results suggest potential phylogenetic determinants of response to WNS and can inform further studies of context-dependent host–pathogen interactions.","Davy, Christina M.; Donaldson, Michael E.; Bandouchova, Hana; Breit, Ana M.; Dorville, Nicole A.S.; Dzal, Yvonne A.; Kovacova, Veronika; Kunkel, Emma L.; Martínková, Natália; Norquay, Kaleigh J.O.; Paterson, James E.; Zukal, Jan; Pikula, Jiri; Willis, Craig K.R.; Kyle, Christopher J.",,445,22

Then, the vaccination and infection experiments (n = 50) were set as seven groups. The survival rate (70%) in ORF25/CCL35.2 group was highest. The highest specific antibody levels were found in ORF25/CCL35.2 group in major immune tissues by qRT-PCR, and confirmed in serum by ELISA assay, antibody neutralization titer, and serum incubation-infection experiments. Three crucial innate immune indices, namely C3 content, lysozyme, and total superoxide dismutase (TSOD) activities, were highest in ORF25/CCL35.2 group in serum. pcORF25/pcCCL35.2 can effectively up-regulate mRNA expressions of some important immune genes (IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-γ2, and viperin), and significantly suppress CyHV-2 replication in head kidney and spleen tissues. The minimal tissue lesions can be seen in ORF25/CCL35.2 group in gill, spleen, and trunk kidney tissues by histopathological examination.

We analyzed the association of clinical and laboratory variables with DVT to evaluate the risk of DVT in patients after AIS. AIS patients admitted to the Changsha Central Hospital between January 2017 and December 2019 with length of stay in hospital ≥7 days were included. Clinical and laboratory variables for DVT at baseline were collected, and the diagnosis of DVT was confirmed by ultrasonography. Independent factors were developed by Multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 101 patients were included in the study. The in-hospital incidence of DVT after AIS was 19.8%(20/101). The average level of D-dimer when DVT detected was significant increased around 4-fold than that on admission (P < .001). Pulmonary infection (odds ratio [OR] = 5.4, 95%CI:1.10–26.65, P = .037)) and increased muscle tone (OR = 0.11, 95%CI:0.02–0.58, P = .010) as independent relevant factors for DVT were confirmed. Pulmonary infection as a risk factor and increased muscle tone as a protective factor for DVT were identified in patients after AIS. The level of D-dimer which increased around 4-fold compared to the initial level could be an indicator for DVT occurrence.","Huang, Yucai; Guo, Cuirong; Song, Kun; Li, Changluo; Ding, Ning",Medicine (Baltimore),445,1

METHODS: Newborns with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome aged 0–28 days and gestational age ≥36 weeks were included in the study if their cases were managed with non-extra corporal membrane oxygenation treatments. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they died before discharge. Predictors of non-extra corporal membrane oxygenation treatment failure were sought, and the threshold of predictors was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were included in the study. A total of 77 (74.8%) survived hospitalization and were discharged, whereas 26 (25.2%) died. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of oxygen index, pH, base excess, and combinations of these indicators demonstrated the advantage of the combination of oxygen index and base excess over the others variables regarding their predictive ability. The area under the curve for the combination of oxygen index and base excess was 0.865. When the cut-off values of oxygen index and base excess were 30.0 and −7.4, respectively, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting death were 77.0% and 84.0%, respectively. The model with base excess added a net reclassification improvement of 0.090 to the model without base excess. CONCLUSION: The combination of oxygen index and base excess can be used as a predictor of outcomes in neonates receiving non-extra corporal membrane oxygenation treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. In neonates with acute respiratory distress syndrome, if oxygen index >30 and base excess <−7.4, non-extra corporal membrane oxygenation therapy is likely to lead to death.","Wu, Hui; Hong, Xiaoyang; Qu, Yangming; Liu, Zhenqiu; Zhao, Zhe; Liu, Change; Ji, Qiong; Wang, Jie; Xueli, Quan; Jianwei, Sun; Cheng, Dongliang; Feng, Zhi-Chun; Yuan, Shi",J Pediatr (Rio J),445,17

The stipulation of expert advice for disease identification is also a challenge for the farmers. The traditional techniques adopted for plant disease detection require more human intervention, are unhandy for farmers, and have a high cost of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Therefore, there is a requirement for automating plant disease detection and classification. Deep learning and IoT-based solutions are proposed in the literature for plant disease detection and classification. However, there is a huge scope to develop low-cost systems by integrating these techniques for data collection, feature visualization, and disease detection. This research aims to develop the ‘Automatic and Intelligent Data Collector and Classifier’ framework by integrating IoT and deep learning. The framework automatically collects the imagery and parametric data from the pearl millet farmland at ICAR, Mysore, India. It automatically sends the collected data to the cloud server and the Raspberry Pi. The ‘Custom-Net’ model designed as a part of this research is deployed on the cloud server. It collaborates with the Raspberry Pi to precisely predict the blast and rust diseases in pearl millet. Moreover, the Grad-CAM is employed to visualize the features extracted by the ‘Custom-Net’. Furthermore, the impact of transfer learning on the ‘Custom-Net’ and state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19 is shown in this manuscript. Based on the experimental results, and features visualization by Grad-CAM, it is observed that the ‘Custom-Net’ extracts the relevant features and the transfer learning improves the extraction of relevant features. Additionally, the ‘Custom-Net’ model reports a classification accuracy of 98.78% that is equivalent to state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19. Although the classification of ‘Custom-Net’ is comparable to state-of-the-art models, it is effective in reducing the training time by 86.67%. It makes the model more suitable for automating disease detection. This proves that the proposed model is effective in providing a low-cost and handy tool for farmers to improve crop yield and product quality.","Kundu, Nidhi; Rani, Geeta; Dhaka, Vijaypal Singh; Gupta, Kalpit; Nayak, Siddaiah Chandra; Verma, Sahil; Ijaz, Muhammad Fazal; Woźniak, Marcin",Sensors (Basel),445,1

In this study, three metal elements (Ag, Fe, and Gd) were doped to nano-TiO(2) material respectively (content: 0.4%, 0.7%, and 1.0%) to improve inactivation effect of Escherichia coli and Enterococci in ballast water. Experimental results indicate that compared with the sole ultraviolet (UV) and the UV and original nano-TiO(2), the UV and metal-doped nano-TiO(2) increased the bacterial inactivation rate to different extents. For each metal element, high external metal content (1.0%) corresponded to high inactivation effort. The doping of Ag resulted in optimal inactivation effort, and the addition of Fe and Gd caused unobvious effort. At the end of the inactivation process (20 s), the UV and 1% Ag-doped nano-TiO(2) reached the highest logarithmic sterilization rates (0.915 for Escherichia coli and 0.805 for Enterococcus).

Reachability analysis over nonlinear dynamical systems asks if a given set of target states can be reached, starting from an initial set of states. This is solved by computing conservative over approximations of the reachable set using abstract domains to represent these approximations. However, most approaches must tradeoff the level of conservatism against the cost of performing analysis, especially when the number of system variables increases. This makes reachability analysis challenging for nonlinear systems with a large number of state variables. Our approach works by constructing a dependency graph among the variables of the system. The tree decomposition of this graph builds a tree wherein each node of the tree is labeled with subsets of the state variables of the system. Furthermore, the tree decomposition satisfies important structural properties. Using the tree decomposition, our approach abstracts a set of states of the high dimensional system into a tree of sets of lower dimensional projections of this state. We derive various properties of this abstract domain, including conditions under which the original high dimensional set can be fully recovered from its low dimensional projections. Next, we use ideas from message passing developed originally for belief propagation over Bayesian networks to perform reachability analysis over the full state space in an efficient manner. We illustrate our approach on some interesting nonlinear systems with low treewidth to demonstrate the advantages of our approach.","Sankaranarayanan, Sriram",Computer Aided Verification,445,24

Methods: Members of area-based and community of interest COVID-19 support groups in the Bristol conurbation were invited to complete an online survey. Of 1,255 people who clicked on the survey link, 862 responded; of these, 539 responses were eligible for analysis. Results: Respondents reported providing a wide range of support that went beyond health information, food and medical prescription assistance, to include raising morale through humour, creativity and acts of kindness and solidarity. A substantial proportion felt that they had become more involved in neighbourhood life following the lockdown and had an interest in becoming more involved in future. Neighbour support spanned all adult age groups, including older people categorised as being at-risk to the virus. With respect to most measures, there were no differences in the characteristics of support between respondents in areas of higher and lower deprivation. However, respondents from more deprived areas were more likely to state that they were involved in supporting certain vulnerable groups.

Through a series of interwoven tales, I discuss my own journey of leadership development and offer an analysis of the value of dedicated courses and the importance of providing this to the wider workforce. STORY OF SELF: I am a doctor in training and was among the first three cohorts placed onto the new Rosalind Franklin programme, organised by the NHS Leadership Academy. I share my key reflections of the impact of this course on my personal and professional development. STORY OF US: My cohort contained professionals from a diverse range of backgrounds—their challenges, views and insights contrasted greatly with my own. Having the protected time to build trust, form teams and discuss issues that crossed organisational boundaries provided novel insights that helped all of us. STORY OF NOW: As the COVID-19 pandemic has taken hold, we are in a state of extreme flux. As a result, I have become aware of how important it is to marry expertise with generalist skills and knowledge of the wider healthcare system. Enduring the initial surge of COVID-19 was about staff working together and blending specialism with generalist pragmatism. The ability to harness and sustain this type of working will represent a legacy from COVID-19 that is positive and one which galvanises our greatest asset—the talents and experiences of our diverse workforce—in order to meet future healthcare challenges.","Chen, Yang",,445,24

Bei seltenen Erkrankungen wie der PCD oder dem Alpha-1-Antitrypsinmangel ist die Kenntnis der Symptome besonders wichtig. Bei den entzündlichen Atemwegserkrankungen dominieren virale Erreger als Auslöser, weswegen häufig eine antibiotische Behandlung nicht notwendig ist. Durch eine Überlappung relevanter Symptome muss bei ungewöhnlichen Verläufen auch an das Vorliegen eines Immundefekts gedacht werden. Das Asthma bronchiale ist die häufigste chronische Atemwegserkrankung im Kindes- und Jugendalter. Eine obstruktive Ventilationsstörung kann auch, jedoch wesentlich seltener, durch eine exogen allergische Alveolitis oder eine Bronchiolitis obliterans verursacht werden. Interstitielle Lungenerkrankungen gehen hingegen mit einer restriktiven Ventilationsstörung einher. Zu den kinderpneumologischen Notfällen gehören die Fremdkörperaspiration und die Epiglottitis sowie der Pneumothorax. Bei Säuglingen, Kindern und Jugendlichen aller Altersgruppen sind zahlreiche organische und nichtorganische Schlafstörungen bekannt. Leitsymptome wie nächtliches Schnarchen, Ein- und Durchschlafstörungen, Albträume, Enuresis, kognitive Leistungseinschränkungen oder auch arterielle Hypertonie oder Minderwuchs können darauf hinweisen.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients presenting with NSTI were prospectively followed up in an attempt to identify factors that were significantly associated with mortality. RESULTS: There were a total of 86 patients [65 males (75.6%) and 21 females (24.4%)] with an overall mortality of 33.7% (29 patients). The average age was 50.37 years and trauma was the commonest aetiology (34 patients, 66.7%). The average duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 10.56 days; the lower limb was most commonly involved (62 patients, 72.09%). Fifty nine patients had comorbidities (commonest being diabetes mellitus in 41). Age above 50 years, symptoms for more than 8.5 days, involved surface area more than 15.5%, of the total body surface, on-admission pulse rate more than 99 beats/minute, systolic blood pressure less than 103 mm Hg, Glasgow scale less than 12, need for inotropes, low hemoglobin, high leukocyte counts, uraemia, deranged coagulation, low serum albumin, and high levels of lactic acid were significant for mortality. On multivariate analysis, only age above 50 years, presence of acidosis and low serum albumin significantly affected survival. CONCLUSION: NSTI carry high mortality. The identification of potential risk factors associated with mortality might help in guiding and optimizing the management of patients who present with NSTI.","Kumar, Tarun; Kaushik, Robin; Singh, Simrandeep; Sharma, Rajeev; Attri, Ashok",Hell Cheirourgike,445,10

A platform consists of a platform core (such as a smartphone operating system, a marketplace or a music streaming service) which is controlled by the platform owner who orchestrates the relationship between customers and providers (e.g. the distribution of goods, apps or music to end-users). Recently, the utilization and monetization of data has been significantly increasing. While some sources report the existence of data platforms as technical repositories to distribute data, the literature is sparse in discussing the role of data in platform ecosystems or outlining the existence of data platform ecosystems. By combining the technical concept of a data platform with the one of a platform ecosystem, a data platform ecosystem emerges. It comprises a platform ecosystem that facilitates the recombination and exchange of data around a stable core between a wide range of complements of data providers and prospective customers. To understand the characteristics of data platform ecosystems, we will elaborate on the concepts of data modularity, data quality, disposal and usage rights of data as well as ways to address the information paradox inherent to data.

The term ‘triple jeopardy’ has been coined to identify that older people with frailty and diabetes are at particular risk from the virus. Government figures for non‐COVID deaths from March to May 2020 show a 20–50% increase in those >70 years but lack of testing capacity may have led to under‐reporting of the virus. There has undoubtedly been a catastrophe in care homes, with 40% of total COVID‐19 deaths occurring in this setting. Whether frailty poses a greater risk than age alone is uncertain, with observational studies producing conflicting results. NICE guidance to include assessment of frailty in clinical decision making may have introduced study bias. Diabetes adds additional risk, with 33% of all hospital deaths occurring in people with diabetes: hazard ratio 3.51 for type 1 diabetes and 2.03 for type 2. The majority of those who died were >70 years (60.9% type 1 and 79.2% type 2). Poor glycaemic control is associated with increased risk. A 19th century definition of triple jeopardy defined gender, race and poverty as the dominant factors and these remain just as relevant in the COVID‐19 era.

We conducted an experiment to examine how influencers’ posts affect Chinese millennial consumers’ acceptance of new products. We used a 2 (influencer type: celebrity versus general public) × 2 (sponsorship display status: display versus no display) × 2 (product exposure method: exposure versus no exposure) factorial design. The findings reveal that the social media posts that made consumers most likely to accept a new product were created by a general public influencer and did not include a display of any sponsorship affiliation with the product. Additionally, there was a significant interplay between the influencer type, sponsorship display status, and product exposure method regarding consumers’ acceptance intention toward a new product. A consumer was most likely to accept and purchase a new product when three factors (general public influencer, sponsorship displayed, and product exposed) were combined.

Yet recent trends toward freelancing and technological connectivity make scope economies especially timely in addressing structural challenges to artist-led incubators. This paper offers a conceptual framework for cooperative strategies that employ economies of scope both in the economic sense of joint production and in the financial sense of risk pooling. This framework distinguishes franchise, federation, and resource-sharing organizational structures as developed through case studies of two US-based organizations: ArtBuilt and REC (Resources for Every Creator), placed in a larger context of cooperative organizational strategy in the USA and Europe. The proposed strategies of cooperative networks (quasi-franchises, federations, or resource-sharing networks) also draw on a literature of spatial agglomeration in creative industries. The framework leads to more speculative ideas of “balance-sheet philanthropy” through credit backstopping by foundations, and of novel investment trusts that can be piloted across a range organizations including foundations, grant-makers, artist residency programs, and even for-profit companies engaged in reinsurance.

We exploit the variation in the interaction of the score for the transparency of the local government in a specific province, the district-sector share of enterprises engaging in bribe payment, and the sector average size of the enterprise owner’s social network that are public officers as an exogenous variation in the likelihood of engaging in bribe payment. The results of the analysis reveal that when an enterprise pays bribe, it reduces the wages of its employees by approximately 27.6% (mostly for those within the highest wage bracket). Employees’ membership of a trade union, enterprise’ performance, capacity for inter-jurisdictional mobility, investment in human capital development, and formality status are likely operative channels of impact. Plain English Summary Enterprises’ engagement in bribe payment has negative impacts on the wages of employees. Corruption and bribe payment are endemic in many developing countries and they come at a cost to the broader society. Several studies have been conducted on how corruption impacts the welfare of individuals and households, the productivity, and effective and efficient functioning of firms and government, but we contribute to this debate by considering how bribe payment at the firm level affects employees’ welfare. We argue that bribe payment by an enterprise has potential effects on the wages and other non-monetary compensations of their employees. Depending on the size of the bribe and the profit level of the enterprise, bribe payment may reduce or improve an enterprises’ cash flow. In an event that the enterprise incurs a cost for paying bribe, it may transfer the cost to its employees by either cutting their wages or adjusting other pecuniary benefits that they receive. On the other hand, if the enterprise benefits from paying bribe, employees’ wages and other benefits could either increase as a spillover effect or remain unchanged depending on several factors, including the enterprise’s appetite for further bribe payment in anticipation of reaping more benefits in the long term. We use a unique dataset from the survey of Vietnamese small- and medium-scale manufacturing enterprises to validate these propositions and the channels through which they operate. The results of the analysis show that when an enterprise pays bribe, it reduces the wages of its employees (mostly for those within the highest wage bracket) by approximately 27.6%. Our result further shows that employees’ membership of a trade union, an enterprise’s performance and its capacity to move between different jurisdictions of operation, investment in human capital development, and formality status are the potential channels through which the identified impact operates. These findings support the need for anti-corruption policies, which could have other spillover effects on decent labor outcomes in Vietnam and other developing countries.","EFOBI, Uchenna; VO, Xuan VINH; ORKOH, Emmanuel",Small Bus Econ,445,22

Two types of stimuli were developed for the experiments: consumers’ VR store experience (106 data) (i.e., having respondents experience 360-degree-based VR store videos recorded at a fashion retailer) and store website experience (107 data) (i.e., having respondents experience the same store’s website). The results revealed that relative to an ordinary store website, consumers’ VR store experience evoked positive emotions and increased perceived store attractiveness. This study also discovered that store familiarity does not moderate the relationship between the two store experience types and evoked emotions, implying that VR technology is effective regardless of consumers’ familiarity with a store. Text analytics were also utilized, providing additional insights about their VR store experiences.

METHOD: The VFC was implemented and assessed using 3 PDSA cycles. Initially, a paper referral system was introduced along with treatment pathways. Subsequently an electronic referral system was established. The 3(rd) PDSA cycle involved training A&E staff on referrals and treatment pathways. At each stage the number of VFC referrals and clinic follow-ups were measured. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a telephone survey with a random sample of 30 patients. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in face-to-face follow-ups between pre-VFC (Total:4083, Average:86.87) and post-VFC (Total:713, Average:35.65) p-value<0.0001. There was a statistically significant increase in patient satisfaction after the implementation of the electronic referral system and staff re-training(9.25) compared to paper referrals(8.23), p-value=0.02064. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the VFC successfully reduced the number of face-to-face follow-ups while maintaining patient satisfaction. Thus, it is an effective alternative to conventional fracture clinics. A similar model can be introduced at other hospitals to minimise in-person consultations and risk of transmission, while standardising patient care. It has also highlighted the importance of appropriate technological infrastructure, staff training and service evaluation.","Erotocritou, M; Overton, A; Ang, W W; Walker, M; Burns, S; Berber, O",Br J Surg,445,16

AIM: To explore medical students’ perceptions of their learning experience during the undergraduate psychiatry late clinical rotation (PLCR) at Stellenbosch University (SU) and to use the findings to make possible recommendations regarding curriculum renewal. SETTING: In recognition of this, the Department of Psychiatry at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of SU is reviewing its current teaching and learning practices. METHODS: Data were collected from two focus groups. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: ‘learning in the clinical context’, ‘gaining knowledge’ and ‘generational needs’. Whilst several suggestions were made for potential improvement, the participants still endorsed that the PLCR does provide them with a good learning experience in psychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that these perceptions are from a group of millennials, the insights arising from the ‘generational needs’ theme were especially valuable. To bridge the generational gap and develop a curriculum that will not only meet the standards expected by educators but also achieve acceptance from learners, future research with a specific focus on clinical teachers’ perceptions is needed.","Smit, Inge M.; Volschenk, Mariette; Koen, Liezl",S Afr J Psychiatr,445,16

To mitigate this devastating effect the inception of artificial intelligence into medical health care is mandatory. This study aims to present the educational perspective of Covid-19 and forecast the number of confirmed and death cases in the USA, India, and Brazil along with the discussion of endothelial dysfunction in epithelial cells and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) with the Covid-19. Three different deep learning based experimental setups have been framed to forecast Covid-19. Models are (i) Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (ii) Convolutional LSTM (iii) Proposed ensemble of Convolutional and Bi-directional LSTM network are known as CoBiD-Net ensemble. The educational perspective of Covid-19 has been given along with an architectural discussion of multi-organ failure due to intrusion of Covid-19 with the cell receptors of the human body. Different classification metrics have been calculated using all three models. Proposed CoBiD-Net ensemble model outperforms the other two models with respect to accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Using CoBiD-Net ensemble, accuracy for Covid-19 cases ranges from 98.10 to 99.13% with MAPE ranges from 0.87 to 1.90. This study will help the countries to know the severity of Covid-19 concerning education in the future along with forecasting of Covid-19 cases and human body interaction with the Covid-19 to make it the self-replicating phenomena.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective tolerability study in 18 critically ill patients with a high protein formula (high protein-to-energy (HP:E) formula = Fresubin® Intensive; HPG) compared to a contemporary matched conventional therapy group (CTG). The primary outcome was GI intolerance defined as ≥300 ml daily gastric residual volume (GRV), vomiting, or diarrhea on days 1 and 2. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of patients reaching their protein target on day 4 and overall protein intake. RESULTS: Groups were comparable regarding demographic characteristics, disease severity, organ failures, mechanical ventilation, and NUTRIC score at baseline. Eighteen patients completed the 4-day feeding period. The number of events of GRV of ≥300 ml/day was equal in both groups (33.3%). The incidence of diarrhea and vomiting was low in the HPG (two patients concerned). EN did not need to be discontinued due to intolerance in any group. Seventy-two percent of patients reached protein targets ≥1.3 g/kgBW/d within 4 days after initiation of enteral feeding, which was superior to the CTG (33%). Post-hoc testing showed group differences of protein intake between HPG and CTG were significant at t = 72 h and t = 96 h. Energy targets were met in both groups. CONCLUSION: The HP:E formula containing 33% whey protein hydrolysate is well tolerated in this tolerability study. Due to the HP:E ratio protein targets can be reached faster. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm preliminary results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02678325.

Loss of conformational stability and decreased enzymatic activity in PAH variants result in the autosomal recessive disorder phenylketonuria (PKU), characterized by developmental and psychological problems if not treated early. One current therapeutic approach to treat PKU is based on pharmacological chaperones (PCs), small molecules that can displace the folding equilibrium of unstable PAH variants toward the native state, thereby rescuing the physiological function of the enzyme. Understanding the PAH folding equilibrium is essential to develop new PCs for different forms of the disease. We investigate here the urea and the thermal-induced denaturation of full-length PAH and of a truncated form lacking the regulatory and the tetramerization domains. For either protein construction, two distinct transitions are seen in chemical denaturation followed by fluorescence emission, indicating the accumulation of equilibrium unfolding intermediates where the catalytic domains are partly unfolded and dissociated from each other. According to analytical centrifugation, the chemical denaturation intermediates of either construction are not well-defined species but highly polydisperse ensembles of protein aggregates. On the other hand, each protein construction similarly shows two transitions in thermal denaturation measured by fluorescence or differential scanning calorimetry, also indicating the accumulation of equilibrium unfolding intermediates. The similar temperatures of mid denaturation of the two constructions, together with their apparent lack of response to protein concentration, indicate the catalytic domains are unfolded in the full-length PAH thermal intermediate, where they remain associated. That the catalytic domain unfolds in the first thermal transition is relevant for the choice of PCs identified in high throughput screening of chemical libraries using differential scanning fluorimetry.","Conde-Giménez, María; Sancho, Javier",Int J Mol Sci,445,32

To inform optimization of cancer genomics communication, we assessed oncologists’ experiences with return of genomic results (ROR), including their preparation/readiness for ROR, collaboration with genetic counselors (GCs) during ROR, and perceived challenges. The BASIC3 study paired pediatric oncologists with GCs to return results to patients’ families. We thematically analyzed 24 interviews with 12 oncologists at two post-ROR time points. Oncologists found pre-ROR meetings with GCs and geneticists essential to interpreting patients’ reports and communicating results to families. Most oncologists took a collaborative ROR approach where they discussed tumor findings and GCs discussed germline findings. Oncologists perceived many roles for GCs during ROR, including answering families’ questions and describing information in lay language. Challenges identified included conveying uncertain information in accessible language, limits of oncologists’ genetics expertise, and navigating families’ emotional responses. Oncologists emphasized how GCs’ and geneticists’ support was essential to ROR, especially for germline findings. GS can be successfully integrated into cancer care, but to account for the GC shortage, alternative ROR models and access to genetics resources will be needed to better support families and avoid burdening oncologists.","Hsu, Rebecca L.; Gutierrez, Amanda M.; Schellhammer, Sophie K.; Robinson, Jill O.; Scollon, Sarah; Street, Richard L.; Salisbury, Alyssa N.; Pereira, Stacey; Plon, Sharon E.; Malek, Janet; Parsons, D.

Contact tracing is crucial for effective disease control and is normally carried out by public health teams. Contact tracing staff are provided with rapid intensive training but are operating in a dynamic environment where processes and advice are adapting continuously. Real-time data is essential to inform strategy, coordinate interconnected processes, and respond to needs . Given that many contact tracers have been newly recruited or redeployed, they may not have significant experience in healthcare and may experience difficulties in managing the anxieties and emotional distress of the public. Aim: (i) identify emerging needs and issues and feed this information back to the Health Service Executive for updates to the COVID-19 Contact Management Programme (CMP); (ii) understand the psychological impact on contact tracers and inform the development of appropriate supports. Methods: We will use a mixed-methods approach. A brief online survey will be administered at up to three time points during 2021 to measure emotional exhaustion, anxiety, general health, and stress of contact tracing staff, identify tracing systems or processes issues, as well as issues of concern and confusion among the public. Interviews will also be conducted with a subset of participants to achieve a more in-depth understanding of these experiences. Observations may be conducted in contact tracing centres to document processes, practices, and explore any local contextual issues. Impact: Regular briefs arising from this research with data, analysis, and recommendations will aim to support the work of the CMP to identify problems and implement solutions. We will deliver regular feedback on systems issues; challenges; and the psychological well-being of contact tracing staff.","O'Donovan, Róisín; Buckley, Claire; Crowley, Philip; Fulham-McQuillan, Hugh; Gilmore, Brynne; Martin, Jennifer; McAuliffe, Eilish; Moore, Gemma; Nicholson, Emma; Ní Shé, Éidín; O'Hara, Mary Clare; Segurado, Ricardo; Sweeney, Mary Rose; Wall, Patrick; De Brún, Aoife",HRB Open Res,445,0

However, they require modifications to authoring and editorial processes and pose technical and publishing challenges. Several teams within Cochrane and the international Living Evidence Network have been piloting living systematic reviews. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation with participants involved in six LSRs (three Cochrane and three non-Cochrane). Up to three semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 participants involved with one or more of the pilot LSRs. Interviews explored participants' experiences contributing to the LSR, barriers and facilitators to their conduct and opportunities for future development. Pilot team members also completed monthly surveys capturing time for key tasks and the number of citations screened for each review. RESULTS Across the pilot LSRs, search frequency was monthly to three-monthly, with some using tools such as machine learning and Cochrane Crowd to screen searches. Varied approaches were used to communicate updates to readers. The number of citations screened varied widely between the reviews, from three to 300 citations per month. The amount of time spent per month by the author team on each review also varied from 5 min to 32 h. Participants were enthusiastic to be involved in the LSR pilot. They highlighted the importance of a motivated and well-organised team; the value of technology enablers to improve workflow efficiencies; the need to establish reliable and efficient processes to sustain living reviews; and the potential for saving time and effort in the long run. Participants highlighted challenges with the current publication processes, managing ongoing workload and the lack of resources to support LSRs in the long term. CONCLUSIONS Findings to date support feasibility and acceptability of LSR production. There are challenges that need to be addressed for living systematic reviews to be sustainable and have maximum value. The findings from this study will be used in discussions with the Cochrane community, key decision makers and people more broadly concerned with LSRs to identify and develop priorities for scale-up.","Millard, Tanya; Synnot, Anneliese; Elliott, Julian; Green, Sally; McDonald, Steve; Turner, Tari",Systematic reviews,445,8

The identification of the intersegmental plane is one of the challenges. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG) angiography in VATS segmentectomy. METHODS Nineteen GGO patients were enrolled, and VATS segmentectomy with ICG near-infrared angiography were performed between July 2017 and December 2017. Conventional 3-port VATS was used. ICG was injected intravenously after dominant arties were ligated. Intersegmental plane was identified and divided by stapler and electrocautery. RESULTS All patients had perfect intersegmental plane visualization. The mean operation time was 140.8 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 23.7 mL. No complications due to ICG occurred. The mean chest tube duration was 4.6 days. No severe complications occurred in the perioperative period. The mean chest tube drainage duration was 4.6 days. Prolonged postoperative air leak (>5 days), which required no surgical intervention, occurred in 2 cases. There were no severe complications or in-hospital deaths. CONCLUSIONS VATS segmentectomy with ICG near-infrared angiography is a reasonable treatment option to treat small GGO in lung, especially due to its good surgical view maintenance.","Chen, Ruiji; Ma, Yongfu; Li, Chengrun; Li, Yunjing; Yang, Bo; Guo, Juntang; Feng, Changjiang; Chen, Siyu; Yao, Jie; Liang, Chaoyang; Liu, Yang",Surgical innovation,445,1

Trapping of the parent artery may have a risk of ischemic complications due to intracranial perfusion disorders. We successfully treated 24 patients with large CCAs using a flow diverter (Pipeline™ embolic device: PED), and this report discusses the safety and efficacy of this method. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty four patients (23 females, mean age 71.5 years old) with large CCAs, including 6 giant CCAs, were treated with a PED over three years. Under sufficient dual anti-platelet management, the PED was deployed over the orifice of the aneurysm. Two patients required multiple telescoping stents. Clinical and radiological states were checked with MRI at 1, 3 and 6 months post-surgically. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 6 months. RESULTS In all patients, PED was appropriately deployed. Stagnation of contrast with eclipse signs was observed post-angiogram in 21 cases. One patient requiring 5 telescoping stents experienced temporary ischemic symptoms. Fourteen patients experienced improvement of ocular motor impairment deficiency, including 6 patients who recovered. Angiograms at 6 months follow-up showed complete occlusion in 63% (12/19) of patients, and MRI showed reduction of aneurysm volume in 89% (17/19) of patients. CONCLUSION Flow diverters for large CCAs showed promising clinical and radiological efficacy. They can shrink the aneurysm and improve symptoms without sacrificing the parent artery. It will be necessary to summarize the cases and to verify the long-term results.","Miyachi, Shigeru; Hiramatsu, Ryo; Ohnishi, Hiroyuki; Yagi, Ryokichi; Kuroiwa, Toshihiko",Neurointervention,445,1

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective analytical cohort studies in these children if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. We duplicated inclusion decisions and resolved disagreement by discussion with other authors. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted outcome data using the following time point ranges, when available: RCTs: baseline to six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years; cohort studies: baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous.For the RCTs, concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability. Lower versus usual or modified total fat intake may have made little or no difference to weight over a six- to twelve month period (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; 1 RCT; n = 620; low-quality evidence), nor a two- to five-year period (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; 1 RCT; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Compared to controls, lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) probably decreased BMI in children over a one- to two-year period (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence), with no other differences evident across the other time points (two to five years: MD 0.00 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; 1 RCT; n = 541; greater than five years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; 1 RCT; n = 576; low-quality evidence). Lower fat intake probably slightly reduced total cholesterol over six to 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Lower fat intake probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over six to 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and over two to five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. However, lower total fat intake probably made little or no difference to HDL-C over a six- to 12-month period (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), nor a two- to five-year period (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, lower total fat intake probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children over a six- to 12-month period (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height over more than five years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Over half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions. Limited evidence from three trials that randomised children to a lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) versus usual or modified fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed small reductions in body mass index, total- and LDL-cholesterol at some time points with lower fat intake compared to controls, and no consistent differences in effects on weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or height. Associations in cohort studies that related total fat intake to later measures of body fatness in children were inconsistent and the quality of this evidence was mostly very low. Twenty-three out of 24 included studies were conducted in high-income countries, and may not be applicable in low- and middle-income settings. High-quality, longer-term studies are needed, that include low- and middle-income settings and look at both possible benefits and risks.","Naude, Celeste E; Visser, Marianne E; Nguyen, Kim A; Durao, Solange; Schoonees, Anel",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,445,1

To provide new insights into the genetic features of EV71 and the relationship between the overall codon usage pattern of this virus and that of humans, values for relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), codon adaptation index (CAI), and nucleotide composition were calculated and analyzed. The relationship between ENC values and (G+C)₃% suggests that, although nucleotide composition plays an important role in shaping the overall codon usage pattern of this virus, other factors also affect this pattern. In addition, the negative correlation between the CAI value and (G+C)₃% suggests that the secondary structure of the EV71 coding sequence caused by its nucleotide composition can affect gene expression. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between ENC and CAI, suggesting that gene expression does not play a role in shaping the overall codon usage pattern of EV71. The overall codon usage pattern of the EV71 virus is only partly similar to the general codon pattern of human, suggesting that, although EV71 has co-evolved with humans for extended periods, mutation pressure played an important role in shaping the virus's overall codon usage pattern. These results revealed that the EV71 virus has developed a subtle strategy during evolution for adapting to environmental changes in its host cells solely by means of mutation pressure.","Ma, M R; Hui, L; Wang, M L; Tang, Y; Chang, Y W; Jia, Q H; Wang, X H; Yan, W; Ha, X Q",Genetics and molecular research : GMR,445,16

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent CB ablation in our institution from June 2018. From June 2019, we have been consistently using FoE suture for hemostasis (FoE+ group), and before that conventional manual compression was utilized (FoE- group). Ablations were performed under uninterrupted oral anticoagulant strategy. Both femoral veins were punctured, and a single introducer was placed in each vein. In the FoE- group, after ablation, protamine was administered, and manual compression was applied. In the FoE+ group, the suture was placed in both groins without protamine administration and manual compression. All patients were in decubitus position until the next morning. RESULTS A total of 190 consecutive patients (73.2% male, 59.7 ± 11.0 years old) were evaluated, 90 being in the FoE+ group. There was no difference in the mean procedure duration between two groups (72.7 ± 23.1 min vs 73.7 ± 27.1 min, p = 0.784). However, the total lab time was significantly longer in FoE- group (132.9 ± 35.3 min vs 109.9 ± 32.6 min, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in complication rates. No major vascular complications were found in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS Utilization of FoE sutures for hemostasis seems to be a safe and effective after cryoballoon ablation. It abolishes the need for protamine administration which can cause serious adverse events. As manual compression is unrequired, EP lab workflow improves due to significantly shortened total lab time per patient.","Velagic, Vedran; Mugnai, Giacomo; Pasara, Vedran; Prepolec, Ivan; Puljevic, Mislav; Pezo-Nikolic, Borka; Puljevic, Davor; Samardzic, Jure; Cikes, Maja; Milicic, Davor",Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing,445,29

Although decreased in BAL, Th2 cytokine levels were higher in serum after DEX treatment. Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in BAL and serum were decreased in PRCV/DEX pigs early but increased later compared to those in phosphate-buffered saline-treated, PRCV-infected pigs, corresponding to a similar trend for lung lesions. PRCV infection increased T-cell frequencies in BAL, but DEX treatment of PRCV-infected pigs reduced frequencies of T cells; interestingly B and SWC3a(+) (monocytes/macrophages/granulocytes) cell frequencies were increased. DEX reduced numbers of PRCV-stimulated Th1 gamma interferon-secreting cells in spleen, tracheobroncheolar lymph nodes, and blood.

This article describes how digital health technologies are being or could be used for COVID-19 mitigation. It then proposes the National Emergency Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN), which would combine digital health technologies to address this and future crises. Methods: Subject matter experts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center examined the peer-reviewed literature and science/technology news to see what digital health technologies have already been or could be implemented to (1) support patients while limiting COVID-19 transmission, (2) increase health care providers' capability and capacity, and (3) predict/prevent future outbreaks. Results: Major technologies identified included telemedicine and mobile care (for COVID-19 as well as routine care), tiered telementoring, telecritical care, robotics, and artificial intelligence for monitoring. Several of these could be assimilated to form an interoperable scalable NETCCN. NETCCN would assist health care providers, wherever they are located, by obtaining real-time patient and supplies data and disseminating critical care expertise. NETCCN capabilities should be maintained between disasters and regularly tested to ensure continual readiness. Conclusions: COVID-19 has demonstrated the impact of a large-scale health emergency on the existing infrastructures. Short term, an approach to meeting this challenge is to adopt existing digital health technologies. Long term, developing a NETCCN may ensure that the necessary ecosystem is available to respond to future emergencies.","Scott, Benjamin K; Miller, Geoffrey T; Fonda, Stephanie J; Yeaw, Ronald E; Gaudaen, James C; Pavliscsak, Holly H; Quinn, Matthew T; Pamplin, Jeremy C",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,445,16

Our secondary objective was to estimate the psychometric properties of a brief Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ). Methods We conducted patient-finding exercise in our study areas through various means to obtain subjects with idiopathic epilepsy. We carefully examined each patient through a detailed case-history examination. Following that, we evaluated fear related to epilepsy by using Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in Epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ) across two broad domains: epilepsy and pharmacotherapy. Results The study obtained 52 subjects (39.0 years; 45.0% males, 70.0% married, 35.0% unqualified, 85.0% active epilepsy, 80.0% generalized seizures) with idiopathic epilepsy. The alpha coefficient was 92.8, with no item-specific coefficient of ≤0.91. The alpha coefficient was 0.90 and 0.93 for reporting a ""yes"" and ""no"" to the items, respectively. We obtained a two-factor structure of BG-FEQ that provided a cumulative variance of 83.6%. The majority (65.0%) reported at least one fear. The per-patient mean number of the fear element was 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-3.3), which differed significantly for males and females (1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.6 and 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, respectively, p=0.03). The most frequent fear was that of addiction and the bad effects of anti-seizure medications (both 45.0%). Upon bootstrap regression after constraining gender, the fear elements were associated with illiteracy, difficulty in understanding epilepsy and sleeping in a prone position. The sample power was 99.0%. Conclusion There was a significant representation of fear among those with idiopathic epilepsy, especially among the females, particularly the fear of brain tumour, premature death and more frequent/severe seizures over time. At least 65.0% of idiopathic subjects are likely to be affected by at least one fear. The essential mitigating approach should be the education of practitioners towards better identification and therapeutic handling of comorbid constructs, and also for the education of patients and their caregivers towards better awareness and prevention. There is also a need for formal Epilepsy Educators towards better awareness, therapeutic support and prevention of epilepsy.","Gharagozli, Kurosh; Lotfalinezhad, Elham; Amini, Fatemeh; Saii, Vida; Bhalla, Devender",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,445,1

COVID-19 specific biomarkers of cognitive impairment are currently lacking, but there is some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could preferentially and directly target the frontal lobes, as suggested by behavioral and dysexecutive symptoms, fronto-temporal hypoperfusion on MRI, EEG slowing in frontal regions, and frontal hypometabolism on 18F-FDG-PET imaging. We suggest that an inflammatory parainfectious process targeting preferentially the frontal lobes (and/or frontal networks) could be the underlying cause of these shared clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging findings in COVID-19 patients.

However, RCTs have become increasingly complex and costly, which is particularly challenging for independent investigator-initiated clinical trials (IICTs). IICTs have an essential role in clinical research, and it is important that efforts are made to ensure IICTs are adequately funded and are conducted cost-effectively. Objective To examine the practices and attitudes of Swiss stakeholders regarding IICT funding acquisition and cost management. Design, Setting, and Participants For this qualitative study, interviews were conducted in Switzerland between February and August 2020. The purposive sample comprised 48 stakeholders from 4 different groups: primary investigators (n = 27), funders and sponsors (n = 9), clinical trial support organizations (n = 6), and ethics committee members (n = 6). Main Outcomes and Measures Practices and attitudes of stakeholders regarding IICT funding acquisition and cost management were assessed using individual semistructured qualitative interviews. Interviews were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results After interviews with 48 IICT stakeholders (75% male presenting), these participants identified a systemic problem of IICTs being underfunded, which can lead to compromises being made regarding the quality and conduct of IICTs. Participants identified 2 overarching and interconnected groups of reasons why IICTs in Switzerland are regularly underfunded. First, it was reported that IICT budget estimations are often inaccurate because of poor planning and preparation, unforeseeable events, investigators intentionally underestimating budgets, and limited budget assessment and oversight. Second, with the exception of a specific IICT funding program by the Swiss National Science Foundation, it was reported that limited funding sources and unrealistic expectation of funders led to underlying challenges in getting IICTs fully funded. A number of measures that could help reduce the underfunding of IICTs were identified, including improving the support of investigators and IICTs, strengthening networking and guidance, harmonizing and simplifying bureaucracy, and increasing public funding of IICTs. Conclusions and Relevance This study highlights the inadequate expertise of Swiss stakeholders to correctly, systematically, and reproducibly calculate RCT budgets and the need for transparency on trial costs as well as training in budgeting practices. Limited financial resources for academic clinical research and issues regarding the professional planning and conduct of IICTs are persistent issues that many other countries also face.","McLennan, Stuart; Griessbach, Alexandra; Briel, Matthias",JAMA network open,445,31

However, functional adaptation, including RV pressure generation and systolic free-wall longitudinal mechanics, remains equivocal. This meta-analysis compared RV pressure and function in athletes and controls. METHODS A systematic review of online databases was conducted up to June 4, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed on RV systolic pressures, at rest and during exercise, tricuspid annular plane systolic displacement, myocardial velocity (S'), and global and regional longitudinal strain. Bias was assessed using Egger regression for asymmetry. Data were analyzed using random-effects models with weighted mean difference and 95% CI. RESULTS Fifty-three studies were eligible for inclusion. RV systolic pressure was obtained from 21 studies at rest (n=1043:1651; controls:athletes) and 8 studies during exercise (n=240:495) and was significantly greater in athletes at rest (weighted mean difference, 2.9 mmHg [CI, 1.3-4.5 mmHg]; P=0.0005) and during exercise (11.0 [6.5-15.6 mm Hg]; P<0.0001) versus controls. Resting tricuspid annular plane systolic displacement (P<0.0001) and S' (P=0.001) were greater in athletes. In contrast, athletes had similar RV free-wall longitudinal strain (17 studies; n=450:605), compared with controls but showed greater longitudinal apical strain (16 studies; n=455:669; 0.9%, 0.1%-1.8%; P=0.03) and lower basal strain (-2.5% [-1.4 to -3.5%]; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Functional RV adaptation, characterized by increased tricuspid annular displacement and velocity and a greater base-to-apex strain gradient, is a normal feature of the athlete's heart, together with a slightly elevated RV systolic pressure. These findings contribute to our understanding of RV in athletes and highlight the importance of considering RV function in combination with structure in the clinical interpretation of the athlete's heart.","Dawkins, Tony G; Curry, Bryony A; Wright, Stephen P; Meah, Victoria L; Yousef, Zaheer; Eves, Neil D; Shave, Rob E; Stembridge, Michael",Circulation.

The least vertical misalignment was observed with the slitlamp-marking device (mean 0.28 mm). There was no statistically significant difference in vertical misalignment between the 4 groups. CONCLUSIONS All marking devices showed a slight deviation to the horizontal reference meridian. Because small deviations of the meridian can result in a relevant reduction in the astigmatism-reducing effect with toric intraocular lenses, accurate marking of the cornea before surgery is critical due to the variable cyclotorsion caused by a change from the upright to the supine position.

METHODS One hundred and fifty women with pelvic floor disorders participated on one occasion, and 20 women returned for the same investigations by two different raters on 3 different days. At each session, PFM strength was assessed using palpation (both the modified Oxford Grading Scale and the Levator ani testing), manometry, and dynamometry; and PFM activation was assessed using sEMG. RESULTS The interrater reliability of manometry, dynamometry, and sEMG (both root-mean-square [RMS] and integral average) was high (Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient [CCC] = 0.95, 0.93, 0.91, 0.86, respectively), whereas the interrater reliability of both palpation grading scales was low (Cohen's Kappa [k] = 0.27-0.38). The intrarater reliability of manometry (CCC = 0.96), and dynamometry (CCC = 0.96) were high, whereas intrarater reliability of both palpation scales (k = 0.78 for both), and of sEMG (CCC = 0.79 vs 0.80 for RMS vs integral average) was moderate. The Bland-Altman plot showed good inter and intrarater agreement, with little random variability for all instruments. The correlations among palpation, manometry, and dynamometry were moderate (coefficient of determination [r2 ] ranged from 0.52 to 0.75), however, transperineal sEMG amplitude was only weakly correlated with all measures of strength (r2 = 0.23-0.30). CONCLUSIONS Manometry and dynamometry are more reliable tools than vaginal palpation for the assessment of PFM strength in women with pelvic floor disorders, especially when different raters are involved. The different PFM strength measures used clinically are moderately correlated; whereas, PFM activation recorded using transperineal sEMG is only weakly correlated with PFM strength. Results from perineal sEMG should not be interpreted in the context of reporting PFM strength.","Navarro Brazález, Beatriz; Torres Lacomba, María; de la Villa, Pedro; Sánchez Sánchez, Beatriz; Prieto Gómez, Virginia; Asúnsolo Del Barco, Ángel; McLean, Linda",Neurourology and urodynamics,445,1

We aimed to evaluate the patterns and effects of on-admission hyperglycemia and inflammatory response in a level 1 trauma center. We hypothesized that higher initial readings of blood glucose and cytokines are associated with severe injuries and worse in-hospital outcomes in trauma patients. METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted for adult trauma patients who were admitted and tested for on-admission blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18 and hs-CRP. Patients were categorized into four groups [non-diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic hyperglycemic (DH) and stress-induced hyperglycemic (SIH)]. The inflammatory markers were measured on three time points (admission, 24 h and 48 h). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for the correlation for the inflammatory markers. Pearson's correlation test and logistic regression analysis were also performed. RESULTS During the study period, 250 adult trauma patients were enrolled. Almost 13% of patients presented with hyperglycemia (50% had SIH and 50% had DH). Patients with SIH were younger, had significantly higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), higher IL-6 readings, prolonged hospital length of stay and higher mortality. The SIH group had lower Revised Trauma Score (p = 0.005), lower Trauma Injury Severity Score (p = 0.01) and lower GCS (p = 0.001). Patients with hyperglycemia had higher in-hospital mortality than the normoglycemia group (12.5% vs 3.7%; p = 0.02). A significant correlation was identified between the initial blood glucose level and serum lactate, IL-6, ISS and hospital length of stay. Overall rate of change in slope 88.54 (95% CI:-143.39-33.68) points was found more in hyperglycemia than normoglycemia group (p = 0.002) for IL-6 values, whereas there was no statistical significant change in slopes of age, gender and their interaction. The initial IL-6 levels correlated with ISS (r = 0.40, p = 0.001). On-admission hyperglycemia had an adjusted odds ratio 2.42 (95% CI: 1.076-5.447, p = 0.03) for severe injury (ISS > 12) after adjusting for age, shock index and blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS In trauma patients, on-admission hyperglycemia correlates well with the initial serum IL-6 level and is associated with more severe injuries. Therefore, it could be a simple marker of injury severity and useful tool for patient triage and risk assessment.

Current researches are not sufficient to understand the etiological and immunopathobiological parameters related to COVID-19 so as to have a therapeutic solution to the problem. METHODS A structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature has been carried out using focused review questions and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Further Standard tools were implied in order to appraise the quality of retrieved papers. The characteristic outcomes of screened research and review articles along with analysis of the interventions and findings of included studies using a conceptual framework have been described employing a deductive qualitative content analysis methodology. RESULTS This review systematically summarizes the immune-pathobiological characteristics, diagnosis, potential therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 based on the current published literature and evidence. The current review has covered 125 peer-reviewed articles, majority of which are from high-income technically developed countries providing the most recent updates about the current understanding of the COVID-19 bringing all the significant findings and related researches together at a single platform.

Resveratrol has been widely studied for several of its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and anti-oxidative effects. The regulation of SIRT-1 is thought to be related to the effects of resveratrol. As a downstream component of SIRT-1, NF-κB is one of the important signaling pathways that regulate the inflammatory response. Herein, we explored how treatment with resveratrol promoted recovery of motor function after SCI by activating the SIRT-1/NF-κB signaling pathway and inhibiting inflammation in rat models. Recovery of hind limb function was observed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale at different time points after SCI. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, Nissl staining and HE staining were utilized to observe the morphological characteristics of spinal cord tissue, as well as the expression of SIRT-1, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Resveratrol treatment promoted motor function recovery, increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and reduced loss of motor neurons and lesion size among rats after SCI. Meanwhile, inflammatory response was inhibited as the SIRT-1/NF-κB signaling pathway was modulated. These results suggest that resveratrol can help achieve neuroprotective effect by inhibiting inflammation, regulated by the SIRT-1/NF-κB signaling pathway.","Zhao, Haosen; Mei, Xifan; Yang, Dongfang; Tu, Guanjun",Neuroscience letters,445,23

Despite decades of research, an effective drug therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome remains elusive. The ideal pharmacotherapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome should demonstrate antiprotease activity and target injurious inflammatory pathways while maintaining host defense against infection. Furthermore, a drug with a reputable safety profile, low possibility of off-target effects, and well-known pharmacokinetics would be desirable. The endogenous 52-kd serine protease α1-antitrypsin has the potential to be a novel treatment option for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The main function of α1-antitrypsin is as an antiprotease, targeting neutrophil elastase in particular. However, studies have also highlighted the role of α1-antitrypsin in the modulation of inflammation and bacterial clearance. In light of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome is even more pertinent, and α1-antitrypsin has been implicated in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hogan, Grace; Geoghegan, Pierce; Carroll, Tomás P; Clarke, Jennifer; McElvaney, Oisín F; McElvaney, Oliver J; McElvaney, Noel G; Curley, Gerard F",Anesthesiology,445,29

Given the chemical nature of these compounds two features are always present. A portion or portions of the molecule that has little affinity for apolar surfaces and media and on the contrary a series of part or one large part that has considerable affinity for hydrophilic, polar or charged media and surfaces. A series of techniques are routinely used to probe the molecular interactions that can arise between components, such as the drug, a range of surface- active excipients and flavor compounds, for example terpenoids and the solvent or dispersion medium. RESULTS Fifty-eight papers were included in the review, a large number (16) being of theoretical nature and an equally large number (14) directly pertaining to medicine and pharmacy; alongside experimental data and phenomenological modelling. The review therefore simultaneously represents an amalgam of review article and research paper with routinely used or established (10) and well-reported methodologies (also included in the citations within the review). Experimental data included from various sources as diverse as foam micro-conductivity, interferometric measurements of surface adsorbates and laser fluorescence spectroscopy (FRAP) are used to indicate the complexity and utility of foams and surface soft matter structures for a range of purposes but specifically, here for encapsulation and incorporation of therapeutics actives (pharmaceutical molecules, vaccines and excipients used in medicaments). Techniques such as interfacial tensiometry, interfacial rheology (viscosity, elasticity and visco-elasticity) and nanoparticle particle size (hydrodynamic diameter) and charge measurements (zeta potential), in addition to atomic force and scanning electron microscopy have proven to be very useful in understanding how such elemental components combine, link or replace one another (competitive displacement). They have also proven to be both beneficial and worthwhile in the sense of quantifying the unseen actions and interplay of adsorbed molecules and the macroscopic effects, such as froth formation, creaming or sedimentation that can occur as a result of these interactions. CONCLUSION The disclosures and evaluations presented in this review confirm the importance of a theoretical understanding of a complex model of the molecular interactions, network and present a framework for the understanding of really very complex physical forms. Future therapeutic developers rely on an understanding of such complexity to garner a route to a more successful administration and formulation of a new generation of therapeutic delivery systems for use in medicine.","Sarker, Dipak K",Current drug discovery technologies,445,27

For treatment recommendations, it is important to know if the treatment benefit was universal. Objective To determine the outcomes among patients who may have a reduced effect of thrombectomy, including those who are older, have milder symptoms, or present late. Design, Setting, and Participants DEFUSE 3 was a randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial conducted from May 2016 to May 2017. This multicenter study included 38 sites in the United States. Of 296 patients who were enrolled in DEFUSE 3, 182 patients met all inclusion criteria and were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis, which was conducted in August 2017. These patients had acute ischemic strokes due to an occlusion of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery and evidence of salvageable tissue on perfusion computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The study was stopped early for efficacy. Interventions Endovascular thrombectomy plus medical management vs medical management alone. Main Outcomes and Measures Functional outcome at day 90, assessed on the modified Rankin Scale. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted proportional association between endovascular treatment and clinical outcome (shift in the distribution of modified Rankin Scale scores expressed as a common odds ratio) among patients of different ages, baseline stroke severities, onset-to-treatment times, locations of the arterial occlusion, and imaging modalities used to document the presence of salvageable tissue (computed tomography vs magnetic resonance imaging). Results This study included 182 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 70 [59-80] years; median [interquartile range] National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 16 [11-21], and 92 women [51%]). In the overall cohort, independent predictors of better functional outcome were younger age, lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and lower serum glucose level. The common odds ratio for improved functional outcome with endovascular therapy, adjusted for these variables, was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.8-5.4). There was no significant interaction between this treatment effect and age (P = .93), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (P = .87), time to randomization (P = .56), imaging modality (P = .49), or location of the arterial occlusion (P = .54). Conclusions and Relevance Endovascular thrombectomy, initiated up to 16 hours after last known well time in patients with salvageable tissue on perfusion imaging, benefits patients with a broad range of clinical features. Owing to the small sample size of this study, a pooled analysis of late time window endovascular stroke trials is needed to confirm these results.

We report the clinical features and treatment of a Chinese renal transplant recipient with COVID-19. A 46-year-old Chinese woman, who had a renal transplant in 2006 due to chronic glomerulonephritis, was admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University for fever, cough, and expectoration for more than 10 days and diarrhea for 3 days. At admission, her body temperature was 38.2 °C and pulse oxygen saturation was 96% under oxygen inhalation. There were decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Laboratory data revealed normal leucocyte count, a normal percentage of neutrophils, a normal percentage of lymphocytes, decreased lymphocyte count, elevated procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased levels of urea, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. COVID-19 was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab and sputum which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Chest CT revealed multiple patchy and flake ground-glass shadows in bilateral lung fields, and strip shadows in bilateral lower lobes. Treatment included antiviral (umifenovir, hydroxychloroquine), antibacterial (moxifloxacin), and other support therapies. Her symptoms, laboratory data, and chest CT showed trends of gradual improvement, while nasopharyngeal swabs were always positive for SARS-CoV-2.

This International Sexual Health And ReproductivE health (I-SHARE) study protocol manuscript describes a common plan for online national surveys and global comparative analyses. METHODS The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to better understand sexual and reproductive health in selected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate multinational comparisons. Participants will be recruited through an online survey link disseminated through local, regional and national networks. In each country, a lead organisation will be responsible for organising ethical review, translation and survey administration. The consortium network provides support for national studies, coordination and multinational comparison. We will use multilevel modelling to determine the relationship between COVID-19 and condomless sex, intimate partner violence, access to reproductive health services, HIV testing and other key items.

The results obtained demonstrate that the curing process depends on the nature of the alkyl residue of the ester group of cyanoacrylate molecules, being the heat of polymerization lower for the octyl derivative in comparison with the hexyl and butyl, and reaching a maximum temperature of 35 °C after a time of mixing with physiological fluids of 60-70 s. The cell behavior demonstrates that the three systems do not present toxicity for fibroblasts and low adhesion of cells, which is a positive result for application as tissue adhesives, especially for the fixation of abdominal polypropylene meshes for hernia repair. The animal experimentation indicates the excellent tolerance of the meshes fixed with the cyanoacrylic adhesives, during at least a period of 90 d, and guarantees a good adhesion for the application of hernia repair meshes.","Fernández-Gutiérrez, Mar; Rodriguez-Mancheño, Marta; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Pascual, Gemma; Bellón, Juan Manuel; Román, Julio San",Macromolecular bioscience,445,12

The objective of this prospective observational study was to assess the effect of CVVHDF on the pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin as maintenance therapy. METHODS Blood, urine, and dialysate samples were collected to measure teicoplanin levels. CVVHDF clearance (CLCVVHDF ), total clearance (CLTOTAL ), and volume of distribution (Vd) were calculated by simplex-linear modeling. The influence of CVVHDF dose on teicoplanin pharmacokinetics was assessed. FINDINGS Ten samples from eight patients were studied. Creatinine clearance was 3.4 ± 5.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 . Three patients were anuria. The dose for CVVHDF was 32.1 ± 7.0 mL/kg/h. Vd was 1.6 ± 0.7 L/kg. T1/2 was 100.1 ± 42.7 hours. CLTOTAL of teicoplanin was 11.9 ± 5.4 mL/min and CLCVVHDF was 5.8 ± 4.2 mL/min. Contribution of CLCVVHDF to CLTOTAL was 51.2% ± 23.6%. CLCVVHDF of individual teicoplanin varied widely. Large intra-occasion differences were also observed. Dose of CLCVVHDF did not influence overall CLTOTAL , Vd, or half-life. The proportion of CLTOTAL due to CLCVVHDF varied widely. It was high in some cases. DISCUSSION In patients receiving CVVHDF, there is great variability in teicoplanin pharmacokinetics which complicates empiric approach to dosing, suggesting the need for therapeutic drug monitoring.","Lim, Seung K; Lee, Sun A; Kim, Cheol-W; Kang, Eunjeong; Choi, Young H; Park, Inwhee",Hemodialysis international.

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of our prospectively maintained institutional database to identify all patients with recurrent CVS and treated with stent-retrievers between April 2011 and May 2017. All patients were initially treated with intra-arterial (IA) vasodilators and were subsequently re-treated with stent-retrievers if they developed recurrent vasospasm. Patients were categorized into two groups, those in which IA vasodilators were given again prior to the stent-retriever deployment (VD-first) and those in which the stent-retriever was deployed first and IA vasodilators were given subsequently (SR-first). RESULTS We identified 12 patients (7 females, mean age 54.9 years), 5 in the VD-first and 7 in the SR-first cohorts. Stent-retriever lumen dilatation was attempted in 53 segments (VD-first 14, SR-first 39). Stent-retriever deployment was technically feasible in all cases. Vasodilation occurred in 71.4% (10/14 segments) in the VD-first group and 82.1% (32/39 segments) in SR-first group. Additional treatment was required in 5 segments. There was no recurrent vasospasm in the SR-first group; however, 3 patients (60%) in the VD-first group showed recurrent vasospasm. No angiographical abnormality was found at long-term follow-up (7 patients, mean 29.1 months). CONCLUSION The use of stent-retrievers to treat cerebral vasospasm is technically feasible and can cause long-term vasodilatation; however, this effect is maximized if stent-retrievers are used prior to infusion of IA vasodilators.","Kwon, Hyon-Jo; Lim, Jeong-Wook; Koh, Hyeon-Song; Park, BumSoo; Choi, Seung-Won; Kim, Seon-Hwan; Youm, Jin-Young; Song, Shi-Hun",Clinical neuroradiology,445,19

The antimicrobial efficacies of the tested fabrics loaded with MC compound were evaluated against bioaerosols of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli O157:H7 utilizing a colony counting method. It was determined that both types of coated fabrics exhibited superior antimicrobial efficacy upon exposure to aerosol generation for 3 h. The effect of the coating on air permeability was found to be minimal. Samples were stable for a 6 month time period when they were stored in darkness. However, when the fabrics were exposed to fluorescent light, partial chlorine loss was observed. The MC-coated fabrics exhibited great potential for use in protective face masks and air filters to combat airborne pathogens.","Demir, Buket; Cerkez, Idris; Worley, S D; Broughton, R M; Huang, Tung-Shi",ACS applied materials & interfaces,445,19

Feelings depend on the interoceptive nervous system (INS), a collection of peripheral and central pathways, nuclei and cortical regions which continuously sense chemical and anatomical changes in the organism. How such humoral and neural signals come to generate conscious mental states has been a major scientific question. The answer proposed here invokes (1) several distinctive and poorly known physiological features of the INS; and (2) a unique interaction between the body (the 'object' of interoception) and the central nervous system (which generates the 'subject' of interoception). The atypical traits of the INS and the direct interactions between neural and non-neural physiological compartments of the organism, neither of which is present in exteroceptive systems, plausibly explain the qualitative and subjective aspects of feelings, thus accounting for their conscious nature.","Carvalho, Gil B; Damasio, Antonio","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",445,27

Utilizing more advanced technology including video communication, although available, was generally underutilized until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth presents the opportunity to bridge many divides including geographical and logistical challenges. Many acute pediatric conditions can be managed safely and effectively through telehealth especially when remote physical exam equipment is used. Telehealth can also be especially useful in medical care of children with medical complexity. Traveling with medical equipment to multiple subspecialists can be incredibly challenging and often a similar quality visit can be conducted through telehealth in the comfort of a child's home environment. Well child care presents a unique problem while trying to maintain social distancing. Integrating a hybrid model using both an in-person exam and history through video conferencing can help balance limited face to face time with the need to ensure a full and appropriate physical exam. Integration of telehealth into the pediatric patient centered medical home can enable families to gain convenience while maintaining the essential relationship with their primary care office.","Milne Wenderlich, Andrea; Herendeen, Neil",Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care,445,5

As aggregates of stalled initiation complexes, SGs are defined by the presence of translation initiation machinery in addition to mRNA binding proteins. Here, we report that cells infected with poliovirus (PV) can form SGs early that contain T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1), translation initiation factors, RNA binding proteins, and mRNA. However, this response is blocked as infection progresses, and a type of pseudo-stress granule remains at late times postinfection and contains TIA but lacks translation initiation factors, mRNA binding proteins, and most polyadenylated mRNA. This result was observed using multiple stressors, including viral infection, oxidative stress, heat shock, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Multiple proteins required for efficient viral internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation are localized to SGs under stress conditions, providing a potential rationale for the evolution and maintenance of the SG inhibition phenotype. Further, the expression of a noncleavable form of the RasGAP-SH3 domain binding protein in PV-infected cells enables SGs whose constituents are consistent with the presence of stalled 48S translation preinitiation complexes to persist throughout infection. These results indicate that in poliovirus-infected cells, the functions of TIA self-aggregation and aggregation of stalled translation initiation complexes into stress granules are severed, leading to novel foci that contain TIA1 but lack other stress granule-defining components.","White, James P; Lloyd, Richard E",Journal of virology,445,1

RECENT FINDINGS MINS is defined as a prognostically relevant myocardial injury due to ischemia that occurs during or within 30 days after noncardiac surgery. MINS occurs in 8% of adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery and is diagnosed with an elevated postoperative troponin measurement. MINS is associated with significant morbidity, and approximately 10% of patients experiencing MINS will die within 30 days. There is a dose-graded response in mortality and time to death with increasing levels of postoperative troponin elevations. Most patients (>80%) suffering from MINS will not experience an ischemic symptom. Without troponin monitoring, the majority of MINS events would go undetected. To avoid missing these prognostically relevant events, guidelines now recommend perioperative troponin monitoring in high-risk patients having noncardiac surgery. In patients who suffer MINS, risk-adjusted observational data suggest that aspirin and a statin can reduce the risk of 30-day mortality. SUMMARY Among adults, MINS is the most common cardiovascular complication that occurs after noncardiac surgery. Given that worldwide 200 million adult patients undergo major noncardiac surgery each year, at least 8 million of these patients will suffer MINS making this a substantial public health problem.","Khan, James; Alonso-Coello, Pablo; Devereaux, P J",Current opinion in cardiology,445,16

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the incidence of IH after midline and off-midline incisions in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS A systematic search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify all comparative studies from January 1991-August 2016 on the incidence of IH after midline and off-midline(transverse or Pfannenstiel) incisions in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Case series and studies reporting the IH after stoma site extraction, SILS, or NOTES were excluded. The MINORS instrument was used for quality assessment for observational studies. Weighted estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS A total of 17 articles were identified and included for meta-analysis, 16 of which were observational studies and 1 was an RCT. The mean MINORS score for observational studies was 12.9 (SD 3.2, range 7-17). Sample sizes in the midline (mean 185, range 20-995) and off-midline(mean 184, range 20-903) groups were similar. Follow-up ranged from 17.3 to 42 months. The pooled incidence of IH was 10.6% (338/3177) in midline, 3.7% (48/1314) in transverse, and 0.9% (9/956) in Pfannenstiel incisions. IH was significantly higher in the midline compared to off-midline groups (weighted OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0-8.3, I 2 = 79.7%, p for heterogeneity <0.001). Midline incisions were also at higher risk of IH versus transverse (weighted OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-6.7, I 2 = 72.7%, p for heterogeneity <0.001) and Pfannenstiel (weighted OR 8.6, 95% CI 3.0-24.6, I 2 = 43.5%, p for heterogeneity = 0.101) incisions. There was no publication bias according the funnel plot or statistically (Egger's p = 0.336). CONCLUSIONS Midline incisions for specimen extraction in laparoscopic colorectal surgery are at significantly higher risk of IH compared to off-midline (transverse or Pfannenstiel) incisions, but these data are of poor quality and heterogeneous.","Lee, Lawrence; Abou-Khalil, Maria; Liberman, Sender; Boutros, Marylise; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,445,19

The role of bariatric patients' self-management style in explaining variability in long-term outcomes is unclear. This qualitative study examined bariatric patients' self-management experiences after bariatric surgery in relation to long-term outcomes. A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured individual interviews with post-surgery patients (n = 23) at a Canadian bariatric surgery program. A constant comparative approach was used to systematically analyse the data and identify overarching themes. Variation in patients' experiences and follow-up time were the two primary units of analysis. Patients were predominantly female (n = 19; 82.6%) and had a mean age of 50 ± 8.49 years. The median time post-surgery was 2 years (range: 6 months-7 years). Three distinct phases described the process of self-management post-bariatric surgery: (1) rediscovering self-esteem and confidence in one's ability to self-manage (1-month to 1.5-years post-surgery), (2) achieving weight maintenance and addressing emotion dysregulation (1.5-3-years post-surgery) and (3) embracing a flexible balanced lifestyle (beyond 3-years). Bariatric surgery patients experience distinct challenges relative to their post-surgery time course. Facilitating access to interprofessional bariatric care after surgery allowed patients to acquire the self-management knowledge and skills necessary to address challenges to following the bariatric guidelines in the long-term.","Youssef, Alaa; Mylopoulos, Maria; Maunder, Robert; Wiljer, David; Cassin, Stephanie E; Wnuk, Susan; Leung, Samantha; Sockalingam, Sanjeev",Clinical obesity,445,16

Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cut off on March 8, 2020.A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Compared with patients without hypertension, patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have preexisting comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.005) and gender (P = 0.019) were independent risk factors associated with the severity of pneumonia in patients on admission, whereas ACEI/ARB treatment (P = 0.184) was not.Patients with COVID-19 with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. ACEI/ARB drugs did not influence the severity of pneumonia in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE 3.0 Tesla with normocapnic arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging acquired during an interleaved hypercapnic (3 minutes) and normocapnic (3 minutes) respiratory stimulus. ASSESSMENT CBF, maximum CVR, and time-to-maximum CVR (i.e., CVRDELAY ) were calculated. Laterality indices (difference between infarcted and contralesional hemispheres divided by sum of absolute values) of metrics at enrollment were contrasted between participants with vs. without new infarcts on follow-up.

Current evidence of FUS-mediated neurostimulation for humans has been limited to the observation of subjective sensory manifestations and electrophysiological responses, thus warranting the identification of stimulated brain regions. Here, we report FUS sonication of the primary visual cortex (V1) in humans, resulting in elicited activation not only from the sonicated brain area, but also from the network of regions involved in visual and higher-order cognitive processes (as revealed by simultaneous acquisition of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging). Accompanying phosphene perception was also reported. The electroencephalo graphic (EEG) responses showed distinct peaks associated with the stimulation. None of the participants showed any adverse effects from the sonication based on neuroimaging and neurological examinations. Retrospective numerical simulation of the acoustic profile showed the presence of individual variability in terms of the location and intensity of the acoustic focus. With exquisite spatial selectivity and capability for depth penetration, FUS may confer a unique utility in providing non-invasive stimulation of region-specific brain circuits for neuroscientific and therapeutic applications.","Lee, Wonhye; Kim, Hyun-Chul; Jung, Yujin; Chung, Yong An; Song, In-Uk; Lee, Jong-Hwan; Yoo, Seung-Schik",Scientific reports,445,16

Much of our understanding of this relationship has been informed by examining the impact of congenital blindness and deafness on language and cognitive development. Relatively little is known about the ""lesser"" senses of smell and taste. Here we report a neuropsychological case-control study contrasting a young adult male (P01) diagnosed with anosmia (i.e. no olfaction) during early childhood relative to an age- and sex-matched control group. A structural MRI of P01's brain revealed profoundly atrophic/aplastic olfactory bulbs, and standardized smell testing confirmed his prior pediatric diagnosis of anosmia. Participants completed three language experiments examining comprehension, production, and subjective experiential ratings of odor salient words (e.g. sewer) and scenarios (e.g. fish market). P01's ratings of odor salience of single words were lower than all control participants, whereas his ratings on five other perceptual and affective dimensions were similar to controls. P01 produced unusual associations when cued to generate words that smelled similar to odor-neutral target words (e.g. ink → plant). In narrative picture description for odor salient scenes (e.g. bakery), P01 was indistinguishable from controls. These results suggest that odor deprivation does not overtly impair functional language use.

Herein, we describe an unusual case of giant cell-rich SFT (GCRSFT) occurring in the nasopharynx. A 64-year-old man experienced dizziness and headache for more than 10 years with no obvious cause. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3.9 cm × 2 cm tumor on the posterior lateral wall of the left nasopharynx, and angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor fed by branches of the left carotid artery. Hence, preoperative embolization was performed, and then the tumor was endoscopically resected. The symptoms were relieved after the resection, and postoperative head CT and video laryngoscopy showed that the tumor was completely resected. We next characterized the specific pathological characteristics of the resected tumor. Histologically, the tumor was characterized by varying cellular proliferation of cytologically bland spindle cells within a collagenous stroma, with prominent interspersed branching vessels. Mitotic activity was low (2/50HPF), and there was no evidence of pleomorphism or tumor necrosis. Moreover, multinucleated giant cells with deep nuclear staining and distributed in pseudovascular spaces were found within the tumor. We ruled out the possibility that our case was giant cell fibroblastoma (GCF) by immunohistochemical analysis, showing that the tumor cells were positive for CD34, CD99, STAT6, and BCL-2, and that the Ki-67 labeling index was 3%, indicating that our case was SFT and not GCF. The patient's condition is generally good after a 14-month follow-up. This report serves to broaden the morphologic spectrum of GCRSFT and will help clinicians and pathologists better understand this entity to prevent misdiagnosis.","Dong, Shuang-Shuang; Wang, Ning; Yang, Cui-Ping; Zhang, Guo-Chang; Liang, Wei-Hua; Zhao, Jin; Qi, Yan",OncoTargets and therapy,445,28

Fast, accurate movements at a single joint are produced by a stereotyped pattern that includes a decrease in any preexisting activity in antagonist muscles. This premovement suppression is necessary to prevent the antagonist muscle from opposing movement generated by the agonist muscle.

Coagulation disorders increase the risk of IHE. The most common location of IHE is in the distal esophagus. The characteristic clinical triad of manifestations comprises acute retrosternal pain, odynophagia or dysphagia, and hematemesis. It is important to distinguish IHE from other acute conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. CASE REPORT An 84-year-old male was scheduled for coil embolization for an endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair. For this reason, he was taking aspirin and warfarin. A nasogastric tube had been inserted during surgery and subsequently removed without any problems reported. Postoperatively, he experienced chest pain and hematemesis of sudden onset. Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated a large, dark red, non-pulsatile, submucosal, esophageal mass in the area of the mid-esophagus with a little oozing. He was diagnosed as having an IHE; other possible diagnoses were excluded by contrast-enhanced computed tomography and aortography. He was treated with fasting, a proton pump inhibitor, and cessation of anti-thrombotic drugs; he recovered completely. The bleeding spot in the esophagus was in the area of the mid-esophagus, which was around the second natural constriction site. It was possible that the nasogastric tube had contact with the esophageal wall at this second natural constriction, and caused intramural esophageal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Nasogastric tubes are not generally recognized as a cause of IHE. However, they can cause them, especially when a patient is taking anti-thrombotic drugs.","Yamada, Toru; Motomura, Yasuaki; Hiraoka, Eiji; Miyagaki, Aki; Sato, Juichi",The American journal of case reports,445,1

Furthermore, commercial poultry farm owners have become concerned about the risk represented by contagious avian diseases that nearby backyard poultry could transmit. Fifty-one voluntary backyard chicken farms were visited between October 2012 and January 2013. Blood samples and individual cloacal swabs were collected from 457 chickens. In 44 farms (86%), one or more of the tested chickens had antibodies against avian encephalomyelitis and chicken infectious anaemia viruses, 24 farms (47%) had chickens seropositive for infectious bronchitis virus, 10 farms (20%) had chickens seropositive for infectious bursal disease virus, six farms (12%) had chickens seropositive for infectious laryngotracheitis virus and two farms (5.4%) had chickens seropositive for avian influenza virus. No farms had chickens seropositive for Newcastle disease virus. Of the 51 farms, five (10%) had chickens positive for coronavirus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A phylogenetic analysis showed that all backyard chicken coronaviruses collected were QX type infectious bronchitis viruses. All chickens tested for avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were negative. To our knowledge, there is no evidence to date to suggest that these diseases would have been transmitted between commercial and non-commercial flocks.","Pohjola, L; Tammiranta, N; Ek-Kommonen, C; Soveri, T; Hänninen, M L; Fredriksson Ahomaa, M; Huovilainen, A",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,445,1

Interleukins (ILs) are among the main immune factors contributing to the deterioration of the immune response and the formation of cytokine storms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. INTRODUCTION This review article investigated the relationship between virus structure, risk factors, and patient plasma interleukin levels in infections caused by the coronavirus family. METHOD The keywords ""interleukin,"" ""coronavirus structure,"" ""plasma,"" and ""risk factors"" were the main words searched to find a relationship among different interleukins, coronavirus structures, and risk factors in ISI, PUBMED, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases. RESULT Patients with high-risk conditions with independent panels of immune system markers are more susceptible to death caused by SARS-CoV2. IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15 are probably secreted at different levels in patients with coronavirus infections despite the similarity of inflammatory markers during coronavirus infections. SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV increase the secretion of IL-4 in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, while it remains unchanged in MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection demonstrates increased IL-10 levels. However, IL-10 levels increase during SARS-CoV infection, and different levels are recorded in SARS-CoV2. MERS-CoV increases IL-15 secretion while its levels remain unchanged in SARS-CoV2. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the different structures of SARS-CoV2, such as length of spike or nonstructural proteins (NSPs), and susceptibility of patients based on their risk factors may lead to differences in immune marker secretion and pathogenicity. Therefore, identifying and controlling interleukin levels can play a significant role in controlling the symptoms and the development of individual-specific treatments.","Mousavizadeh, Leila; Soltani, Ramin; Abedini, Kosar; Ghasemi, Sorayya",Current molecular medicine,445,16

STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective single-center study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Two hundred selected patients with gynecological disease were recruited for the study from May 2008 through December 2009 at Samsung Medical Center. RESULTS Two hundred patients underwent SPA gynecological surgery (105 a total hysterectomy; 11 a subtotal hysterectomy; 43 an oophorectomy; 31 an ovarian cystectomy; 5 a salpingectomy; 2 a myomectomy; 3 adhesiolysis only). The median age and body mass index were 45.5 and 22.9 kg/m(2), respectively. SPA surgery was successfully completed in 187 patients, without the need for ancillary ports (93.5%). Two cases required a conventional multiport, and nine cases needed one additional port. Two patients were converted to a laparotomy. One intra- and five post-operative complications occurred. The complication rate was 3.2% (6/187). The median operative time was 120 min (54-250) for a total hysterectomy, 180 (150-345) for a subtotal hysterectomy, 60 (27-245) for an oophorectomy, 105 (50-185) for a cystectomy, and 60 (30-115) for a salpingectomy. CONCLUSION Single-port surgery was safe and feasible for gynecological indications. Further study of single-port surgery is required to determine whether it has significant benefits compared to conventional techniques.","Park, Hwang Shin; Kim, Tae-Joong; Song, Taejong; Kim, Min Kyu; Lee, Yoo-Young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Kim, Byoung-Gie; Bae, Duk-Soo","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",445,7

Its complications are usually self-limited consisting mostly of local skin burns. This report presents a major complication, a femur shaft fracture following an osteoid osteoma radiofrequency ablation. The fracture occurred approximately one year after the ablation at the site of the osteoid osteoma. Discussion Few case reports have been published regarding subtrochanteric femur fracture after ablation of an osteoid osteoma. To our knowledge this is the first report of a femoral shaft fracture following an ablation. Another unique characteristic of the presented case is the late presentation, approximately one year following ablation. Factors which may have contributed to the fracture include lateral entry point of the drill which may have weakened the femur when taking its biological and mechanical properties into account, and the fact that the patient was a soldier who was allowed to continue his military training only six weeks after the ablation. Conclusion Radiofrequency ablation is an effective and relatively safe technique in treating osteoid osteomas, however the physician should be aware of the fracture risk involved, consider mechanical and biologic factors of the bone prior to drilling, and be very conservative when recommending return to high level activity. In addition, a close follow-up should be carried on after the procedure in order to supervise bone remodeling.","Mazzawi, Elias; Militianu, Daniela; Eidelman, Mark; Keren, Yaniv","Clinical cases in mineral and bone metabolism : the official journal of the Italian Society of Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism, and Skeletal Diseases",445,19

The WEB intrasaccular device has been developed specifically for this indication. To date, there has been no report of the long-term follow-up of a series of patients with aneurysms treated with this type of device, to our knowledge. Our aim was to evaluate a 1-year follow-up of angiographic results in a prospective single-center series of patients treated with the WEB-Single-Layer (SL) device. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients treated with the WEB-SL device in our center between August 2013 and May 2014 were prospectively included. One-year angiographic outcomes were assessed. Results at follow-up were graded as complete occlusion, neck remnant, or residual aneurysm. RESULTS Eight patients with 8 unruptured wide-neck aneurysms were enrolled in this study. Average dome width was 7.5 mm (range, 5.4-10.7 mm), and average neck size was 4.9 mm (range, 2.6-6.5 mm). One-year angiographic follow-up obtained in all aneurysms included 1 complete aneurysm occlusion (12.5%), 6 neck remnants (75%), and 1 aneurysm remnant (12.5%). Of 8 aneurysms, worsening of aneurysm occlusion was observed in 2 (25%) by compression of the WEB device. There was no angiographic recurrence of initially totally occluded aneurysms. No bleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular therapy of intracranial aneurysms with the WEB-SL device allows treatment of wide-neck aneurysms with a high rate of neck remnant at 1 year, at least partially explained by WEB compression. Initial size selection and technologic improvements could be an option for optimization of aneurysm occlusion in WEB-SL treatment.","Sivan-Hoffmann, R; Gory, B; Riva, R; Labeyrie, P-E; Signorelli, F; Eldesouky, I; Gonike-Sadeh, U; Armoiry, X; Turjman, F",AJNR.

There remains a significant unmet need for patients with hematological malignancies requiring specialized procedures and treatments, like cellular therapy to treat or cure their disease. For instance, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is approved for relapsed/refractory (after two or more lines of therapy) diffuse large B cell lymphoma and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in the second relapse in patients younger than 25 years of age. Similarly, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a lifesaving procedure for many patients, such as those with acute myeloid leukemia with high-risk cytogenetics. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrust upon the hematologists and transplant specialists' unique challenges with the implementation and management of cellular therapy. One of the significant concerns regarding this immunocompromised patient population is the significant risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its highly contagious nature. Experts have recommended that if medically indicated, especially in high-risk disease (where chemotherapy is unlikely to work), these lifesaving procedures should not be delayed even during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, proceeding with CAR-T cell therapy and HSCT during the pandemic is a considerable task and requires dedication from the transplant team and buy-in from the patients and their family or support system. Open conversations should be held with the patients about the risks involved in undergoing cellular therapies during current times and the associated future uncertainties.","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Ailawadhi, Sikander; Malvik, Natalie; Cerny, Jan",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,445,8

The present study reports our initial experience of dual-port laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (DPLDG). METHODS From November 2016 to August 2018, 38 consecutive patients underwent DPLDG in our center. The observational outcomes included 30-day morbidity and mortality rates, time to first flatus, time to first oral liquid diet, time to first oral semiliquid diet, time to drainage tube removal, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, postoperative 4-day recovery rate, additional analgesic use, hospital stay and cosmetic benefits. RESULTS Mean operative time was 191.6 ± 44.4 min, mean intra-operative blood loss was 39.8 ± 48.7 ml, and the mean number of dissected lymph nodes was 38.3 ± 13.7 nodes. One case was converted to five-port laparoscopic surgery, and no intraoperative complications occurred in any of the cases. The mean time to postoperative first flatus was 45.3 ± 18.0 h. The mean time to intake of an oral liquid diet was 56.7 ± 30.4 h. The mean time to drainage tube removal was 97.9 ± 52.3 h. The mean VAS scores for the 3 days after surgery were 2.3 ± 0.7, 2.0 ± 0.6 and 1.6 ± 0.5, respectively. A total of 81.6% of the enrolled patients met the postoperative 4-day recovery standard, and 15.8% of patients received additional analgesics. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.0 ± 2.0 days.

Common medications for PD do not always achieve satisfactory outcome of pain relief. Hence, both health professionals and patients are seeking help from complementary and alternative medicine. The acupoint herbal plaster (AHP), which appears to be a safe and effective way to alleviate menstrual pain, as well as to improve other PD-related symptoms. Despite similar clinical studies for this condition in the past, no high-quality methodology-based clinical trial has been reported to date. The current study aims to assess the efficacy of the AHP compared with the acupoint placebo plaster (APP) and being placed on a waiting-list control group in patients with primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS/DESIGN This study is a randomized, single-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 180 women with PD will be included and randomly allocated to the AHP, APP and waiting-list (WL) groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients in the AHP group will be provided with herbal plasters (Shaofuzhuyu decoction) on various acupoints: Shenque (CV8), Guanyuan (CV4), Qihai (CV5), Ciliao (BL32) and Zigong (EX-CA1). Women in the APP group will receive placebo plasters on the same acupoints, and no intervention will be given to the WL group until completion of the study. The primary outcome will be pain intensity reduction measured by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with other outcome measurements including the Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale (CMSS), the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the Participant Global Impression of Change (PGIC). All assessments will be performed at baseline, each menstrual cycle during the treatment course and the follow-up course. Any adverse events will be recorded throughout the study. DISCUSSION This is the first study to compare the changes in menstrual pain after three different interventions: the active intervention (AHP), the placebo intervention (APP), and a period of no intervention (WL). This three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the relative contributions of the specific (AHP vs. APP) and non-specific (APP vs. WL) effects to the overall clinical effects of the active AHP on women with PDM. The scientific and rigorous methodology design of this trial should gather good evidence to assess the curative effects and safety of the AHP on PD. Moreover, the results of this study may provide evidence-based references for the treatment of menstrual pain in future. TRIAL REGISTRATION Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ID: ChiCTR-TRC-16008701.

Demographic and procedural factors associated with stent placement were recorded. Patency of the PICA was evaluated immediately after stent placement and on follow-up angiography. RESULTS Thirteen patients with vertebral or vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms were treated in the study period, of whom 4 presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The average number of devices that spanned the PICA ostium was 1.77 (range, 1-3), with no immediate PICA occlusions. There were no postoperative strokes in the treated PICA territory, although there was 1 contralateral PICA-territory stroke of unclear etiology without clinical sequelae.

RECENT FINDINGS Short-term success is seen in most patients undergoing endoscopic therapy for Barrett's esophagus neoplasia, but long-term outcomes are only just becoming available. SUMMARY The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) continues to rise with poor survival seen in the majority of patients. The only known precursor to EAC is Barrett's esophagus. Although the risk of progression from metaplastic Barrett's esophagus to neoplasia is low, surveillance is advocated as patients who progress to mucosal neoplasia carry a significantly higher risk of progressing to invasive EAC. Minimally invasive endoscopic therapy with endoscopic resection and radiofrequency ablation are now the gold standard treatments for patients with intramucosal neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. After successful treatment, follow-up is still required as long-term durability is not 100% and recurrences are not rare.

Its 17 kDa protein product, ISG15, was the first ubiquitin-like modifier identified, and is similar to a ubiquitin linear dimer. As ISG15 modifies proteins in a similar manner to ubiquitylation, protein conjugation by ISG15 is termed ISGylation. Some of the primary enzymes that promote ISGylation are also involved in ubiquitin conjugation. The process to remove ISG15 from its conjugated proteins, termed de-ISGylation, is performed by a cellular ISG15-specific protease, ubiquitin-specific proteases with molecular mass 43 kDa (UBP43)/ubiquitin-specific proteases 18. Relative to ubiquitin, the biological function of ISG15 is still poorly understood, but ISG15 appears to play important roles in various biological and cellular functions.

METHODS The study included 10 preterm infants at 34-40 weeks' corrected age. Oxyhaemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration, heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and body movements were recorded during low-intensity sensory punctate stimulation for 1 s with and without therapeutic touch by a neonatal development specialist nurse. Each stimulation was followed by a resting phase of 30 s. All measurements were performed with the infants asleep in the prone position. RESULTS sensory punctate stimulus exposure significantly increased the oxy-Hb concentration but did not affect HR, SaO2 and body movements. The infants receiving therapeutic touch had significantly decreased oxy-Hb concentrations over time. CONCLUSIONS Therapeutic touch in preterm infants can ameliorate their sensory punctate stimulus response in terms of brain activation, indicated by increased cerebral oxygenation. Therefore, therapeutic touch may have a protective effect on the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow during sensory punctate stimulus in neonates.","Honda, Noritsugu; Ohgi, Shohei; Wada, Norihisa; Loo, Kek Khee; Higashimoto, Yuji; Fukuda, Kanji",Archives of disease in childhood.

The use of Ni as a catalyst for the steam reforming of methane has led us to look at Ni nanoclusters as potential candidates for the direct conversion of methane. Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn nanoclusters are also focused on. How the type of C1 fragments (CH4, CH3, CH2, CH, and C) stabilized by the metal nanoclusters as adsorbed species varies with metal species is theoretically investigated. The particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is based on swarm intelligence, as well as density functional theory, is used for this calculation. The Ni nanoclusters are found to preferentially adsorb C as a stable species, the Fe and the Co nanoclusters both CH and CH3, and the Cu nanoclusters CH3; the Zn nanoclusters are found not to chemisorb any C1 fragment. The methane activation capacity can be ranked in the order of Ni > Fe > Co > Cu > Zn. The highest methane activation capacity of Ni is due to the strongest covalent nature of the interaction between Ni and the adsorbed species. The ionicity of the bond between Fe and the adsorbed species is higher than that between Co and the adsorbed species, while the covalent nature of the bonds is comparable for both. The weak methane activation ability of Cu compared to Fe, Co, and Ni is found to be due to the fact that both the covalent and ionic bond strengths between Cu and the adsorbed species are weak. Zn and the adsorbed species form neither ionic nor covalent bonds. These results indicate that the Fe and the Co nanoclusters as well as the Ni may lead to the over-oxidation of methane, whereas the Zn nanoclusters cannot activate methane in the first place; therefore, their application to direct methane conversion catalysts is unlikely. Since the Cu nanoclusters do not adsorb C and CH as stable species, but CH3 stably, the Cu nanoclusters are expected to work as a catalyst for the direct conversion of methane.","Hori, Mikiya; Tsuji, Yuta; Yoshizawa, Kazunari",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,445,1

Here we use the dense genomic surveillance generated by the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium to reconstruct the dynamics of 71 different lineages in each of 315 English local authorities between September 2020 and June 2021. This analysis reveals a series of sub-epidemics that peaked in the early autumn of 2020, followed by a jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7/Alpha lineage. Alpha grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown suppressed Alpha and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. However, a series of variants (mostly containing the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. Accounting for sustained introductions, however, indicates that their transmissibility is unlikely to have exceeded that of Alpha. Finally, B.1.617.2/Delta was repeatedly introduced to England and grew rapidly in the early summer of 2021, constituting approximately 98% of sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes on 26 June.","Vöhringer, Harald S; Sanderson, Theo; Sinnott, Matthew; De Maio, Nicola; Nguyen, Thuy; Goater, Richard; Schwach, Frank; Harrison, Ian; Hellewell, Joel; Ariani, Cristina V; Gonçalves, Sonia; Jackson, David K; Johnston, Ian; Jung, Alexander W; Saint, Callum; Sillitoe, John; Suciu, Maria; Goldman, Nick; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Birney, Ewan; Volz, Erik; Funk, Sebastian; Kwiatkowski, Dominic; Chand, Meera; Martincorena, Inigo; Barrett, Jeffrey C; Gerstung, Moritz",Nature,445,19

There are two forms of PCL: primary, which arise de novo, and secondary which is a leukemic transformation in patients with previously multiple myeloma. Patients with PCL may benefit from stem cell transplantation and novel agents, but their prognosis remains inferior to that of patients who have multiple myeloma. CLINICAL CASE We describe the case of 53 years old patient with relapsed plasma cells leukemia after unrelated bone marrow transplant, treated with a KRD chemotherapy regimen. He performed a very good response after the first 2 cycles (bone marrow malignant plasma cells reducing from 36% to 0.5%). However, according to the very poor prognosis of this disease, after the 4th cycle of chemotherapy the patient progressed and dead into few weeks. The KRD regimen was able to convert the chimerism after bone marrow transplant from partial to complete after the first 2 cycles of treatment, showing some activity in this disease. CONCLUSIONS KRD regimen, in our clinical case, showed some activity being well tolerated in a very poor prognosis disease such as PCL. Probably, right use and maybe sooner use of new drugs such as bortezomib or carfilzomib, in combination regimens, may be useful in better treating such disease.","Palazzo, Giulia",Recenti progressi in medicina,445,27

METHODS A systematic search and review identified 20 guidelines and recommendations that had been published by 25 May 2020. We analysed documents from 17 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. RESULTS The documents were based on expert consensus with limited evidence and were of variable, low methodological rigour. Most did not provide recommendations for delivery methods or managing symptomatic infants. None provided recommendations for post-discharge assimilation of potentially-infected infants into the community. The majority encouraged keeping mothers and infants together, subject to infection control measures, but one-third recommended separation. Although breastfeeding or using breastmilk were widely encouraged, two countries specifically prohibited this. CONCLUSION The guidelines and recommendations for managing infants affected by COVID-19 were of low, variable quality and may be unsustainable. It is important that transmission risks are not increased when new information is incorporated into clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines should emphasise the extent of uncertainty and clearly define gaps in the evidence.","Yeo, Kee Thai; Oei, Ju Lee; De Luca, Daniele; Schmölzer, Georg M; Guaran, Robert; Palasanthiran, Pamela; Kumar, Kishore; Buonocore, Giuseppe; Cheong, Jeanie; Owen, Louise S; Kusuda, Satoshi; James, Jennifer; Lim, Gina; Sharma, Ankur; Uthaya, Sabita; Gale, Christopher; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Battersby, Cheryl; Modi, Neena; Norman, Mikael; Naver, Lars; Giannoni, Eric; Diambomba, Yenge; Shah, Prakeshkumar S; Gagliardi, Luigi; Harrison, Michael; Pillay, Shakti; Alburaey, Abdullah; Yuan, Yuan; Zhang, Huayan",Acta paediatrica,445,19

In this issue of the JCI, Sager, et al. examined SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes from patients previously tested for CCC as part of a comprehensive respiratory panel using PCR and were segregated into negative (CCC-) or positive (CCC+) exposure. No differences were seen between groups in terms of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, hospitalized patients with a documented history of CCC+ infection had lower rates of ICU admissions and higher rates of survival than hospitalized CCC- patients.

Total mesorectal excision (TME), the standard treatment for patients with distal rectal tumors, is usually performed in an ""up-to-down"" approach, either laparoscopically (LAPTME) or as an open procedure. We have already reported a NOTES-inspired, transanal, ""down-to-up"" variant of TME (NOTESTME). The main aim of this study was to assess the quality of the resected specimen in patients who had undergone either NOTESTME or LAPTME. METHODS All patients with distal rectal neoplasia presenting between January 2011 and December 2014 were considered for the study. Additional inclusion criteria comprised American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≤ III and the absence of previous open surgery. Assignment to either group was sequential and based on the rank of inclusion in the study. The primary endpoint was the macroscopic quality of the specimen. Secondary endpoints included nerve visualization, tumor perforation, operating time, status of margins, and number of retrieved nodes. RESULTS Eighteen patients (6 men, 12 women) were in the NOTESTME group and 15 (7 men, 8 women) in the LAPTME group, respectively. The TME specimen was considered complete or mainly regular in 16 patients who had undergone NOTESTME (88.9 %) and in 11 patients who had undergone LAPTME (73.3 %), (p > 0.05). During the procedure, we visually identified the neurovascular bundles of Walsh in 14 patients in the NOTESTME group (77.8 %) and in only 5 patients in the LAPTME group (33.3 %), (p < 0.05). Mean operative time was 245 min (range 155-440 min) in the NOTESTME group and 275 min (range 180-400 min) in the LAPTME group (p > 0.05). A median of 11 nodes per specimen (range 8-22 nodes) was retrieved in the NOTESTME group and 12 nodes (range 6-41 nodes) in the LAPTME group, respectively (p > 0.05). Distal and radial margins were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Compared to the LAPTME, the NOTESTME seems to be associated with a more frequent intraoperative identification of the sacral nerves. However, the difference in overall quality of the retrieved specimen, although favoring NOTESTME, did not reach statistical significance in this small series.","Chouillard, E; Regnier, A; Vitte, R-L; Bonnet, B V; Greco, V; Chahine, E; Daher, R; Biagini, J",Techniques in coloproctology,445,16

Patients' well-being plays a crucial role in the decision-making process. However, there is a paucity of studies investigating patients' or surgery-related factors influencing the postoperative gastrointestinal function. The aim of this study was to investigate in a predictive model patients or surgical variables that allow better estimation of the postoperative gastrointestinal QoL. METHODS This observational study retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis between 2004 and 2017. The one-time postoperative QoL was assessed with the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) in 2019. A linear regression model with stepwise selection has been applied to all patients and surgery-related variables. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-two patients with a mean age of 62.30 ± 9.74 years showed a mean GIQLI of 116.39±18.25 at a mean follow-up time of 90.4±33.65 months. Women (n=168) reported a lower GIQLI compared to male (n=104; 112.85±18.79 vs 122.11±15.81, p<0.001). Patients with pre-operative cardiovascular disease (n=17) had a worse GIQLI (106.65 ±22.58 vs 117.08±17.66, p=0.010). Finally, patients operated less than 5 years ago (n=63) showed a worse GIQLI compared to patients operated more than 5 years ago (n=209; 111.98±19.65 vs 117.71±17.63, p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS Female gender and the presence of pre-operative cardiovascular disease are predictive for a decreased postoperative gastrointestinal QoL. Furthermore, patients' estimation of gastrointestinal functioning seems to improve up to 5 years after surgery.","Posabella, Alberto; Steinemann, Daniel Christian; Droeser, Raoul André; Varathan, Nadshathra; Ayçiçek, Selin Göksu; Nocera, Fabio; von Flüe, Markus; Rotigliano, Niccolò; Füglistaler, Ida",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,445,31

To investigate whether variability in COVID-19 severity partially results from differential IL-6 expression, functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-6 were determined in Chinese COVID-19 patients with mild or severe illness. An Asian-common IL-6 haplotype defined by promoter SNP rs1800796 and intronic SNPs rs1524107 and rs2066992 correlated with COVID-19 severity. Homozygote carriers of C-T-T variant haplotype were at lower risk of developing severe symptoms (odds ratio, 0.256; 95% confidence interval, 0.088 to 0.739; P = 0.007). This protective haplotype was associated with lower levels of IL-6 and its antisense long noncoding RNA IL-6-AS1 by cis-expression quantitative trait loci analysis. The differences in expression resulted from the disturbance of stimulus-dependent bidirectional transcription of the IL-6/IL-6-AS1 locus by the polymorphisms. The protective rs2066992-T allele disrupted a conserved CTCF-binding locus at the enhancer elements of IL-6-AS1, which transcribed antisense to IL-6 and induces IL-6 expression in inflammatory responses. As a result, carriers of the protective allele had significantly reduced IL-6-AS1 expression and attenuated IL-6 induction in response to acute inflammatory stimuli and viral infection. Intriguingly, this low-producing variant that is endemic to present-day Asia was found in early humans who had inhabited mainland Asia since ∼40,000 years ago but not in other ancient humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The present study suggests that an individual's IL-6 genotype underlies COVID-19 outcome and may be used to guide IL-6 blockade therapy in Asian patients. IMPORTANCE Overproduction of cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and is believed to play a critical role in exacerbating the excessive inflammatory response. Polymorphisms in IL-6 account for the variability of IL-6 expression and disparities in infectious diseases, but its contribution to the clinical presentation of COVID-19 has not been reported. Here, we investigated IL-6 polymorphisms in severe and mild cases of COVID-19 in a Chinese population. The variant haplotype C-T-T, represented by rs1800796, rs1524107, and rs2066992 at the IL-6 locus, was reduced in patients with severe illness; in contrast, carriers of the wild-type haplotype G-C-G had higher risk of severe illness. Mechanistically, the protective variant haplotype lost CTCF binding at the IL-6 intron and responded poorly to inflammatory stimuli, which may protect the carriers from hyperinflammation in response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results point out the possibility that IL-6 genotypes underlie the differential viral virulence during the outbreak of COVID-19. The risk loci we identified may serve as a genetic marker to screen high-risk COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Tao; Lin, Yu-Xin; Zha, Yan; Sun, Ying; Tian, Jinxiu; Yang, Zhiying; Lin, Shan-Wen; Yu, Fuxun; Chen, Zi-Sheng; Kuang, Bo-Hua; Lei, Jin-Ju; Nie, Ying-Jie; Xu, Yonghao; Tian, Dong-Bo; Li, Ying-Zi; Yang, Bin; Xu, Qiang; Yang, Li; Zhong, Nanshan; Zheng, Meizhen; Li, Yimin; Zhao, Jincun; Zhang, Xiang-Yan; Feng, Lin",mBio,445,1

Barriers to delivering efficient health care include geographical limitations as well as long wait times. Telehealth has been used as a solution by many different health care services. However, it has not been as widely used in cancer care. In 2018, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pittsburgh Healthcare System expanded the use of telehealth to provide antineoplastic therapies to rural patients by creating a clinical video telehealth clinic of the Virtual Cancer Care Network. This allows oncologists located at the tertiary center to virtually deliver care to remote sites. The recent COVID-19 pandemic forced oncologists across the VA system to adopt telehealth to provide continuity of care. On the basis of our review and personal experience, we have outlined opportunities for telehealth to play a role in every step of the cancer care journey from diagnosis to therapy to surveillance to clinical trials for medical, surgical, and radiation oncology. There are many advantages, such as decreased travel time and potential cost savings; however, there continues to be challenges with veterans having access to devices and the Internet as well as understanding how to use telehealth equipment.

METHODS During February and March 2011, all 450 ICUs in public hospitals in Italy were invited to take part in an online survey. The questionnaire focused on ICU characteristics, methods used to prevent, diagnose, and treat infections, and antimicrobials prescribing policies. The frequency of each reported practice was calculated as a percentage of the total number of units answering the question. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 38.8% (175 of the 450 ICUs contacted) with homogeneous distribution across the country and in terms of unit type. RESULTS Eighty-eight percent of the responding facilities performed periodical surveillance cultures on all patients. In 71% of patients, cultures were also collected on admission. Endotracheal/bronchial aspirates were the most frequently cultured specimens at both time points. Two-thirds of the responding units had never performed screening cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Around 67% of the ICUs reported the use of antimicrobial de-escalation strategies during the treatment phase. In general, the use of empirical antimicrobial drug regimens was appropriate. Although the rationale for the choice was not always clearly documented, the use of a combination therapy was preferred over antibiotic monotherapy. The preferred first-line agents for invasive candidiasis were fluconazole and an echinocandin (64% and 25%, respectively). Two-thirds of the ICUs monitored vancomycin serum levels and administered it by continuous infusion in 86% of cases. For certain antibiotics, reported doses were too low to ensure effective treatment of severe infections in critically ill patients; conversely, inappropriately high doses were administered for certain antifungal drugs. CONCLUSIONS Although infection control policies and management practices are generally appropriate in Italian ICUs, certain aspects, such as the extensive use of multidrug empirical regimens and the inappropriate antimicrobial dosing, deserve careful management and closer investigation.","Bassetti, Matteo; De Gaudio, Raffaele; Mazzei, Teresita; Morace, Giulia; Petrosillo, Nicola; Viale, Pierluigi; Bello, Giuseppe; La Face, Sofia; Antonelli, Massimo",Critical care,445,30

Our objective was to systematically review the literature and conduct a meta-analysis of studies that investigated the prognostic significance of lymph node yield and/or lymph node density after neck dissection for patients with head and neck cancer. Data Sources The Ovid/Medline, Ovid/Embase, and NLM PubMed databases were systematically searched on January 23, 2017, for articles published between January 1, 1946, and January 23, 2017. Review Methods We reviewed English-language original research that included survival analysis of patients undergoing neck dissection for a head and neck malignancy stratified by lymph node yield and/or lymph node density. Study data were extracted by 2 independent researchers (S.C. and M.O.). We utilized the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to account for heterogeneity of studies. Results Our search yielded 350 nonduplicate articles, with 23 studies included in the final synthesis. Pooled results demonstrated that increased lymph node yield was associated with a significant improvement in survival (hazard ratio, 0.833; 95% CI, 0.790-0.879). Additionally, we found that increased lymph node density was associated with poorer survival (hazard ratio, 1.916; 95% CI, 1.637-2.241).

This study describes the clinical and prognostic factors in SLE patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study that reviewed all clinical records of patients with SLE admitted to the ICU between 2011 and 2018. RESULTS We evaluated 188 patients, with 279 ICU admissions. Most patients were female (n = 159; 84.57%) with a median age of 35 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 25-48 years). Infection was the leading cause of admission in 77 (27.60%) cases, followed by lupus flare. The average length of hospitalization was 5 days (IQR 3-11 days), and the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000, Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were 9 (IQR 2-17), 14 (IQR 10-17), and 3 (IQR 2-5), respectively.

We analyzed differences in the access to EVT by geographical areas in Catalonia, a territory with a highly decentralized stroke model. METHODS We studied 965 patients treated with EVT from a prospective multicenter population-based registry of stroke patients treated with reperfusion therapies in Catalonia, Spain (SONIIA). Three different areas were defined: (A) health areas primarily covered by Comprehensive Stroke Centers, (B) areas primarily covered by local stroke centers located less than hour away from a Comprehensive Stroke Center, and (C) areas primarily covered by local stroke centers located more than hour away from a Comprehensive Stroke Center. We compared the number of EVT×100 000 inhabitants/year and time from stroke onset to groin puncture between groups. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Throughout the study period, there were significant differences in the population rates of EVT across geographical areas. EVT rates by 100 000 in 2015 were 10.5 in A area, 3.7 in B, and 2.7 in C. Time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 82 minutes longer in group B (312 minutes [245-435]) and 120 minutes longer in group C (350 minutes [284-408]) compared with group A (230 minutes [160-407]; P<0.001).

The newly developed C-MAC Video Stylet promises to combine the advantages of rigid stylets and flexible optical scopes. We therefore evaluated the feasibility of awake orotracheal intubations with this device. METHODS In this prospective observational study, three anesthesiologists experienced in advanced airway management performed each 12 awake oral intubations with this device on adult patients with known or predicted intubation difficulties. The primary outcome was overall intubation success. Secondary outcomes were total attempts, successful time, first post-operative day sequelae, and subjective intubation difficulty rated on a visual analogue scale (1, very easy; 10, extremely difficult). RESULTS Ten (28%) patients were female, aged 64 +/-13 years, with BMI 26 +/- 5 kg.m- 1. ASA status (II/III/IV) was 8 (22%) /, 23 (64%) / 5 (14%). Indications for awake oral intubation were: oropharyngeal tumor 20 (56%), cervical-spine fracture 8 (22%), previously known difficult airway 4 (11%), spinal canal stenosis 3 (8%), and bilateral peritonsillar abscess 1 (3%). Overall 97% were successfully intubated in 45 s (31-88). First-attempt success rate was 80% in 37 s (29-54); 92% of patients would choose the same procedure again. On the first post-operative day, 11 (31%) patients complained of sore throat; 5 (14%) had minor injuries. Ease of intubation was rated as median VAS (IQR) 3 (1-7).

This adaptation is likely due to the leading noise shifting ('adapting') the dynamic range of auditory neurons, which can improve the neural encoding of speech spectral and temporal cues. Because neural dynamic range adaptation depends on stimulus level statistics, here we investigated the importance of 'statistical' adaptation for improving speech recognition in noisy backgrounds. We compared the recognition of noised-masked words in the presence and in the absence of adapting noise precursors whose level was either constant or was changing every 50 ms according to different statistical distributions. Adaptation was measured for 28 listeners (9 men) and was quantified as the recognition improvement in the precursor relative to the no-precursor condition. Adaptation was largest for constant-level precursors and did not occur for highly fluctuating precursors, even when the two types of precursors had the same mean level and both activated the medial olivocochlear reflex. Instantaneous amplitude compression of the highly fluctuating precursor produced as much adaptation as the constant-level precursor did without compression. Altogether, results suggest that noise adaptation in speech recognition is probably mediated by neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent sound level. Further, they suggest that auditory peripheral compression per se, rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex, could facilitate noise adaptation by reducing the level fluctuations in the noise.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecognizing speech in noise is challenging but can be facilitated by noise adaptation. The neural mechanisms underlying this adaptation remain unclear. Here, we report some benefits of adaptation for word-in-noise recognition and show that (1) adaptation occurs for stationary but not for highly fluctuating precursors with equal mean level; (2) both stationary and highly fluctuating noises activate the medial olivocochlear reflex; and (3) adaptation occurs even in highly fluctuating noise when the stimulus is passed through a fast amplitude compressor. These findings suggest that noise adaptation reflects neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent noise level and that auditory peripheral compression rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex could facilitate noise adaptation.","Marrufo-Pérez, Miriam I; Sturla Carreto, Dora Del Pilar; Eustaquio-Martín, Almudena; Lopez-Poveda, Enrique A",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,445,31

As an alternative, supraglottic airway devices (SAD) are efficient and technically easy to insert. We therefore evaluated the time to ventilation, success rate, and skill retention for various airway management approaches by medical laypersons using a manikin model. METHODS Fifty medical laypersons with no previous experience whatsoever in airway management or resuscitation were enrolled. All participants received a 1-h-long theoretical lecture and a practical demonstration of mouth-to-mouth ventilation, ETI, and six SAD. Afterwards, the laypersons performed mouth-to-mouth ventilation and used each of the seven airway-management systems on an advanced patient simulator (SimMan) in a random sequence. All participants were re-evaluated 3 months later without any further practical or theoretical demonstration. RESULTS The success rates for ETI were 74% during the first evaluation and 64% during the second, whereas the success rate for all six SAD was 100% during all application attempts. The success rate for mouth-to-mouth ventilation was 86% initially and 84% 3 months later. The time to adequate mouth-to-mouth ventilation was 15 ± 13 s initially and 16 ± 7 s subsequently. ETI required 53 ± 21 s during the initial evaluation and 44 ± 16 s 3 months later. CONCLUSION A variety of SAD all proved to reliably secure airways quickly, even in the hands of complete novices. The SAD were much more effective than ETI, which often failed, and were even superior to mouth-to-mouth ventilation. SAD may thus be an appropriate first-line approach to field ventilation.","Goliasch, Georg; Ruetzler, Anita; Fischer, Henrik; Frass, Michael; Sessler, Daniel I; Ruetzler, Kurt",European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,445,11

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic coloanal anastomosis is an attractive new surgical option in patients with low rectal cancer because laparotomy is not necessary due to transanal specimen extraction. Risks of tumor spillage and fecal incontinence induced by transanal extraction are not known. METHODS Between 2000 and 2010, 220 patients with low rectal cancer underwent laparoscopic rectal excision with hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis. The rectal specimen was extracted transanally in 122 patients and transabdominally in 98 patients. End points were circumferential resection margin, mesorectal grade, local recurrence, survival, and functional outcome. RESULTS The mortality rate was 0.5% and surgical morbidity rate was 17%. The rate of positive circumferential resection margin was 9% and the mesorectum was graded complete in 79%, subcomplete in 12%, and incomplete in 9%. After a follow-up of 51 months (range, 1-151), the local recurrence rate was 4% and overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 83% and 70% at 5 years, respectively. The continence score was 6 (range, 0-20). There was no difference of mortality rate, morbidity rate, circumferential resection margin, mesorectal grade, local recurrence (4% vs 5%, P = 0.98), and disease-free survival rate (72% vs 68%, P = 0.63) between transanal and transabdominal extraction groups. Continence score was also similar (6 vs 6, P = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS Transanal extraction of the rectal specimen did not compromise oncologic and functional outcome after laparoscopic surgery for low rectal cancer and seems as a safe option to preserve the abdominal wall.","Denost, Quentin; Adam, Jean-Philippe; Pontallier, Arnaud; Celerier, Bertrand; Laurent, Christophe; Rullier, Eric",Annals of surgery,445,7

OBJECTIVE To evaluate a novel iodinated copolymer-based liquid embolic agent (precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid (PHIL)) in the porcine rete mirabile (RM), serving as an endovascular embolization model. Onyx, as an established liquid embolic agent, served as comparator. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen embolization procedures were performed using PHIL (n=8) or Onyx (n=8) as liquid embolic agent. Waiting time between injections was set to 30 or 60 s (n=4 per study group). Survival time after intervention was 2 hours or 7 days. Embolization characteristics (eg, procedure times, number of injections and volume of embolic agent) and embolization extent (percentage of embolized RM in post-interventional x-ray) were assessed. Post-interventional CT and histopathological analyses were performed. RESULTS Embolization characteristics and embolization extent were not significantly different for PHIL and Onyx, including subgroups (eg, embolization extent 44% vs 69% (medians); p=0.101). For PHIL, extension of the waiting time from 30 to 60 s led to a significantly higher embolization extent (24% vs 72% (medians); p=0.035). Moderate disintegration and mild inflammation of the embolized blood vessels were present for both embolic agents. CONCLUSION PHIL is feasible for transarterial embolization in an acute and subacute endovascular embolization model. In this preliminary experimental in vivo study, embolization characteristics, embolization extent, and biocompatibility seem to be similar to those of Onyx.","Vollherbst, Dominik F; Otto, Ruth; von Deimling, Andreas; Pfaff, Johannes; Ulfert, Christian; Kauczor, Hans U; Bendszus, Martin; Sommer, Christof M; Möhlenbruch, Markus A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,445,16

We aimed to evaluate the safety and preliminary outcomes in patients who underwent a modified version of the Z-POEM where the tunnel is made directly overlying the cricopharyngeus, the mucosal incision and muscular interruption (MIMI) approach, and to compare these with patients who underwent a non-tunneled flexible endoscopic approach. METHODS All patients with ZD who were treated by flexible endoscopy at our institution between January 2015 and February 2020 were identified by a retrospective chart review. Dysphagia symptoms were assessed using a validated scoring system. RESULTS Nineteen patients with ZD underwent MIMI (mean age 76.1 years, 68.1% male) and seven patients underwent non-tunneled flexible endoscopic approach (mean age 64.4 years, 85.7% male) during the study period. Mean ZD size was 2.8 cm in the MIMI group and 1.9 cm in the non-tunneled group (p = 0.03). Clinical success was achieved in 17/19(89.5%) MIMI patients and 7/7(100%) of non-tunneled flexible endoscopic patients (p = 0.101). Dysphagia scores improved in both groups, although this difference was only significant in the MIMI group (p ≤ 0.001). Recurrence occurred in 2/17(11.7%) MIMI patients and 3/7(42.9%) non-tunneled flexible endoscopic patients (p = 0.096). There were 4 complications, including one pharyngeal perforation requiring open surgical repair in a patient with a small ZD with an associated cricopharyngeal bar in the MIMI group. Median length of follow-up was 290 [142; 465] days in the MIMI group and 1056 [258; 1206] days in the non-tunneled group (p = 0.094). CONCLUSIONS MIMI is a technically feasible and effective treatment for ZD. Care should be taken in patients with a cricopharyngeal bar and small ZD, as this may increase the risk of perforation. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine if MIMI reduces the risk of symptom recurrence when compared to non-tunneled flexible endoscopic approaches.","Klingler, Michael J; Landreneau, Joshua P; Strong, Andrew T; Barajas-Gamboa, Juan S; Tat, Christine; Tu, Chao; Fathalizadeh, Alisan; Kroh, Matthew; Rodriguez, John; Sanaka, Madhusudhan R; Ponsky, Jeffrey",Surgical endoscopy,445,1

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CD73 in IBD-associated tumorigenesis. A mouse model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis (CAT) induced by azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium was successfully constructed. Model mice were injected with CD73 inhibitor or adenosine receptor agonist. Colon length, body weight loss and tumor formation were assessed macroscopically. Inflammatory cytokine measurement and RNA sequencing on colon tissues were performed. Inhibition of CD73 by adenosine 5'-(α,β-methylene) diphosphate (APCP) suppressed the severity of CAT with attenuated weight loss, longer colons, lower tumor number and smaller tumor size compared with the model group. Activation of adenosine receptors using 1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-1-deoxy-N-ethyl-β-D-ribofuranuronamide (NECA) exacerbated CAT. Histological assessment indicated that inhibition of CD73 reduced, while activation of adenosine receptors exacerbated, the histological damage of the colon. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) in colonic tissue was detected in the NECA group. According to RNA sequencing results, potential oncogenes such as arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), Bcl-2-like protein 15 (Bcl2l15) and N-acetylaspartate synthetase (Nat8l) were downregulated in the APCP group and upregulated in the NECA group compared with the model group. Therefore, inhibition of CD73 attenuated IBD-associated tumorigenesis, while activation of adenosine receptors exacerbated tumorigenesis in a C57BL/6J mouse model. This effect may be associated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the regulation of ALOX15, Bcl2l15 and Nat8l.","Liu, Xuan-Hui; Wu, Xian-Rui; Lan, Nan; Zheng, Xiao-Bin; Zhou, Chi; Hu, Tuo; Chen, Yu-Feng; Cai, Ze-Rong; Chen, Ze-Xian; Lan, Ping; Wu, Xiao-Jian",Oncology letters,445,30

Herein, pure nano-VO2 from discrete nanoparticles to continuous films were successfully deposited on quartz glass by controlling the sputtering parameters. It was demonstrated that, for Gram-positive S. aureus and S. epidermidis, the nano-VO2 could effectively disrupt bacteria morphology and membrane integrity, and eventually cause death. By contrast, the nano-VO2 did not exhibit significant toxicity towards Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a selective antimicrobial effect of nano-VO2 materials on Gram-positive bacteria. Based on the experimental results, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the antimicrobial selectivity, which might originate from the different sensitivity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Elevated intracellular ROS levels exceed the threshold that bacteria can self-regulate to maintain cellular redox homeostasis and thus cause oxidative stress, which can be alleviated by the intervention of glutathione (GSH) antioxidant. In addition, nano-VO2 did not produce significant cytotoxicity (hemolysis) against human erythrocytes within 12 h. Meanwhile, potential cytotoxicity against HIBEpiC revealed a time- and dose-dependent behavior that might be controlled and balanced by careful design. The findings in the present work may contribute to understanding the antimicrobial behavior of nano-VO2, and to expanding the new applications of VO2-based nanomaterials in environmental and biomedical fields.","Li, Jinhua; Zhou, Huaijuan; Wang, Jiaxing; Wang, Donghui; Shen, Ruxiang; Zhang, Xianlong; Jin, Ping; Liu, Xuanyong",Nanoscale,445,27

However, most research on sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic focused on heterosexual individuals. The only study so far on men who have sex with men was conducted in the United States. AIM Our study expands the understanding of sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic by studying gay and bisexual men in Hong Kong. Although sexual desire and sexual activity continue to be important aspects of one's life during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are COVID-19-related barriers to having sex. This study therefore examined the association between sexual desire, COVID-19-related barriers, and whether to engage in sexual activity or not during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS 857 cisgender sexual minority people in Hong Kong participated in an online survey study, and for this article, only male participants were included in the analysis, yielding an analytical sample of 376 gay and bisexual men. OUTCOMES Participants were asked to assess their sexual desire (ie, sexual drive and sexual motivation), COVID-19-related barriers (ie, perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection), and sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS It was found that while sexual desire remained prevalent among the gay and bisexual men, COVID-19-related barriers were also commonly observed. Sexual drive and sexual motivation were positively associated with sexual activity. Perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were negatively predictive of engaging in sexual activity, after controlling for general sexual desire. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Understanding the ambivalence and driving and inhibiting factors for having sex during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide a new framework for understanding people's sexual activity during an unprecedented scale of the pandemic. It is likely that abstinence would not work as the respondents expressed strong sexual desire and that the pandemic is going to last for a long time. Governments, policy makers, and sexual scientists need to work together to come up with practicable, feasible, and easy-to-follow guidelines for having sex during the pandemic. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS This is one of the first studies to examine the impact of COVID-19 on sexual activity among gay and bisexual men. The results should be interpreted with caution because of the use of cross-sectional design and nonprobability sampling.

Authors' reply.,17.59649,12.399965,2020-08-25,"Viruses in the family Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales, are etiologic agents of a range of human and animal diseases, including both mild and severe respiratory diseases in humans. These viruses encode conserved replicase and structural proteins as well as more diverse accessory proteins, encoded in the 3' ends of their genomes, that often act as host cell antagonists. We previously showed that 2',5'-phosphodiesterases (2',5'-PDEs) encoded by the prototypical Betacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and by Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus antagonize the oligoadenylate-RNase L (OAS-RNase L) pathway. Here we report that additional coronavirus superfamily members, including lineage A betacoronaviruses and toroviruses infecting both humans and animals, encode 2',5'-PDEs capable of antagonizing RNase L. We used a chimeric MHV system (MHVMut) in which exogenous PDEs were expressed from an MHV backbone lacking the gene for a functional NS2 protein, the endogenous RNase L antagonist. With this system, we found that 2',5'-PDEs encoded by the human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 (OC43; an agent of the common cold), human enteric coronavirus (HECoV), equine coronavirus (ECoV), and equine torovirus Berne (BEV) are enzymatically active, rescue replication of MHVMut in bone marrow-derived macrophages, and inhibit RNase L-mediated rRNA degradation in these cells. Additionally, PDEs encoded by OC43 and BEV rescue MHVMut replication and restore pathogenesis in wild-type (WT) B6 mice. This finding expands the range of viruses known to encode antagonists of the potent OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway, highlighting its importance in a range of species as well as the selective pressures exerted on viruses to antagonize it.IMPORTANCE Viruses in the family Coronaviridae include important human and animal pathogens, including the recently emerged viruses severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We showed previously that two viruses within the genus Betacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and MERS-CoV, encode 2',5'-phosphodiesterases (2',5'-PDEs) that antagonize the OAS-RNase L pathway, and we report here that these proteins are furthermore conserved among additional coronavirus superfamily members, including lineage A betacoronaviruses and toroviruses, suggesting that they may play critical roles in pathogenesis. As there are no licensed vaccines or effective antivirals against human coronaviruses and few against those infecting animals, identifying viral proteins contributing to virulence can inform therapeutic development. Thus, this work demonstrates that a potent antagonist of host antiviral defenses is encoded by multiple and diverse viruses within the family Coronaviridae, presenting a possible broad-spectrum therapeutic target.","Goldstein, Stephen A; Thornbrough, Joshua M; Zhang, Rong; Jha, Babal K; Li, Yize; Elliott, Ruth; Quiroz-Figueroa, Katherine; Chen, Annie I; Silverman, Robert H; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,445,1

This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Historically, it has caused two pandemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome followed by the present COVID-19 that emerged from China. The virus is believed to be acquired from zoonotic source and spreads through direct and contact transmission. The symptomatic phase manifests with fever, cough and myalgia to severe respiratory failure. The diagnosis is confirmed using reverse transcriptase PCR. Management of COVID-19 is mainly by supportive therapy along with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Preventive strategies form the major role in reducing the public spread of virus along with successful disease isolation and community containment.

There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use. Objective To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation). Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included. Exposures History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing. Main Outcomes and Measures Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive. Results A total of 18 472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12 725 (69%) were white. Of 18 472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18 472 patients (9.4%). Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15). Conclusions and Relevance This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity. These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.","Mehta, Neil; Kalra, Ankur; Nowacki, Amy S; Anjewierden, Scott; Han, Zheyi; Bhat, Pavan; Carmona-Rubio, Andres E; Jacob, Miriam; Procop, Gary W; Harrington, Susan; Milinovich, Alex; Svensson, Lars G; Jehi, Lara; Young, James B; Chung, Mina K",JAMA cardiology,445,24

To begin to understand what mechanisms might control this outcome, we examined the effect of a murine-CD52 specific monoclonal antibody on the depletion and repopulation of immune cells in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. We tested whether the tolerance-promoting receptor PD-1 is required for disease remission post anti-CD52; and found that PD-1 deficient mice with a more severe EAE were nevertheless effectively treated with anti-CD52. Anti-CD52 increased the proportions of newly generated T cells and DN T cells, while reducing newly generated B cells; the latter effect being associated with a higher expression of CD52 by these cells. In the longer-term, anti-CD52 caused substantial increases in the proportion of newly generated lymphocytes and DN T cells, in mice with EAE. Thus, the rapid repopulation of lymphocytes from central lymphoid organs post anti-CD52 may limit further disease. Furthermore, these data identify DN T cells, a subset with immunoregulatory potential, as a significant hyper-repopulating subset following CD52 mediated depletion.

However, outcome data on breast cancer subgroups in the Finnish population is limited. This retrospective registry-based study aimed to assess patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of different breast cancer subgroups in early (EBC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in a real-life clinical setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study consisted of 6977 adult female breast cancer patients diagnosed in Southwest Finland during 2005-2018. Patients were divided into four mutually exclusive groups: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), triple negative, HER2-/hormone receptor positive (HR+), and HER2 and/or HR status unknown, and further into EBC and MBC patients. Real-world (rw) clinical outcomes: disease free survival (rwDFS), progression free survival (rwPFS), overall survival (OS) and distant recurrence-free interval (rwDRFI) were assessed. RESULTS Within EBC 5-year survival was the highest 88% in HER2-/HR+, 85% in HER2+, and 75% in triple negative. The rwDFS varied significantly in EBC (5-year rwDFS HER2+, triple negative, HER2-/HR+: 80%, 71%, 87% respectively). In MBC median survival was 2 years for both HER2-/HR+ and HER2+, and markedly shorter for triple negative (0.8 years). Independent predictors of mortality were age (HR 1.1), other subgroups than HER2-/HR+ (HR 1.2-1.9), metastatic disease (HR 9.8), and other malignancies (HR 2.7). CONCLUSIONS This registry-based study demonstrates significant differences in breast cancer outcomes on the subgroup level, as well as poorer outcomes compared to clinical trials, giving complementary insight on clinical characteristics in an unselected patient population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTISE This retrospective registry-based study assessed the clinical outcomes of different breast cancer subgroups in 6977 adult female breast cancer patients diagnosed in Southwest Finland during 2005-2018. Results demonstrated significant variation in the survival between subgroups in both EBC and MBC, as well as differences between unselected patients representing the standard of care and randomized clinical trials. Although, according to the global comparison of survival trends, the net survival of breast cancer patients in Finland is generally high, there is great variation between subgroups. This real-life breast cancer data provides tools to further evaluate medical need in different breast cancer subgroups.","Teerenhovi, H; Tuominen, S; Nurmi-Rantala, S; Hemmilä, P; Ellonen, A",The oncologist,445,26

Since their discovery in the late 1970's, DCs have been recognized as the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs). DCs have a superior capacity for acquiring, processing, and presenting antigens to T cells and they express costimulatory or coinhibitory molecules that determine immune activation or anergy. For these reasons, cell-based therapeutic approaches using DCs have been explored in cancer and infectious diseases but with limited success. In humans, DCs are divided into heterogeneous subsets with distinct characteristics. Two major subsets are CD11c+ myeloid (m)DCs and CD11c- plasmacytoid (p)DCs. pDCs are different from mDCs and play an essential role in the innate immune system via the production of type I interferons (IFN). However, pDCs are also able to take-up antigens and effectively cross present them. Given the rarity of pDCs in blood and technical difficulties in obtaining them from human blood samples, the understanding of human pDC biology and their potential in immunotherapeutic approaches (e.g. cell-based vaccines) is limited. However, due to the recent advancements in cell culturing systems that allow for the generation of functional pDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), studying pDCs has become easier. In this mini-review, we hypothesize about the use of pDCs as a cell-based therapy to treat HIV by enhancing anti-HIV-immune responses of the adaptive immune system and enhancing the anti-viral responses of the innate immune system. Additionally, we discuss obstacles to overcome before this approach becomes clinically applicable.","van der Sluis, Renée M; Egedal, Johanne H; Jakobsen, Martin R",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,445,24

Creating such environments where all learners can thrive and grow together is a challenge, but a consistently doable one. This Perspective describes 12 lessons learned within four main themes: ground rules; language and communication; concepts of social constructs, intersectionality, and bidirectional biases; and structural racism, solutions, and advocacy. The authors' recommendations for how to successfully teach health professions students about race and racism come from their collective experience of over 60 years of instruction, research, and practice. Proficiency in discussing race and addressing racism will become increasingly relevant as health care institutions strive to address the social needs of patients (e.g., food insecurity, housing instability) that contribute to poor health and are largely driven by structural inequities. Having interprofessional team-based care, with teams better able to understand and counteract their own biases, will be critical to addressing the social and structural determinants of health for marginalized patients. Recognizing that implicit biases about race impact both patients and health professions students from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds is a critical step toward building robust curricula about race and health equity that will improve the learning environment for trainees and reduce health disparities.","Peek, Monica E; Vela, Monica B; Chin, Marshall H",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,445,31

Elevated transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signalling is implicated in cSCC development and progression in RDEB patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of exogenous and endogenous TGFβ signalling in RDEB cSCC with a view to assess the potential of targeting TGFβ signalling for RDEB cSCC therapy. METHODS A panel of 11 patient derived RDEB cSCC primary tumour keratinocyte cell lines (SCCRDEBs) were tested for their signalling and proliferation responses to exogenous TGFβ. Their responses to TGFBR1 kinase inhibitors (SB-431542 and AZ12601011(AZA01)) was tested using in vitro proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, 3D invasion assays and in vivo tumour xenograft assays. RESULTS All SCCRDEBs respond to exogenous TGFβ by activation of canonical SMAD signalling and proliferative arrest. Blocking endogenous signalling by treatment with SB-431542 and AZ12601011 significantly inhibited proliferation (n=7/11), clonogenicity (n=6/11), migration (n=8/11) and invasion (6/11) of SCCRDEBs. However, these TGFBR1 kinase inhibitors also promoted proliferation and clonogenicity in 2/11 SCCRDEBs. Pre-treatment of in vitro TGFBR1 addicted SCCRDEB70 cells with SB-431542 enhanced overall survival and reduced tumour volume in subcutaneous xenografts but had no effect on non-addicted SCCRDEB2 cells in these assays. CONCLUSION Targeting TGFBR1 kinase activity may have therapeutic benefit in the majority of RDEB cSCCs, however, the potential tumour suppressive role of TGFβ signalling in a subset of RDEB cSCCs necessitates biomarker identification to enable patient stratification before clinical intervention.","Dayal, J H S; Mason, S M; Salas-Alanis, J C; McGrath, J A; Taylor, R G; Mellerio, J E; Blyth, K; South, A P; Inman, G J",The British journal of dermatology,445,16

Approaches to regenerate the corneal endothelium offer a solution to the current tissue scarcity and a treatment to those in need. Methods for generating corneal endothelial cells into numbers that could address the current tissue shortage and the possible strategies used to deliver them have now become a therapeutic reality with clinical trials taking place in Japan, Singapore and Mexico.

METHODS We searched the Western Denmark Heart Registry to identify patients with an acute coronary angiography due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest performed at our institution between September 2010 and September 2013. We identified 68 unconscious patients, who were resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and underwent acute PCI with stent implantation and immediate therapeutic hypothermia, and followed these for 30 days. Target temperature of 32-34°C was achieved by either an invasive or a non-invasive cooling system. RESULTS All patients had elevated myocardial biomarkers and 37 patients had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Bare metal stents were implanted in 14 and drug-eluting stents in 54 patients. All patients received antithrombotic treatment with a standard loading dose of 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 10,000 units heparin intravenously prior PCI. Clopidogrel or ticagrelor was administered orally through a gastric tube immediately after PCI. During the procedure abciximab or bivalirudin was administered in 44 patients. Electrocardiographic and clinical signs of stent thrombosis were found in one patient. CONCLUSIONS We observed one stent thrombosis in this cohort of 68 consecutive patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were treated with PCI and therapeutic hypothermia. This suggests that PCI with stent implantation can be performed with acceptable safety in these patients.","Chisholm, Gro E; Grejs, Anders; Thim, Troels; Christiansen, Evald H; Kaltoft, Anne; Lassen, Jens F; Kristensen, Steen D; Bøtker, Hans Erik; Maeng, Michael",European heart journal.

Anatomical variations, such as absent or surgically clamped vessels, can result in undesirable flow patterns. These can affect the brain's ability to maintain cerebral perfusion and the formation of cerebral aneurysms. An experimental test system was developed to simulate cerebral physiological conditions through three flexible 3D patient-specific models of complete and incomplete CoW geometries. Flow visualizations were performed with isobaric dyes and the mapped dye streamlines were tracked throughout the models. Three to seven flow impact locations were observed for all configurations, corresponding to known sites for aneurysmal formation. Uni and bi-directional cross-flows occurred along the communicating arteries. The greatest shunting of flow occurred for a missing pre-communicating anterior (A1) and posterior (P1) cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral arteries had the greatest reduction (15-37%) in efferent flow rates for missing either a unilateral A1 or bilateral P1 segments. The bi-directional cross-flows, with multiple afferent flow mixing, observed along the communicating arteries may explain the propensity of aneurysm formation at these sites. Reductions in efferent flow rates due to aplastic vessel configurations may affect normal brain function.","Fahy, Paul; McCarthy, Peter; Sultan, Sherif; Hynes, Niamh; Delassus, Patrick; Morris, Liam",Annals of biomedical engineering,445,16

The etiology of this age-induced bone loss is not clear but has been associated with increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from leaky mitochondria. ROS are known to oxidize/damage the surrounding proteins/amino acids/enzymes and thus impair their normal function. Among the amino acids, the aromatic amino acids are particularly prone to modification by oxidation. Since impaired osteoblastic differentiation from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) plays a role in age-related bone loss, we wished to examine whether oxidized amino acids (in particular the aromatic amino acids) modulated BMMSC function. Using mouse BMMSCs, we examined the effects of the oxidized amino acids di-tyrosine and kynurenine on proliferation, differentiation and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our data demonstrate that amino acid oxides (in particular kynurenine) inhibited BMMSC proliferation, alkaline phosphatase expression and activity and the expression of osteogenic markers (Osteocalcin and Runx2). Taken together, our data are consistent with a potential pathogenic role for oxidized amino acids in age-induced bone loss.","El Refaey, Mona; Watkins, Christopher P; Kennedy, Eileen J; Chang, Andrew; Zhong, Qing; Ding, Ke-Hong; Shi, Xing-ming; Xu, Jianrui; Bollag, Wendy B; Hill, William D; Johnson, Maribeth; Hunter, Monte; Hamrick, Mark W; Isales, Carlos M",Molecular and cellular endocrinology,445,1

Recent studies have used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify various virus species, including DNA viruses that are harbored by bats; however, little is known about the nature of these potentially novel viruses. Here, we report the characterization of a novel herpesvirus isolated from an Indonesian pteropodid bat. The virus, tentatively named fruit bat alphaherpesvirus 1 (FBAHV1), has a double-stranded DNA genome of 149,459 bp. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that FBAHV1 is phylogenetically grouped with simplexviruses within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Inoculation of FBAHV1 into laboratory mice caused a lethal infection. Virus infection was observed in lung, liver, and brain tissue. Serological and PCR screening revealed that fruit bats infected with FBAHV1 or its related virus are widely distributed in Indonesia. The identification of FBAHV1 makes a considerable contribution to our understanding of simplexviruses associated with bats. IMPORTANCE Bats are known to harbor emerging viruses, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, and filoviruses. Although alphaherpesviruses are disseminated in humans and other animals, there is little information about their distribution in bats. Here, we isolated a previously unknown alphaherpesvirus from an Indonesian fruit bat. Genome sequence analysis suggested that the virus is a member of the genus Simplexvirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which also includes common human viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2. FBAHV1 is the first bat-derived alphaherpesvirus whose complete genome has been sequenced.","Sasaki, Michihito; Setiyono, Agus; Handharyani, Ekowati; Kobayashi, Shintaro; Rahmadani, Ibenu; Taha, Siswatiana; Adiani, Sri; Subangkit, Mawar; Nakamura, Ichiro; Sawa, Hirofumi; Kimura, Takashi",Journal of virology,445,1

In partnership with public, private, academic and citizen groups, the project activities supported the development of Jakstradas in all seven regencies and established a resource recovery centre (RRC) as a model to practice 3Rs in the region. The key lessons learned from these project activities are discussed and some practical recommendations are identified based on a literature review, interviews and workshops with local government officials and residents. Through those opportunities, it was found that remote regencies around Lake Toba do not have environmentally sound final disposal sites and do not have the financial or technical capacity to provide waste collection and handling services to residents, which often results in illegal dumping and open burning of waste. It was also revealed that lack of established markets for recycling value chains and citizens participation in waste separation at source had resulted in limited success for recycling and 3R activities in the region.","Tatsuno, Miwa; Dickella Gamaralalage, Premakumara Jagath; Onogawa, Kazunobu","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",445,1

The massive data generated through the use of big data and artificial intelligence can play an important role in addressing this unprecedented global health and economic crisis. OBJECTIVES The objective of this work is to develop an expert system that combines several solutions to combat COVID-19. The main solution is based on a new developed software called General Guide (GG) application. This expert system allows us to explore, monitor, forecast, and optimize the data collected in order to take an efficient decision to ensure the safety of citizens, forecast, and slow down the spread's rate of COVID-19. It will also facilitate countries' interventions and optimize resources. Moreover, other solutions can be integrated into this expert system, such as the automatic vehicle and passenger sanitizing system equipped with a thermal and smart High Definition (HD) cameras and multi-purpose drones which offer many services. All of these solutions will facilitate lifting COVID-19 restrictions and minimize the impact of this pandemic. METHODS The methods used in this expert system will assist in designing and analyzing the model based on big data and artificial intelligence (machine learning). This can enhance countries' abilities and tools in monitoring, combating, and predicting the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS The results obtained by this prediction process and the use of the above mentioned solutions will help monitor, predict, generate indicators, and make operational decisions to stop the spread of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS This developed expert system can assist in stopping the spread of COVID-19 globally and putting the world back to work.","Tkatek, Said; Belmzoukia, Amine; Nafai, Said; Abouchabaka, Jaafar; Ibnou-Ratib, Youssef",Work,445,5

In the cerebellum, glutamate spillover from climbing fibers recruits molecular layer interneurons in the absence of conventional synaptic connections. Spillover-mediated signaling is typically limited by transporters that bind and reuptake glutamate. Here, we show that patterned expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) in Purkinje cells regulates glutamate spillover to molecular layer interneurons. Using male and female Aldolase C-Venus knock-in mice to visualize Zebrin microzones, we find larger climbing fiber-evoked spillover EPSCs in regions with low levels of EAAT4 compared to regions with high EAAT4. This difference is not explained by presynaptic glutamate release properties or postsynaptic receptor density but rather by differences in the glutamate concentration reaching receptors on interneurons. Inhibiting glutamate transport normalizes the differences between microzones, suggesting that heterogeneity in EAAT4 expression is a primary determinant of differential spillover. These results show that neuronal glutamate transporters limit extrasynaptic transmission in a non-cell autonomous manner and provide new insight into the functional specialization of cerebellar microzones.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTExcitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) help maintain the fidelity and independence of point-to-point synaptic transmission. Whereas glial transporters are critical to maintain low ambient levels of extracellular glutamate to prevent excitotoxicity, neuronal transporters have more subtle roles in shaping excitatory synaptic transmission. Here we show that the patterned expression of neuronal EAAT4 in cerebellar microzones controls glutamate spillover from cerebellar climbing fibers to nearby interneurons. These results contribute to fundamental understanding of neuronal transporter functions and specialization of cerebellar microzones.","Malhotra, Shreya; Banumurthy, Gokulakrishna; Pennock, Reagan; Vaden, Jada H; Sugihara, Izumi; Overstreet-Wadiche, Linda; Wadiche, Jacques I",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,445,1

Unfortunately, many physicians possess OUD stigma. Training during medical school presents an opportunity to reduce OUD stigma and improve opioid overdose reversal knowledge. This study assessed the efficacy of Opioid Overdose Awareness and Reversal Training (OOART) and evaluated the equivalency of the online and in-person OOART. Methods: Voluntary training was delivered to first-year medical (M1) students at one medical school. In 2018 and 2019, 29 and 68 M1 students, respectively, received in-person OOART training and completed pre- and post-training surveys. In 2020, 62 students participated in online OOART training, of which 53 completed both pre- and post-training surveys. Results: All three opioid overdose Knowledge questions showed significant improvements between pre- and post-training survey responses.

There were no statistical differences between in-person and online post-training survey results for two out of the three Knowledge questions and all 11 Attitude questions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that our OOART was effective in increasing opioid overdose reversal knowledge and reducing OUD stigma. There was no meaningful difference in outcomes between the training modalities.

Results from phase 1 and 2 trials of these vaccines, the first developed and produced in Latin America, have been encouraging, both in terms of safety and immunogenicity. The ongoing phase 3 trials will continue to look at safety, together with efficacy; parallel intervention studies involving over a million people in Havana will begin generating data on effectiveness. Coordination between Cuba's biotechnology sector and its public health system-particularly throughout the different levels of primary care-to control and treat COVID-19 is a cornerstone of the Cuban strategy and one that could serve as a blueprint for future pandemics. Another Cuban product, itolizumab, is showing positive results mitigating cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Developed in collaboration with Biocon (India), itolizumab is administered under an expanded access program to treat vulnerable populations in Cuba. Marshaling complementary capacities of dozens of institutions belonging to BioCubaFarma-the country's biotech conglomerate-and developing therapies, vaccines and medical technologies together, is another cornerstone of Cuba's strategy to combat COVID-19 and improve population health.

SETTING Sussex Eye Hospital, Brighton, United Kingdom. DESIGN Experimental study. METHODS In this ex vivo study on 15 porcine eyes, an optical particle counter was used to measure particles ≤10 µm using cumulative mode in the 6 built-in channels: 0.3 µm, 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 2.5 µm, 5 µm, and 10 μm aerosols during phacoemulsification. The two parts of the study were to: (1) assess the efficacy of the particle counter in the theater environment where there are dynamic changes in temperature and humidity; and (2) to measure aerosol generation with 3 phacoemulsification settings: (a) continuous power with 80% longitudinal (5 eyes); (b) continuous power with 100% torsional (5 eyes); and (c) continuous power with 80% longitudinal with application of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) on the ocular surface (5 eyes). Five measurements were taken pre-phacoemulsification and 5 during phacoemulsification per eye with a total of 75 measurements. RESULTS Maximum aerosols were captured effectively when the counter faced the aerosol source. There was no significant difference in aerosol generation of all sizes during each phacoemulsification setting with torsional, longitudinal and longitudinal with HPMC (p>001). Combining data of all 3 phacoemulsification settings (150 measurements from 15 eyes), there was no significant difference comparing pre-phacoemulsification and during phacoemulsification for aerosols ≤5µm (1455 vs 1363.85, p=0.60), >5-10μm (1.5 vs 1.03, p=0.43) and ≤10µm (1209 vs 1131.55, p=0.60). CONCLUSION Phacoemulsification did not generate aerosols ≤10 μm with continuous power using 80% longitudinal, 100% torsional or 80% longitudinal setting with HPMC on the surface.","Lee, Hanbin; Naveed, Hasan; Ashena, Zahra; Nanavaty, Mayank A",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,445,30

Introduction: FTA is the notation used when patients do not attend their designated outpatient appointment. FTA events waste appointment resources that could have been allocated to another patient and increase clinic waiting lists. Therefore, predicting FTA or identifying mechanisms to improve FTA rates could have both economic and patient benefits. Materials and Methods: Using activity data and patient demographic information from the immunology outpatient services at a large metropolitan hospital in Australia, descriptive statistics and regression analysis were used to investigate whether the telehealth modality or other patient or clinic characteristics had the potential to influence FTA rates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted using a panel set to group individual patient events together to explore the ability of patient characteristics or appointment characteristics to predict FTA events. Ethics approval was received from the Metro South Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/18/QMS/45889). Results: From April 2016 to September 2018, 6,131 appointments occurred, with an overall FTA rate of 16%. Telehealth accounted for 254 or 4.1% of all appointments. When in-person and telehealth modalities were examined separately, the FTA rates were 16.3% and 8.7%, respectively. The greatest predictor of FTA was found to be the modality by which the clinic was delivered, in person or telehealth. Patient-specific characteristics such as Indigenous status, previous FTA behavior, and whether the person was privately funded were also important factors. Discussion and Conclusions: These results indicate that offering appropriate patients the option of telehealth has the potential to reduce FTA. Given the impact of FTA on clinic viability, caseload burden, and waiting lists, telehealth should be explored further and, where possible, should be offered as a routine alternative to in-person appointments.","Snoswell, Centaine L; Comans, Tracy A",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,445,7

Study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment were performed for all included studies, while the outcome of interest pertained to differences in bacterial load quantification through the use of different interventions prior to aerosol-generating procedures in dental practices. Random effects frequentist network meta-analysis was performed, with mean difference (MD) and 95% CI as the effect measure. Confidence in the documented evidence was assessed through the newly fueled CINeMA framework (Confidence in Network Meta-analysis) based on the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Twenty-nine clinical trials were deemed eligible, 21 RCTs and 8 nonrandomized studies, while 11 RCTs contributed to the network meta-analysis, comprising 10 competing interventions. Tempered chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.2% as compared with nonactive control mouth rinse, prior to routine ultrasonic scaling, was most effective toward reduced postprocedural bacterial load with an MD of -0.92 (95% CI, -1.54 to -0.29) in log10 bacterial CFUs (colony-forming units). For CHX 0.2%, an MD of -0.74 (95% CI, -1.07 to -0.40) was observed as compared with control. Tempered CHX 0.2% presented the highest probabilities of being ranked the most effective treatment (31.2%). Level of confidence varied from very low to moderate across all formulated comparisons. These findings summarize the current state of research evidence in the field of aerosolized bacteria in dentistry. Instigated by the era of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the stipulation of a broader evaluation of the aerosolized microbes, including viruses, potentially coupled with disinfectant-based prevention schemes should be prioritized.","Koletsi, D; Belibasakis, G N; Eliades, T",Journal of dental research,445,1

The relationship between NIRS and quantitative aEEG/EEG parameters has not yet been investigated. Our aim was to study the association between oxygen utilization during the first 6 h after birth and simultaneously continuously monitored brain activity measured by aEEG/EEG. Forty-four hemodynamically stable babies with a GA < 28 weeks, with good quality NIRS and aEEG/EEG data available and who did not receive morphine were included in the study. aEEG and NIRS monitoring started at NICU admission. The relation between regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE), and quantitative measurements of brain activity such as number of spontaneous activity transients (SAT) per minute (SAT rate), the interval in seconds (i.e. time) between SATs (ISI) and the minimum amplitude of the EEG in μV (min aEEG) were evaluated. rScO2 was negatively associated with SAT rate (β=-3.45 [CI=-5.76- -1.15], p=0.004) and positively associated with ISI (β=1.45 [CI=0.44-2.45], p=0.006). cFTOE was positively associated with SAT rate (β=0.034 [CI=0.009-0.059], p=0.008) and negatively associated with ISI (β=-0.015 [CI=-0.026- -0.004], p=0.007). Oxygen delivery and utilization, as indicated by rScO2 and cFTOE, are directly related to functional brain activity, expressed by SAT rate and ISI during the first hours after birth, showing an increase in oxygen extraction in preterm infants with increased early electro-cerebral activity. NIRS monitored oxygenation may be a useful biomarker of brain vulnerability in high-risk infants.","Tataranno, Maria Luisa; Alderliesten, Thomas; de Vries, Linda S; Groenendaal, Floris; Toet, Mona C; Lemmers, Petra M A; Vosse van de, Renè E; van Bel, Frank; Benders, Manon J N L",PloS one,445,10

One hundred and twenty-two community-dwelling elderly people aged ≥ 65 were randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi or a Tai Chi plus CBI group. Participants' level of fear of falling, physical mobility, self-perceived personal wellbeing and social participation were compared before and after completing the 8-week intervention and then at a 2-month follow-up. The findings showed that Tai Chi both with and without CBI had a similar effect on reducing elderly people's fear of falling, but only Tai Chi plus CBI had a positive effect on participants' self-perceived personal wellbeing. Tai Chi both with and without CBI had no effect on participants' self-perceived social participation and mobility. Apart from a slight improvement in participants' self-perceived personal wellbeing, other outcome effects were similar for Tai Chi with and without CBI. This finding raises a question about the additive effects of combined intervention over Tai Chi alone in reducing elderly people's fear of falling. In view of the higher demand for resources and manpower to implement a combined intervention, further study is still required to confirm the potential additional benefits of this combined intervention prior to recommending it to community services.","Liu, Yat Wa Justina; Tsui, Chi Man",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,445,1

Globally, people spend much of their time indoor to contain or avoid people infected with the virus. Until now, there has been a rapid increase in diverts research works to find a lasting solution to this worldwide threat. In the past few years, IoT has drawn convincing ground in research fields range from academic and industrial fields, especially in healthcare. The IoT revolution reshapes contemporary healthcare systems by incorporate economic, social, and technological prospects. It progresses from conventional healthcare systems to more personalized healthcare systems, where patients can be monitored, diagnosed, and treated effortlessly. Wearable body sensor network has transformed the power to change our lifestyle with abundant technologies in areas of healthcare, entertainment, transportation, retail, business, and emergency services control. The integration of wireless sensors and sensor networks with simulation and intelligent systems research has developed an interdisciplinary definition of ambient intelligence to address the obstacles faced in our everyday lives. It is essential to build a reliable and efficient wearable system for monitoring during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the situation of COVID-19, an IoT-based wearable body sensor can be utilized to lower the possible spread of the pandemic using enabled/linked devices aimed at people for early diagnosis, monitoring during social distance, quarantine time, and after recovery. Therefore, this chapter reviews the role of IoT and wearable body sensor technologies in fighting COVID-19 and presents an IoT-based wearable body sensor architecture to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. IoT-based wearable body sensor can be used widely to control and track patient conditions in both towns and cities using an internal network, thus minimize pressure and tension on healthcare professionals, eliminating medical faults, reducing workload and medical staff productivity, reducing long-term healthcare costs, and enhancing patient satisfaction during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Awotunde, J.

However, governments, policy makers and the international community must quickly need to act, recognize and attempt to mitigate the negative impacts (current and potential) of the pandemic and related response efforts on key sectors that contribute to food security, nutrition and livelihoods. The livestock sector is a key contributor to these areas, especially for the world's most vulnerable populations. In the light of recent challenges in food supply chain, there is now considerable concern about the food production, processing, distribution, and demand. COVID-19 resulted in the movement restrictions of workers, changes in demand of consumers, closure of food production facilities, restricted food trade policies and financial pressures in food supply chain. The effects of COVID-19 on the livestock sector are still largely unquantified and yet to be fully felt. Formal assessments have not yet been possible, but current observations reveal disruptions to livestock value chains.

Another concern is the people in the sample not being representative of the general population. Statistical adjustment cannot without strong assumptions correct for selection bias in an opt-in sample, but multilevel regression and poststratification can at least adjust for known differences between sample and population. We demonstrate these models with code in R and Stan and discuss their application to a controversial recent study of COVID-19 antibodies in a sample of people from the Stanford University area.

Moreover, based on ecological perspectives on the role of family context, we consider partnership status and parental status as predictors of changes in these variables over time. Using a longitudinal research design, we model co-occurring trajectories of changes in family demands and satisfaction with family life between early April 2020 and early September 2020 using unconditional and conditional multivariate latent growth curve modeling. Results suggest that, on average, both family demands and satisfaction with family life increased across this time period and that having minor children ≤ 17 years of age was associated with decreases in satisfaction with family life across time. Moreover, an exploratory analysis suggests that partnership status may help offset the positive relationship between parental status and family demands. These findings have implications for future research on family life during a crisis and suggest that single parents of young children should be the focus of interventions to reduce family-related stressors and increase levels of family wellbeing during times of crisis.

Objective: To describe the development of a program for delivering clinical education for all ATSs through a VLE model. Background: Athletic training programs were faced with the task of delivering clinical education for all students through a virtual learning model. Further complicating the situation was that no blueprint for a VLE existed for athletic training. Description: The ATP developed clear, definitive objectives for a 6-week VLE, but afforded each clinical site the autonomy to determine how it could best implement the objectives of the VLE based upon its individual strengths and limitations. Advantage(s): Students reported increased self-motivation, improved communication skills and self-confidence, an improved ability to adapt to new situations, increased independence, personal and professional growth, the ability to stay positive and focused in the face of unexpected challenges, increased appreciation and application of evidence-based practice, and a more in-depth understanding and confidence related to organization and administration topics. Conclusion(s): Virtual learning environments offer an alternative for accomplishing the clinical education of ATSs when they cannot be physically present because of extenuating circumstances, such as a pandemic.

As a result, there is a need for data-driven approaches to pinpoint the unique constellation of clinical and social determinants of health (SDOH) risk factors that give rise to poor patient outcomes following infection in US communities. We combined county-level COVID-19 testing data, COVID-19 vaccination rates, and SDOH information in Tennessee. Between February-May 2021, we trained machine learning models on a semi-monthly basis using these datasets to predict COVID-19 incidence in Tennessee counties.

MBCs are a heterogeneous population whose function can be dictated by isotype or expression of particular surface proteins. Here, aided by antigen-specific B-cell tetramers, MBC populations were evaluated to discern their phenotype and function in response to infection with a non-lethal strain of P. yoelii. Infection of mice with P. yoelii 17X resulted in the production of two predominant MBC populations: somatically hypermutated isotype-switched (IgM-) and IgM+ MBCs that co-expressed CD73 and CD80 that produced antigen-specific antibodies in response to secondary infection. Re-challenge experiments indicated that IgG-producing cells dominated the recall response over the induction of IgM-secreting cells, with both populations expanding with similar timing during the secondary response. Furthermore, using ZsGreen1 expression as a surrogate for activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression alongside CD73 and CD80 co-expression, ZsGreen1+CD73+CD80+IgM+ MBCs gave rise to class-switched IgG-producing plasmablasts that induced comparable titers of Ag-specific Abs as their IgM- counterparts after adoptive transfer and infection with P. yoelii. Moreover, ZsGreen1+CD73+CD80+ IgM+ and IgM- MBCs differentiated into B cells with a germinal center phenotype after adoptive transfer. A third population of B cells (ZsGreen1-CD73-CD80-IgM-) that emerges after infection responded poorly to reactivation in vitro and in vivo, indicating that these cells do not represent a population of MBCs. Together these data indicated that MBC function is not defined by immunoglobulin isotype, nor does co-expression of key surface markers limit the potential fate of MBCs after recall.

An understanding of how these policies impacted travel patterns over time and at different spatial scales is important for designing effective strategies, future pandemic planning and in providing broader insights on the population geography of the country. Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying in near-real time the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility.

We find substantial heterogeneities across time and region, with large changes observed compared to pre-pandemic patterns. The impacts of periods of lockdown on distances travelled and flow volumes are evident, with each showing variations, but some significant reductions in co-location rates. Clear differences in multiple metrics of mobility are seen in central London compared to the rest of the UK, with each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland showing significant deviations from England at times. Moreover, the impacts of rapid changes in rules on international travel to and from the UK are seen in substantial fluctuations in traveller volumes by destination.

Therefore, the main goal of this study is to assess the impact of cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge on the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. Design/methodology/approach Cloud-based e-learning system (CELS) provides all e-learning requirements like software and hardware resources to promote conventional e-learning technologies. The CELS stands on several factors of diverse aspects that have been of high significance in CELS success. So, these systems must be checked to analyze their significance rate and successfully carry out their effectiveness. On the other hand, these days, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) changes our daily lifestyles. Therefore, the present investigation provides a new model investigating the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. Also, an online questionnaire was used to gather the data. The content validity of the questionnaire was obtained by applying the opinions of ten experts from e-learning specialists. The collected data are analyzed using LISREL and Smart PLS software. Findings The results from the path coefficient and the sample t-test have implied that skills and knowledge positively influence CELS in the COVID-19 era. In addition, the relationship between cultural characteristics and CELS in the COVID-19 era has been positive and significant. The relationship between the economic situations and the CELS in the COVID-19 era is positive and significant. Practical implications The proposed model helps managers get a big picture of CELS necessities and more effectively in the COVID-19 era. This research has a unique impact on universities to develop an e-learning platform to facilitate the education process in the COVID-19 era. It provides guidelines for educational institutions to effectively implement the learning management system to facilitate students' education. Originality/value CELS are getting increasingly essential to offer training courses more efficiently in educational institutions. Although the intersection between cloud computing and e-learning has increasingly grown in both practical and academic contexts, few studies on the impact of cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge on the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. This paper explores the ignored but critically important subject of CELS. This paper's main contribution is to present a new and integrated model containing the essential aspects of the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. The proposed framework comprises cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge aspects simultaneously, as well as sub-criteria denoting each element.","Teng, L. Y.; Tan, Q.

We study the booster effect on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS We extracted data for the period July 30, 2021 to October 5, 2021 from the Israeli Ministry of Health database regarding 4,616,994 persons. We compared confirmed Covid-19 infections, severe illness, and death of those who received a booster [≥]12 days earlier (booster group) with a nonbooster group. In a secondary analysis, we compared the rates 3-7 days with [≥]12 days after receiving the booster dose. We used Poisson regressions to estimate rate ratios after adjusting for possible confounding factors. RESULTS Confirmed infection rates were {approx}10-fold lower in the booster versus nonbooster group (ranging 8.8-17.8 across five age groups) and 4.7-11.4 fold lower in the secondary analysis. Severe illness rates in the primary and secondary analysis were 19.1-fold (95% CI, 15.9-23) and 6.5-fold (95% CI, 5.1-8.4) lower for ages 60+, and 20.7-fold (95% CI, 9.7-44.2) and 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1-8.8) lower for ages 40-60. For ages 60+, COVID-19 associated death rates were 13.9-fold (95% CI, 8.8-22) lower in the primary analysis and 4.6-fold (95% CI, 2.7-7.9) lower in the secondary analysis. CONCLUSIONS Across all age groups, rates of confirmed infection and severe illness were substantially lower among those who received a booster dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.","Bar-On, Y.

Long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients who discharge intensive care unit (ICU) are unclear. Objectives We investigated the effect of COVID-19 on lung structure, pulmonary functional, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients discharge from ICU and medical ward. Methods A prospective single-centre study conducted in PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients who has been discharged from University of Health Sciences, Dr. Suat Seren Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Teaching and Research Hospital between 15 January and 5 March 2021. Patients who followed up for more than 48 hours in ICU and more than 72 hours in medical ward were included the study. Computed tomography scores, pulmonary functional tests (PFT), 6-min walking distance and health related quality of life by SF-36 were compared between ICU and medical ward patients at 6 months after discharge. Results Seventy patients were included final analyses and 31 of them discharged from ICU. ICU patients had higher CT scores than non-ICU patients at admission (17 vs 11) and follow up visit (6 vs 0). Two-three of ICU patients had at least one abnormal finding at control CT. Advanced age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15) and higher CT score at admission (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.27) were risk factors for having radiological abnormalities at control CT. Conclusion A number of COVID-19 survivors especially with severe disease could not fully recover after 6 months of hospital discharge.","Yildirim, S.; Susam, S.; Cimen, P.; Yapicioglu, S.; Sunecli, O.; Ediboglu, O.; Kirakli, C.",,445,24

Thus, training teachers to use these tools was extremely crucial. The current study examined the effectiveness of E-learning environments on developing the skills to design E-tivities based on Gamification for Gaza technology teachers. The researchers followed the quasi-experimental approach for two randomly selected experimental groups. The first experimental group was taught via E-learning social environment Edmodo, while the second experimental group was taught via the personal E-learning environment WordPress. Every group consists of 30 teachers teaching Information Technology for secondary students. The group equivalence was adjusted before the experiment in designing E-tivities skills based on gamification. To collect data, the researchers prepared an observation card of the skills for designing E-tivities based on gamification. The observation card dealt with the design tools and their sub-indicators, and it was applied before and after the intervention phase. The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences at the level (alpha &lt;= 0.05) between the mean of the teachers' scores in the experimental social environment group Edmodo, and the experimental personal learning environment group WordPress in the post-application of the observation card for designing E-tivities skills based on gamification. Additionally, the findings revealed great effectiveness of E-learning social environment Edmodo and the personal E-learning environment WordPress on developing skills for designing E-tivities based on gamification. In light of these results, it is recommended that social and personal E-learning environments should be employed in developing the skills of teachers and improving their experiences.

Since then, world governments have coordinated information flows and issued guidelines to contain the overwhelming effects of this disease. At the same time, the scientific community is continually seeking information about transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of the disease, new diagnoses, and strategies for prevention and treatment. One of the challenges is performing the tests for the diagnosis of the disease, whose technique adopted for the detection of the genetic material of COVID-19 requires equipment and specialized human resources, making it an expensive procedure. We hypothesize that machine learning techniques can be used to classify the test results for COVID-19 through the joint analysis of popular laboratory tests' clinical parameters. Machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines Regression, enable the creation of disease prediction models and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze clinical parameters. Thus, we evaluated the existing correlations between laboratory parameters and the result of the COVID-19 test, and developed two classification models: the first classifies the test results for patients with suspected COVID-19, and the second classifies the hospitalization units of patients with COVID-19, both according to the laboratory parameters. The models achieved an accuracy above 96%, showing that they are promising to the classification of tests for COVID-19 and screen patients by hospitalization unit.","Oliveira, Rfap Bastos C. J.

Excess mortality, which is defined as the increase in observed death counts compared to a baseline expectation, provides an alternate measure of the mortality shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we use data from civil death registers for 54 municipalities across the state of Gujarat, India, to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality.

Previous studies assumed that DMN or GDN activity manifests in behavior with minimal delays and has rigid effects, i.e., DMN always facilitates generation of spontaneous thought and inhibits cognitive control. With those static response functions, the antagonism of DMN and GDN could explain the alternation of task focused and mind wandering states. But it rules out others, such as multi-tasking, where spontaneous thought and cognitive control are both increased, or rumination, where both are decreased. However, shifts from task focused to mind wandering have been shown to occur via a multi-tasking state. We therefore propose dynamic response functions, allowing delay or reversal of DMN and GDN effects. Dynamic response functions enabled us to stochastically predict mind wandering up to at least 30 min in advance from EEG measures of DMN and GDN activity in a tone counting task. Experimental results show both considerable delays and switches between task-positive and negative effects. Mind wandering was initiated by a barrage of DMN activity more than 20 minutes prior a report of mind wandering, directing the mental focus inward. Critically, facilitation of spontaneous thoughts occurred several minutes prior to the report. These thoughts sustained up to 10 min, after which a rebound to task-focused behavior was effectuated, notably without intervention from the GDN. Repeated GDN interventions, however, secured a basic level of task performance.","Nakatani, Chie; Bernhard, Hannah; van Leeuwen, Cees",bioRxiv,445,16

In many cases these do not reflect real-life diagnostic sensitivities. Therefore, manufacturer-independent quality checks of available AgPOCTs are needed, given the potential implications of false-negative results. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a scalable approach for direct comparison of the analytical sensitivities of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antigen point-of-care tests (AgPOCTs) in order to rapidly identify poor performing products. Methods: We present a methodology for quick assessment of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow test stripes suitable for quality evaluation of many different products. We established reference samples with high, medium and low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads along with a SARS-CoV-2 negative control sample. Test samples were used to semi-quantitatively assess the analytical sensitivities of 32 different commercial AgPOCTs in a head-to-head comparison. Results: Among 32 SARS-CoV-2 AgPOCTs tested, we observe sensitivity differences across a broad range of viral loads (~7.0*10 to ~1.7*10 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per ml). 23 AgPOCTs detected the Ct25 test sample (~1.4*10 copies/ ml), while only five tests detected the Ct28 test sample (~1.7*10 copies/ ml). In the low range of analytical sensitivity we found three saliva spit tests only delivering positive results for the Ct21 sample (~2.2*10 copies/ ml). Comparison with published data support our AgPOCT ranking. Importantly, we identified an AgPOCT offered in many local drugstores and supermarkets, which did not reliably recognize the sample with highest viral load (Ct16 test sample with ~7.0*10 copies/ ml) leading to serious doubts in its usefulness in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Conclusion: The rapid sensitivity assessment procedure presented here provides useful estimations on the analytical sensitivities of 32 AgPOCTs and identified a widely-spread AgPOCT with concerningly low sensitivity.","Denzler, A.; Jacobs, M.

This initial section is split chronologically into the early neonatal and infantile period and later childhood and adulthood; with the intention of reflecting clinical practice as closely and succinctly as possible. Disorders of the biliary tree, bile formation and secretion, and hepatocyte metabolism are the core of this chapter, a merger of chapters 3 and 4 of the previous edition. Considerations on the pathogenetic and/or clinical overlap between developmental, genetic and metabolic disorders were the rationale behind this change. The complexity of hepatocyte metabolism is reflected into the miriad of related pathological conditions. Recent technological advances, particularly in genomics in the last five years, have resulted in a plethora of new entities and changes in terminology, challenging the authors to balance detail and application to clinical practice. Tables and figures from previous editions have been largely kept due to their quality and contemporary relevance, whilst new ones have been added to accommodate new advances (e.g. classification of mitochondrial disorders), a compromise to bridge between the two editions for the accustomed reader. Liver involvement in immunodeficiency and miscellaneous disorders precede the final section on anatomical anomalies.

Self-organizing neural networks possess the capability to cluster countries in the space domain based on their similar characteristics, with respect to their COVID-19 cases. This form enables the finding of countries that have a similar behavior, and thus can benefit from utilizing the same methods in fighting the virus propagation. In order to validate the approach, publicly available datasets of COVID-19 cases worldwide have been used. In addition, a fuzzy fractal approach is utilized for the temporal analysis of the time series of the countries considered in this study. Then, a hybrid combination, using fuzzy rules, of both the self-organizing maps and the fuzzy fractal approach is proposed for efficient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forecasting of the countries. Relevant conclusions have emerged from this study that may be of great help in putting forward the best possible strategies in fighting the virus pandemic. Many of the existing works concerned with COVID-19 look at the problem mostly from a temporal viewpoint, which is of course relevant, but we strongly believe that the combination of both aspects of the problem is relevant for improving the forecasting ability. The main idea of this article is combining neural networks with a self-organizing nature for clustering countries with a high similarity and the fuzzy fractal approach for being able to forecast the times series. Simulation results of COVID-19 data from countries around the world show the ability of the proposed approach to first spatially cluster the countries and then to accurately predict in time the COVID-19 data for different countries with a fuzzy fractal approach.","Melin, Patricia Castillo Oscar",Sustainability,445,1

We aimed to characterise aerosol and droplet generation in gastrointestinal endoscopy, where there is little evidence. Design This prospective observational study included patients undergoing routine per-oral gastroscopy (POG, n=36), trans-nasal endoscopy (TNE, n=11) and lower gastrointestinal (LGI) endoscopy (n=48). Particle counters took measurements near the appropriate orifice (two models used, diameter ranges 0.3um-25um and 20um-3000um). Quantitative analysis was performed by recording specific events and subtracting the background particles. Results POG produced 2.06x the level of background particles (p<0.001), and 2.13x the number of particles compared to TNE. LGI procedures produce significant particle counts (p<0.001), with a rate of 8.8x106/min/m3 compared to 13.0x106/min/m3 for POG. Events significant relative to the noise floor of background particles were: POG- throat spray (112.3x, p<0.01), oesophageal extubation (36.7x, p<0.001), coughing/gagging (30.7x, p<0.01); TNE- nasal spray (32.8x, p<0.01), nasal extubation (25.6x, p<0.01), coughing/gagging (23.3x, p<0.01); LGI- rectal intubation (3.5x, p<0.05), rectal extubation (11.8x, p<0.01), application of abdominal pressure (4.9x, p<0.05). These all produced particle counts larger than or comparable to volitional cough. Conclusions Gastrointestinal endoscopy performed via the mouth, nose or rectum all generates significant quantities of aerosols and droplets. As the infectivity of procedures is not established, we therefore suggest adequate PPE is used for all GI endoscopy where there is a high population prevalence of COVID-19. Avoiding throat and nasal spray would significantly reduce particles generated from UGI procedures.","Phillips, F. M.; Crowley, J.; Warburton, S.; Gordon, G. S. D.; Parra-Blanco, A.",,445,1

Due to rising infections, it has a significant impact on society as well as the economy. Although vaccines and treatment are available now, there is a need to control the pandemic's spread by appropriate strategies and policies. This study evaluates incidence such as positive rates and mortality rates through breakpoints, which were not undertaken in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In this regard, we have two-fold objectives: (1) to forecast the cumulative confirmed cases and death cases and (2) to compute the incidence rate within two consecutive days and evaluate the forecasted periods. The autoregressive integrated moving average model is used to forecast the cumulative confirmed cases and death cases for two months. The segmented regression model is used to split the pandemic time series into six periods and compute the incidence rate. Our results show that cumulative confirmed cases will reach 335733 in Kuwait and 445805 in Saudi Arabia by the beginning of June 2021. The cumulative death cases will reach 1830 and 7283 in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, respectively. However, the positive rate will increase during the forecasted period in both countries, while the death rate will decrease in Kuwait and increase in Saudi Arabia.

Since exposed individuals and infected individuals can infect the susceptible with different transmission rates, we use the Markovian approach to construct a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model with recurrent mobility patterns in the metapopulation network. We first theoretically calculate the epidemic threshold, and then, perform the proposed model in different underlying metapopulation networks, named as ER-like metapopulation network and BA-like metapopulation network. Simulation results indicate that BA-like metapopulation network is more conductive for epidemic spreading. Further research presents that both comprehensive interferences and the initial mobility rate can influence disease propagation heavily. In particular, for ER-like metapopulation network, comprehensive interferences can suppress the disease propagation when the initial mobility rate approaches to one. Whereas for BA-like metapopulation network, comprehensive interferences can contain the disease when the initial mobility rate is greater than a certain value. Meanwhile, implementing stronger interventions in patches with larger populations could reduce epidemic spreading effectively in BA-like metapopulation network. In addition, a long latent period could lead to the spread and infection of disease in both kinds of metapopulation networks.","Shao, Qi Han Dun",Applied Mathematics and Computation,445,1

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the share of international air travel with non-CIS countries dropped sharply to 29%, the share of international flights with the countries of the near abroad decreased to 2.2%. Despite the decrease in the number of domestic flights by 17%, the share of the number of domestic passenger flights increased from 43.9% to 68.5%. In Russia, in 2020 the leaders in passenger air transportation are three airlines: 1) Aeroflot (with a market capacity of 21%), 2) Siberia (18%), 3) low-cost airline Pobeda (13.2%). According to our calculations, the economic losses of Russian airlines due to the pandemic amounted to 13.708 billion dollars (or 8.8% of airline losses on a global scale). Our analysis showed that there are two large aviation harbors in Russia - Moscow and St. Petersburg. They account for an average of 45-55% of the total number of flights in the country. Nine Russian airports account for 75% of air travel. In the near future, the development of all types of domestic tourism will continue the growth dynamics, which will contribute to the revitalization of the aviation business.","Kuznetsova, A.","Hradec Economic Days, Vol 11(1)",445,12

Here we present the Nucleic Transformer, a conceptually simple but effective and interpretable model architecture that excels in a variety of DNA/RNA tasks. The Nucleic Transformer processes nucleic acid sequences with self-attention and convolutions, two deep learning techniques that have proved dominant in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. We demonstrate that the Nucleic Transformer can be trained in both supervised and unsupervised fashion without much domain knowledge to achieve high performance with limited amounts of data in Escherichia coli promoter classification, viral genome identification, and degradation properties of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates. Additionally, we showcase extraction of promoter motifs from learned attention and how direct visualization of self-attention maps assists informed decision making using deep learning models.","He, Shujun; Gao, Baizhen; Sabnis, Rushant; Sun, Qing",bioRxiv,445,1

During this time, online social networks, more than ever, have represented an alternative solution for social life, allowing users to interact and debate with each other. Hence, it is of paramount importance to understand the changing use of social networks brought about by the pandemic. In this paper, we analyze how the interaction patterns around popular influencers in Italy changed during the first six months of 2020, within Instagram and Facebook social networks. We collected a large dataset for this group of public figures, including more than 54 million comments on over 140 thousand posts for these months. We analyze and compare engagement on the posts of these influencers and provide quantitative figures for aggregated user activity. We further show the changes in the patterns of usage before and during the lockdown, which demonstrated a growth of activity and sizable daily and weekly variations. We also analyze the user sentiment through the psycholinguistic properties of comments, and the results testified the rapid boom and disappearance of topics related to the pandemic.

Unfortunately, there is no reliable treatment or vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 right now. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a photon therapy based on PBM which uses a light sourcing in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. It has general effects like metabolic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The most important method for COVID-19 management are oxygenation and faster rehabilitation of the damaged tissue, antiviral effects and finally controlling the cytokine storm by reducing inflammatory agents. Photobiomodulation may be used as an adjuvant therapy or even an alternative therapy for all these mechanisms without side effects and drug interactions. We can increase these effects by combining this method with another method known as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, possibly. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been investigated as a novel way of inhibiting bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Studies indicate that PBM and aPDT could be useful in many viral and bacterial pulmonary complications like Influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS. In conclusion COVID-19 disease is very unknown, and scientists in any area must manage the challenge, in any way possible. According to mechanisms mentioned earlier, we are referring to the capabilities of photobiomodulation and photodynamic therapy. The best use is a combination of both methods. Present treatments are focused on virus removal, tissue oxygenation, and reduction of cytokine storm. In combination with these two methods, we can achieve these goals with minimal interference with pharmaceutical methods and battle this disease with biophysical agents. © 2021 SPIE.","Fekrazad, R.","Photonic Diagnosis, Monitoring, Prevention, and Treatment of Infections and Inflammatory Diseases 2021",445,1

Several observations support a role for vascular endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis including an increased incidence of thrombotic events and coagulopathy and the presence of vascular risk factors as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. It has recently been reported that endothelitis is associated with viral inclusion bodies suggesting a direct role for SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis. The ACE2 receptor has been shown to mediate SARS-CoV-2 uptake and it has been proposed that CD147 (BSG) can function as an alternative cell surface receptor. To define the endothelial cell populations that are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 as well as other genes implicated in the cellular entry of SARS-Cov-2 in the vascular endothelium through the analysis of single cell sequencing data derived from multiple human tissues (skin, liver, kidney, lung and intestine). We found that CD147 (BSG) but not ACE2 is detectable in vascular endothelial cells within single cell sequencing datasets derived from multiple tissues in healthy individuals. This implies that either ACE2 is not expressed in healthy tissue but is instead induced in response to SARS-Cov2 or that SARS-Cov2 enters endothelial cells via an alternative receptor such as CD147.","Ganier, C; Du-Harpur, X; Harun, N; Wan, B; Arthurs, C; Luscombe, NM; Watt, FM; Lynch, MD",bioRxiv,445,1

IU has been reliably associated with disrupted threat extinction. However, it remains unclear whether IU would be related to disrupted extinction to other arousing stimuli that are not threatening (i.e., rewarding). We addressed this question by conducting a reward associative learning task with acquisition and extinction training phases (n = 58). Throughout the associative learning task, we recorded valence ratings (i.e. liking), skin conductance response (SCR) (i.e. sweating), and corrugator supercilii activity (i.e. brow muscle indicative or negative and positive affect) to learned reward and neutral cues. During acquisition training with partial reward reinforcement, higher IU was associated with greater corrugator supercilii activity to neutral compared to reward cues. IU was not related to valence ratings or SCR’s during the acquisition or extinction training phases. These preliminary results suggest that IU-related deficits during extinction may be limited to situations with threat. The findings further our conceptual understanding of IU’s role in the associative learning and extinction of reward, and in relation to the processing of threat and reward more generally.","Morriss, Jayne; Biagi, Nicolo; Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Andreatta, Marta",bioRxiv,445,16

In this longitudinal study, self-selected UK adults (n=1,733) completed three online surveys (May-June, August-September and November-December 2020, with a retrospective pre-pandemic component in the baseline survey), self-reporting sociodemographics, lifestyle and behaviours, including high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks, HFSS meals and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. Monthly HFSS snacks portion intake increased from pre-pandemic levels (48.3) in May-June (57.6, p<0.001), decreased in August-September (43.7, p<0.001), before increasing back to pre-pandemic levels in November-December (49.2, p<0.001). 48.5% self-reported increased (25.9 [95% confidence interval: 24.1, 27.8]) and 47.7% self-reported decreased (24.1 [22.4,26.0]) monthly HFSS snacks portion intakes in November-December compared with pre-pandemic levels. Monthly HFSS meals portion intake decreased from pre-pandemic levels (7.1) in May-June (5.9, p<0.001), being maintained in August-September (5.9, p=0.897), and then increasing again in November-December (6.6, p<0.001), to intakes that remained lower than pre-pandemic levels (p=0.007). 35.2% self-reported increased (4.8 [4.3, 5.3]) and 44.5% self-reported decreased (5.1 [4.6,5.6]) monthly HFSS meals portion intakes in November-December compared with pre-pandemic levels. The proportion meeting FV intake recommendations was stable from pre-pandemic through to August-September (70%), but decreased in November-December 2020 (67%, p=0.034). Increased monthly HFSS snacks intake was associated with female gender, lower quality of life, and - in a time-varying manner - older age and higher HFSS meals intake. Increased monthly HFSS meals intake was associated with female gender, living with adults only and higher HFSS snacks intake. Reduced FV intake was associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and lower physical activity. These results suggest large interindividual variability in dietary change during the first year of the pandemic, with important public health implications in individuals experiencing persistent increases in unhealthy diet choices, associated with BMI, gender, quality of life, living conditions, physical activity and other dietary behaviours.","Dicken, S.

Exposure(s): Confirmed COVID-19 positive by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Main outcomes were percentages of patients prescribed medications, overall, by age group, and by comorbidity based on hospitalization status. Use percentage by month of COVID-19 diagnosis was measured. Cumulative count of potential therapeutic options was measured over time. Results: Dataset included 22897 unique patients with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 42.4 [20.4] years; 12154 [53%] female). Among the sample, 6326 28%) were non-Hispanic White, 8475 (37%) were Hispanic, 1562 (7%) Asian, and 1313 (6%) Black. A COVID-related hospitalization occurred in 3546 patients. Of the hospitalized patients, more than 30% had baseline comorbidities of hypertension (48%), hyperlipidemia (37%), and type 2 diabetes (35%). Most frequently used medications in patients overall were acetaminophen (21.2%), albuterol (14.9%), ondansetron (13.9%), and enoxaparin (10.8%). Medications used were generally similar across ages and comorbidities. Prior to May, dexamethasone was rarely used, with well under 50 COVID-19 patients that had been hospitalized to that point receiving the medication. By mid-August, more than 500 patients to that point had received dexamethasone. Hydroxychloroquine use effectively halted in COVID-19 hospitalized patients after May. Throughout the period of March to December 2020, enoxaparin was used in the most patients to that point at any instance. By mid-December, more than 2000 in the analysis cohort of hospitalized patients had received enoxaparin. Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective cohort study, across age and comorbidity groups, predominant utilization was for supportive care therapy. Dexamethasone and remdesivir experienced large increases in use. Conversely, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use markedly dropped. Medication utilization rapidly shifted towards more evidence-concordant treatment of patients with COVID-19 as rigorous study findings emerged.","Watanabe, J. H.; Kwon, J.; Nan, B.; Abeles, S.

Neutrophils from these tissues expressed the CCL28 receptor CCR3, and CCR3 stimulation enhanced neutrophil antimicrobial activity against Salmonella. Moreover, bone marrow neutrophils harbored pre-formed intracellular CCR3 that was rapidly mobilized to the cell surface following phagocytosis or inflammatory stimuli. The functional consequences of CCL28 deficiency were strikingly different between two infection models, as Ccl28-/- mice were highly susceptible to Salmonella gut infection, but highly resistant to otherwise lethal Acinetobacter lung infection.

Shared and diverse underpinnings of psychiatric disorders cannot be systematically understood on the basis of symptom-based categories of mental disorders, which map poorly onto pathophysiological mechanisms. In the MIND-Set study, we make use of current concepts of comorbidity that transcend the current diagnostic categories. We test this approach to psychiatric problems in patients with frequently occurring psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities (excluding psychosis). The main objective of the MIND-Set project is to determine the shared and specific mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and stress-related psychiatric disorders at different observational levels. Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional study. Data from different observational levels as defined in the research domain criteria (RDoC; genetics, physiology, neuropsychology, system level neuroimaging, behavior, self-report and experimental neurocognitive paradigms) are collected over four time points. Included are adult ([≥] 18 years), non-psychotic, psychiatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of a stress-related disorder (mood disorder, anxiety disorder and/or addiction disorder) and/or a neurodevelopmental disorder (ASD and/or ADHD). Individuals with no current or past psychiatric diagnosis are included as controls. Data collection started in June 2016 with the aim to include a total of 650 patients and 150 healthy controls by 2021. The data collection procedure includes online questionnaires and three subsequent sessions with 1) Standardized clinical examination, physical examination, and blood sampling; 2) Psychological constructs, neuropsychological tests, and biological marker sampling; 3) Neuroimaging measures. Discussion: The MIND-Set study enables us to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of non-psychotic psychiatric disorders transdiagnostically. We will identify both shared and disorder-specific markers at different observational levels that can be used as targets for future diagnostic and treatment approaches","Eijndhoven, P. v.; Collard, R.; Vrijsen, J.

In this paper, we propose a prospective screening tool wherein we use chest CT scans to diagnose the patients for COVID-19 pneumonia. We use a set of open-source images, available as individual CT slices, and full CT scans from a private Indian Hospital to train our model. We build a 2D segmentation model using the U-Net architecture, which gives the output by marking out the region of infection. Our model achieves a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.88-1.00) and a specificity of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.94). Additionally, we derive a logic for converting our slice-level predictions to scan-level, which helps us reduce the false positives.","Lokwani, R.; Gaikwad, A.; Kulkarni, V.; Pant, A.; Kharat, A.",Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods,445,13

A Structural Topic Modelling Analysis of Free-Text Data from 11,000 UK Adults",17.893324,3.6304815,2021-08-13,"The paper offers some thoughts prompted by the research paper published by Peter Lor, Bradley Wiles, and Johannes Britz, “Re-Thinking Information Ethics: Truth, Conspiracy Theories, and Librarians in the COVID-19 Era,” in LIBRI, March 2021. It highlights two significant contributions, an analysis of the misinformation in the COVID-19 pandemic and the notion of alethic rights, the right of truth of patrons based on the work of D’Agostini. This reflection then situates the COVID-19 misinformation campaign within the broader disinformation ecology within which it exists. While it agrees that alethic rights are an important ethical framework, it wonders whether it practically advances work beyond that libraries and librarians are already doing, e.g., in collection decisions, approaches to reference questions, or library programming. It looks at the debate between John Swan and Noel Peattie on the inclusion of books representing outright lies in the collection (e.g., Holocaust denial). It then contrasts a right to information and authorities propagating and validating that information with a right to misinformation and authorities for propagating and validating that misinformation that exists within disinformation ecologies. The problem of truth, its authorities and its context appears to be more complicated than an appeal to alethic truths: for example, liberals and conservatives differ on the meaning of a rational consensus on contentious political matters, such as climate change. Given the dire consequences of misinformation on democracies and public health, an appeal to professional neutrality is woefully inadequate. There must be proactive resistance, if not outright repudiation.

The mental health of readers and viewers can also be affected by the media after tragic events. Potentially, the media have a proactive role in shaping the actions of the mass population and thereby influencing policy actions. The print media especially are considered a key avenue for taking information to the masses. However, in this information and communications technology (ICT) era, people are increasingly reluctant to carry hard-copy newspapers, instead preferring e-newspapers. At the present time, entire newspapers, and especially their opinion sections, are deluged by concerns about the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. After China and Japan first encountered COVID-19, other Asian countries began their COVID-19 fight at different times between January and March 2020. All affected countries sought to manage the pandemic in their own way, following lessons learned from China and Japan. Every form of media in affected countries highlighted concerns by presenting news, perceptions, and opinions related to the pandemic. With opinion sections and editorials, the key sections of e-newspapers to reflect experts' perceptions and thoughts, this study aims to examine experts' views in the e-newspapers of five different countries in Asia, in relation to China and Japan. Considering the diversity of socioeconomic and geopolitical settings, five countries-South Korea, Singapore, Iran, India, and Bangladesh-are selected, each represented by one leading English-language e-newspaper. This study explores how experts' perceptions in the studied countries present different aspects of life. It also examines which e-newspaper emphasized which aspect of life and in which period of the outbreak. By intensive text mining in each selected e-newspaper, the study found that experts' opinions addressed diverse issues with regard to COVID-19. These issues are grouped under the following eight categories: health and drugs, preparedness and awareness, social welfare and humanity, the economy, governance and institutions, politics, the environment and wildlife, and innovation and technology. This pioneering study of five different e-newspapers in Asian countries from January to March 2020 presents a similar picture of experts' concerns and their roles in shaping responses to health crises;thus, it plays a role in contributing to policy actions.","Parvin, G.

However, they are not usually observed, but rather assumed as self-evident and necessarily “good.” The purpose of the article is to summarize the theory of morality from the social systems' perspective and illustrate with concrete examples the polemogenous nature of moral communication. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents an analysis of the role of morality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspective of Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory. Applying the method of second-order observation, it describes three cases of moral semantics disseminated via mass media and social media, and it examines their connection with the structural situation of subsystems of society during the pandemic crisis (particularly healthcare, politics and science). Findings: Second-order observation of moral communication demonstrates to be fruitful to describe the conditions and consequences in which moralization of communication occurs, particularly in a situation of critical transition around the healthcare crisis. The three examples examined, namely, the hero semantics directed to healthcare workers, the semantics of indiscipline and the controversies around pseudo-sciences and conspiracy theories, show how they are based on social attribution of esteem and disesteem, how they try to answer to troublesome situations and contradictions that seem difficult to cope, and how they are close related to the emergence of conflicts, even when they seem positive oriented and well intentioned. Originality/value: This paper is an attempt to test the usefulness of Luhmann's theory of society to understand the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and particularly the role of moral communication in concrete examples. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Morales, F.

Successful Twitter bot detection proposals are generally supervised, which rely heavily on large-scale datasets. However, existing benchmarks generally suffer from low levels of user diversity, limited user information and data scarcity. Therefore, these datasets are not sufficient to train and stably benchmark bot detection measures. To alleviate these problems, we present TwiBot-20, a massive Twitter bot detection benchmark, which contains 229,573 users, 33,488,192 tweets, 8,723,736 user property items and 455,958 follow relationships. TwiBot-20 covers diversified bots and genuine users to better represent the real-world Twittersphere. TwiBot-20 also includes three modals of user information to support both binary classification of single users and community-aware approaches. To the best of our knowledge, TwiBot-20 is the largest Twitter bot detection benchmark to date. We reproduce competitive bot detection methods and conduct a thorough evaluation on TwiBot-20 and two other public datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that existing bot detection measures fail to match their previously claimed performance on TwiBot-20, which suggests that Twitter bot detection remains a challenging task and requires further research efforts.","Feng, Shangbin; Wan, Herun; Wang, Ningnan; Li, Jundong; Luo, Minnan",,445,16

This fact became especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. One type of the potential antiviral agents are interferons, which have already proved to be effective for the treatment of diseases caused by viruses. This article discusses the possibility of using recombinant human interferon lambda-1 and its pegylated form for the treatment of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Experiments on a Vero E6 cell culture showed that a pharmaceutical substance based on recombinant human interferon lambda-1 immobilized on PEG 1500 by electron-beam pegylation exhibited significant antiviral activity with high therapeutic index against SARS-CoV-2 and produced low cytotoxic effect on Vero E6 cells. It is concluded that this substance can be used to create a drug for the treatment of viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Madonov, P. G.; Svyatchenko, V. A.; Legostaev, S. S.; Kikhtenko, N.

Our results show that resilience is the strongest predictor for reducing the chef's perception of stress. In contrast, financial restrictions due to unemployment or short-time work compensation do not increase the perception of stress. Additionally, self-employment status increases the stress perception. Meanwhile, the assessment of the governmental economic support as insufficient also has a high impact on the stress perception.","Wilkesmann, U.; Wilkesmann, M.",International Journal of Hospitality Management,445,16

However, towards the end of 2020, a remarkable exponential growth was observed and the TETRIS strategy was lost. Here, we aimed to understand the factors that fueled SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics during the first epidemic wave in the country. We recovered 84 whole viral genomes from patients diagnosed between November, 2020 and February, 2021 in Rocha, a sentinel eastern Uruguayan department bordering Brazil. The lineage B.1.1.28 was the most prevalent in Rocha during November-December 2020, P.2 became the dominant one during January-February 2021, while the first P.1 sequences corresponds to February, 2021. The lineage replacement process agrees with that observed in several Brazilian states, including Rio Grande do Sul (RS). We observed a one to three month delay between the appearance of P.2 and P.1 in RS and their subsequent detection in Rocha. The phylogenetic analysis detected two B.1.1.28 and one P.2 main Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 clades, introduced from the southern and southeastern Brazilian regions into Rocha between early November and mid December, 2020. One synonymous mutation distinguishes the sequences of the main B.1.1.28 clade in Rocha from those widely distributed in RS. The minor B.1.1.28 cluster, distinguished by several mutations, harbours non-synonymous changes in the Spike protein: Q675H and Q677H, so far not concurrently reported. The convergent appearance of S:Q677H in different viral lineages and its proximity to the S1/S2 cleavage site raise concerns about its functional relevance. The observed S:E484K-VOI P.2 partial replacement of previously circulating lineages in Rocha might have increased transmissibility as suggested by the significant decrease in Ct values. Our study emphasizes the impact of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Uruguay and the need of reinforcing real-time genomic surveillance on specific Uruguayan border locations, as one of the key elements for achieving long-term COVID-19 epidemic control.","Rego, N.; Fernandez-Calero, T.; Arantes, I.; Noya, V.; mir, d.; Brandes, M.; Zanetti, J.; Arleo, M.; Pereira, E.; Possi, T.; Chappos, O.; Bilbao, L.; Reyes, N.; Duquia, M.; Victoria, M.; Techera, P.; Benitez-Galeano, M.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical data of the children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 26 to March 5, 2020. The children were divided into an asymptomatic group with 41 children and a symptomatic group with 73 children. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the effect of different antiviral regimens (monotherapy, double therapy, or triple therapy) and whether interferon α-1b was used in combination with azithromycin on the length of hospital stay and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS: A total of 114 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (72 boys and 42 girls) were enrolled. The median age of the children was 7.1 years. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 6 days.

A variety of shuttling and nonshuttling nuclear proteins, using multiple nuclear import pathways, accumulated in the cytoplasm of cells infected with rhinovirus. An in vitro nuclear import assay with semipermeabilized infected cells confirmed that nuclear import was inhibited and that docking of nuclear import receptor-cargo complexes at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC was prevented in rhinovirus-infected cells. The relocation of cellular proteins and inhibition of nuclear import correlated with the degradation of two NPC components, Nup153 and p62. The degradation of Nup153 and p62 was not due to induction of apoptosis, because p62 was not proteolyzed in apoptotic HeLa cells, and Nup153 was cleaved to produce a 130-kDa cleavage product that was not observed in cells infected with poliovirus or rhinovirus. The finding that both poliovirus and rhinovirus cause inhibition of nuclear import and degradation of NPC components suggests that this may be a common feature of the replicative cycle of picornaviruses. Inhibition of nuclear import is predicted to result in the cytoplasmic accumulation of a large number of nuclear proteins that could have functions in viral translation, RNA synthesis, packaging, or assembly. Additionally, inhibition of nuclear import also presents a novel strategy whereby cytoplasmic RNA viruses can evade host immune defenses by preventing signal transduction into the nucleus.","Gustin, Kurt E; Sarnow, Peter",Journal of virology,445,15

Retrospective single cohort study on patients with suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and asymptomatic Healthcare Workers, enrolled from March to April 2020. Subjects had quantitative PCR (qPCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 via nasal swab and serological testing using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay. Some subjects underwent chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) after rapid test. The aim of the study was to analyse the proportion of those who developed a positive IgM/IgG response for SARS-CoV-2. The correspondence between the results from rapid testing and CLIA, when available, was evaluated. 97 subjects underwent qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 through nasal swab, which resulted positive in 40/43 (93.0%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of asymptomatic HCW, in no subjects with suspected COVID-19 (clinical and radiological findings) then excluded by repeated nasal swabs and alternative diagnosis (COVID-19-negative patients, CNPs), and in 6/6 (100%) of patients with confirmed diagnosis and negative follow-up nasal swabs (COVID-19-recovered patients, CRPs). IgM resulted positive in 8/43 (18.6%) of symptomatic patients and in 1/6 (16.7%) of CRPs. IgG resulted positive in 36/43 (83.7%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of HCW, and in 1/8 (12.5%) and 6/6 (100%) of CNPs and CRPs, respectively. A comparison between an IgG/IgM Rapid Test and a following CLIA test showed consistency in negative results in 25/28 of HCW and 8/8 of CNPs tested. Our preliminary data support the role of IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay as a point-of-care test that may complement molecular tests in the screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers.

Subsequently, experiments were undertaken to assess diagnostic criteria such as specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility. The detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR assays was 10 RNA copies per reaction mixture. No cross-reactivity was observed between RNA samples derived from designed HCoV and other HCoV or human metapneumovirus. A total of 158 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from adult patients with acute respiratory tract infection in Beijing were screened for the presence of human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1 by using real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR method. The fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR method detected six specimens positive for human coronavirus NL63, five specimens positive for human coronavirus HKU1; and conventional RT-PCR method detected three HCoV-NL63 positive and three HCoV-HKU1 positive, respectively. The convention RT-PCR products of positive samples were obtained and sequence analysis confirmed the reliability of the above methods. In summary, the real-time RT-PCR assay for HCoV- NL63 or HKU1 was more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and with less time (less than 4 hours) for completion.

This susceptibility is particularly evident for novel infectious agents such as in severe acute respiratory syndrome but is also all too apparent for common pathogens such as influenza. Many years ago, it was noted that the elderly possessed oligoclonal expansions of T cells, especially of CD8(+) cells. At the same time, it was established that cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity was associated with many of the same phenotypic and functional alterations to T-cell immunity that were being reported as biomarkers associated with aging. It was discovered that CMV was the prime driving force behind most of the oligoclonal expansions and altered phenotypes and functions of CD8 cells. Independently, longitudinal studies of a free-living population of the very old in Sweden over the past decade have led to the emerging concept of an 'immune risk phenotype' (IRP), predicting mortality, which was itself found to be associated with CMV seropositivity. These findings support our hypothesis that the manner in which CMV and the host immune system interact is critical in determining the IRP and hence is predictive of mortality.

The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management. RECENT FINDINGS All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens. SUMMARY The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.","Talwar, Arunabh; Lee, Hans; Fein, Alan",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,445,20

Although Centers for Disease Control has reported 1,551,095 cases in the United States as of May 21, 2020, asymptomatic infection rates remain unknown within the U.S., especially in geographically disparate regions. Methods On April 7, 2020 our hospital established universal SARS-CoV-2 screening using RT-PCR RNA detection from nasopharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic patients prior to essential and elective surgeries. This study included 1,997 asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical procedures and 1,797 admitted for medical management at a Midwestern academic hospital between April 7, 2020 and May 21, 2020. Results As of May 21, asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection had been completed for 1,997 surgical patients and 1,797 non-surgical patients. Initial testing was positive in 26 patients, with an additional four positive tests occurring during repeat testing when greater than 48 hours had elapsed since initial testing. Overall asymptomatic infection rate was 0.79%. Asymptomatic infection rate was significantly lower in surgical patients (0.35% vs. 1.28%, p=0.001). Surgical patients tended to be older than non-surgical patients, although this was not statistically significant (51, IQR 27-65 vsx 46, IQR 28-64, p=0.057). Orthopedic surgery patients were significantly younger than those from other surgical services (42 vs. 53 yrs, p<0.001), however orthopedic and non-orthopedic surgical patients had similar asymptomatic infection rates (0.70% vs. 0.25%, p=0.173). Conclusion Among asymptomatic patients tested at a Midwestern academic medical center, 0.79% were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings will help guide screening protocols at medical centers while providing essential and elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the asymptomatic infection rate was low, this data substantiates the threat of asymptomatic infections and potential for community viral spread. These results may not be generalizable to large urban population centers or areas with high concentrations of COVID-19, each region must use available data to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of universal testing vs universal contact precautions.Level of Evidence: IV.","Hendrickson, Nathan R; Kesler, Kyle; DeMik, David E; Glass, Natalie A; Watson, Matthew K; Ford, Bradley A; Salinas, Jorge L; Pugely, Andrew J",The Iowa orthopaedic journal,445,10

Encompassing the upstream end of the 3' UTR are a bulged stem-loop and an overlapping RNA pseudoknot, both of which are essential to MHV and common to all group 2 coronaviruses. At the downstream end of the genome is the minimal signal for initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis. Between these two ends is a hypervariable region (HVR) that is only poorly conserved between MHV and other group 2 coronaviruses. Paradoxically, buried within the HVR is an octanucleotide motif (oct), 5'-GGAAGAGC-3', which is almost universally conserved in coronaviruses and is therefore assumed to have a critical biological function. We conducted an extensive mutational analysis of the HVR. Surprisingly, this region tolerated numerous deletions, rearrangements, and point mutations. Most striking, a mutant deleted of the entire HVR was only minimally impaired in tissue culture relative to the wild type. By contrast, the HVR deletion mutant was highly attenuated in mice, causing no signs of clinical disease and minimal weight loss compared to wild-type virus. Correspondingly, replication of the HVR deletion mutant in the brains of mice was greatly reduced compared to that of the wild type. Our results show that neither the HVR nor oct is essential for the basic mechanism of MHV RNA synthesis in tissue culture. However, the HVR appears to play a significant role in viral pathogenesis.","Goebel, Scott J; Miller, Timothy B; Bennett, Corey J; Bernard, Kristen A; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,445,3

Human cells lack this receptor and are therefore not susceptible to MHV. Specific alleviation of the tropism barrier by redirecting MHV to a tumor-specific receptor could lead to a virus with appealing properties for tumor therapy. To demonstrate that MHV can be retargeted to a nonnative receptor on human cells, we produced bispecific adapter proteins composed of the N-terminal D1 domain of mCEACAM1a linked to a short targeting peptide, the six-amino-acid His tag. Preincubation of MHV with the adapter proteins and subsequent inoculation of human cells expressing an artificial His receptor resulted in infection of these otherwise nonsusceptible cells and led to subsequent production of progeny virus. To generate a self-targeted virus able to establish multiround infection of the target cells, we subsequently incorporated the gene encoding the bispecific adapter protein as an additional expression cassette into the MHV genome through targeted RNA recombination. When inoculated onto murine LR7 cells, the resulting recombinant virus indeed expressed the adapter protein. Furthermore, inoculation of human target cells with the virus resulted in a His receptor-specific infection that was multiround. Extensive cell-cell fusion and rapid cell killing of infected target cells was observed. Our results show that MHV can be genetically redirected via adapters composed of the S protein binding part of mCEACAM1a and a targeting peptide recognizing a nonnative receptor expressed on human cells, consequently leading to rapid cell death. The results provide interesting leads for further investigations of the use of coronaviruses as antitumor agents.","Verheije, M H; Würdinger, T; van Beusechem, V W; de Haan, C A M; Gerritsen, W R; Rottier, P J M",Journal of virology,445,26

Our purpose was to asses the virological and clinical features of children with respiratory infections caused by hMPV. We examined 658 nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 637 children with respiratory infections for hMPV by using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 268 samples from 637 children were inoculated onto tertiary monkey kidney cells. A total of 36 serum samples (26 in the acute phase and 10 in the convalescent phase) from the 26 hMPV-positive children were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to hMPV by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. We detected hMPV in 57 (8.9%) of the 637 samples by using RT-PCR and isolated 7 (2.6%) hMPV strains of the 268 samples in cell cultures. A total of 12 (46.2%) of 26 hMPV-positive children were suspected to have primary infection with hMPV as determined by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The infected children were diagnosed as having wheezy bronchitis (36.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (26.3%), bronchitis (22.8%), and pneumonia (14.0%). We showed that two hMPV groups were circulating in different regions during the same period and that reinfection with hMPV frequently occurs in childhood. The RT-PCR test is the most sensitive test for detection of hMPV, and a serological test may be useful to differentiate between primary infection and reinfection with hMPV.","Ebihara, Takashi; Endo, Rika; Kikuta, Hideaki; Ishiguro, Nobuhisa; Ishiko, Hiroaki; Hara, Michimaru; Takahashi, Yutaka; Kobayashi, Kunihiko",Journal of clinical microbiology,445,24

METHODS Influenza virus-infected chorion cells were incubated in the absence or presence of inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, SB203580 and SB202190. TNF-alpha mRNA and hemagglutinin viral RNA (HA vRNA) were amplified with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques. TNF-alpha protein concentrations were determined by enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay. The extent of apoptosis induction was estimated by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and ribavirin, which have been shown to inhibit apoptosis induction via the inhibition of viral gene replication, were used as positive control reagents. RESULTS PDTC and ribavirin inhibited the accumulation of TNF-alpha mRNA and HA vRNA in the virus-infected chorion cells, resulting in the suppression of TNF-alpha protein secretion. Both SB203580 and SB202190 suppressed TNF-alpha protein secretion, but not the accumulation of TNF-alpha mRNA as well as HA vRNA and the induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that p38 MAP kinase pathway is critical in TNF-alpha gene expression at a post-transcriptional level but not in the apoptosis induction and influenza virus replication in cultured chorion cells.","Uchide, Noboru; Ohyama, Kunio; Bessho, Toshio; Toyoda, Hiroo",Intervirology,445,17

The piglets were given colostrum three times a day at 4 hr intervals. Half of the piglets fed HCC showed diarrhea and recovered, and all piglets survived. In contrast, all piglets fed UCC developed diarrhea and three of them died. In experiment 2, 2-day-old piglets fed HCC containing antibody titers of 1:512, 1:128 and 1:32, and UCC were inoculated with PED virus, and survival rates after challenge were 100, 75, 50 and 0 %, respectively.

Of these viruses, HHV-6 is among the most successful human parasites, establishing lifelong infections in nearly 100% of individuals around the world. To better understand this host-pathogen relationship, we determined whether HHV-6 could interfere with the development of the innate antiviral response by affecting interferon (IFN) biosynthesis. Using inducible cell lines and transient transfection assays, we have identified the immediate-early 1 (IE1) protein as a potent inhibitor of IFN-beta gene expression. IE1 proteins from both HHV-6 variants were capable of suppressing IFN-beta gene induction. IE1 prevents IFN-beta gene expression triggered by Sendai virus infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsDNA transfection, or the ectopic expression of IFN-beta gene activators such as retinoic inducible gene I protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, TBK-1, IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon), and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). While the stability of IFN-beta mRNA is not affected, IE1-expressing cells have reduced levels of dimerized IRF3 and nucleus-translocated IRF3 in response to activation by TBK-1 or IKKepsilon. Using nuclear extracts and gel shift experiments, we could demonstrate that in the presence of IE1, IRF3 does not bind efficiently to the IFN-beta promoter sequence. Overall, these results indicate that the IE1 protein of HHV-6, one of the first viral proteins synthesized upon viral entry, is a potent suppressor of IFN-beta gene induction and likely contributes to favor the establishment of and successful infection of cells with this virus.","Jaworska, Joanna; Gravel, Annie; Fink, Karin; Grandvaux, Nathalie; Flamand, Louis",Journal of virology,445,29

METHODOLOGY This was a retrospective chart review of patients who were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus by Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Data extracted from patients' case files included patient demographics, presenting symptoms, provisional diagnoses, and outcomes of hospitalisation. Descriptive variables were summarized; proportions were compared using Chi-square tests, and independent predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate regression analysis. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS There were a total of 61 patients with positive RT-PCR testing: mean age ± SD (minimum - maximum) was 53.0 ± 18.5 (5 months - 90) years. Persons aged 60 years and above were the largest group (n=24, 39.3%). More than half were male (n=35, 57.4%); about 43% had one morbidity; 41.0% had at least two co-morbidities. The mean (SD) arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 86.9% ± 16.7. Patients who were clinically dyspnoeic at presentation, and who had co-morbidities were significantly more hypoxaemic (p = 0.026 and 0.04, respectively). Significantly more patients who had normal oxygen saturation at presentation survived (p = 0.006). None of these variables was an independent predictor of mortality, however. CONCLUSION Arterial hypoxaemia was significantly associated with dyspnoea and underlying disease, and normal oxygen saturation at presentation was significantly associated with survival. Hospital managers and clinicians may thus prioritize routine pulse oximetry, supplemental oxygen therapy and management of co-morbidities in the COVID-19 fight.","Ayinbuomwan, S A; Mokogwu, N; Akoria, O A; Okwara, B U; Omuemu, C E; Obaseki, D E",West African journal of medicine,445,26

In this study, we explored the patterns of COVID-19 cases in the US from 1 March to 12 December 2020. The county-level cases and rates of the disease were mapped using a geographic information system (GIS). The overall trend of the disease in the US, as well as in each of its 50 individual states, were analyzed by the seasonal-trend decomposition. The disease curve in each state was further examined using K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that three clusters were observed in the early phase (1 March-31 May). New York has a unique pattern of the disease curve and was assigned one cluster alone. Two clusters were observed in the middle phase (1 June-30 September). California, Texas and Florida were assigned in the same cluster, which has the pattern different from the remaining states. In the late phase (1 October-12 December), California has a unique pattern of the disease curve and was assigned a cluster alone. In the whole period, three clusters were observed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR were retrospectively analysed. Clinical data, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and imaging features were recorded. Lung features included ground-glass opacities (GGO), areas of consolidation and crazy paving patterns. The COVID19-LDCT score was calculated by summing the score of each segment from 0 (no involvement) to 10 (severe impairment). Univariate analysis was performed to explore predictive factor of high COVID19-LDCT score. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare groups and a Spearman correlation used with p<0.05 for significance. RESULTS: Eighty patients with positive RT-PCR were analysed. The mean age was 55 years ± 16, with 42 males (53%). The most frequent symptoms were fever (60/80, 75%) and cough (59/80, 74%), the mean NEWS was 1.7±2.3. All LDCT could be analysed and 23/80 (28%) were normal. The major imaging finding was GGOs in 56 cases (67%). The COVID19-LDCT score (mean value = 19±29) was correlated with NEWS (r = 0.48, p<0.0001). No symptoms were risk factor to have pulmonary involvement. Univariate analysis shown that dyspnea, high respiratory rate, hypertension and diabetes are associated to a COVID19-LDCT score superior to 50. CONCLUSIONS: COVID19-LDCT score did correlate with NEWS. It was significantly different in the clinical low-risk and high-risk groups.

This electret layer is essential to efficient filtration of difficult-to-capture small particles, yet the exact nature of electrostatic capture with respect to both the charge on the particles and the electret fibres as well as the effect of immediate environment remains unclear. Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interaction between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation. The results of our work elucidate the details of virus electrostatics and contribute to the general understanding of efficient virus filtration mechanisms.","Javidpour, Leili; Bozic, Anze; Naji, Ali; Podgornik, Rudolf",,445,25

A good correlation was observed between the spread and decay durations (R2=0.37). However, some exceptions were observed in prefectures that are adjacent to primary prefectures (e.g., Tokyo, Osaka, Aichi, and Fukuoka) and in areas where people returned from foreign countries, which were defined origins of cluster infections. Excluding these prefectures, population density is shown to be the primary factor affecting spread and decay patterns, with correlations of 0.52 and 0.76, respectively. The absolute humidity also affected the spread duration (R2=0.40).

A recent strategy to achieve this goal is formation of stable co-amorphous solid dispersions with co-formers of low molecular weight. Here, the amorphization strategy was applied for low-soluble anti-hypertensive valsartan (VAL), an angiotensin II receptor blocker, and nicotinamide, which exhibits lung- and cardio-protective effects. Through interactions with the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, VAL may be used to treat both hypertension and the current pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using mechanochemical and liquid- and solid-state approaches, solvated co-amorphous solid dispersions of VAL with nicotinamide were obtained. They were characterized by spectroscopic, thermal, and X-ray analyses. The density functional theory, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, and non-covalent interaction index calculations revealed the presence of two types of hydrogen bonds between VAL and NIC (i.e., N-H···O and O-H···O). One of them had a partially covalent character, which caused conformational changes in the flexible VAL molecule, restricting contribution of the tetrazolyl N-H donor and thus limiting the possibility of co-crystal formation. The recognized VAL/NIC1- and VAL/NIC2-type heterodimeric interactions were responsible for the excellent durability of the solid compositions and up to 24-fold better solubility than VAL alone. The synthesized dispersions constitute a new class of dually acting drugs, containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient (VAL) and supporting nutraceutical (nicotinamide).","Turek, Marika; Rózycka-Sokolowska, Ewa; Koprowski, Marek; Marciniak, Bernard; Balczewski, Piotr",Mol Pharm,445,16

However, social isolation measures have deeply changed their lifestyle, which is believed to have a psychological impact on them. The objective was to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the emotional health of children and adolescents attending primary or secondary school. POPULATION AND METHODS: Parents of children and adolescents from San Carlos de Bariloche participated in the study. Adults' perception of the emotional and behavioral impact of lockdown on children and adolescents, changes in sleeping habits, screen use, sports-related activities, eating, and medical consultations, was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 267 parents were included. Of them, 96.3 % noticed emotional and behavioral changes. The most common ones were that their children were more bored (76.8 %), more irritable (59.2 %), more reluctant (56.9 %), and angrier (54.7 %). It was observed that they woke up and went to bed later, and slept 30 minutes more. Moreover, leisure screen use increased by 3 hours on weekdays. Time dedicated to physical activities did not change, but the type of activities did: swimming and team sports were replaced by biking, walking, and skiing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown affected the emotional health and habits of children and adolescents. Boredom, irritability, and reluctance were more present during lockdown. The possibility of doing outdoor physical activities allowed them to keep practicing sports.","Schnaiderman, Diego; Bailac, Mariana; Borak, Laura; Comar, Haydeé; Eisner, Ana; Ferrari, Alejandra; Giannini, Gabriela; Risso, Fernando; Vetere, Carolina; Garibotti, Gilda",Arch Argent Pediatr,445,20

The objective of this study was to assess the changes in lecture methods and lab materials used in anatomy courses that ran between May-August (T1) and August-December (T2) 2020 responding to Covid-19 restrictions. Materials/Methods A survey was distributed to anatomy educators through professional associations from June-November 2020. Respondents indicated (1) their institution;(2) programs taught (professional health (PH), medicine (MED), or undergraduate (UG));(3) course type (integrated or stand-alone);(4) percentage of lab time before and during Covid-19 that utilized cadaveric, plastic, and/or other teaching materials;and (5) lecture format. Institutions were classified as public or private via institution websites. Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction compared responses before and during Covid-19 across programs, course type, and institution. Data are presented as percent increase (+value) or decrease (-value). Alpha&lt;5%. Results T1 and T2 received 67 and 191 responses, respectively. During T1 and T2, cadaver use decreased in PH (-58% stand-alone (-58% and private (-49% P=0.033). During T1 and T2, use of other teaching materials increased in PH (+1180% stand-alone (+920% and private (+1233% & +667%, P&lt;0.001) and public (+415% & +400%, P&lt;0.001) institutions. For T1 and T2, in-person lecture decreased (-89% & -72%, P≤0.001), while remote lecture increased (+509% & +533%, P≤0.001) during Covid-19. Conclusion Reduction in cadaver use and in-person lecture were most pronounced in T1, but remained diminished through both time points, suggesting a shift from the initial pandemic response to teaching to more complex hybrid programs as regulations permitted. Significance/Implication This study provides evidence to better understand how anatomy educators adapted their gross anatomy teaching due to Covid-19 across programs. In addition, this study provides first of its kind insight into how anatomy was taught across programs prior to Covid-19. Future studies need to determine whether the findings characterized here were pandemic-based or if they represent long-term changes for anatomy education.","Harmon, Derek Attardi Stefanie Barremkala Malli Bentley Danielle Brown Kirsten Dennis Jennifer Goldman Haviva Harrell Kelly Klein Barbie Ramnanan Christopher Richtsmeier Joan Farkas Gary",The FASEB Journal,445,9

Demographic data, medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT), treatment details, and clinical outcomes were extracted from medical records. Results: 1487 COVID-19 inpatients were included in this study, of whom 1252 were discharged and 235 were deceased in hospital. 61% of 235 deceased patients had hypertension, as opposed to 38% of the patients who were discharged (RR=2.18, P&lt;0.05). The relative risk was highest for patients above 70 years, in males, in smokers, and in those with family history of hypertension. Higher risk was noticed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension as compared to those whose BP were under control. A similar relationship for hypertension was detected with admission to ICU (RR=3.27, P&lt;0.01). Conclusions: Hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity, but also a risk factor affecting the severity of COVID-19 and adverse outcomes. Therefore, hypertension management in COVID-19 patients is an important aspect in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","Ambily, K.; Nair, T. S.",Journal of Hypertension,445,1

Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of BRII-196 and BRII-198 were investigated in healthy adults. MethodsSingle ascending doses of BRII-196 and BRII-198 were evaluated in parallel in the first-in-human, placebo-controlled phase 1 studies. A total of 32 healthy adults were randomized and received a single intravenous infusion of 750, 1500, and 3000 mg of BRII-196 (n=12), BRII-198 (n=12), or placebo (n=8) and were followed for 180 days. ResultsAll infusions were well tolerated at infusion rates between 0.5 mL/min to 4 mL/min with no dose-limiting adverse events, deaths, serious adverse events, or any systemic or local infusion reactions. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were isolated asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities of Grade 1-2 in severity. Each mAb displayed pharmacokinetics expected of Fc-engineered human IgG1 with mean terminal half-lives of approximately 46 days and 76 days, respectively, with no evidence of significant anti-drug antibody development. ConclusionsBRII-196 and BRII-198 were well-tolerated.

Strategies that combine NPIs with innovative SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies may increase containment efficacy and help to shorten quarantine durations. We developed a user-friendly software-tool that implements a recently published stochastic within-host viral dynamics model that captures temporal attributes of the viral infection, such as test sensitivity, infectiousness and the occurrence of symptoms. Based on this model, the software allows to evaluate the efficacy of user-defined, arbitrary NPI and testing strategies in reducing the transmission potential in different contexts. The software thus enables decision makers to explore NPI strategies and perform hypothesis testing, e.g. with regards to the utilization of novel diagnostics or with regards to containing novel virus variants.","van der Toorn, Wiep; Oh, Djin-Ye; von Kleist, Max",Patterns (N Y),445,24

Here, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence on serial interval distributions and delays in case isolation for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints in PubMed on two epidemiological parameters namely serial intervals and delay intervals relating to isolation of cases for COVID-19 until 22 October, 2020 following predefined eligibility criteria. We assessed the variation in these parameter estimates by correlation and regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 103 unique studies identified on serial intervals of COVID-19, 56 were included providing 129 estimates and of 451 unique studies on isolation delays, 18 studies were included providing 74 estimates. Serial interval estimates varied from 1.0 to 9.9 days, while case isolation delays varied from 1.0 to 12.5 days which were associated with spatial, methodological and temporal factors. In mainland China, the pooled mean serial interval was 6.2 (range, 5.1-7.8) days before the epidemic peak and reduced to 4.9 (range, 1.9-6.5) days after the epidemic peak. Similarly, the pooled mean isolation delay related intervals were 6.0 (range, 2.9-12.5) days and 2.4 (range, 2.0-2.7) days before and after the epidemic peak, respectively. There was a positive association between serial interval and case isolation delay. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal factors, such as different control measures and case isolation in particular led to shorter serial interval estimates over time. Correcting transmissibility estimates for these time-varying distributions could aid mitigation efforts.","Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Yeung, Amy; Shan, Songwei; Wang, Lin; Gao, Huizhi; Du, Zhanwei; Xu, Xiao-Ke; Wu, Peng; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",Clin. infect. dis,445,1

However, evidence on the safety and efficacy of these therapies is limited. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three-group, controlled trial involving hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 who were receiving either no supplemental oxygen or a maximum of 4 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive standard care, standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily, or standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily plus azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg once daily for 7 days. The primary outcome was clinical status at 15 days as assessed with the use of a seven-level ordinal scale (with levels ranging from one to seven and higher scores indicating a worse condition) in the modified intention-to-treat population (patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19). Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 667 patients underwent randomization; 504 patients had confirmed Covid-19 and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. As compared with standard care, the proportional odds of having a higher score on the seven-point ordinal scale at 15 days was not affected by either hydroxychloroquine alone (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 2.11; P = 1.00) or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.73; P = 1.00). Prolongation of the corrected QT interval and elevation of liver-enzyme levels were more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, than in those who were not receiving either agent. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care.

As viral disease emergence is expected to accelerate, these data dictate a need for proactive approaches to develop broadly active family-specific and cross-family therapeutics for use in future disease outbreaks. Emphasis should focus not only on the development of broad-spectrum small-molecule and antibody direct-acting antivirals, but also on host-factor therapeutics, including repurposing previously approved or in-pipeline drugs. Another new class of therapeutics with great antiviral therapeutic potential is RNA-based therapeutics. Rather than only focusing on known risks, dedicated efforts must be made toward pre-emptive research focused on outbreak-prone virus families, ultimately offering a strategy to shorten the gap between outbreak and response. Emphasis should also focus on orally available drugs for outpatient use, if possible, and on identifying combination therapies that combat viral and immune-mediated pathologies, extend the effectiveness of therapeutic windows and reduce drug resistance. While such an undertaking will require new vision, dedicated funding and private, federal and academic partnerships, this approach offers hope that global populations need never experience future pandemics such as COVID-19.","Meganck, Rita M; Baric, Ralph S",Nat Med,445,20

Maintaining blood supply during the COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge. We conducted a cross-sectional study by an online survey to analyse the variation of practices across blood centers of India during this pandemic. A total of 196 blood centers completely responded to the online survey. Most of the blood centres who responded were part of Government hospitals (60 %), part of an academic institutes (55.6 %) and were directly supporting a COVID hospital (67.5 %). Almost 95.4 % blood centers reported reduction of blood donation mainly due to lockdown (50 %) and inability to conduct camps (17.3 %). Scheduling blood donations was one of the most difficult to implement strategy for maintaining adequate blood donation (40.2 %). Blood center manpower management was also a challenge and upto 48 % blood centers operated in two batches to ensure social distancing in blood banks and reduce the risk of exposure.

Detection of viral genomic materials by RT-PCR is the gold standard for diagnosis. Suspected COVID-19 patients who had a documented history of exposure and exhibited symptoms, but did not have positive PCR test results, were generally self-quarantined with prescriptions aiming to help attenuate their symptoms. These prescriptions are however neither specific nor highly effective for COVID-19 treatment. Given the rapidly growing pandemic and the overwhelmed medical system, the number of self-quarantined patients is increasing. There is an urgent need of alternative medicine to help patients relieve symptoms during self-quarantine, and to potentially help increase their chances of survival and recovery from the infection. We report here a case of severe COVID-19 that never had a positive PCR test result during disease progression but was confirmed with antibody test post recovery. This patient was self-quarantined and received diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), a steroid-like molecule, in combination with vitamin C as alternative medicine. This patient went through severe COVID-19 but eventually recovered upon the implementation of this treatment regimen, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of DG as alternative medicine to help relieve COVID-19 symptoms.","Ding, Hong; Deng, Wenjun; Ding, Lingling; Ye, Xiaoqun; Yin, Shanye; Huang, Weishan",J. med. virol,445,1

However, whether these trends reflect a reduction in ACS incidence or a decrease in emergency room visits is unknown. Using Google Trends, queries for chest pain that have previously been shown to closely correlate with coronary heart disease were compared with searches for myocardial infarction and COVID-19 symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluates if search terms (or topics) pertaining to chest pain symptoms correlate with the reported decrease in presentations of ACS. METHODS: Google Trends data for search terms ""chest pain,"" ""myocardial infarction,"" ""cough,"" and ""fever"" were obtained from June 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Related queries were evaluated for a relationship to coronary heart disease. RESULTS: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, chest pain searches increased in all countries studied by at least 34% (USA P=.003, Spain P=.007, UK P=.001, Italy P=.002), while searches for myocardial infarction dropped or remained unchanged. Rising searches for chest pain included ""coronavirus chest pain,"" ""home remedies for chest pain,"" and ""natural remedies for chest pain."" Searches on COVID-19 symptoms (eg, cough, fever) rose initially but returned to baseline while chest pain-related searches remained elevated throughout May. CONCLUSIONS: Search engine queries for chest pain have risen during the pandemic as have related searches with alternative attribution for chest pain or home care for chest pain, suggesting that recent drops in ACS presentations may be due to patients avoiding the emergency room and potential treatment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Senecal, Conor; Gulati, Rajiv; Lerman, Amir",JMIR Cardio,445,16

This survey was undertaken to explore inhaled ICU sedation practice in France. METHODS: In this national survey, medical directors of French adult ICUs were contacted by phone or email between July and August 2019. ICU medical directors were questioned about the characteristics of their department, their knowledge on inhaled sedation, and practical aspects of inhaled sedation use in their department. RESULTS: Among the 374 ICUs contacted, 187 provided responses (50%). Most ICU directors (73%) knew about the use of inhaled ICU sedation and 21% used inhaled sedation in their unit, mostly with the Anaesthetic Conserving Device (AnaConDa, Sedana Medical). Most respondents had used volatile agents for sedation for <5 years (63%) and in <20 patients per year (75%), with their main indications being: failure of intravenous sedation, severe asthma or bronchial obstruction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sevoflurane and isoflurane were mainly used (88% and 20%, respectively). The main reasons for not using inhaled ICU sedation were: ""device not available"" (40%), ""lack of medical interest"" (37%), ""lack of familiarity or knowledge about the technique"" (35%) and ""elevated cost"" (21%). Most respondents (80%) were overall satisfied with the use of inhaled sedation. Almost 75% stated that inhaled sedation was a seducing alternative to intravenous sedation. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the widespread knowledge about inhaled ICU sedation in France but shows its limited use to date. Differences in education and knowledge, as well as the recent and relatively scarce literature on the use of volatile agents in the ICU, might explain the diverse practices that were observed. The low rate of mild adverse effects, as perceived by respondents, and the users' satisfaction, are promising for this potentially important tool for ICU sedation.","Blondonnet, Raiko; Quinson, Audrey; Lambert, Céline; Audard, Jules; Godet, Thomas; Zhai, Ruoyang; Pereira, Bruno; Futier, Emmanuel; Bazin, Jean-Etienne; Constantin, Jean-Michel; Jabaudon, Matthieu",PLoS One,445,1

Transcriptome analysis of HEK 293T cells treated with wild and mutant APC revealed differentially expressed genes enriched in inflammatory, apoptotic, and virus defense-related signaling pathways. Both wild and mutant APC displayed concentration-dependent cytoprotective effects. Low concentrations of K150del mutant resulted in decreased anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, whereas its higher concentrations restored these effects. Expression of virus defense-related genes improved in mouse lung tissues after repeated administration of the APC variant.

Public health measures designed to contain the spread of the disease saw the cessation of international travel as well as the establishment of border closures between and within countries. The social and economic impact was considerable. This paper examines the effects of the public health measures of “ring-fencing” and of prolonged closures of the state border between New South Wales and Victoria (Australia), placing the events of 2020/21 into the context of the historic and contemporary trajectories of the border between the two states. It shows that while border closures as public-health measures had occurred in the past, their social and economic impact had been comparatively negligible due to low cross-border community integration. Concerted efforts since the mid-1970s have led to effective and close integration of employment and services, with over a quarter of the resident population of the two border towns commuting daily across the state lines. As a result, border closures and state-based lockdown directives caused significant social disruption and considerable economic cost to families and the community as a whole. One of the lessons of the 2020/21 pandemic will be to either re-evaluate the wisdom of a close social and economic integration of border communities, which would be a backwards step, or to future-proof these communities by developing strategies, effectively public health management plans, to avoid a repeat when the next pandemic strikes.","Spennemann, Dirk H.

Methods: Altogether 742 discharged COVID-19 patients were analyzed retrospectively and were divided into re-infected patients (n=60) and non-re-infected patients (n=682) according to whether they became nucleic acid positive again after discharge. The time form leaving the hospital to re-infection and the time form the first nucleic acid negative test results to being re-infected were recorded. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared when they were admitted to the hospital. Logistic regression analysis was carried out on disease indicators with statistical differences between the two groups. Results: Compared with non-re-infected patients, there were statistical differences in age, contact history, fatigue, chills, nasal congestion and runny nose, lung CT observations, clinical classification and lymphocyte count of re-infected patients (P&lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that nasal congestion and a runny nose, a lymphocyte count less than 0.93×109 cells/L, and age ≥65 years were the risk factors of being re-infected. The ROC curve showed that the cut-off value of lymphocyte count was 0.847×109 cells/L, and the AUC of predicted re-infection was 0.867. Conclusion: The symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose, lymphocyte count less than 0.93×109 cells/L and, aged more than 65 years are the risk factors for the recurrent positive rates for COVID-19 patients, and lymphocyte count has certain clinical value in predicting recurrent patients. © 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. RESULTS: In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. CONCLUSIONS: We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.","Valdés-Florido, María José; López-Díaz, Álvaro; Palermo-Zeballos, Fernanda Jazmín; Martínez-Molina, Iván; Martín-Gil, Victoria Eugenia; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto; Ruiz-Veguilla, Miguel",Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment,445,17

In this commentary, we argue that ignoring the potential benefits of harm reduction strategies may unintentionally lead to an erosion of trust in tobacco control among some members of the public. Trust in tobacco control as an institution is crucial for the success of tobacco control efforts. To ensure trust, we must return to our basic principles of doing no harm, developing programs that are responsive to people's experiences, and providing resources in assisting people to reduce the harms that may be associated with practices, such as smoking, which adversely affect health. Only by respecting an individual's priorities can we cultivate trust and develop tobacco prevention efforts that are grounded in the realities of people's lives and responsive to their needs.","Antin, Tamar M J; Hunt, Geoffrey; Annechino, Rachelle",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),445,29

Health care workers face significant risk of infection when treating patients with a viral severe acute respiratory infection. To ensure health care worker safety and limit nosocomial transmission of such infection, it is crucial to synthesize the evidence regarding the infection risk associated with different modalities of oxygen therapy used in treating patients with severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 1, 2020, for studies describing the risk of infection associated with the modalities of oxygen therapy used for patients with severe acute respiratory infection. The study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by independent reviewers. The primary outcome measure was the infection of health care workers with a severe acute respiratory infection. Random-effect models were used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 22,123 citations, 50 studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 16 for meta-analysis. Globally, the quality of the included studies provided a very low certainty of evidence. Being exposed or performing an intubation (odds ratio 6.48; 95% confidence interval 2.90 to 14.44), bag-valve-mask ventilation (odds ratio 2.70; 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 5.36), and noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 2.12 to 7.40) were associated with an increased risk of infection. All modalities of oxygen therapy generate air dispersion. CONCLUSION: Most modalities of oxygen therapy are associated with an increased risk of infection and none have been demonstrated as safe. The lowest flow of oxygen should be used to maintain an adequate oxygen saturation for patients with severe acute respiratory infection, and manipulation of oxygen delivery equipment should be minimized.","Cournoyer, Alexis; Grand039,; Maison, Sophie; Lonergan, Ann-Marie; Lessard, Justine; Chauny, Jean-Marc; Castonguay, Véronique; Marquis, Martin; Frégeau, Amélie; Huard, Vérilibe; Garceau-Tremblay, Zoé; Turcotte, Ann-Sophie; Piette, Éric; Paquet, Jean; Cossette, Sylvie; Féral-Pierssens, Anne-Laure; Leblanc, Renaud-Xavier; Martel, Valéry; Daoust, Raoul",Ann. emerg. med,445,33

This study explores factors that promote or support wellbeing for young people during the pandemic, how they differ by age, using a self-reported online survey with those aged 8 - 25 in Wales between September 2020 and February 2021. Open-ended responses were analysed via thematic analysis to provide further context. A total of 6,291 responses were obtained from 81 education settings across Wales (including primary and secondary schools as well as sixth form, colleges and universities). Wellbeing was highest in primary school children and boys and lowest in those who were at secondary school children, who were girls and, those who preferred not to give a gender. Among primary school children, higher wellbeing was seen for those who played with others (rather than alone), were of Asian ethnicity (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.3), lived in a safe area (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.67 to 2.5) and had more sleep. To support their wellbeing young people reported they would like to be able to play with their friends more. Among secondary school children those who were of mixed ethnicity reported lower wellbeing (OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.70 to 15.80). To support their wellbeing they reported they would like more support with mental health (due to anxiety and pressure to achieve when learning online). This study found self-reported wellbeing differed by gender, ethnicity and deprivation and found younger children report the need for play and to see friends to support wellbeing but older children/young people wanted more support with anxiety and educational pressures.","James, Michaela; Jones, Hope; Baig, Amana; Marchant, Emily; Waites, Tegan; Todd, Charlotte; Hughes, Karen; Brophy, Sinead",,445,7

We demonstrate the applicability of the approaches using AdaBoost and random forest algorithms for the task of classifying the regional daily growth factor of the spread of an epidemic based on a variety of explanatory factors. In such an application, some of the potential classification errors could have critical consequences. The classification tool will enable the spread of the epidemic to be tracked and controlled by yielding insights regarding the relationship between local containment measures and the daily growth factor. In order to benefit maximally from a variety of ordinal and non-ordinal algorithms, we also propose an ensemble majority voting approach to combine different algorithms into one model, thereby leveraging the strengths of each algorithm. We perform experiments in which the task is to classify the daily COVID-19 growth rate factor based on environmental factors and containment measures for 19 regions of Italy. We demonstrate that the ordinal algorithms outperform their non-ordinal counterparts with improvements in the range of 6-25% for a variety of common performance indices.

We examined how the pandemic and its social consequences may differentially impact sexual minority adults, relative to heterosexual adults. Methods: Data are from a U.S. national sample of adults (n = 2996;18.06%) collected from online panels from April to May 2020. We used eight indicators of well-being-mental health, physical health, quality of life, stress, loneliness, psychological distress, alcohol use, and fatigue-to assess the degree to which sexual identity subgroups (i.e., heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, and ""other"" sexual minority) varied in retrospective pre- and postpandemic onset indicators of well-being and whether groups varied in their rate of change from pre- and postpandemic onset. Results: The results showed consistent patterns of decline in well-being across sexual identity subgroups, although changes in mental health, physical health, quality of life, stress, and psychological distress were more robust among sexual minority adults in general, relative to heterosexual adults. Adjusted multivariate models testing differences in change in retrospective pre- and postpandemic onset found that well-being among bisexual men and women was most negatively impacted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic may have distinct health consequences for sexual minority adults in the United States. Our findings support and further legitimize calls for more comprehensive surveillance and cultural responsiveness in emergency preparedness as it relates to sexual minority people and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The use of face masks in public may not protect the general public from contracting the virus, however, presumptively decreases the viral load and contributes to a favourable clinical outcome in COVID-19 disease. A certain time is required for antigen-specific T cells and B cells to fully develop. Obligatory face mask wearing in public favours the virus transmission through oral mucosa and/or conjunctival epithelium, which enables the adaptive immune responses to evolve. In the case of inhalation of high loads of SARS-CoV-2, the time for the development of fully protective adaptive immune responses seems to be insufficient.

Trekking, however, may pose a threat of human-to-gorilla disease transmission that could have disastrous effects on wild gorillas. We used 858 photographs posted on Instagram in 2013–2019 to analyse the proximity of tourists visiting mountain gorillas in the wild. We classified photographs of the encounters according to the distance between the closest gorilla and human, the age class of the gorilla, the trekking location and presence of a surgical face mask on the tourist. We ran a generalised linear mixed model to test whether these variables influenced the distance between the human and the wild gorillas in the photographs, and to test whether these distances have changed over time. Most sampled photographs (86%) showed tourists within a critical 4 m of the gorillas, with 25 incidents of physical contact between a tourist and a gorilla, and only 3% at the recommended distance of 7 m or more. We only were able to record face mask use in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where these were present in 65% of uploaded photos. Tourists and immature gorillas tended to get closer to each other than tourists and adult gorillas, and this is more pronounced in female tourists than male tourists. The mean distance between human and wild gorillas decreased by ~1 m between 2013 and 2019. The results indicate that existing rules are not enforced and raise attention to this unsustainable aspect of mountain gorilla trekking as it is practiced today. These ever-growing tourist attractions in the range countries pose risks of disease transmission in both directions between tourists and wildlife. The popularity of photograph-based social media may stimulate closer contacts and influence people into risky behaviours. We advocate the establishment and reinforcement of regulations relating to the distance between animals and tourists in any in situ wildlife ecotourism context, as well as campaigns to raise awareness regarding the risks of anthroponosis, and fines applied in case of non-compliance.

TRIAL DESIGN: Open-label, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness platform trial with response-adaptive randomization PARTICIPANTS: We will evaluate patients who meet the eligibility criteria stipulated by the COVID-19 mAB EUAs who receive mABs within the UPMC Health System, including infusion centers and emergency departments. EUA eligibility criteria include patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, <10 days of symptoms, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (elderly, obese, and/or with specific comorbidities). The EUA criteria exclude patients who require oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 and patients already hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19. We will use data collected for routine clinical care, including data entered into the electronic medical record and from follow-up calls. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The interventions are the COVID-19 specific mABs authorized by the EUAs. All aspects of mAB treatment, including eligibility criteria, dosing, and post-infusion monitoring, are as per the EUAs. As a comparative effectiveness trial, all patients receive mAB treatment, and the interventions are compared against each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mAB interventions will accordingly change. From November 2020 to February 2021, FDA issued EUAs for three mAB treatments (bamlanivimab; bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab), and at trial launch on March 10, 2021 we evaluated all three. Due to a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone, on March 24, 2021 the U.S. Government halted distribution of bamlanivimab alone, and UPMC accordingly halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. On April 16, 2021, FDA revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy. At the time of manuscript submission, we are therefore evaluating the two mAB treatments authorized by EUAs (bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is total hospital free days (HFD) at 28 days after mAB administration, calculated as 28 minus the number of days during the index stay (if applicable - e.g., for patients admitted to hospital after mAB administration in the emergency department) minus the number of days readmitted during the 28 days after treatment. This composite endpoint captures the number of days from the day of mAB administration to the 28 days thereafter, during which the patient is alive and free of hospitalization. Death within 28 days is recorded as -1 HFD, as the worst outcome. RANDOMISATION: We will start with equal allocation. Due to uncertainty in sample size, we will use a Bayesian adaptive design and response adaptive randomization to ensure ability to provide statistical inference despite variable sample size. When mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order, the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. Infusion center operations teams and pharmacists use a mAB assignment application embedded in the electronic medical record to determine the random allocation. BLINDING (MASKING): This trial is open-label. However, outcome assessors conducting follow-up calls at day 28 are blinded to mAB assignment, and investigators are blinded to by-mAB aggregate outcome data until a statistical platform trial conclusion is reached. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Sample size will be determined by case volume throughout the course of the pandemic, supply of FDA authorized mABs, and by that needed to reach a platform trial conclusion of inferiority, superiority, or futility of a given mAB. The trial will continue as long as more than one mAB type is available under EUA, and their comparative effectiveness is uncertain. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol Version 1.0, February 24, 2021. Recruitment began March 10, 2021 and is ongoing at the time of manuscript submission. The estimated recruitment end date is February 22, 2022, though the final end date is dependent on how the pandemic evolves, mAB availability, and when final platform trial conclusions are reached.

Although no study has been done on malnutrition among a general cohort of patients with COVID 19, it has long been associated with increased mortality and poor long-term outcomes. We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition among patients with COVID 19 admitted in a tertiary government hospital. METHODS: Cross-sectional study on COVID 19-confirmed patients admitted to the COVID 19 wards from July 15 to September 15, 2020. Nutritional status was assessed using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (PhilSPEN) modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade (SGA) tool. Malnutrition was defined as those with SGA grades B and C. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test of association, as appropriate, was used to identify factors that have a significant association with malnutrition. Furthermore, logistic regression was done on factors with significant association. RESULTS: Among the 355 adult patients in the study, 71.83% (255/355) were malnourished [SGA B: 67.84% (173/255); SGA C: 32.16% (82/255)]. The following were shown to have significant association with malnutrition: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [p-value < 0.001], hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [p-value 0.002], and chronic kidney disease (p-value 0.033). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that age [OR 1.02, CI 95% 1.00, 1.04, p-value 0.027] and CAP-Moderate Risk (MR) [OR 3.02, CI 95% 1.73, 5.27, p-value < 0.001] are significant predictors of malnutrition. All patients with CAP- High Risk and HAP were malnourished. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition was high (71.83%) in a general cohort of COVID 19 patients as measured by the modified SGA tool. The following are risk factors of malnutrition among patients with COVID 19: age, CAP, and HAP. Nutritional support and management of comorbidities are of paramount importance in the care of patients with COVID 19.","Larrazabal, Ramon B; Perez, Blessie Marie B; Masamayor, Ella Mae I; Chiu, Harold Henrison C; Palileo-Villanueva, Lia Aileen M",Clin Nutr ESPEN,445,24

Treatment options addressing COVID-19 included drug repurposing, investigational therapies such as remdesivir, and vaccine development. Combination therapy based on drug repurposing is among the most widely pursued of these efforts. Multi-drug regimens are traditionally designed by selecting drugs based on their mechanism of action. This is followed by dose-finding to achieve drug synergy. This approach is widely-used for drug development and repurposing. Realizing synergistic combinations, however, is a substantially different outcome compared to globally optimizing combination therapy, which realizes the best possible treatment outcome by a set of candidate therapies and doses toward a disease indication. To address this challenge, the results of Project IDentif.AI (Identifying Infectious Disease Combination Therapy with Artificial Intelligence) are reported. An AI-based platform is used to interrogate a massive 12 drug/dose parameter space, rapidly identifying actionable combination therapies that optimally inhibit A549 lung cell infection by vesicular stomatitis virus within three days of project start. Importantly, a sevenfold difference in efficacy is observed between the top-ranked combination being optimally and sub-optimally dosed, demonstrating the critical importance of ideal drug and dose identification. This platform is disease indication and disease mechanism-agnostic, and potentially applicable to the systematic N-of-1 and population-wide design of highly efficacious and tolerable clinical regimens. This work also discusses key factors ranging from healthcare economics to global health policy that may serve to drive the broader deployment of this platform to address COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Abdulla, Aynur; Wang, Boqian; Qian, Feng; Kee, Theodore; Blasiak, Agata; Ong, Yoong Hun; Hooi, Lissa; Parekh, Falgunee; Soriano, Rafael; Olinger, Gene G; Keppo, Jussi; Hardesty, Chris L; Chow, Edward K; Ho, Dean; Ding, Xianting",Adv Ther (Weinh),445,29

Besides theoretical assumptions, there is no evidence that OSA may favor SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or may lead to a more severe disease. Taking the opportunity of the Atahualpa Project cohort, we aimed to assess the relationship between previously diagnosed OSA and SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults living in rural Ecuador. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in 180 individuals aged > 60 years that underwent polysomnography previously to this novel pandemic. Those with OSA remained untreated due to income limitations. Exposure-effect models were fitted with OSA as the exposure, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology as the outcomes, and confounders - age, gender, obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, individuals per house, home confinement - as independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 87 (48%) individuals were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2, 77% of whom were symptomatic. The mean apnea/hypopnea index was 11.1 ± 11.7 episodes per hour, with 83 (46%) individuals having mild, and 38 (21%) moderate-to-severe OSA. Exposure-effect models demonstrated lack of relationship between OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows no relationship between history of OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or symptomatology, opposing previous suggestions that persons with OSA are more prone to acquire the infection and have a more severe disease.","Del Brutto, Oscar H; Mera, Robertino M; Castillo, Pablo R; Recalde, Bettsy Y; Costa, Aldo F",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,445,16

METHODS: Between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020, 896 pregnant women were admitted to our Institution and tested for COVID-19. We collected information regarding their sociodemographic characteristics. Additional information on geographical area of residence, number of family members, number of family members tested positive for COVID-19, and clinical data was collected for women tested positive for COVID-19. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of developing COVID-19 according to sociodemographic characteristics were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the 896 women enrolled, 50 resulted positive for COVID-19. Pregnant women aged &#8805;35 years had a significantly lower risk of developing the infection (crude OR = 0.29; 95% CI:0.16-0.55). Conversely, foreign women (crude OR = 3.32; 95% CI:1.89-5.81), unemployed women (crude OR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.77-5.40), and women with an unemployed partner (crude OR = 3.16; 95% CI: 1.48-6.79) showed a significantly higher risk of infection. Ethnicity was positively associated with the risk of developing COVID-19 (mutually adjusted OR = 2.15; 95% CI:1.12-4.11) in the multivariate analysis. Foreign women with COVID-19 were more likely to have a lower education level (p < 0.01), to be unemployed (p < 0.01), and to live in larger families (p < 0.01) compared to Italian pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The socioeconomic conditions described are characteristic of immigration patterns in our metropolitan area. These factors may increase the risk of viral transmission, reducing the effectiveness of lockdown and social distancing.","D039,; Ambrosi, Francesco; Iurlaro, Enrico; Tassis, Beatrice; Di Maso, Matteo; Erra, Roberta; Cetera, Giulia E; Cesano, Nicola; Di Martino, Daniela; Ossola, Manuela W; Ferrazzi, Enrico Maria",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,445,23

METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, nonblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial comparing antibiotic therapy (10-day course) with appendectomy in patients with appendicitis at 25 U.S. centers. The primary outcome was 30-day health status, as assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health status; noninferiority margin, 0.05 points). Secondary outcomes included appendectomy in the antibiotics group and complications through 90 days; analyses were prespecified in subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of an appendicolith. RESULTS: In total, 1552 adults (414 with an appendicolith) underwent randomization; 776 were assigned to receive antibiotics (47% of whom were not hospitalized for the index treatment) and 776 to undergo appendectomy (96% of whom underwent a laparoscopic procedure). Antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of 30-day EQ-5D scores (mean difference, 0.01 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.001 to 0.03). In the antibiotics group, 29% had undergone appendectomy by 90 days, including 41% of those with an appendicolith and 25% of those without an appendicolith. Complications were more common in the antibiotics group than in the appendectomy group (8.1 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.98); the higher rate in the antibiotics group could be attributed to those with an appendicolith (20.2 vs. 3.6 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 5.69; 95% CI, 2.11 to 15.38) and not to those without an appendicolith (3.7 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.43). The rate of serious adverse events was 4.0 per 100 participants in the antibiotics group and 3.0 per 100 participants in the appendectomy group (rate ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.67 to 2.50). CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of appendicitis, antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of results of a standard health-status measure. In the antibiotics group, nearly 3 in 10 participants had undergone appendectomy by 90 days. Participants with an appendicolith were at a higher risk for appendectomy and for complications than those without an appendicolith.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using database that included: demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, medications and clinical outcomes of all patients hospitalized in Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between March 12, 2020 and December 1st 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk of death of COVID-19 infected patients. RESULTS: In total,1002 patients with COVID-19 infection with mean age of the cohort was 54±16 years (65% (n=650) male) were included, with an overall and intensive care unit (ICU) mortalities of 26% (n=257) and 42% (n=199/473), respectively. The prevalence of ICU admission was 47% (n=473) and the need for mechanical ventilation was 41% (n=413). The overall length of stay in the ICU was 13 (9-21) days. Adjusting for other factors in the model, the multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that in-hospital mortality in admitted COVID-19 patients was associated with old age (p<0.001), heart diseases (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-3.03; p=0.018), liver diseases (aOR, 4.48; 95% CI: 1.04-19.3; p=0.044), those with higher ferritin levels (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI: 1.00-1.00; p=0.006), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR, 3.20; 95% CI: 1.65-6.18; p=0.001), sepsis (aOR, 1.77; 95% CI: 1.12-2.80; p=0.022), and those that had ICU admission (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.12-4.38; p=0.022). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high and was associated with advanced age, heart diseases, liver disease, high ferritin, ARDS, sepsis and ICU admission.

ASPECTS score was lower (9 [7-10] vs. 10 [8-10], p = 0.032), NIHSS score was slightly higher (5 [2-14] vs. 4 [2-8], p = 0.122), onset-to-door time was higher (304 [93-760] vs. 197 [91.25-645] min, p = 0.104), and a lower proportion arrived within 4.5 h from onset of symptoms (43.4 vs. 58%, p = 0.043) during the CO-VID-19 period. There were no differences between proportion of patients receiving recanalization treatment (intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy) and in-hospital delays. CONCLUSION: We observed a reduction in the number of acute strokes and TIAs admitted during the COVID-19 period. This drop affected especially elderly patients, and despite a delay in their arrival to the emergency department, the proportion of patients treated with recanalization therapies was preserved.","Velilla-Alonso, Gabriel; García-Pastor, Andrés; Rodríguez-López, Ángela; Gómez-Roldós, Ana; Sánchez-Soblechero, Antonio; Amaya-Pascasio, Laura; Díaz-Otero, Fernando; Fernández-Bullido, Yolanda; Iglesias-Mohedano, Ana María; Vázquez-Alén, Pilar; Vales-Montero, Marta; Gil-Núñez, Antonio-Carmelo",Cerebrovasc Dis,445,1

METHODS: Loss of sense of smell and/or taste was reported by 26 of 63 COVID-19 patients (41%), whereas only 31% of the patients experiencing hyposmia had simultaneous symptoms of rhinitis. Smell tests were performed in 14 of these patients and taste tests in 10. The measurements were conducted in a patient care setting in an early COVID-19 cohort. RESULTS: An olfactory disorder was present in 10/14 patients, before as well as after nasal decongestion. In 2 of these patients, hyposmia was the leading or only symptom of SARS-CoV­2 infection. All tested patients reported recovery of smell and/or taste within 8 to 23 days. CONCLUSION: The data imply that a) COVID-19 can lead to hyposmia in a relevant number of patients, the incidence was approximately 30% in this cohort; b) in most cases, the olfactory disturbance was not associated with nasal obstruction, thus indicating a possible neurogenic origin; and c) the olfactory disorder largely resolved within 1-3 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. There were no indications of an increased incidence of dysgeusia. These early data may help in the interpretation of COVID-19-associated hyposmia as well as in the counseling of patients, given the temporary nature of hyposmia observed in this study. Furthermore, according to the current experience, hyposmia without rhinitic obstruction can be the leading or even the only symptom of a SARS-CoV­2 infection.","Bocksberger, S; Wagner, W; Hummel, T; Guggemos, W; Seilmaier, M; Hoelscher, M; Wendtner, C-M",HNO,445,16

Contact tracing and quarantining of positive cases are chief strategies of disease control that has been accepted globally. Though scientific knowledge regarding household transmission of the COVID-19 through contact of positive case is sparse. Current systematic review was planned to assess global statistics and characteristics of household secondary attack rate (SAR) of COVID-19. Methods Eligible articles were retrieved through search of - MEDLINE, SCOPUS and EMBASE for the period December 2019 to June 15th 2020. Search terms were developed to identify articles reporting household SARs in various countries. After initial screening of 326 articles, 13 eligible studies were included in the final evidence synthesis. Results We found that SAR varies widely across countries with lowest reported rate as 4.6% and highest as 49.56%. The rates were unaffected by confounders such as population of the country, lockdown status and geographic location. Review suggested greater vulnerability of spouse and elderly population for secondary transmission than other household members. It was also observed that quarantining and isolation are most effective strategies for prevention of the secondary transmission of the disease. Symptomatic status of the index case emerged to be a critical factor, with very low transmission probability during asymptomatic phase. Conclusion Present review findings recommend that adequate measures should be provided to protect the vulnerable population as only case tracing and quarantining might be insufficient. It should be combined with advisory for limiting household contacts and active surveillance for symptom onset.","Shah, Komal; Saxena, Deepak; Mavalankar, Dileep",QJM,445,24

We show that the proposed procedure is asymptotically minimax and pointwise optimal, minimizing moments of the detection delay as probabilities of false alarm and wrong identification approach zero. The asymptotic optimality properties hold for general stochastic models with dependent observations. We illustrate general results for detection-identification of changes in multistream Markov ergodic processes. We consider several examples, including an application to rapid detection-identification of COVID-19 in Italy.

We hypothesised that reductions would vary by patient age and disease type. We examined pre- and in-lockdown ED attendances for two COVID-19 unrelated diagnoses: one likely to be affected by lockdown measures (gastroenteritis), and one likely to be unaffected (appendicitis). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study across two EDs in one London hospital Trust. We compared all adult and paediatric ED attendances, before (January 2020) and during lockdown (March/April 2020). Key patient demographics, method of arrival, and discharge location were compared. We used Systemised Nomenclature of Medicine codes to define attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. RESULTS: ED attendances fell from 1129 per day before lockdown to 584 in lockdown, 51.7% of pre-lockdown rates. In-lockdown attendances were lowest for under-18s (16.0% of pre-lockdown). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital increased from 17.3% to 24.0%, and the proportion admitted to intensive care increased fourfold. Attendances for gastroenteritis fell from 511 to 103, 20.2% of pre-lockdown rates. Attendances for appendicitis also decreased, from 144 to 41, 28.5% of pre-lockdown rates. CONCLUSION: ED attendances fell substantially following lockdown implementation. The biggest reduction was for under-18s. We observed reductions in attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. This may reflect lower rates of infectious disease transmission, although the fall in appendicitis-related attendances suggests that behavioural factors were also important. Larger studies are urgently needed to understand changing patterns of ED use and access to emergency care during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.","Honeyford, Kate; Coughlan, Charles; Nijman, Ruud G; Expert, Paul; Burcea, Gabriel; Maconochie, Ian; Kinderlerer, Anne; Cooke, Graham S; Costelloe, Ceire E",West J Emerg Med,445,16

The number of infected cases is increasing day by day. Unfortunately, we do not have a vaccine and specific treatment for it. Along with the protective measures, respiratory and/or circulatory supports and some antiviral and retroviral drugs have been used against SARS-CoV-2, but there are no more extensive studies proving their efficacy. In this study, the latest publications in the field have been reviewed, focusing on the modulatory effects on the immunity of some natural antiviral dietary supplements, vitamins and minerals. Findings suggest that several dietary supplements, including black seeds, garlic, ginger, cranberry, orange, omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins (e.g., A, B vitamins, C, D, E), and minerals (e.g., Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Se, Zn) have anti-viral effects. Many of them act against various species of respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses. Therefore, dietary supplements, including vitamins and minerals, probiotics as well as individual nutritional behaviour can be used as adjuvant therapy together with antiviral medicines in the management of COVID-19 disease.","Islam, Muhammad Torequl; Quispe, Cristina; Martorell, Miquel; Docea, Anca Oana; Salehi, Bahare; Calina, Daniela; Reiner, Zeljko; Sharifi-Rad, Javad",Int J Vitam Nutr Res,445,16

Most of the recommended precautionary measures are dependent on human behaviors and therefore their effectiveness largely depends on peoples' perception and attitudes toward the disease. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary measures taken in response to COVID-19 in North America. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, an online survey targeted to North Americans focused on the public's knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and precautionary behaviors taken in response to this pandemic. Descriptive analyses were performed for the whole population and the subgroup analyses contrasted the differences between Americans and Canadians. Results: The cohort comprised 1,264 relatively young participants with an average age of 28.6 ± 9.8 years. The vast majority (&gt;90%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19. Regarding risk perception, about a quarter assumed to be at less risk to contract the disease, and 42.8% considered themselves to be less contagious than others. While the vast majority avoided performing risky behaviors, only a small proportion (13.2%) wore a face mask—which is in line with the public health recommendations of the two countries at the time of data collection. Overall, a larger proportion of Canadian participants (55.8%) were satisfied with the performance of their national public health in response to the current pandemic, compared to their American counterparts (12.2%). Discussion: Data regarding the public's knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and behaviors in response to this pandemic is limited. The results of this study highlight that this relatively young and educated sample of North Americans had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19 and a large proportion of them were taking the precautionary measures against this pandemic. However, a significant number of individuals believe to be at less risk of contracting the disease compared to the general population. Educating the public that no one is safe from this disease, could play a role in further limiting risky behaviors and ultimately facilitating disease containment.","Salimi, Ali; ElHawary, Hassan; Diab, Nermin; Smith, Lee",Front.

Revascularization is an important therapy for patients with CLTI. However, we sometimes experience refractory cases with insufficient peripheral circulation or microcirculation after revascularization. In this situation, additional therapy can be administered, such as low-density lipoprotein apheresis, high-pressure oxygen therapy, and spinal cord stimulation. However, they are not effective in some cases. Some reports have also indicated that transdermal isosorbide dinitrate patch (ISDN-P) is a useful therapy for PAD. As the efficacy of ISDN-P for patients with CLTI is not well-known, we examined it in this study. We assessed the skin perfusion pressure (SPP) after affixing an ISDN-P on the foot, because SPP measurement has proved useful in the assessment of PAD and is a good indicator of wound healing potential. The SPP (dorsal and plantar aspects) after ISDN-P application on the foot of healthy volunteers increased (n = 8; mean ± SD, 12.6 ± 7.9 [P = .12], and 21.2 ± 7.7 mm Hg [P < .05], respectively), as did SPP of patients with CLTI (n = 10; mean ± SD, 19.8 ± 2.5 [P < .01], and 14.1 ± 5.9 mm Hg [P < .05], respectively). All the patients who received an ISDN-P on the foot had no major complication, and no significant change in blood pressure.

However, growing evidence highlights SARS-CoV-2-mediated extrarespiratory manifestations, namely, gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic complications. The detection of 1) the virus in the GI system (duodenum, colon, rectum, anal region, and feces); 2) the high expression of additional candidate coreceptors/auxiliary proteins to facilitate the virus entry; 3) the abundant viral angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor; 4) the substantial expression of host transmembrane serine protease 2, necessary to induce virus-cell fusion; 5) the viral replication in the intestinal epithelial cells; and 6) the primarily GI disorders in the absence of respiratory symptoms lead to increased awareness of the risk of disease transmission via the fecal-oral route. The objectives of this review are to provide a brief update of COVID-19 pathogenesis and prevalence, present a critical overview of its GI and liver complications that affect clinical COVID-19 outcomes, clarify associated mechanisms (notably microbiota-related), define whether gut/liver disorders occur more frequently among critically ill patients with COVID-19, determine the impact of COVID-19 on preexisting gut/liver complications and vice versa, and discuss the available strategies for prevention and treatment to improve prognosis of the patients.

The detection of (i) the virus in the GI system (duodenum, colon, rectum, anal region and feces); (ii) the high expression of additional candidate co-receptors/auxiliary proteins to facilitate the virus entry; (iii) the abundant viral angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor; (iv) the substantial expression of host transmembrane serine protease 2, necessary to induce virus-cell fusion; (v) the viral replication in the intestinal epithelial cells; and (vi) the primarily GI disorders in the absence of respiratory symptoms lead to increased awareness of the risk of disease transmission via the fecal-oral route. The objectives of this review are to provide a brief update of COVID-19 pathogenesis and prevalence, present a critical overview of its GI and liver complications that affect clinical COVID-19 outcomes, clarify associated mechanisms (notably microbiota-related), define whether gut/liver disorders occur more frequently among critically ill patients with COVID-19, determine the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing gut/liver complications and vice versa, and discuss the available strategies for prevention and treatment to improve prognosis of the patients.","Levy, Emile; Stintzi, Alain; Cohen, Albert; Desjardins, Yves; Marette, Andre; Spahis, Schohraya",Am. j. physiol. gasterointest. liver physiol,445,16

METHODS: Psychiatric outpatient visits and patient diagnostic information were extracted from the EHR(electronic health records) of a Korean tertiary hospital during 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and 3 months before the COVID-19 outbreak. Visit rates of psychiatric outpatients according to primary psychiatric diagnosis category before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were compared using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model. The temporal associations between the number of daily outpatient visits and the daily number of newly confirmed cases were examined by time-series analysis within each diagnosis category. RESULTS: Total daily outpatient visit rate was significantly reduced during the pandemic. Among the nine most prevalent diagnosis categories, the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were significantly reduced by about 29.8%, 14.8%, and 13.3% respectively. Time-series analysis showed significant temporal correlations between the daily number of newly confirmed cases and the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, whereas patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders showed no significant temporal association. LIMITATIONS: Potential confounding factors unrelated to the pandemic might have influenced the results. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that patients with anxiety or depressive disorders may have concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19, and may be more reluctant to visit psychiatry outpatient clinics. Delivery strategies for mental healthcare services, such as telepsychiatry, would be helpful to enhance continuity of care during the pandemic.","Seo, Jun Ho; Kim, Se Joo; Lee, Myeongjee; Kang, Jee In",J Affect Disord,445,16

Until May 10th, 2020, there were 4,178,097 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 283,732 deaths globally. In Indonesia, the total of confirmed cases was 14,032 cases with 973 deaths. Before discovering effective medicines and vaccines for prevention, it is crucial for future forecasting to support medical services and decision-makers to prevent the spread of the disease. This study uses ARIMA analysis to predict the number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases in Indonesia. The results show that in the coming 30 days from now, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases would continue to increase until it reaches 610 people (95% CI 447-773 people). However, the increase in daily cases also occurred with increased patients recovered and a decrease of dead-patients, as many as 173 people (95% CI 95-215 people) and 27 people (95% CI 0-75 people). The condition is quite encouraging, given the high mortality and low recovery from COVID-19 in the early days.

Studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 are prone to thrombotic disease resulting in increased mortality. We present a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a warehouse worker with a giant thrombus-in-transit involving the right ventricle and tricuspid valve. We also describe the associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man with recent COVID-19 exposure presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, and syncope and was found to be in hypoxic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen. The clinical course deteriorated with worsening respiratory failure and septic shock, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressor support. Further evaluation revealed a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and an S1Q3T3 pattern on electrocardiogram. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed due to clinical deterioration and hemodynamic instability, which showed a large thrombus-in-transit through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and supportive care. A repeat echocardiogram after 1 week did not show any thrombus. The patient slowly improved over the following weeks but required tracheostomy due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. He was discharged on oral anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the presence of significant COVID-19-related hemostatic disturbances and the importance of associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. A bedside echocardiogram can provide valuable information in patients with suspected high-risk pulmonary embolism and hemodynamic instability. Early diagnosis by keeping a high index of suspicion and prompt treatment is vital to avoid adverse outcomes and increased mortality.","Khan, Hafiz Muhammad Waqas; Khan, Mahin Raqueeb; Munir, Ahmad; Moughrabieh, Anas; Changezi, Hameem Unnabi",Am J Case Rep,445,24

We aimed to conduct a timely assessment of the psychological burden and experience on medical student volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales to survey the psychology burden of students in April 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine medical students who signed up for volunteer activities in Chinese from February to April 2020. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Results: The detection of depression, anxiety and stress of medical student volunteers were 26.8%, 20.2% and 11.1%, respectively. The volunteer's negative emotions were more pronounced before work and diminished gradually. Most participants expressed no concern about being infected themselves, but worry about family infection. Participant's motivations for volunteering were primarily their duties as medical students and encouragement from their families/teachers. The vast majority of medical students said they would be willing to work as medical assistants again and this experience would not affect their career choice. Conclusions: Chinese medical student volunteers tended to show negative emotions at the beginning of their work, and then gradually declined, while positive emotions emerged. Most medical students were willing to volunteer as medical assistants when their country needed them due to their sense of responsibility as medical students. This study on the psychological and experiential aspects were derived from Chinese medical student volunteers and might have a significant impact on future public health emergencies in similar settings.","Zhang, Kaiting; Peng, Yixiang; Zhang, Xiaowei; Li, Liping",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),445,16

Stay-at-home orders (SHO) prompted rapid upscaling of telemedicine capabilities and upskilling of providers. This study compares telemedicine usage before and after the SHO and analyzes how a Children's Center addressed challenges associated with a rapid rise in telemedicine. Methods: Data on outpatient visits across 14 specialty divisions were abstracted from the institutional electronic medical record. The 12-week study period (March 9, 2020-May 29, 2020) spanned three epochs: pre-SHO; post-SHO; reopening to in-person visits. Changes in in-person visits, video visits, and completed, cancelled, and no-show appointments were compared between three epochs. Results: A total of 4,914 outpatient pediatric specialty visits were completed, including 67% (3,296/4,914) in-person and 33% (1,618/4,914) through video. During the first two epochs encompassing the SHO, video visits increased by 4,750%. During the third epoch when the SHO was lifted, video visits decreased by 66%, with 19.4% of visits conducted through video in week 12. Overall, for outpatient video appointments, 82.8% (1,618/1,954) were completed, 9.1% (178/1,954) were cancelled, and 8.1% (158/1,954) were no-shows. The percentage of completed and no-show appointments did not differ between epochs. However, the cancellation rate decreased significantly from Epochs 1 to 3 (p = 0.008). Conclusion: A SHO was associated with a large increase in pediatric specialty video visits. Post-SHO, the percentage of pediatric specialty visits conducted through video decreased but remained higher than before the SHO. Frequent, content-rich communications, self-directed tutorials, and individualized coaching may facilitate successful increases in telemedicine use.","Howie, Flora; Kreofsky, Beth L; Ravi, Anupama; Lokken, Troy; Hoff, Mekenzie D; Fang, Jennifer L",Telemed. j. e. health,445,21

METHODS: A meta-analysis of the prevalence of different abnormal coagulation indicators in COVID-19 patients in China was performed. The difference of coagulation indicators and the incidence of DIC were compared between severe cases and nonsevere cases as well as nonsurvivors and survivors, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 22 Chinese studies involving 4,889 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients were included. The average D-dimer value of COVID-19 patients is 0.67 µg/mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.78), and 29.3% (95% CI: 20.1-38.5%) of patients showed elevated D-dimer values. Severe patients had significantly higher D-dimer levels and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) compared with nonsevere patients. Nonsurvivors had significantly higher D-dimer levels, prolonged PT, and decreased platelet count compared with survivors. In total, 6.2% (95% CI: 2.6-9.9%) COVID-19 patients were complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in which the log risk ratio in nonsurvivors was 3.267 (95% CI: 2.191-4.342, Z = 5.95, p < 0.05) compared with that in survivors. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of coagulopathy in Chinese COVID-19 inpatients is high, and both the abnormal coagulation indicators and DIC are closely associated with the severity and poor prognosis of these COVID-19 patients. Therefore, attention should be paid to coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Closely monitoring of coagulation indicators and application of appropriate anticoagulation may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 inpatients in China.","Jin, Shanen; Jin, Yiyang; Xu, Bai; Hong, Jun; Yang, Xianghong",Thromb Haemost,445,26

We developed a statistical framework to explore the association between molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level disease transmissibility of COVID-19. METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous transmissibility of COVID-19 by using the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). The mutation activity in SARS-CoV-2 is quantified empirically depending on (i) the prevalence of emerged amino acid substitutions and (ii) the frequency of these substitutions in the whole sequence. Using the likelihood-based approach, a statistical framework is developed to examine the association between mutation activity and Rt. We adopted the COVID-19 surveillance data in California as an example for demonstration. RESULTS: We found a significant positive association between population-level COVID-19 transmissibility and the D614G substitution on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We estimate that a per 0.01 increase in the prevalence of glycine (G) on codon 614 is positively associated with a 0.49% (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.59) increase in Rt, which explains 61% of the Rt variation after accounting for the control measures. We remark that the modeling framework can be extended to study other infectious pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a link between the molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level transmission of COVID-19 to provide further evidence for a positive association between the D614G substitution and Rt. Future studies exploring the mechanism between SARS-CoV-2 mutations and COVID-19 infectivity are warranted.","Zhao, Shi; Lou, Jingzhi; Cao, Lirong; Zheng, Hong; Chong, Marc K C; Chen, Zigui; Zee, Benny C Y; Chan, Paul K S; Wang, Maggie H",Theor Biol Med Model,445,24

The aim is then to identify all defective items of the collection with as few tests as possible. This problem is relevant in several fields, among which biology and computer sciences. In the present article we consider that the tests applied to groups of items returns a \emph{load}, measuring how defective the most defective item of the group is. In this setting, we propose a simple non-adaptative algorithm allowing the detection of all defective items of the collection. This method improves on classical group testing algorithms using only the binary response of the test. Group testing recently gained attraction as a potential tool to solve a shortage of COVID-19 test kits, in particular for RT-qPCR. These tests return the viral load of the sample and the viral load varies greatly among individuals. Therefore our model presents some of the key features of this problem. We aim at using the extra piece of information that represents the viral load to construct a one-stage pool testing algorithm on this idealized version.

How this novel beta-coronavirus virus, and coronaviruses more generally, alter cellular metabolism to support massive production of ~30 kB viral genomes and subgenomic viral RNAs remains largely unknown. To gain insights, transcriptional and metabolomic analyses are performed 8 hours after SARS-CoV-2 infection, an early timepoint where the viral lifecycle is completed but prior to overt effects on host cell growth or survival. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 remodels host folate and one-carbon metabolism at the post-transcriptional level to support de novo purine synthesis, bypassing viral shutoff of host translation. Intracellular glucose and folate are depleted in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and viral replication is exquisitely sensitive to inhibitors of folate and one-carbon metabolism, notably methotrexate. Host metabolism targeted therapy could add to the armamentarium against future coronavirus outbreaks.","Zhang, Yuchen; Guo, Rui; Kim, Sharon H; Shah, Hardik; Zhang, Shuting; Liang, Jin Hua; Fang, Ying; Gentili, Matteo; Leary, Colin N O039; Elledge, Steven J; Hung, Deborah T; Mootha, Vamsi K; Gewurz, Benjamin E",Nat Commun,445,16

Moreover, analysis of the determined clinical outcomes is required and thus, modifiable predictor values need to identified. In Ayurveda, outcome of a disease is a multivariate function and this exploratory work is an attempt to identify one such factor "" Vyadhiksamatwa "" (immune status). Materials and methods: A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in fifty diagnosed cases of COVID-19. Study participants were subjected to a questionnaire to assess relationship between the three determinants of the disease - exposure, clinical severity and Vyadhiksamatwa (immune status). Results: Clinical Severity was found strongly correlated with Vyadhiksmatwa (with the value of Pearson Correlation - 0.740 significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). Conclusion: In the determination of clinical severity of disease, there are two epidemiological factors responsible - extrinsic (exposure) and intrinsic (Vyadhiksamatwa). It has been observed that higher the value of Vyadhiksamatwa of an individual lesser will be the clinical severity of the disease in that individual. Vyadhiksamatwa can alter the host response to infections.","Sharma, Meenakshi; Sharma, Charu; Mandal, Sisir Kumar; Nesari, Tanuja Manoj; Kumar, Anil",,445,13

The effect on air pollution has been studied in detail in the literature, although some pollutants, such as ammonia (NH3), have received comparatively less attention to date. Focusing on the case of Lombardy in Northern Italy, this study aimed to evaluate changes in NH3 atmospheric concentration on a temporal scale (the years from 2013 to 2019 compared to 2020) and on a spatial scale (countryside, city, and mountain areas). For this purpose, ground-based (from public air quality control units scattered throughout the region) and satellite observations (from IASI sensors on board MetOp-A and MetOp-B) were collected and analyzed. For ground-based measurements, a marked spatial variability is observed between the different areas while, as regards the comparison between periods, statistically significant differences were observed only for the countryside areas (+31% in 2020 compared to previous years). The satellite data show similar patterns but do not present statistically significant differences neither between different areas, nor between the two periods. In general, there have been no reduction effects of atmospheric NH3 as a consequence of COVID-19. This calls into question the role of the agricultural sector, which is known to be the largest responsible for NH3 emissions. Even if the direct comparison between the two datasets shows little correlation, their contextual consideration allows making more robust considerations regarding air pollutants.","Lovarelli, Daniela Fugazza Davide Costantini Michele Conti Cecilia Diolaiuti Guglielmina Guarino Marcella",Atmospheric Environment,445,24

On March 2020 tocilizumab - an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody - was suggested as immunomodulatory treatment in severe COVID-19 because hyperinflammatory syndrome occurs in many patients similarly to the cytokine release syndrome that develops after CAR-T cell therapy. In our retrospective observational study, 20 severe COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care were treated with tocilizumab in addition to standard-of-care therapy (SOC) and compared with 13 COVID-19 patients receiving only SOC. Clinical respiratory status, inflammatory markers and vascular radiologic score improved after one week from tocilizumab administration. On the contrary, these parameters were stable or worsened in patients receiving only SOC.

The social aspect of this issue is complicated by the fact that Europe nowadays hosts 82 million international migrants. If migrant workers leave the host country, it reduces the Covid-19 spread. Nevertheless, if migrant workers do not return, it will worsen the situation with the economic crisis. The subject of the study is the instrumental and mathematical aspects of impact simulation of labor migrants' policy on the economic growth of the host country affected by COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the work is to develop the system dynamics model for assessing labor migrants' policy impact on the economic growth of the host country during COVID-19 pandemic. It examined through hypotheses of different scenarios of labor migrants policy impact on the host country economic growth in Covid-19 pandemic. The proposed model combines epidemiological and the economic growth models and relies upon real statistical data. The analysis was carried out in four European countries.

As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, hospitals rapidly adapted prone positioning for acutely ill patients into a new process: awake self-prone positioning. Could a large health care system safely and rapidly implement awake self-prone positioning in COVID-19 units to prevent respiratory failure from progressing among a surge of inpatients? REVIEW OF EVIDENCE: The team extensively reviewed the literature. Using evidence from 22 case reports, peer-reviewed standards, and studies, they developed an awake self-prone positioning guideline. IMPLEMENTATION: The guideline was implemented in April 2020 in critical care and COVID-19 units. Multimodal education included a concise guideline and real-time support from intensive care unit nurses, clinical nurse specialists, and nursing professional development specialists. EVALUATION: Awake self-prone positioning was a new procedure, and relevant data were obtained from the electronic medical record. From March 18 to August 5, 2020, 1000 COVID-19-related admissions occurred; 272 patients had a high-flow nasal cannula, 111 (41%) of whom had documentation of awake self-prone positioning. SUSTAINABILITY: This guideline is now an established part of COVID-19 care and has been integrated into practice in units caring for patients with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses adapted quickly to using awake self-prone positioning as a plan of care for hypoxic patients. This practice may help hospitals adjust care delivery for these patients and effectively maintain patients in non-intensive care units. (Critical Care Nurse.

The developed system only requires a person to put a rack with mixed and non-arranged tubes in front of a robot. The robot autonomously performs recognition, reasoning, planning, manipulation, etc., and returns a rack with separated and arranged tubes. The system is simple-to-use, and there are no requests for expert knowledge in robotics.

To meet this challenge hospitals need a Disaster Response Plan and a Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) as a crisis leadership tool. The complex dependency between the systems staff, supplies, and space during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major problem for hospitals. To take the appropriate countermeasures, the effects of the crisis on these systems must be detected, analyzed, and displayed. The presentation and interpretation of such complex processes often poses serious problems for the hospitals' incident commanders. In this article, we describe a new model that is able to display these complex interrelationships within the command process. The model was developed and deployed during the disaster response to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in order to facilitate the entire command process and to improve hospital disaster response. The approach of the model is as simple as it is innovative. It perfectly symbolizes the basic principle of disaster medicine: keep is safe and simple. It will help hospitals to improve command and control and to optimize the disaster response during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Wurmb, Thomas; Ertl, Georg; Ernestus, Ralf-Ingo; Meybohm, Patrick",J Emerg Manag,445,1

Common methods of achieving this is via Motor Imagery (MI), which maps brain signals to code for certain commands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is preferred for recording brain signal data on account of it being non-invasive. Despite their potential utility, MI-BCI systems are yet confined to research labs. A major cause for this is lack of robustness of such systems. As hypothesized by two teams during Cybathlon 2016, a particular source of the system's vulnerability is the sharp change in the subject's state of emotional arousal. This work aims towards making MI-BCI systems resilient to such emotional perturbations. To do so, subjects are exposed to high and low arousal-inducing virtual reality (VR) environments before recording EEG data. The advent of COVID-19 compelled us to modify our methodology. Instead of training machine learning algorithms to classify emotional arousal, we opt for classifying subjects that serve as proxy for each state. Additionally, MI models are trained for each subject instead of each arousal state. As training subjects to use MI-BCI can be an arduous and time-consuming process, reducing this variability and increasing robustness can considerably accelerate the acceptance and adoption of assistive technologies powered by BCI.","Moeed, Abdul",,445,23

RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to trials that support the current Food and Drug Administration label and published over the past 3 years, the recently published Spironolactone With Patiromer in the Treatment of Resistant Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease (AMBER) trial provides clear benefits of patiromer use in a group of resistant hypertension patients. The AMBER was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 295 participants stratified by local serum potassium measurement (4.3 to < 4.7 mmol/L vs 4.7 to 5.1 mmol/L) and history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The focus was on enabling participants with resistant hypertension to achieve blood pressure goals by using spironolactone. Additionally, the ongoing Patiromer for the Management of Hyperkalemia in Subjects Receiving RAASi Medications for the Treatment of Heart Failure (DIAMOND) trial is designed to demonstrate how patiromer is an ""enabler"" of therapies that are needed to either control resistant hypertension or reduce mortality in heart failure but generate hyperkalemia. These and other studies are discussed in detail. Patiromer is one of two new potassium binders that are far better tolerated than the previous agent and can be given chronically to participants who need life-saving therapies but have elevations of potassium into a dangerous range as a consequence.","Ali, Waleed; Bakris, George",Curr Cardiol Rep,445,16

The search for alternative diagnostic techniques is still ongoing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of microultrasound (microUS) for the diagnosis of csPCa within prospectively collected cohort of patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) according to MRI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 320 consecutive patients with at least one Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) &#8805;3 lesion according to MRI were prospectively enrolled. INTERVENTION: All patients received microUS before prostate biopsy using the ExactVu system; the Prostate Risk Identification using microUS (PRI-MUS) protocol was used to identify targets. The urologists were blinded to MRI results until after the microUS targeting was completed. All patients received both targeted (based on either microUS or MRI findings) and randomized biopsies. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The sensitivity and specificity of microUS to determine the presence of csPCa (defined as at least one core with a Gleason score &#8805;7 PCa) were determined. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to determine the predictors of csPCa. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Clinically significant PCa was diagnosed in 116 (36.3%) patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of microUS for csPCa diagnosis were 89.7% and 81.5%, while specificity and positive predictive value were 26.0% and 40.8%, respectively. A combination of microUS-targeted and randomized biopsies would allow diagnosing the same proportion of csPCa as that diagnosed by an approach combining MRI-targeted and randomized biopsies (n = 113; 97.4%), with only three (2.6%) csPCa cases diagnosed by a microUS-targeted and three (2.6%) by an MRI-targeted approach. In a logistic regression model, an increasing PRI-MUS score was an independent predictor of csPCa (p &#8804; 0.005). The main limitation of the current study is represented by the fact that all patients had suspicious MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Microultrasound is a promising imaging modality for targeted prostate biopsies. Our results suggest that a microUS-based biopsy strategy may be capable of diagnosing the great majority of cancers, while missing only few patients with csPCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: According to our results, microultrasound (microUS) may represent an effective diagnostic alternative to magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer, providing high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the potential role of microUS in the diagnostic pathway of patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer.","Lughezzani, Giovanni; Maffei, Davide; Saita, Alberto; Paciotti, Marco; Diana, Pietro; Buffi, Nicolò Maria; Colombo, Piergiuseppe; Elefante, Grazia Maria; Hurle, Rodolfo; Lazzeri, Massimo; Guazzoni, Giorgio; Casale, Paolo",Eur.

Bacterial contamination (BC) of platelet components (PCs) can lead to transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections (TTBI), central line-associated bloodstream infections, and sepsis, with long-term complications and/or death. In the US, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients require transfusion support until engraftment and together with hematology/oncology (hemonc.) patients receive the highest number of PCs/patient. FDA's Guidance recommends approaches to reduce BC risk including the use of enhanced bacterial culture screening (EBSC) or pathogen reduction (PR) of platelets. Methods: The Miami Cancer Institute (MCI) implemented PR-PCs for all allogeneic HSCT patients. Irradiation, CMV testing, and bacterial screening have been discontinued for PR-PCs. Transfusion outcomes are being monitored using active hemovigilance (HV) reporting. Results: Considering the fatality risk associated with BC of PCs (1:200,000 -1:1,000,000) despite the use of optimal skin cleansing, initial sample diversion, and primary bacterial culture, 1/2,880 PCs are still contaminated (Bloch et al.);further steps towards BC mitigation are needed. As the UK and US reported a residual BC risk of 5.4-9.4/million PCs after implementation of EBSC, PR may represent an alternative approach with other cumulative benefits. Indeed, national HV data from France, Switzerland and Belgium reported no sepsis transfusion reactions since PR implementation (Benjamin et al.). In addition, the risk of TA-GVHD and other TTI including emerging infectious diseases (EID) may be decreased after the inactivation of pathogens and leukocytes (Lanteri et al.). At MCI, the percentage of transfused PR-PCs has been increasing steadily from 7.9% in July 2019 to 22.2% in January 2021. Over a 19 month-period, a total of 9,296 PC were transfused including 1,677 PR-PCs. While non-PR-PCs were all irradiated and bacterially screened, PR-PC were neither irradiated nor bacterially screened. No cases of TA-GVHD or TTI were reported. A total of 27 mild, non-life-threatening platelet transfusion reactions were reported including 22 (81.5%) after non-PR PCs transfusion and 5 (18.5%) after PR-PC transfusion. In addition, the early release of transfusionready fresh PR-PCs 24-48 hours after collection has proven invaluable in providing clinicians and patients with blood continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Though certain measures have improved blood safety, the risk of TTI associated with PC transfusion remains a concern for vulnerable hemonc. patients. Using PR-PC is especially important to consider when patients undergo extensive life-saving therapies such as bone marrow transplants.","Alvarez, H.; Lanteri, M.; Koehne, G.",Anesthesia and Analgesia,445,26

An advanced model using standard differential equations in Python software version 3.6 was used to estimate R0 based on model fit to actual data. RESULTS: Forty-eight SARS-CoV-2 infections were found among the 474 quarantined individuals. Out of these, 44 (92%) were asymptomatic. R0 for the overall duration was found to be 2.29 (95% CI: 1.84-2.78). Male gender and age &#8805; 60 years were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR = 4.33, 95% CI: 2.07-9.05 and 5.32, 95% CI: 3.13-9.04, respectively). Isolation of infected individuals and stricter quarantine of remaining individuals reduced the R0 from 2.41 initially to 1.17 subsequently. CONCLUSION: R0 value was found comparable to the earlier studies indicating similar transmission dynamics among quarantined individuals in India. Universal testing and prompt isolation of infected individuals reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Smaller group sizes should be preferred to large groups during facility-based quarantine in evacuation situations. The role of asymptomatic individuals appears to be strong in SARS-CoV-2 transmission within closed populations.","Saurabh, Suman; Kumar, Ritesh; Kumar, Nitesh; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Nag, Vijaya Lakshmi; Garg, Mahendra Kumar; Misra, Sanjeev",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,445,24

METHODS: We performed a simulation of the currently available data using a multistate and hazards model to provide an objective model for counseling and decision making for health care workers. RESULTS: Stage IV patients with oral cancer who did not receive treatment had progression of disease and an increased mortality rate compared to patients who receive treatment but did not contract COVID-19. The patients who received treatment and got affected with COVID-19 had a far worse impact and higher mortality rate than all other groups. CONCLUSION: Isolation and deferring treatment for stage IV patients with oral cancer, so as to avoid hospital visits and contraction of COVID-19, is an advisable strategy based on this model.","Bhattacharjee, Atanu; Patil, Vijay M; Dikshit, Rajesh; Prabhash, Kumar; Singh, Arjun; Chaturvedi, Pankaj",Head Neck,445,16

We propose a testing protocol to accelerate infection diagnostics by combining multiple samples, and in case of positive results, re-test individual samples. The key insight is that a negative result in the first stage implies negative infection for all individuals. Thus, a single test could rule out infection in multiple individuals. Using simulations, we show that this protocol reduces the required number of testing kits, especially when the infection rate is low, alleviating a key bottleneck for public health authorities in times of pandemics and epidemics such as COVID-19. Our proposed protocol is expected to be more effective when the infection rate is low, which suggests that it is better suited for early stage and large-scale, population-wide testing. However, the managerial trade-off is that the protocol has costs in additional time for returning test results and an increased number of false negatives. We discuss applications of pooled testing in understanding population-wide testing to understand infection prevalence, to diagnose infections in high-risk groups of individuals, and to identify disease cold spots. © 2021 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.","Jain, T.; Jain, B.

METHODS: A prospective analysis was conducted of coronavirus disease 2019 patients presenting from 1 April 2020 to 30 July 2020. The otorhinolaryngological manifestations were evaluated based on patient history. The time required for symptom resolution was evaluated separately for intensive care unit and non-intensive care unit patients. RESULTS: A total of 600 patients were included in the study; 13.3 per cent required the intensive care unit and 2.2 per cent expired. The otorhinolaryngological manifestations were: sore throat (88 per cent), fever (78.8 per cent), anosmia or hyposmia (63.6 per cent), ageusia or hypogeusia (63.5 per cent), rhinorrhoea (51.3 per cent), nasal obstruction (33.5 per cent), sneezing (30.3 per cent), and breathing difficulty (18.6 per cent). The time required for symptom resolution was longest for breathing difficulty (23.6 days for intensive care unit and 8.2 days for non-intensive care unit patients). CONCLUSION: Otorhinolaryngological symptoms are one of the main presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The increased prevalence of medical co-morbidities in patients requiring intensive care unit and in deceased patients is also highlighted.","Bhatta, S; Gandhi, S; Saindani, S J; Ganesuni, D; Ghanpur, A D",J Laryngol Otol,445,1

So far, there is limited clinical evidence on the effect of corticosteroid therapy for this disease. This study aims to investigate the association between corticosteroid therapy and the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance among patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with mild COVID-19 were enrolled from two medical centers in China between January 13, 2020 and February 29, 2020. Baseline characteristics and durations of RNA clearance were compared between the corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid therapy groups. The independent effects of corticosteroid therapy on the duration of RNA clearance were estimated by generalized linear models. RESULTS: Of 82 patients with a mild infection, 40 patients were male (48.8%), with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range, IQR 36-61). Among those patients, 36 patients (43.9%) received corticosteroid therapy. The adjusted multivariate models showed that the effects of corticosteroids were non-significant on the durations of onset to first RNA clearance [ß 2.48, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) - 0.42 to 5.38, P = 0.0926] and to persistent RNA clearance (ß 1.54, 95% CI - 1.41 to 4.48, P = 0.3016), and durations of therapy to first RNA clearance (ß 2.16, 95% CI - 0.56 to 4.89, P = 0.1184) and to persistent RNA clearance (ß 1.22, 95% CI - 1.52 to 3.95, P = 0.3787). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy in patients with mild COVID-19 was not associated with the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance, suggesting that the use of corticosteroids may not be beneficial for patients with mild COVID-19 and should be prudently recommended in clinical practice. However, further studies are needed to verify the findings.","Ding, Cheng; Feng, Xuewen; Chen, Yanfei; Yuan, Jing; Yi, Ping; Li, Yongtao; Ni, Qin; Zou, Rongrong; Li, Xiaohe; Sheng, Jifang; Li, Lanjuan; Xu, Kaijin",Infect Dis Ther,445,15

Preliminary study,17.645086,3.989886,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Many studies have evaluated birth outcomes with COVID-19, but there has been less attention paid to the risk of early pregnancy loss, despite the known association of miscarriage with viral infection.1 The current literature is limited by small numbers of cases, a focus on inpatients, and lack of longitudinal follow-up.2-5 These studies have primarily been conducted in Europe and Asia which limits generalizability to a diverse US population with unique patient characteristics. To address this evidence gap, we present data on a cohort of U.S. women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy to help inform clinical practice. STUDY DESIGN: PRIORITY is an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of COVID-19 during pregnancy in the U.S. Participants are &#8805;13 years, under investigation for or had confirmed COVID-19 defined as positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, enrolled from March-October 2020. For this analysis, we selected participants who enrolled at <14 weeks gestation and had SARS-CoV-2 testing; 7 were excluded that did not have longitudinal follow-up. The study was approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (IRB #20-30410). Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment, weekly for 4 weeks, and then multiple times throughout pregnancy. Medical record review was used to adjudicate adverse outcomes in a subsample of the population. We calculated the incidence and 95% confidence intervals for early pregnancy loss (EPL) defined as pregnancy loss <20 weeks gestation. RESULTS: Among the 1,338 PRIORITY participants, 109 comprise the analysis set who enrolled at <14 weeks gestation; 94 were COVID-19 positive, 15 were COVID-19 negative. All 109 were outpatients and all were symptomatic. Average age of the population was 31 years; 30% of participants were Latinx (Table). The mean gestational age at enrollment was approximately 9 weeks; 83% of participants had at least 1 month of longitudinal follow-up prior to ending pregnancy. In the COVID-19 positive group, 6/94 (6.4%, 95% CI 2.4%-13.4%) had EPL compared with 1/15 in the COVID-19 negative group (6.7%, 95% CI 0.1%-31.9%). In the COVID-19 positive group, 5 EPLs occurred at 7-12 weeks and one at 15 weeks. In a subgroup analysis of 34 COVID-19 positive participants enrolled at <8 weeks gestation, 2/34 had EPL (5.9%). In the COVID-19 positive group, 82/90 (91.1%, 95% CI 83.2%-96.1%) had live births; 84.4% (95% CI 75.3%-91.2%) at term and 15.6% (95% CI 8.8%-24.7%) at <37 weeks; 6/94 pregnancies are ongoing but all are >24 weeks. CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study of pregnant people in the U.S., the risk of pregnancy loss at <20 weeks gestation was about 6%, both for participants with COVID-19 (N=94) and COVID-19 negative controls (N=15). This data compares favorably to the 10% rate of miscarriage among clinically recognized first trimester pregnancies prior to the pandemic.6 To our knowledge, this is the largest analyses of COVID-19 in the first trimester in a U.S. longitudinal cohort. With this sample size, the upper bound of the confidence interval for pregnancy loss of 13.4% is reassuring because it is not significantly higher than the expected miscarriage rate without viral infection. These results can guide counseling for people infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in pregnancy.","Jacoby, Vanessa L; Murtha, Amy; Afshar, Yalda; Gaw, Stephanie; Asiodu, Ifeyinwa; Tolosa, Jorge; Norton, Mary E; Boscardin, John; Flaherman, Valerie",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,445,16

METHODS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in this study. Patients' demographic and clinical data were recorded. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine and blood specimens, and anal and oropharyngeal swabs. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT04279782, 19 February, 2020). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in all four specimen types, though not all specimen types were positive simultaneously. The presence of viral RNA was not necessarily predictive of clinical symptoms, for example, the presence of viral RNA in the urine did not necessarily predict urinary tract symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple systems, including the urinary tract. Testing different specimen types may be useful for monitoring disease changes and progression, and for establishing a prognosis.","Peng, Liang; Liu, Jing; Xu, Wenxiong; Luo, Qiumin; Chen, Dabiao; Lei, Ziying; Huang, Zhanlian; Li, Xuejun; Deng, Keji; Lin, Bingliang; Gao, Zhiliang",J. med. virol,445,1

Since its outset, efforts have been made to guide the rapid generation of research in medicine. There are gaps in some areas of rehabilitation research for patients with COVID-19. The development of a specific research framework might serve to help monitor the status of research (mapping), shape and strengthen research by pointing to under-investigated areas, and promote rehabilitation research in this context. This article introduces and discusses the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Research Framework (CRRF) and presents the methodology used for its development. The questions have been developed among the World Health Organization (WHO) Rehabilitation Programme, Cochrane Rehabilitation, and the experts of its Rehabilitation-COVID-19 Evidence-based Response Action International Multiprofessional Steering Committee. The framework is divided into 2 parts and includes 20 questions organized in 4 groups: epidemiology, and evidence at the micro- (individual), meso- (health services), and macro- (health systems) levels. The CRRF offers a comprehensive view of the research areas relevant to COVID-19 and rehabilitation that are necessary to inform best practice and ensure rehabilitation services and health systems can best serve the population with COVID-19. The collaboration between Cochrane Rehabilitation and the WHO Rehabilitation Programme in establishing the CRRF brought together perspectives from the health systems, health management, and clinical evidence. The authors encourage researchers to use the CRRF when planning studies on rehabilitation in the context of COVID-19.","Negrini, Stefano; Mills, Jody-Anne; Arienti, Chiara; Kiekens, Carlotte; Cieza, Alarcos",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,445,29

It is structurally constituted of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and ß-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine where acetyl groups are randomly distributed across the polymer. The parameters of deacetylation and depolymerization process greatly influence various physico-chemical properties of chitosan and thus, offer a great degree of manipulation to synthesize chitosan of interest for various industrial and biomedical applications. Chitosan and its various derivatives have been a potential molecule of investigation in the area of anti-microbials especially anti-fungal, anti-bacterial and antiviral. The current review predominantly highlights and discusses about the antiviral activities of chitosan and its various substituted derivatives against a wide spectrum of human, animal, plants and bacteriophage viruses. The extrinsic and intrinsic factors that affect antiviral efficacy of chitosan have also been talked about. With the rapid unfolding of COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, we look for chitosan as a plausible potent antiviral molecule for fighting this disease. Through this review, we present enough literature data supporting role of chitosan against different strains of SARS viruses and also chitosan targeting CD147 receptors, a novel route for invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells.

The objective of this study is to assess the anxiety, depression levels, and psychological resilience of physicians working during the Covid-19 outbreak and to evaluate the related factors that are associated with their psychological resilience. METHODS: The sample of this descriptive study was composed of medical doctors and dentists. The data were obtained online between April 13-23, 2020 through a survey prepared by the researchers. In addition, a questionnaire about the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, the Psychological Resilience Scale and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD-A/HAD-D) was given. RESULTS: The average age of the 671 participants was 44.0 ± 9.0 years. Psychological resilience scores were significantly higher in those who had children, who had worked for 15 years or more, and who had received training about COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Depression scores were higher among women and in those who reported having a chronic disease, whose workload increased after the outbreak, and who had physical contact with COVID-positive patients. The anxiety scores were also higher among women and in those whose workload had increased and who had contact with COVID-positive patients (p < 0.05). The physicians with scores below the cutoff point on the HAD-D/HAD-A had significantly higher scores on the Psychological Resilience Scale (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Depression and anxiety levels were found to be significantly lower in physicians with greater psychological resilience. Psychological and social support of all health-care workers, especially physicians, is important in the struggle with the pandemic. It is thought that determining the variables related to psychological resilience in health-care workers will be a guide for psychosocial services.","Arslan, Hatice Nilden; Karabekiroglu, Aytul; Terzi, Ozlem; Dundar, Cihad",Postgrad Med,445,24

Inter-OSCTC sharing of successful protocols and systems has been hampered by evolving resource constraints, the changing science of testing, and ever increasing COVID-19 case counts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify promising approaches to testing vulnerable populations. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 26 leaders of OSCTCs and public health departments across the United States between June 8th and August 10th, 2020. All interviews were coded utilizing oral coding via rapid identification of themes from audio recordings, and analysis occurred concurrently with data collection to assess when saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Six main themes emerged highlighting approaches to testing within vulnerable populations including: 1. Expanding services to support health and health-related needs beyond COVID-19; 2. Gaining community trust; 3. Developing and leveraging community partnerships; 4. Promoting clear and creative messaging; 5. Prioritizing patient experience; and 6. Managing patient results. CONCLUSIONS: Testing among the vulnerable not only helps those at highest risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19, but also presents a critical opportunity to control viral spread within and from these communities. Reaching vulnerable populations is challenging and requires multi-sector collaboration, additional funding, and high levels of creativity and flexibility.","Winterbauer, Elizabeth; Levy, Phillip D; Calhoun, Dustin; Elwell, Timothy; Fishbein, Eliza; Donohue, Stacy; Little, Jessica",Healthc (Amst),445,1

Today, the mask has become a semi-permanent accessory to the face, blocking our ability to express and perceive each other's facial expressions by dividing it into a visible top-half and invisible bottom-half. This significantly restricts our ability to accurately interpret emotions based on facial expressions and strengthens our perceptions of negative emotions produced by frowning. The addition of botulinum toxin (BTX) induced facial muscle paralysis to target the muscles of the top (visible) half of the face, especially the corrugator and procerus muscles, may act as a therapeutic solution by its suppression of glabellar lines and our ability to frown. The treatment of the glabella complex not only has been shown to inhibit the negative emotions of the treated individual but also can reduce the negative in those who come in contact with the treated individual. Mask-wearing in the wake of COVID-19 brings new challenges to our ability to communicate and perceive emotion through full facial expression, our most effective and universally-shared form of communication, and BTX may offer a positive solution to decrease negative emotions and promote well-being for both the mask wearer as well as all who come in contact with that individual.","Nestor, Mark S; Fischer, Daniel; Arnold, David",,445,13

Methods: This quasi-experimental study collected a pooled data from a randomized-control study between February and May 2020 in which 114 participants who presented type 2 diabetes were recruited. The intervention group had health coaching and usual care, whereas the control had usual care only. The main outcome variables of this observation study were the change of HbA1c, physical activity, and eating out behavior within this time interval. Results: We found that the eating out behavior of both groups had decreased, and if a health coach helped the patients set physical activity goals in the two groups, the physical activity behavior will not be impacted due to the pandemic. Conclusions: While every country is focusing on COVID-19 pandemic prevention, especially when strict home quarantine measures and social distancing are adopted, reminding and assisting chronic patients to maintain good self-management behavior may lessen the social and medical system burdens caused by the deterioration of chronic conditions due to the excessive risk prevention behavior and the epidemic prevention work.

We looked at the issues spanning clinical, ethical and logistics domains; identifying areas of benefit as well as drawbacks, some specific to the rushed implementation because of COVID-19's infective risks and the 'rules' of lockdown, but many are generic areas to help guide longer term service design.

However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, People's Liberation Army, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (sixth edition) guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and the serum viral load and interleukin 6 (IL-6) level were determined. RESULTS: Analysis of clinical characteristics of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the level of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAemia (R = 0.902). CONCLUSIONS: Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RNAemia) in patients with COVID-19 was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis. Because elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm that could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.","Chen, Xiaohua; Zhao, Binghong; Qu, Yueming; Chen, Yurou; Xiong, Jie; Feng, Yong; Men, Dong; Huang, Qianchuan; Liu, Ying; Yang, Bo; Ding, Jinya; Li, Feng",Clin Infect Dis,445,19

This study presented a conceptual model based on the theory of planned behaviour that examines university students’ beliefs and their intention to opt for augmented reality app subject to e-learning of coursework. Structural equation modelling was applied to analyse data from 133 university students in Pakistan. The study findings indicated that the theory of planned behaviour explained university students’ acceptance of e-learning through augmented reality apps, where attitude and behavioural control significantly influenced their intention to adopt augmented reality apps for e-learning;hence, subjective norm showed insignificant results.

OBJECTIVE: We implemented a strategy to reduce nosocomial acquisition. METHODS: We summarized our experience in implementing a multipronged infection control strategy in the first 300 days (December 31, 2019, to October 25, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic under the governance of Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. RESULTS: Of 5,296 COVID-19 patients, 4,808 (90.8%) were diagnosed in the first pandemic wave (142 cases), second wave (896 cases), and third wave (3,770 cases) in Hong Kong. With the exception of 1 patient who died before admission, all COVID-19 patients were admitted to the public healthcare system for a total of 78,834 COVID-19 patient days. The median length of stay was 13 days (range, 1-128). Of 81,955 HCWs, 38 HCWs (0.05%; 2 doctors and 11 nurses and 25 nonprofessional staff) acquired COVID-19. With the exception of 5 of 38 HCWs (13.2%) infected by HCW-to-HCW transmission in the nonclinical settings, no HCW had documented transmission from COVID-19 patients in the hospitals. The incidence of COVID-19 among HCWs was significantly lower than that of our general population (0.46 per 1,000 HCWs vs 0.71 per 1,000 population; P = .008). The incidence of COVID-19 among professional staff was significantly lower than that of nonprofessional staff (0.30 vs 0.66 per 1,000 full-time equivalent; P = .022).

Yet the function of FliI6-FliJ complex, a homolog of the F1 ATPase motor, within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear. We use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors to identify key features of this motor. The two states are the 'locked' ground state where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences angular fluctuations in an asymmetric torsional potential, and a 'free' excited state in which FliJ undergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat transitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity of the unloaded FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: &#969;max &#8776; 9.0 rps. The motor was then studied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its maximal power output: Pmax &#8776; 42 kBT/s (or 102 kW/mol), and the stall torque: Gstall &#8776; 3 kBT/rad (or 0.01 nN·nm/rad). Two modes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which the motor performs useful work either by continuously 'grinding' through the resistive environment of the export gate, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In both cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the flagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that the function of the FliI6-FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier, and therefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them into the transport channel.","Kucera, Jiri; Terentjev, Eugene M",Sci Rep,445,20

METHODS: A total of 403 adults participated in the study. The material consisted of 32 vignettes (scenarios) describing realistic health problem situations in which an individual was proposed to use a tele-consultation public health service, varying as a function of five factors: consultation category, health problem category, health problem severity, physician category, and the consultation price. For each health problem situation presented in the vignettes, the participants were asked to rate their willingness to use the proposed tele-consultation service on an 11-point scale. A cluster analysis using the K-means procedure was applied to the quantitative raw data to capture the participants' different perspectives. ANOVA, x2 and t-test analyses were also conducted to examine the effects of the different health problem situations and the sociodemographic characteristics on the participant ratings. RESULTS: Five different perspectives (clusters) were found: never-willing (15% of the sample), severity (26%), consultation-category (22%), undecided (16%), and price-severity (21%). These perspectives were associated with participants' sociodemographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: According to the main results, it seems that the majority of the participants (69%) were highly willing to use tele-consultation public health services in the case of mild illness, cheaper prices and follow-up consultation. In addition, the participants' willingness was significantly affected by some of the participants' sociodemographic characteristics.","Vera Cruz, Germano; Dlamini, Priscilla S",BMC Public Health,445,16

However, when and how serology detection performs the best remains unknown. This article aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serologic methods for COVID-19 based on assay design and post-symptom-onset intervals. Two authors independently searched PubMed, Cochrane library, Ovid, EBSCO for case-control, longitudinal and cohort studies that determined the diagnostic accuracy of serology tests in comparison with NAATs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 cases and used QUADAS-2 for quality assessment. Pooled accuracy was analyzed using INLA method. A total of 27 studies were included in this meta-analysis, with 4 cohort, 16 case-control and 7 longitudinal studies and 4,565 participants. The overall sensitivity of IgG, IgM, and total antibody(TAB) was 0.76(95%CI 0.65-0.86), 0.69(95%CI 0.59-0.78), 0.78(95%CI 0.70-0.85).

Consequently, a large volume of false textual information has been disseminating for a long time since the prevalence of social media. The potential negative influence of misinformation on the public is a growing concern. Therefore, it is strongly motivated to detect online misinformation as early as possible. Few-shot-few-clue learning applies in this misinformation detection task when the number of annotated statements is quite few (called few shots) and the corresponding evidence is also quite limited in each shot (called few clues). Within the few-shot-few-clue framework, we propose a Bayesian meta-learning algorithm to extract the shared patterns among different topics (i.e.different tasks) of misinformation. Moreover, we derive a scalable method, i.e., amortized variational inference, to optimize the Bayesian meta-learning algorithm. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm. This work focuses more on optimizing parameters than designing detection models, and will generate fresh insights into data-efficient detection of online misinformation at early stages.","Zhang, Qiang; Huang, Hongbin; Liang, Shangsong; Meng, Zaiqiao; Yilmaz, Emine",,445,16

Patients admitted to Merkezefendi State Hospital because of COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by RNA detection of virus by using polymerase chain reaction between March 24, 2020 and July 6, 2020, were screened retrospectively. The CHA2DS2-VASc and modified CHA2DS2-VASc score of all patients was calculated. Also, we received all patients' complete biochemical markers including D-dimer, Troponin I, and c-reactive protein on admission. We enrolled 1000 patients; 791 were admitted to the general medical service and 209 to the ICU; 82 of these 209 patients died. The ROC curves of the CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores were analyzed. The cut-off values of these scores for predicting mortality were &#8805; 3 (2 or under and 3). The CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores had an area under the curve value of 0.89 on the ROC. The sensitivity and specificity of the CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 81.7% and 83.8%, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity of the M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 85.3% and 84.1%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CHA2DS2-VASc, Troponin I, D-Dimer, and CRP were independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Using a simple and easily available scoring system, CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores can be assessed in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. These scores can predict mortality and the need for ICU hospitalization in these patients.","Gunduz, Ramazan; Yildiz, Bekir Serhat; Ozdemir, Ibrahim Halil; Cetin, Nurullah; Ozen, Mehmet Burak; Bakir, Eren Ozan; Ozgur, Su; Bayturan, Ozgur",J. thromb. thrombolysis,445,16

The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and local health department staff members investigated a COVID-19 outbreak associated with this opening event. Overall, 46 COVID-19 cases were linked to the event, including cases in 26 patrons and three staff members who attended the opening event and 17 secondary cases. Four persons with cases had COVID-19-like symptoms on the same day they attended the event. Secondary cases included 12 cases in eight households with children, two on a school sports team, and three in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Transmission associated with the opening event resulted in one school closure affecting 650 children (9,100 lost person-days of school) and hospitalization of one LTCF resident with COVID-19. These findings demonstrate that opening up settings such as bars, where mask wearing and physical distancing are challenging, can increase the risk for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. As community businesses begin to reopen, a multicomponent approach should be emphasized in settings such as bars to prevent transmission* (1).

Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root or cubic root cusp singularities, our work complements previous results on the bulk and edge universality and it thus completes the resolution of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture for the last remaining universality type in the complex Hermitian class. Our analysis holds not only for exact cusps, but approximate cusps as well, where an extended Pearcey process emerges. As a main technical ingredient we prove an optimal local law at the cusp for both symmetry classes. This result is also the key input in the companion paper (Cipolloni et al. in Pure Appl Anal, 2018. arXiv:1811.04055) where the cusp universality for real symmetric Wigner-type matrices is proven.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and its phenotypic characteristics among lung transplantation (LTx) candidates comparing GLIM to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of all adult patients assessed for LTx in a one-year period. Phenotypic criteria included body mass index (BMI), unintentional loss of weight (LOW) over a 12-month period and fat-free mass index (FFMI) using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Systemic inflammation associated with severe end-stage lung disease met GLIM's etiological criterion. Diagnosis of malnutrition, and its severity, were classified according to each of GLIM and ICD-10. RESULTS: Of 130 patients, 112 (86%) had all data to classify malnutrition. Malnutrition prevalence according to GLIM was 59%, which was markedly greater than using ICD-10 criteria (26%). Half of the LTx patients were moderately malnourished using GLIM, compared to 19% using ICD-10. A similar proportion were severely malnourished using GLIM (9%) and ICD-10 (7%). Fat-free mass (FFM) depletion (47% of all patients) was a major contributor to GLIM-malnutrition. Over 60% of LTx patients with GLIM-malnutrition were not detected as malnourished using ICD-10 criteria. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition diagnosis using GLIM was higher than using ICD-10 in LTx patients, primarily attributable to the incorporation of quantitative evaluation of FFM depletion. This highlights the utility of the GLIM framework and the importance of including body composition in malnutrition assessment.","Emsley, Christie; King, Susannah; Nyulasi, Ibolya; Snell, Gregory",Clin Nutr,445,15

The study group consisted of 587 secondary school students receiving education in 24 schools located in different regions of Turkey. The form consisting of five open-ended questions used as the data collection tool was developed by the researchers. The descriptive content analysis method was used to analyse the data obtained. In the first question, in which the opinions of students about experiment practices in science lesson were investigated during the distance education process, the answers included in the theme of positive opinion were encountered the most. The greatest difficulty faced by students in conducting experiments in distance education was found to be related to the physical conditions they had. Among the expectations of the students, the most common response was related to increasing experimental practices in distance education. The students stated that they found conducting experiments face to face to be more effective and advantageous compared to conducting experiments in distance education. They also made various suggestions regarding the features of the experimental practices. In line with the results of this study, since it was determined that students found it more effective to do face-to-face experiments, it is thought that it would be appropriate to include experimental practices more, especially in lessons conducted face-to-face, at least in the classrooms where hybrid education is applied.","Bostan Sarioglan, Ayberk Sen Rabia Altas Rukiye",Journal of Educational Technology and Online Learning,445,1

This review intends to summarize the current knowledge and practices to protect ICU personnel during the patient management process in the context of the current pandemic. Recent Findings: The transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly respiratory droplets, aerosols, and contact. The virus can last for a few hours suspended in the air and be viable on surfaces for several days. Some procedures carried out in the ICU can generate aerosols. The shortage of respirators, such as the N95, has generated an increase in the demand for other protective equipment in critical care settings. Summary: The probability of transmission depends on the characteristics of the pathogen, the availability of quality personal protective equipment, and the human factors associated with the performance of health workers. It is necessary to have knowledge of the virus and availability of the best possible personal protection equipment, develop skills for handling equipment, and develop non-technical skills during all intensive care process; this can be achieved through structured training.","Díaz-Guio, Diego Andrés; Díaz-Guio, Yimmy; Pinzón-Rodas, Valentina; Díaz-Gomez, Ana Sofía; Guarín-Medina, Jorge Andrés; Chaparro-Zúñiga, Yesid; Ricardo-Zapata, Alejandra; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Curr Trop Med Rep,445,16

For this reason, we evaluated rapid testing on the Biocartis Idylla&#8482; platform (Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium) for four important genes commonly mutated in lung and colorectal cancers, namely EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, and BRAF. Clinical specimens from which the mutation status has previously been determined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), were retested to determine whether Idylla&#8482; can offer accurate results. To compare the results, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) are calculated for each of the mutation types and then combined to determine the values of the Idylla&#8482; system in total, while setting NGS as the gold-standard basis the assays were compared with. Idylla testing thereby displayed acceptable sensitivity and specificity and delivered reliable results for initial therapy decisions.","Haiduk, Tiffany; Brockmann, Michael; Tillmann, Ramona-Liza; Pieper, Monika; Lüsebrink, Jessica; Schildgen, Verena; Schildgen, Oliver",Exp Mol Pathol,445,24

Countries like India, Bangladesh, and other developing countries are still having a slow pace in the detection of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast detection with clear visualization of infection is required using which a suspected patient of COVID-19 could be saved. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast detection and clear visualization of infection is required. In the recent technological advancements, the fusion of deep learning classifiers and medical images provides more promising results corresponding to traditional RT-PCR testing while making detection and predictions about COVID-19 cases with increased accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed a deep transfer learning algorithm that accelerates the detection of COVID-19 cases by using X-ray and CT-Scan images of the chest. It is because, in COVID-19, initial screening of chest X-ray (CXR) may provide significant information in the detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. We have considered three datasets known as 1) COVID-chest X-ray, 2) SARS-COV-2 CT-scan, and 3) Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). In the obtained results, the proposed deep learning model can detect the COVID-19 positive cases in â¯&#8804;â¯ 2 seconds which is faster than RT-PCR tests currently being used for detection of COVID-19 cases. We have also established a relationship between COVID-19 patients along with the Pneumonia patients which explores the pattern between Pneumonia and COVID-19 radiology images. In all the experiments, we have used the Grad-CAM based color visualization approach in order to clearly interpretate the detection of radiology images and taking further course of action.","Panwar, Harsh; Gupta, P K; Siddiqui, Mohammad Khubeb; Morales-Menendez, Ruben; Bhardwaj, Prakhar; Singh, Vaishnavi",Chaos Solitons Fractals,445,21

In this study, we measured the perceived stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among Iranians to determine the groups at both extremes of the spectrum followed by identifying the stressors and coping mechanisms. METHODS: This study was a mixed-methods study. We distributed a web-based 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10), to measure perceived stress score (PSS), through social networks from March 12 to 23, 2020. Then, we interviewed 42 students, 31 homemakers, 27 healthcare providers, and 21 male participants to identify the sources of stress and coping mechanisms. RESULTS: Finally, 13,454 participants completed the questionnaires. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the participants' PSS was 21 (15-25). Students, homemakers, and healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a higher median (IQR) of PSS compared to other groups (23 [18 to 27], 22 [16 to 26], and 19 [14 to 24], respectively). Male participants showed a lower median (IQR) PSS (17 [12 to 23]). Content analysis of 121 participants' answers showed that the most common stressors were school-related issues mentioned by students, family-related issues mentioned by homemakers, and COVID-19-related issues mentioned by healthcare providers. Male participants' coping mechanisms were mostly related to the perception of their abilities to cope with the current crisis. CONCLUSION: Our participants clinically showed a moderate level of PSS. The main stressors among students, homemakers, and HCWs were related to their principal role in this period, and male participants' coping mechanisms were inspired by the self-image retrieved from the social perspectives.","Faghankhani, Masoomeh; Sodagari, Faezeh; Shokrani, Marjan; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Adabi, Alimohammad; Zabihi, Masoud; Adeli, Aliyeh Mahdavi; Fathimakvand, Mahdi; Golalipour, Elahe; Aghdasi, Sina; Javanbakht, Arash; Nadoushan, Amir Hossein Jalali",Can J Psychiatry,445,25

Hypoglycemia in the elderly is both under-recognized and misdiagnosed due to nonspesific hypoglycemic symptoms and accompanying comorbidities in this population. In diabetic individuals, hypoglycemia is most commonly caused by administering insulin or sulphonylureas and insulin secretagogues. Other drugs, such as antibiotics or beta-blockers, have been reported to reduce blood glucose to abnormally low levels. Hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients is considered a rare event, and the possible reasons may be reactive hypoglycemia, insulin-secreting tumours and other malignancies, hypopituitarism, hypocortisolism, alcohol abuse, inappropriate insulin self-administration, malnutrition, renal failure and sepsis. Case: An 86- year- old male was admitted to the emergency department with hypoglycemia diagnosed with non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) on lung secreting insulin. No surgical intervention or chemotherapy was planned due to patients age and comorbidities so best supportive care was planned. We used prednisone for symptomatic treatment of hypoglycemia and the patient has been followed up periodically. In this period he had no hypoglycemic attack. Conclusion: For patients with hypoglycemia who are unable/decline to receive any further treatment, low dose glucocorticoid is a good choice to achieve normoglycemia. It seems to be more cost effective compared to other treatment options. Furthermore hospitalisation rates may decrease due to decreased hypogylcemic attacks.","Eren, Merve; Bostan, Feyzi",Afr Health Sci,445,1

Emotional and social support are essential to help people to get through personal crises such as bereavement. In this study we characterize the social support owners obtain from their dogs, provide evidence of how widespread this social support is amongst dog-owners, and show how social support from dogs can increase during a crisis (using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example). We collected data from a representative population-based sample of Spanish dog-owners and found that most respondents said that their dogs helped them to get through tough times. They got comfort from physical contact with their dogs, shared activities with them and treated them as confidants in a similar way to friends and family. These are all key aspects of social support, and dogs offer the advantage of being more available than human sources of support. It would be expected that the support that dogs provide would be increased during a time of personal crisis and when we looked at data collected from a convenience sample of Spanish dog-owners during the COVID-19 confinement that is what we found;during the confinement owners engaged in more shared activities with their dogs, hugged them more often and turned to them more as a source of companionship and comfort (p &lt; 0.0001 in all cases). However, although owners did confide more in their dogs (p &lt; 0.0001), the effect was not as great as for other aspects of social support. We suspect that this is because people were able to use telecommunications such as video conferencing to maintain their human confidant relationships. Our findings indicate that dogs can substitute for humans as sources of some kinds of social support when conventional sources are unavailable. Our conclusion is that where a dog is present in a household, it should be regarded as an important resource for social support. This should be considered when designing clinical interventions and when public health decisions are being made.","Bowen, J.; Bulbena, A.; Fatjo, J.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,445,16

In this context, timely insulinization to achieve optimal glycemic control assumes major significance. However, given the challenges associated with the pandemic like restrictions of movement and access to healthcare resources, a simple and easy way to initiate and optimize insulin therapy in people with uncontrolled diabetes is required. With this premise, a group of clinical experts comprising diabetologists and endocrinologists from India discussed the challenges and potential solutions for insulin initiation, titration, and optimization in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during the COVID-19 pandemic and how basal insulin can be a good option in this situation owing to its unique set of advantages like lower risk of hypoglycemia, ease of training, need for less monitoring, better adherence, flexibility of using oral antidiabetic drugs, and improved quality of life compared to other insulin regimens. The panel agreed that the existing challenges should not be a reason to delay insulin initiation in people with uncontrolled T2DM and provided recommendations, which included potential solutions for initiating insulin in the absence or restriction of in-person consultations; the dose of insulin at initiation; the type of insulin preferred for simplified regimen and best practices for optimal titration to achieve glycemic targets during the pandemic. Practical and easily implementable tips for patients and involvement of stakeholders (caregivers and healthcare providers) to facilitate insulin acceptance were also outlined by the expert panel.

METHODS: We estimated per-day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients. We used a bottom-up approach to estimate full economic costs and adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from data provided by three public COVID-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya and augmented this with guidelines. We obtained input prices from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and from market prices for Kenya. RESULTS: Per-day, per-patient unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease under home-based care are 1993.01 Kenyan shilling (KES) (US$18.89) and 1995.17 KES (US$18.991), respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation centre or hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease are 6717.74 KES (US$63.68) and 6719.90 KES (US$63.70), respectively. Per-day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19 disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in intensive care units are 13 137.07 KES (US$124.53) and 63 243.11 KES (US$599.51). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 case management costs are substantial, ranging between two and four times the average claims value reported by Kenya's public health insurer.

Results: A total of 902 spine surgeons from seven global regions completed the survey. Respondents reported a mean level of overall concern of 3.7 on a scale of one to five. 84.0% reported a decrease in clinical duties, and 67.0% reported a loss in personal income. The 82.5% reported being interested in continuing a high level of online education moving forward. Respondents who personally knew someone who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to be unwilling to attend a medical conference 1 year from now (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: [0.39, 0.95], P =.029). The 20.0% reported they plan to pursue an increased degree of nonoperative measures prior to surgery 1 year from now, and respondents with a spouse at home (OR: 3.55, 95% CI: [1.14, 11.08], P =.029) or who spend a large percentage of their time teaching (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: [1.02, 2.07], P =.040) were more likely to adopt this practice. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on surgeon teaching, clinical volume, and personal income. In the future, surgeons with family and those personally affected by COVID-19 may be more willing to alter surgical indications and change education and conference plans. Anticipating these changes may help the spine community appropriately plan for future challenges.","Nolte, Michael T.; Harada, Garrett K.; Louie, Philip K.; McCarthy, Michael H.; Sayari, Arash J.; Mallow, G.

Recorded sensitivity and specificity of the NADAL and the LumiraDx antigen assays and the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA assay were 0.1429 (0.0194, 0.5835), 0.7644 (0.7016, 0.8174), and 0.7157 (0, 1) as well as 0.4545 (0.2022, 0.7326), 0.9954 (0.9817, 0.9988), and 0.9997 (not estimable), respectively. Agreement kappa between the positive results of the two antigen-based assays was 0.060 (0.002, 0.167) and 0.659 (0.492, 0.825) for TMA and real-time PCR. Samples with low viral load as indicated by cycle threshold (Ct) values &gt; 30 were generally missed by both antigen assays, while 1:10 pooling suggested higher sensitivity of TMA compared to real-time PCR. In conclusion, both sensitivity and specificity speak in favor of the use of the LumiraDx rather than the NADAL antigen assay, while TMA results are comparably as accurate as PCR, when applied in a low prevalence setting.","Dierks, S.; Bader, O.; Schwanbeck, J.; Groß, U.; Weig, M.

Following the patterns of other coronaviruses (CoVs), particularly those infecting the respiratory tract, neurological manifestations have been reported in patients with Covid-19. Such manifestations highlight the neurovirulence of this severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2. In order to collect all available information on the implications and mechanisms of infections by respiratory CoVs, a systematic review was designed following the PRISMA protocol. The following PICO strategy (patient, problem, or population; intervention; comparison, control, or comparator; outcomes) was adopted: P included healthy individuals, patients, and animal models susceptible to human-specific viruses; I included molecular, cell culture, and comparative experimental studies; C included healthy, diseased, and immunized conditions; and O represented the virulence and pathogenicity of respiratory CoVs and their effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Searches were conducted in PubMed databases from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Results indicate the involvement of the CNS in infections with various CoVs. Infection typically begins in the airway epithelia with subsequent alveolar involvement, and the virus then spreads to the CNS via neuronal contacts with the recruitment of axonal transport. Neuronal infection and regulated cell death are the main factors causing a generalized encephalitis.","de Assis, Gilmara Gomes; Murawska-Cialowicz, Eugenia; Cieszczyk, Pawel; Gasanov, Eugene V.",Front.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. Methods: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets;supervised learning;and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models’ performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. Results: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model. Conclusions: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy≥89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing.","Íris Viana dos Santos, Santana Andressa C.

This viral infection (COVID-19) is not the only cause of deaths in this pandemic. A usual complication of viral infections is a secondary superimposed bacterial infection or a superinfection. Based on limited published data, the relatively high incidence of severe infection and mortality in COVID-19 patients is attributed to these infections. It is reasonable to anticipate that nearly half of the patients who have died from COVID-19 had superinfection. Patients who have severe form of the disease and those requiring prolonged stay in intensive care units (ICUs) are more prone to developing super added infection by nosocomial pathogens. The most common type of infection observed among COVID-19 patients is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), followed by bacteremia with sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to keep these infections at bay which is promoting antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In developing countries like India, where there is well-established high burden of multidrug-resistant organisms in hospital settings, superinfections in COVID-19 patients can pose a biggest challenge in the treatment leading to increase mortality. There is a need of prospective studies, which should include clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological data on superinfections that can be used in forming effective antimicrobial stewardship strategies;which can have a crucial role in optimal antimicrobial prescribing.","Nag, V.

Necessary preventive precautions for the transmission of COVID-19 has resulted in delays for in-person health care services, especially at the outset of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Among a US sample, we examined the rates of delays (defined as cancellations and postponements) in health care at the outset of the pandemic and characterized the reasons for such delays. METHODS: As part of an internet-based survey that was distributed on social media in April 2020, we asked a US-based convenience sample of 2570 participants about delays in their health care resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Participant demographics and self-reported worries about general health and the COVID-19 pandemic were explored as potent determinants of health care delays. In addition to all delays, we focused on the following three main types of delays, which were the primary outcomes in this study: dental, preventive, and diagnostic care delays. For each outcome, we used bivariate statistical tests (t tests and chi-square tests) and multiple logistic regression models to determine which factors were associated with health care delays. RESULTS: The top reported barrier to receiving health care was the fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection (126/374, 33.6%). Almost half (1227/2570, 47.7%) of the participants reported experiencing health care delays. Among those who experienced health care delays and further clarified the type of delay they experienced (921/1227, 75.1%), the top three reported types of care that were affected by delays included dental (351/921, 38.1%), preventive (269/921, 29.2%), and diagnostic (151/921, 16.4%) care. The logistic regression models showed that age (P<.001), gender identity (P<.001), education (P=.007), and self-reported worry about general health (P<.001) were significantly associated with experiencing health care delays. Self-reported worry about general health was negatively related to experiencing delays in dental care. However, this predictor was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing based on the logistic regression model. Additionally, age was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing. No factors remained significant in the multiple logistic regression for delays in preventive care, and although there was trend between race and delays (people of color experienced fewer delays than White participants), it was not significant (P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: The lessons learned from the initial surge of COVID-19 cases can inform systemic mitigation strategies for potential future disruptions. This study addresses the demand side of health care delays by exploring the determinants of such delays. More research on health care delays during the pandemic is needed, including research on their short- and long-term impacts on patient-level outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, mental health, people's quality of life, and the experience of pain.","Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Rice, Dylan R; Ghoneima, Hana; McKowen, Anna Laura W; Anderson, Nicholas; Wootton, Angie R; Veldhuis, Cindy",J Med Internet Res,445,19

In fact, traditional or herbal medicine have a big influence on people's decisions about their health. Materials and Methods: This report describes the community belief in herbal medicine that provides immunity to COVID-19 infection. Results: In the early pandemic, there were so many false and misinformation about herbal that can cure COVID-19. They use mainly herbs and spices, eucalyptus oil, arak Bali as the alternative of COVID-19 remedies. People's interest in using herbal also shown in the market influx of these things. In a condition where demand is higher than supply, the market ran out of stocks and the prices also sharply increased. Continuous research that uses herbal medicine as an alternative approach to COVID-19 treatment are still ongoing. Nevertheless, as of now, there is no concrete scientific evidence to support the use of traditional medicine in the treatment and management of COVID-19. Conclusion: These facts reflect that COVID-19 vaccine will face challenges in community.

Chest X-Rays for COVID cases tend to show changes in the lungs such as ground glass opacities and peripheral consolidations which can be detected by deep neural networks. However, traditional convolutional networks use point estimate for predictions, lacking in capture of uncertainty, which makes them less reliable for adoption. There have been several works so far in predicting COVID positive cases with chest X-Rays. However, not much has been explored on quantifying the uncertainty of these predictions, interpreting uncertainty, and decomposing this to model or data uncertainty. To address these needs, we develop a visualization framework to address interpretability of uncertainty and its components, with uncertainty in predictions computed with a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network. This framework aims to understand the contribution of individual features in the Chest-X-Ray images to predictive uncertainty. Providing this as an assistive tool can help the radiologist understand why the model came up with a prediction and whether the regions of interest captured by the model for the specific prediction are of significance in diagnosis. We demonstrate the usefulness of the tool in chest x-ray interpretation through several test cases from a benchmark dataset.","Murugamoorthy, Gayathiri; Khan, Naimul",,445,16

They involve auxiliary variables, such that their energy minimisation splits into multiple fractional steps that can be solved easier and more efficiently. In our paper we show that coupling models offer a number of interesting properties that go far beyond their obvious numerical benefits. We demonstrate that discontinuity-preserving denoising can be achieved even with quadratic data and smoothness terms, provided that the coupling term involves the $L^1$ norm. We show that such an $L^1$ coupling term provides additional information as a powerful edge detector that has remained unexplored so far. While coupling models in the literature approximate higher order regularisation, we argue that already first order coupling models can be useful. As a specific example, we present a first order coupling model that outperforms classical TV regularisation. It also establishes a theoretical connection between TV regularisation and the Mumford-Shah segmentation approach. Unlike other Mumford-Shah algorithms, it is a strictly convex approximation, for which we can guarantee convergence of a split Bregman algorithm.","Wewior, Aaron; Weickert, Joachim",,445,21

Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2. We verified the ability of the dehumidifier to rapidly collect aerosolized sodium chloride. Our results point to a facile pool testing method to sample air in any location in the world and assess the presence and concentration of an infectious agent to obtain quantitative risk assessment of exposure, designate zones as ""hot spots"" and minimize the need for individual testing which may often be time consuming, expensive, and laborious.","Moitra, Parikshit; Alafeef, Maha; Dighe, Ketan; Ray, Priyanka; Chang, James; Thole, Aaron; Punshon-Smith, Benjamin; Tolosa, Michael; Ramamurthy, Sai Sathish; Ge, Xudong; Frey, Douglas D; Pan, Dipanjan; Rao, Govind",Biotechnol. bioeng,445,26

Models have been valuable tools during the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks, able to generate possible trajectories of disease burden, evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies, and estimate key transmission variables. Particularly given the rapid pace of model development, evaluation, and integration with decision making in emergency situations, it is necessary to understand the benefits and pitfalls of transmission models. We review and highlight key aspects of the history of infectious disease dynamic models, the role of rigorous testing and evaluation, the integration with data, and the successful application of models to guide public health.

D-serine is the main endogeneous co-agonist of NMDA receptors, and its availability significantly depends on the activity of the metabolic enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO). Inhibition of DAAO increases the brain levels of D-serine, and modulates a variety of physiological functions including cognitive behavior. METHODS: Here, we examined the effects of a novel 4­hydroxypyridazin-3(2H)­one derivative DAAO inhibitor, Compound 30 (CPD30) on passive avoidance learning and on neuronal firing activity in rats. RESULTS: D-serine administration was applied as reference, which increased cognitive performance and enhanced hippocampal firing activity and responsiveness to NMDA after both local and systemic application. Similarly to D-serine, CPD30 (0.1 mg/kg) effectively reversed MK-801 induced memory impairment in the passive avoidance test. Furthermore, local iontophoretic application of CPD30 in the vicinity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons significantly increased firing rate, and enhanced their responses to locally applied NMDA. Compound 30 also enhanced hippocampal firing activity after systemic administration. In 0.1-1.0 mg/kg doses, CPD30 increased spontaneous and NMDA-evoked firing activity of the neurons. Effects of CPD30 on NMDA-responsiveness emerged faster (at 10 min post-injection) when 1.0 mg/kg dose was applied compared to the onset of the effects of 0.1 mg/kg CPD30 (at 30 min post-injection). CONCLUSIONS: The present results confirm that the inhibition of DAAO enzyme is an effective strategy for cognitive enhancement. Our findings further facilitate the understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of DAAO inhibition in the mammalian brain.","Nagy, Lili Veronika; Bali, Zsolt Kristóf; Kapus, Gábor; Pelsoczi, Péter; Farkas, Bence; Lendvai, Balázs; Lévay, György; Hernádi, István",Int. j. neuropsychopharmacol,445,22

The understanding of the association might be helpful in early vigilant monitoring and better management of COVID-19 patients at high risk. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the association of diabetes and hypertension with severity of disease. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed and Cochrane until March 31, 2020. Seven studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 2018 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Diabetes was lower in the survivors (OR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.35-0.90; p = 0.017; I2: 0.0%) and non-severe (OR: 1.66; 95%CI: 1.20-2.30; p = 0.002; I2: 0.0%) patients.

In order to understand how the urban poor mitigate their risk of infection, we conducted a survey with more than 1,400 poor households in two of the African cities with the most COVID-19 infections, Accra and Greater Johannesburg, early in the pandemic, during lockdowns of public life. We find that many of the urban poor already engage in the appropriate hygienic behavior and follow social distancing rules. However, despite citywide lockdowns, about 25-40% of people still report attending large gatherings, 10-20% report receiving guests at home, and 30-35% report leaving the house more than once per week. Lack of cooperation with governmental regulations seems to be more related to a lack of infrastructure or poverty rather than unwillingness to engage in behavioral change. Interestingly, even with the stricter lockdown in South Africa, people are at least equally likely to deviate from social distancing rules. Our results indicate that more South African respondents perceive their government's actions as too extreme and underestimate COVID-19 cases in their country. About half of the sample in both countries report knowing (mainly through TV) about current COVID-19 case numbers. Most participants know that coughing is a symptom, but only half mention fever and difficulty breathing, and very few people mention tiredness. Ghanaians seem to be somewhat better informed. While lack of information is an issue, misinformation appears to be limited. We conclude that a costly shutdown of public life is only effective-and might even be prevented-with a well-informed population, who perceives their government's actions as appropriate and who has access to the infrastructure required to follow WHO safety regulations.","Kathrin, Durizzo; Edward, Asiedu; der Merwe Antoinette, Van; Niekerk Attie, Van; Isabel, Günther",World Dev,445,14

Thematic analysis was conducted applying constant comparison techniques. People with experience of persisting symptoms contributed to study design and data analysis. RESULTS: This article reports analysis of 24 interviews. The main themes include: the ' hard and heavy work ' of enduring and managing symptoms and accessing care; living with uncertainty, helplessness and fear, particularly over whether recovery is possible; the importance of finding the 'right' GP (understanding, empathy, and support needed); and recovery and rehabilitation: what would help? CONCLUSION: This study will raise awareness among primary care professionals, and commissioners, of long-COVID and the range of symptoms people are experiencing. Patients require their GP to believe their symptoms and to demonstrate empathy and understanding.

This narrative review includes searching the PubMed and Web of Science databases using the keywords ""psoriasis,"" ""psoriatic arthritis,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""SARS-CoV-2."" The search was supplemented by manual searching of reference lists of included articles. A total of 11 relevant original investigations and 6 case studies was identified. The search was updated in May 2019. Due to the absence of randomized controlled trials, it is not likely to have a robust evidence-based approach to psoriasis management in the era of COVID-19. However, the current literature may provide some clues for safety considerations. Conventional immunosuppressive therapies such as methotrexate and cyclosporine, and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents should not be preferred due to increased risk of infection, especially in high-risk areas. The use of cyclosporine may pose additional risk due to the side effect of hypertension, which has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to severe COVID-19. Considering that the current literature has provided no conclusive evidence that biologics increase the risk of COVID-19, withdrawal of these agents should be reserved for patients with COVID-19 symptoms.

While social distancing and isolation has been introduced widely, more moderate contact reduction policies could become desirable owing to adverse social, psychological, and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown. Adopting a novel social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three targeted distancing strategies designed to 'keep the curve flat' and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. We simulate stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models, and statistical relational event models. Our models demonstrate that while social distancing measures clearly do flatten the curve, strategic reduction of contact can strongly increase their efficiency, introducing the possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. Limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts emerges as the most effective strategy.

Social distancing and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks. Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow (indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect of human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical grade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging from 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with medical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus, in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial masks.","Khosronejad, Ali; Santoni, Christian; Flora, Kevin; Zhang, Zexia; Kang, Seokkoo; Payabvash, Seyedmehdi; Sotiropoulos, Fotis",,445,16

Since most respiratory viruses are known to show a seasonal pattern of infection, it has been hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonally dependent as well. The present study looks at a possible effect of atmospheric temperature, which is one of the suspected factors influencing seasonality, on the evolution of the pandemic. Basic procedures: Since confirming a seasonal pattern would take several more months of observation, we conducted an innovative day-to-day micro-correlation analysis of nine outbreak locations, across four continents and both hemispheres, in order to examine a possible relationship between atmospheric temperature (used as a proxy for seasonality) and outbreak progression. Main findings: There was a negative correlation between atmospheric temperature variations and daily new cases growth rates, in all nine outbreaks, with a median lag of 10 days. Principal conclusions: The results presented here suggest that high temperatures might dampen SARS-CoV-2 propagation, while lower temperatures might increase its transmission. Our hypothesis is that this could support a potential effect of atmospheric temperature on coronavirus disease progression, and potentially a seasonal pattern for this virus, with a peak in the cold season and rarer occurrences in the summer. This could guide government policy in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres for the months to come.","Rouen, A; Adda, J; Roy, O; Rogers, E; Lévy, P",Epidemiol Infect,445,26

In this manuscript we have described a few nuances of the technique still not properly described in the literature: the presence of three colors clusters; the correlation of the viral load with the color change; and the importance of using an internal control to avoid false-negative results. METHODS: To achieve these findings, we performed colorimetric RT-LAMP assays of 466 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR validated clinical samples, with color quantification measured at 434 nm and 560 nm. RESULTS: First we determinate a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 90.4%. In addition to the pink (negative) and yellow (positive) produced colors, we report for the first time the presence of an orange color cluster that may lead to wrong diagnosis. We also demonstrated using RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP that low viral loads are related to Ct values > 30, resulting in orange colors. We also demonstrated that the diagnosis of COVID-19 by colorimetric RT-LAMP is efficient until the fifth symptoms day when the viral load is still relatively high. CONCLUSION: This study reports properties and indications for colorimetric RT-LAMP as point-of-care for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, reducing false results, interpretations and optimizing molecular diagnostics tests application.","de Oliveira Coelho, Bruna; Sanchuki, Heloisa Bruna Soligo; Zanette, Dalila Luciola; Nardin, Jeanine Marie; Morales, Hugo Manuel Paz; Fornazari, Bruna; Aoki, Mateus Nóbrega; Blanes, Lucas",Mol Med,445,24

We developed an objective model aiming to standardize this assessment, proposing a methodology that could be adopted in future studies designed to evaluate outcomes in the treatment of hypospadias. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the inter and intra observer reliability of a method to assess the quality of the urethral plate (UP) in hypospadias (POST - Plate Objective Scoring Tool) based on elements of glans characteristics. The reliability of such scoring methodology was compared to an analog accepted tool: the Glans-Urethral Meatus-Shaft (GMS) score. A secondary goal was to compare some characteristics of the UP in GMS score to POST values; aiming to find the threshold between favorable and unfavorable plates. METHODS: Data were prospectively obtained from prepubertal boys who underwent primary hypospadias repair between January 2018 and November 2019. Intrinsic elements of the glanular UP (A: distal midline mucocutaneous junction; B: Glanular knob where the mucosal edges of the UP's edge change direction; C: Glanular/coronal junction) were marked and the AB/BC ratio calculated. The ""G"" and ""M"" components of the GMS score were measured electronically three times by four different reviewers with variable pediatric urology experience and blinded to each other values. Favorable UP, according to the GMS score was compared to measurements obtained by POST (AB/BC ratio). RESULTS: 84 subjects were enrolled. The POST score had an excellent inter-observer agreement for the evaluation of the UP in distal hypospadias (Kappa = 0.832) while the ""G"" parameter of the GMS correlated poorly among the observers. The Inter-Class Correlation (ICC) analysis to examine the intra-rater agreement value was 0.914 (95% CI 0.87, 0.95.). AB/BC ratio values ranged from 0.6 to 1.6, with a mean of 1.12. The POST cut-off value for ""favorable"" UP was 1.2 (AUC = 0.62) 95% CI (0.52-0.84) (sensitivity 80% and specificity 60%). CONCLUSIONS: The POST score has higher inter-observer reliability and functions favorably when compared to the GMS. In addition, it demonstrated a high intra-observer reliability among observers of variable experience. Our findings suggest that the POST score adds to evaluation of the UP and could be incorporated as an additional criterion to assess outcomes in distal hypospadias repairs.","Abbas, Tariq O; Vallasciani, Santiago; Elawad, Abubakr; Elifranji, Mohammed; Leslie, Bruno; Elkadhi, Abderrahman; Pippi Salle, J L",J. pediatr. urol,445,16

A total of 1082 people (mean age 48 (SD 12.2); 82% women) responded to an online survey during autumn 2020 including the ""Life Satisfaction Questionnaire-11"". A majority (69%) were satisfied with life as a whole, and with other important life domains, with the exception of contact with friends and sexual life. An equal share reported that life as a whole had either deteriorated (28%) or improved (29%). Of those that perceived a deterioration, 95% considered it to be due to the pandemic. Regarding deteriorated satisfaction with life as a whole, higher odds were found in the following groups: having no children living at home; being middle aged; having other sources of income than being employed; and having a chronic disease. The Swedish strategy might have contributed to the high proportion of satisfied people.

We aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 with solid tumors. METHODS: We enrolled patients with COVID-19 with solid tumors admitted to 32 hospitals in China between December 17, 2020, and March 18, 2020. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed via stepwise regression analysis, and a nomogram was subsequently developed based on the fitted multivariate logistic regression model. Discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were evaluated by estimating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) for the model and by bootstrap resampling, a Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and visual inspection of the calibration curve. RESULTS: There were 216 patients with COVID-19 with solid tumors included in the present study, of whom 37 (17%) died and the other 179 all recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged. The median age of the enrolled patients was 63.0 years and 113 (52.3%) were men. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that increasing age (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.16), receipt of antitumor treatment within 3 months before COVID-19 (OR=28.65, 95% CI 3.54 to 231.97), peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count &#8805;6.93 ×109/L (OR=14.52, 95% CI 2.45 to 86.14), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR; neutrophil count/(WBC count minus neutrophil count)) &#8805;4.19 (OR=18.99, 95% CI 3.58 to 100.65), and dyspnea on admission (OR=20.38, 95% CI 3.55 to 117.02) were associated with elevated mortality risk. The performance of the established nomogram was satisfactory, with an AUC of 0.953 (95% CI 0.908 to 0.997) for the model, non-significant findings on the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and rough agreement between predicted and observed probabilities as suggested in calibration curves. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 86.4% and 92.5%. CONCLUSION: Increasing age, receipt of antitumor treatment within 3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis, elevated WBC count and dNLR, and having dyspnea on admission were independent risk factors for mortality among patients with COVID-19 and solid tumors. The nomogram based on these factors accurately predicted mortality risk for individual patients.","Liu, Chao; Li, Li; Song, Kehan; Zhan, Zhi-Ying; Yao, Yi; Gong, Hongyun; Chen, Yuan; Wang, Qun; Dong, Xiaorong; Xie, Zhibin; Ou, Chun-Quan; Hu, Qinyong; Song, Qibin",J. immunotherap. cancer,445,21

Further, with dramatic changes in environment and farm management practices, one should also arm ourselves and prepare for emerging and re-emerging animal diseases such as cancer, prion diseases, COVID-19, influenza etc. Aptamer – oligonucleotide or short peptides that can specifically bind to target molecules – have increasingly become popular in developing biosensors for sensitive detection of analytes, pathogens (bacteria, virus, fungus, prions), drug residues, toxins and, cancerous cells. They have also been proven successful in the cellular delivery of drugs and targeted therapy of infectious diseases and physiological disorders. However, the in vivo application of aptamer-mediated biosensing and therapy in animals has been limited. This paper reviews the existing reports on the application of aptamer-based biosensors and targeted therapy in animals.

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were a concern. We sought to describe the platelet feature of these cases. Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and nonsevere patients were compared. Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients. The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was longer than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days may be related to the cytokine storm.

It offers affordable, cheap and faster treatment. Drug repurposing has an additional advantage over new drug development because it lowers drug development costs as toxicity and other measures, including clinical trials, have already gone through them. However, there are few barriers which need to over-come like legal and economic barriers. Alternative drug development strate-gies are now being explored, such as the repurposing of existing drugs used to treat other diseases. This can save a considerable amount of time and money since the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profiles of these drugs are already established, effectively enabling pre-clinical studies to be bypassed. Awareness and encouragement can promote the flourish-ing of drug repurposing, which holds a great future in the modern medical sector. Improvements in health care and nutrition have caused impressive improvements in life expectancy worldwide. Repurposing is an accelerated drug development path since existing drugs have clinical and pharmacokinetic evidence. New approaches to drug discovery, such as the re-use of patented medicines that are used to cure other diseases, are under debate.

COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection.

But is well-being also served by social contact with people who are known less well? In this article, we discuss three propositions that support the conclusion that the benefits of social contact also derive from interactions with acquaintances and even strangers. The propositions state that most interaction situations with strangers are benign (Proposition 1), that most strangers are benign (Proposition 2), and that most interactions with strangers enhance well-being (Proposition 3). These propositions are supported, first, by recent research designed to illuminate the primary features of interaction situations. This research shows that situations with strangers often represent low conflict of interest. Also, in interactions with strangers, most people exhibit high levels of low-cost cooperation (social mindfulness) and, if the need is urgent, high levels of high-cost helping. We close by sharing research examples showing that even very subtle interactions with strangers yield short-term happiness. Broader implications for COVID-19 and urbanization are discussed.

Little research has been done regarding how students develop the algebraic concepts and skills involved in reasoning productively about physics quantities, which is different from either understanding of physics concepts or problem-solving abilities. We introduce the Physics Inventory of Quantitative Literacy (PIQL) as a tool for measuring quantitative literacy, a foundation of mathematical reasoning, in the context of introductory physics. We present the development of the PIQL and evidence of its validity for use in calculus-based introductory physics courses. Unlike concept inventories, the PIQL is a reasoning inventory, and can be used to assess reasoning over the span of students' instruction in introductory physics. Although mathematical reasoning associated with the PIQL is taught in prior mathematics courses, pre/post test scores reveal that this reasoning isn't readily used by most students in physics, nor does it develop as part of physics instruction--even in courses that use high-quality, research-based curricular materials. As has been the case with many inventories in physics education, we expect use of the PIQL to support the development of instructional strategies and materials--in this case, designed to meet the course objective that all students become quantitatively literate in introductory physics.","Brahmia, Suzanne White; Olsho, Alexis; Smith, Trevor I.; Boudreaux, Andrew; Eaton, Philip; Zimmerman, Charlotte",,445,16

Excessive alcohol consumption and ""comfort eating"" as coping mechanisms during times of high stress have been shown to further exacerbate mental and physical ill-health. Global examples suggest that unhealthy food and alcohol brands and companies are using the COVID-19 pandemic to further market their products. However, there has been no systematic, in-depth analysis of how ""Big Food"" and ""Big Alcohol"" are capitalizing on the COVID-19 pandemic to market their products and brands. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the extent and nature of online marketing by alcohol and unhealthy food and beverage companies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of all COVID-19-related social media posts made by leading alcohol and unhealthy food and beverage brands (n=42) and their parent companies (n=12) over a 4-month period (February to May 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. RESULTS: Nearly 80% of included brands and all parent companies posted content related to COVID-19 during the 4-month period. Quick service restaurants (QSRs), food and alcohol delivery companies, alcohol brands, and bottle shops were the most active in posting COVID-19-related content. The most common themes for COVID-19-related marketing were isolation activities and community support. Promotion of hygiene and home delivery was also common, particularly for QSRs and alcohol and food delivery companies. Parent companies were more likely to post about corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, such as donations of money and products, and to offer health advice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that Big Food and Big Alcohol are incessantly marketing their products and brands on social media platforms using themes related to COVID-19, such as isolation activities and community support. Parent companies are frequently posting about CSR initiatives, such as donations of money and products, thereby creating a fertile environment to loosen current regulation or resist further industry regulation. ""COVID-washing"" by large alcohol brands, food and beverage brands, and their parent companies is both common and concerning. The need for comprehensive regulations to restrict unhealthy food and alcohol marketing, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is particularly acute in the COVID-19 context and is urgently required to ""build back better"" in a post-COVID-19 world.","Martino, Florentine; Brooks, Ruby; Browne, Jennifer; Carah, Nicholas; Zorbas, Christina; Corben, Kirstan; Saleeba, Emma; Martin, Jane; Peeters, Anna; Backholer, Kathryn",JMIR Public Health Surveill,445,5

Investigating the current evidence is therefore crucial in this pandemic, as early rehabilitation could be effective for the functioning of patients with multiple organ failure. This rapid review assesses the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions in adults with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. METHODS: A rapid review was conducted including only randomised control trials, published until 30 November 2020. All databases were investigated and the results synthesized narratively, evaluating the risk of bias and quality of evidence in all included studies. RESULTS: A total of 404 records were identified through database searches. After removal of duplicates 346 articles remained. After screening, 3 studies (90 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All studies reported positive effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle mass preservation compared with no treatment or standard physio-therapy. CONCLUSION: The lack of evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions does not allow any firm conclusion to be drawn. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation might be a possible rehabilitation intervention to prevent muscle volume loss and improve function in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Use of the formalized consensus method. RESULTS: The medical and surgical management of patients in andrology and sexual medicine must be adapted. Consultations should, as far as possible, be carried out by tele-consultation. For operative procedures, the delay between the operative decision and the date of (re)scheduling of the procedure will depend on: (1) the level of criticality of the clinical situation; (2) the type of intervention; (3) the functional and psychological repercussions, including quality of life while waiting for the procedure; (4) the notion of losing the chance of having an optimal outcome; (5) the risk of potential complications from delaying a procedure for too long; and (6) taking into account the patient's risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19. The protection of urologists from COVID-19 should be considered. Each urologist must make the best decision for the patient, taking into account the acceptable time frame and quality of life impact before surgical management, the COVID risk parameters, the technical and anesthetic feasibility and the structural possibility of the health care institution to ensure a specific dedicated pathway during the COVID-19 health crisis.

METHODS: A national online bilingual American Sign Language/English survey was conducted from April 17 to May 1, 2020. Weighted sample of 474 DHH adults living in the United States. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine independent associations of sociodemographic variables and health indicators with perceived COVID-19 health consequences. RESULTS: About 44% of the medical condition sample used the Internet (English-based text) first for COVID-19 information, followed by TV (24%). Only 1% selected healthcare provider as the go-to source; the remainder got information from family or friends. Perceived health consequences increased with age (adjusted OR = 1.04; CI 95% = 1.02, 1.06). At-risk respondents who self-identified as persons of color were nearly three times more likely to believe that their health will be severely affected by COVID-19 compared to respondents who self-identified as white (adjusted OR = 2.94; CI 95% = 1.20, 7.18).

Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organization's Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media. RESULTS: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts, and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply, whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and attracted more public engagement online. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media. It is urgent to develop an effective vaccine campaign that boosts public confidence and addresses hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Tong, Yixin; Du, Fanxing; Lu, Linyao; Zhao, Sihong; Yu, Kexin; Piatek, Simon J; Larson, Heidi J; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,445,26

The disease raised an unprecedented demand for intensive care support due to severe pulmonary dysfunction and multiorgan failure. Although the pulmonary system is the potential target of the COVID-19, recent reports have demonstrated that COVID-19 profoundly influences the cardiovascular system and the kidneys. Research studies on cadavers have shown that direct heart and kidney injury can be frequently seen in patients deceased due to COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, functional or structural dysfunction of the heart may deteriorate the renal function and vice versa. This concept is already known as the cardiorenal syndrome and may play a role in COVID-19. Proactive monitoring of micro- and macrohemodynamics could allow prompt correction of circulatory dysfunction and can be of pivotal importance in the prevention of acute kidney injury. Moreover, type and amount of fluid therapy and vasoactive drug support could help manage these patients either with or without mechanical ventilator support. This brief review outlines the current evidence regarding the COVID-19-related renal and cardiorenal complications and discusses potential hemodynamic management strategies.","Guven, Goksel; Ince, Can; Topeli, Arzu; Caliskan, Kadir",Cardiorenal Med,445,10

causing acute inflammatory diseases in domestic and agricultural animals (chicken, pig, buffalo, cat, dog) Until recently, this infection in humans was mainly observed during the autumn-winter period and characterized by a mild, often asymptomatic, course The situation changed dramatically in 2003, when SARS outbreak caused by pathogenic CoV (SARS-CoV) was recorded in China A decade later, a new CoV outbreak occurred in the form of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), whereas in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases were recorded, which transformed within the first months of 2020 into the pandemic In all three cases, CoV disease led to severe bronchopulmonary lesions, varying from dry, debilitating cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) At the same time, multiple changes in innate immunity were noted most often manifested as a pronounced inflammatory reaction in the lower respiratory tract, featured by damaged type II pneumocytes, apoptosis, hyalinization of alveolar membranes, focal or generalized pulmonary edema Destructive processes in the respiratory tract were accompanied by migration of monocytes/macrophages and granulocyte neutrophils to the inflammatory focus Such events were accompanied by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which magnitude could ascend up to a cytokine storm SARS-CoV is characterized by symptoms of secondary immunosuppression, manifested by the late onset of interferon production and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes â€“ the key inflammatory factor The reason for such reaction may be accounted for by CoV arsenal containing extensive set of structural and inflammatory proteins exerting pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties Delayed IFN production allowed CoV to replicate actively and freely, and when type I IFN synthesis was eventually triggered, its activity was detrimental and accompanied by an aggravated infection course Thus, SARS can surely be referred to immune-dependent infections with a marked immunopathological component The purpose of this review was to describe some mechanisms underlying formation of innate immune response to infection caused by pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) ;ÐšÐ¾Ñ€Ð¾Ð½Ð°Ð²Ð¸Ñ€ÑƒÑÑ‹ (CoV) Ð¿Ñ€ÐµÐ´ÑÑ‚Ð°Ð²Ð»ÑÑŽÑ‚ ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»Ð¸Ð¼Ð¾Ñ€Ñ„Ð½ÑƒÑŽ Ð³Ñ€ÑƒÐ¿Ð¿Ñƒ Ñ€ÐµÑÐ¿Ð¸Ñ€Ð°Ñ‚Ð¾Ñ€Ð½Ñ‹Ñ…

Whether the risk of VTE significantly differed between COVID-19 cohorts and non-COVID-19 cohorts with similar disease severity remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to compare the rate of VTE between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts with similar disease severity. METHODS: A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase and Google Scholar) was conducted from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 to identify studies reporting VTE in COVID-19. Relative risks (RR) were estimated for the effect measure with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Seven studies (41,768 patients) evaluated VTE in COVID-19 cohorts compared to non-COVID-19 cohorts. The overall risk of VTE (RR 1.18; 95%CI 0.79-1.77; p = 0.42; I2 = 54%), pulmonary embolism (RR 1.25; 95%CI 0.77-2.03; p = 0.36; I2 = 52%) and deep venous thrombosis (RR 0.92; 95%CI 0.52-1.65; p = 0.78; I2 = 0%) did not significantly differ between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts. However, subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of VTE amongst CODID-19 versus non COVID-19 cohorts when only patients hospitalized within the intensive care unit (ICU) were considered (RR 3.10; 95%CI 1.54-6.23), which was not observed in cohorts of predominantly non-ICU patients (RR 0.95; 95%CI 0.81-1.11) (Pinteraction = 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was no signal for a difference in VTE in COVID-19 cohorts compared to non-COVID-19 cohorts, except for the subgroup of patients hospitalized in the ICU. These results should be viewed as exploratory and further studies are needed to confirm these results.","Mai, Vicky; Tan, Boun Kim; Mainbourg, Sabine; Potus, François; Cucherat, Michel; Lega, Jean-Christophe; Provencher, Steeve",Vascul Pharmacol,445,1

However, there is still a lack of effective, safe photosensitizers that would be well tolerated by patients. The combination of several methods (like phototherapy and hyperthermia) constitutes a modern therapeutic approach, which demands new materials based on components that are non-toxic without irradiation. Therefore, this study presents the synthesis and properties of novel, advanced nanomaterials in which the advantage features of the magnetic nanoparticles and photoactive compounds were combined. The primary purpose of this work was the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles coated with biocompatible and antitumor polysaccharide - levan, previously unknown from scientific literature, and the deposition of potent photosensitizer - zinc(II) phthalocyanine on their surface. In order to better characterize the nature of the coating covering the magnetic core, the atomic force microscope analysis, a contact angle measurement, and the mechanical properties of pure levan and its blend with zinc(II) phthalocyanine films were investigated. This magnetic nanomaterial revealed the ability to generate singlet oxygen upon exposure to light. Finally, preliminary toxicity of obtained nanoparticles was tested using the Microtox® test - with and without irradiation.","Chelminiak-Dudkiewicz, Dorota; Rybczynski, Patryk; Smolarkiewicz-Wyczachowski, Aleksander; Mlynarczyk, Dariusz T; Wegrzynowska-Drzymalska, Katarzyna; Ilnicka, Anna; Goslinski, Tomasz; Marszall, Michal P; Ziegler-Borowska, Marta",Appl Surf Sci,445,24

This influence could be noticed obviously by the latest drop in crude oil prices. Furthermore, coronavirus has affected the supply chains and delayed the development of sustainable energy worldwide. Due to its relevance, academics have begun to study the associations regarding this crisis. The COVID-19 Pandemic offers a new chance to investigate the impacts of prolonged landscape-scale confusion on sustainability change paths in real-time. How the global renewable energy flexibility sector will respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic is a critical question. This crisis could inspire governance structures to plan adequately for other varieties of crises in the future. These improvements can drive research by spouting the generation of new disciplines stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak to expedite sustainability transitions and improve the recognition of governance's main role in changes. Smart policies could transform COVID-19 threats into great opportunities for the world's sustainable energy scenario towards green energy generation and use in the coming years. In this paper, the impacts of COVID-19 in terms of the energy sector, especially the electricity and oil sectors, will be explained.

In severe cases, the presence of kidney injury is associated with increased risk of death, highlighting the relevance of this organ as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake, but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation. The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation, and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death. In this review, we discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multiorgan damage.","Noris, Marina; Benigni, Ariela; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",Kidney Int,445,24

We present duality results, which allow us to motivate why this particular risk measurement regime is fair for both the single agents and the whole system at the same time. We relate Systemic Risk Measures of shortfall type to an equilibrium concept, namely a Systemic Optimal Risk Transfer Equilibrium, which conjugates Bühlmann’s Risk Exchange Equilibrium with a capital allocation problem at an initial time.

Besides this, studies on patients? clinical characteristics have described electrolyte imbalances as one of the recurrent features of COVID-19. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study on all patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) from 1st March to 31st May 2020 who had undergone a blood gas analysis and a nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 by rtPCR. We defined positive patients as cases (n. 710) and negatives as controls (n. 619), for a total number of patients of 1.329. The study was approved by the local ethics committee Area 3 Milan. Data were automatically extracted from the hospital laboratory SQL-based repository in anonymized form. We considered as outcomes potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chlorine (Cl-) and calcium (Ca++) as continuous and as categorical variables, in their relation with age, sex and SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Results We observed a higher prevalence of hypokalemia among patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 (13.7% vs 6% of negative subjects). Positive patients had a higher probability to be admitted to the ED with hypokalemia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.8-4.1 p<0.0001) and women were twice as likely to be affected than men (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.67-3.54 p<0.001). Odds ratios for positive patients to manifest with an alteration in serum Na+ was (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.17-2.35 p<0.001) and serum chlorine (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.03-2.69 p<0.001). Notably, OR for positive patients to be hypocalcemic was 7.2 (95% CI 4.8-10.6 p<0.0001) with a low probability for women to be hypocalcemic (OR 0.63, 95% IC 0.4-0.8 p=0.005). Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a higher prevalence of hypokalemia, hypocal- cemia, hypochloremia and sodium alterations.

We describe a successful initial experience implementing a virtual elective in interventional radiology (IR) and provide the course framework, student feedback, and potential improvements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-week virtual IR elective curriculum was created utilizing a combination of synchronous and asynchronous learning and the ""flipped"" classroom educational model. Students virtually participated in daily IR resident education conferences, resident-led case review sessions, and dedicated lectures. Asynchronous prelearning material consisted of text and video correlating to lecture topics. Anonymous precourse and postcourse surveys were sent to all participating students (nâ¯=â¯10). RESULTS: Ten students (100%) completed precourse and seven (70%) completed postcourse surveys. Enrolled students were considering residencies in surgery (50%), internal medicine (40%), interventional radiology (30%), and/or diagnostic radiology (30%). Students' understanding of what IRs do and the procedures they perform (p < 0.001), when to consult IR for assistance in patient management (pâ¯=â¯0.005), and the number of IR procedures students could recall (pâ¯=â¯0.015) improved after the course. Case-review sessions and virtual lectures ranked as having the highest education value. Students recommended additional small-group case workshops. CONCLUSION: This successful virtual IR elective provides a framework for others to continue IR medical student education during the pandemic and grow the specialty's presence within an increasingly virtual medical school curriculum. The described model may be modified to improve IR education beyond the COVID-19 era.","DePietro, Daniel M; Santucci, Sarah E; Harrison, Neil E; Kiefer, Ryan M; Trerotola, Scott O; Sudheendra, Deepak; Shamimi-Noori, Susan",Acad Radiol,445,6

The CMfg concept integrates the distributed resources and capacities in a shared economy, transfers them to the virtual manufacturing services with various quality of service (QoS) properties. These services are invoked to collaborate in producing customized demands with specific functional and non-functional properties. The operational perspective of the service-demand matching problem is considered more in the literature;however, it is a challenging problem in the CMfg ecosystem. This paper evaluates the service-demand matching problem from a structural perspective to facilitate resilience and configurable system working well in the operational interactions. Therefore, a CMfg hyper-network-based model is proposed which is enriched with QoS properties. It employs the available capacities in all small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large companies. The service-demand matching problem is a complex issue;so, it is impossible to analyze it with the current approaches. Here, the CMfg structure is examined through topological characteristics. It helps decision-makers to provide a robust and resilient service-demand matching model. It also proposes some investment opportunities for the SME. The proposed model and its capabilities are discussed through a real case study about the COVID-19 ventilator manufacturing systems in CMfg ecosystem.","Rezapour Niari, Maryam Eshgi Koroush Fatahi Valilai Omid",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,445,5

Here, we explore the early perceived effects of COVID-19 on dermatology residents through an electronic sample survey and identify possible areas for targeted improvement in lieu of a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: On April 3, 2020, a survey of link with 25 questions was sent to dermatology program coordinators to be disseminated among dermatology residents in the United States. The survey was closed on April 13, 2020. All of the questions were optional and no personal identifiers were collected. RESULTS: A total of 140 dermatology residents from 50 different residency programs across 26 states responded to the survey. The majority of respondents (85%) reported negative effects of COVID-19 on their overall wellness. Despite the majority of residents (92%) speculating that COVID-19 will have negative long-term effects on the US economy, only 33% agreed or strongly agreed that it will affect their job prospects. Teledermatology was widely implemented following the declaration of a national emergency (96% of represented residencies compared with only 30% before the pandemic), with heavy resident involvement. The majority of residents (99%) reported having virtual didactics and that they found them to be beneficial. Most residents were uncomfortable with the prospect of being reassigned to a nondermatology specialty during the pandemic. In addition, 22% of residents believed that their leadership were not transparent and prompt in addressing changes relating to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatology residents were affected negatively by COVID-19 in regard to their well-being, clinical training, and education. Several areas of improvement were identified that could improve our preparedness for a second wave of the virus.","Li, Yumeng M; Galimberti, Fabrizio; Abrouk, Michael; Kirsner, Robert S",South Med J,445,1

We show that the expression of IL-1ß or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in immunopathology modelled by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1ß and IL-6 response modules, but not the cytokine transcripts themselves, is a feature of infection in the nasopharynx and blood, but is not associated with severity of COVID-19 disease, length of stay or mortality.

MethodsUsing the payment data from all 79 pharmaceutical companies in Japan between 2017 and 2018 and direct research grants from the Japanese government between 2019 and 2020, we evaluated the extent of financial and non-financial COI among all 20 Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board members. ResultsJapanese government COVID-19 advisory board members were predominantly male (75.0%) and physicians (50.0%). Between 2019 and 2020, two members (10.0%) received a total of $819,244 in government research funding. Another five members (25.0%) received $419,725 in payments, including $223,183 in personal fees, from 28 pharmaceutical companies between 2017 and 2018.

Further, neither the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare nor the Japanese Cabinet Secretariat disclosed financial or non-financial COI with industry. Further, the government and had no policies for managing COI among advisory board members. ConclusionsThis study found that the Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board had financial and non-financial COI with pharmaceutical companies and the government. Further, there were no rigorous COI management strategies for the COVID-19 advisory board members. Any government must ensure the independence of scientific advisory boards by implementing more rigorous and transparent management strategies that require the declaration and public disclosure of all COI.","Mamada, Hanano; Murayama, Anju; Ozaki, Akihiko; Hashimoto, Takanao; Saito, Hiroaki; Sawano, Toyoaki; Bhandari, Divya; Shrestha, Sunil; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",,445,16

South Africa extended temporarily its already considerable system of social protection and introduced new implementation systems. Elsewhere, governments that had hitherto appeared ambivalent about social protection resisted major reforms, even on a temporary basis. In Zambia, the government committed considerable resources to small farmers but ignored almost entirely cash transfers to the poor. Botswana provided food parcels but did not expand its social grant programmes. The shock of Covid-19 in Southern Africa did not prove to be a ?critical juncture?: Powerful pro-reform coalitions did not form to shift governments onto new policy paths. National governments were generally reluctant either to introduce programmes that were targeted on the urban poor specifically or to allow countrywide emergency programmes to become permanent.

This study was conducted to explore changes in patients' use of dietary or herbal supplements among individuals infected with COVID-19 before and during infection and the association between herbal or dietary supplements and hospitalization. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted enrolling symptomatic patients who had recently recovered from COVID-19. Data were collected through phone interviews, and McNemar's test was used to investigate changes to consumption of dietary or herbal supplements before and during infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between supplements use during patients' infection and hospitalization. A total of 738 patients were included in this study, of whom 32.1% required hospitalization. About 57% of participants were male with a mean age of 36.5 (±11.9) years. The use of lemon/orange, honey, ginger, vitamin C, and black seed among participants significantly increased during their infection. In contrast, patients using anise, peppermint, and coffee peel before their infection were more likely to stop using them during their infection. In addition, using lemon/orange (p < 0.0001), honey (p = 0.0002), ginger (p = 0.0053), vitamin C (p = 0.0006), black seed (p < 0.0001), peppermint (p = 0.0027), costus (p = 0.0095), and turmeric (p = 0.0012) was significantly higher among nonhospitalized patients than hospitalized ones. However, in the multivariable logistic regression, only use of vitamin C (OR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.33-0.79), peppermint (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.31-0.90), and lemon/orange (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.33-0.88) was associated with significantly lower odds of hospitalization. The study reveals that patients' consumption of dietary or herbal supplements changed in response to their COVID-19 infection, with hospitalized patients having a lower likelihood of using these supplements. Because some supplements were associated with lower odds of hospitalization, these supplements or their bioactive components should be further investigated as feasible options for COVID-19 treatment.","Aldwihi, Leen A; Khan, Shahd I; Alamri, Faisal F; AlRuthia, Yazed; Alqahtani, Faleh; Fantoukh, Omer I; Assiri, Ahmed; Almohammed, Omar A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),445,16

The edaphoclimatic zoning was based on the overlapping of maps that characterize the average annual air temperature obtained by multiple linear regression, annual water deficiency calculated by the Thornthwaite and Matter method (1955) and favorable soil classes to the development of papaya. The results indicated that as regards the edaphoclimatic zoning for the papaya crop it was observed that 71.70% of the area is classified as apt for its development. In relation to agrometeorological favorability for the occurrence of fungal diseases, there was a favorability of 7.64% for the development without restrictions of the oidium and a predominance of 64,56% of favorability with thermal restriction. For the early blight fungus, it was observed that the zones of favorability without restriction correspond to 11.66% of the area apt for the papaya cultivation and that 55.13% of the area has favorability with restriction of humidity. The edaphoclimatic zoning for the papaya crop showed compatibility with the most productive areas of this crop in the state of Espírito Santo. The zoning of thermal favorability for the occurrence of papaya fungal diseases proved to be a valuable tool for studies of plant diseases, allowing the establishment of plans for the allocation of resistant varieties, in order to minimize the risks of loss of crop productivity due to the disease. This methodology presents potential to be used in other areas, cultures and phytopathological diseases.","Moreira, Taís Rizzo; Ferreira da Silva, Samuel; Marques da Silva Gandine, Simony; Barbosa de Souza, Kaíse; Senhorelo, Adriano Posse; Heitor, Fabricio Dias; Parajara, Magno do Carmo; Ribeiro, Wilian Rodrigues; Gonçalves, Morgana Scaramussa; Pinheiro, André Alves; Billo, Dâmaris; Araújo, Emanuel França; Pedroso Nascimento, Glícia Silvania; Berude, Leandro Christo; Barros, Quétila Souza; Silva, Rodrigo Freitas; Amaral Dino Alves Dos Santos, Gleissy Mary; Rosa Dos Santos, Alexandre",J Therm Biol,445,13

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the epidemiology, treatment pathways and 30-day mortality rates of hip fractures. Outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients were compared against those who tested negative. METHODS: An observational, retrospective, multicentre study was conducted across six hospitals in the South East of England. Data were retrieved from the National Hip Fracture Database and electronic medical records. Data was collected for the strictest UK lockdown period (period B=23 March 2020-11 May 2020), and the corresponding period in 2019 (period A). RESULTS: A total of 386 patients were admitted during period A, whereas 381 were admitted during period B. Despite the suspension of the 'Best Practice Tariff' during period B, time to surgery, time to orthogeriatric assessment, and 30-day mortality were similar between period A and B. The length of inpatient stay was significantly shorter during period B (11.5 days vs 17.0 days, p<0.001). Comparison of COVID-19 positive and negative patients during period B demonstrated that a positive test was associated with a significantly higher rate of 30-day mortality (53.6% vs 6.7%), surgical delay >36h (46.4% vs 30.8%, p=0.049), and increased length of inpatient stay (15.8 vs 11.7 days, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown did not alter the epidemiology of hip fractures. A substantially higher mortality rate was observed among patients with a COVID-19 positive test. These findings should be taken into consideration by the healthcare policymakers while formulating contingency plans for a potential 'second wave'.","Malik-Tabassum, K; Robertson, A; Tadros, B J; Chan, G; Crooks, M; Buckle, C; Rogers, B; Selmon, G; Arealis, G",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,445,21

These patients commonly have associated diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with high rates of cardiovascular-related death. Management of ESKD requires renal replacement therapy via dialysis or transplantation. While transplantation provides the greatest improvement in survival and quality of life, the vast majority of patients are treated initially with hemodialysis. However, outcomes differ significantly among patient populations. Barriers in access to care have particularly affected at-risk populations, such as Black and Hispanic patients. These patients receive less pre-ESKD nephrology care, are less likely to initiate dialysis with a fistula, and wait longer for transplants-even in pediatric populations. Priorities for ESKD care moving into the future include increasing access to nephrology care in underprivileged populations, providing patient-centered care based on each patient's ""life plan,"" and focusing on team-based approaches to ESKD care.

METHODS: The clinical data of 20 children who were diagnosed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 20 to March 4, 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 20 children, there were 7 boys (35%) and 13 girls (65%), aged 8 months to 14 years (mean 8±5 years). All these children had no clinical manifestations and attended the hospital for an epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2. Nineteen children were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in all 20 children. There were 4 children (20%) of mild type, 16 children (80%) of common type, and no children of severe type or critical type. The mean peripheral blood leukocyte count was (6.8±3.5)×109/L, and 7 children had an abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte count, with an increase in 5 children and a reduction in 2 children. One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87×109/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42â mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (>400â U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (>1.6â mmol/L). Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation. Most of the children with asymptomatic infection have no obvious abnormalities in blood routine and other laboratory tests. Changes in chest CT scan can be used as an aid for early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection in children.","Chen, Jun; Wang, Xian-Feng; Zhang, Pei-Fa",Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,445,20

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this prolonged sitting on students' self-perceived physical, mental, and cognitive condition and to answer the question of whether simple standing breaks in lectures can help students improve these conditions and for example feel more concentrated, motivated, or less tense in class. A five-minute standing break was introduced using a designed presentation slide for one semester in five different 90-min lectures. In addition, an active break as well as an open break with no trigger were implemented in two further lectures to explicitly investigate the effects of a standing break. Before, during, and after the semester, the students were surveyed about their physical, mental, and cognitive condition (836 respondents at start, 634 during semester, and 528 at the end). To evaluate the practicality and acceptance of the standing break, lecturers were interviewed about their experience. At all survey time points, the standing break was highly accepted by the university students. About three quarters of the students felt a relaxation of the muscles in the neck and shoulder as well as in the back and the legs. More than three quarters perceived an increase in concentration, receptiveness and retentiveness, motivation, and well-being. Results of the statistical analysis indicate that a standing break as well as an active break are more effective than an open break to improve the self-perceived physical and psychological well-being of the university students. The increase in cognitive skills is reported by all groups, including the group who were offered open breaks. Hence, standing breaks in university lectures receive a high level of acceptance and practicability and have the potential to increase students' physical, mental, and cognitive condition and contribute to students' physical activity and health. While field research provides opportunities such as the testing of measures in the natural environment and producing real-life results relevant to the students and lecturers, it also imposes limitations as lecture settings differed, not all disturbances could be controlled, and the participation in the study might have led to social-desirability bias. For a sustainable development of a standing-friendly teaching and learning culture at universities, further interventions as well as the consideration of the topic in all processes and decisions within the universities are necessary. Since this study has taken place, student-life has changed drastically with COVID-19 measures. While this current paper is based on research conducted in 2019 and has only tested live lectures on campus, the tools tested could also be used for online lectures.","Paulus, M.; Kunkel, J.; Schmidt, S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an experimental study. Its data were collected in the infectious diseases clinic of a research hospital from May to August, 2020. This study was carried out with 67 COVID-19 patients (33 in the experimental group and 34 in the control group). The data were collected using a personal information form, the state-trait anxiety inventory, and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. The progressive muscle relaxation exercises were performed twice a day for 5 days with the researcher's supervision. The data were analyzed using means, numbers, percentage distributions, the &#967;2 test, the dependent t test, and the independent t test. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups' mean posttest scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (p < 0.05). The in-group comparison of the experimental group found a statistically significant difference between their mean pretest and posttest scores on the State Anxiety Scale (p < 0.05). The in-group comparison of the control group found no statistically significant changes in their mean pretest and posttest scores on the State Anxiety Scale (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The progressive muscle relaxation exercises effectively reduced the anxiety and improved the sleep quality of patients with COVID-19.","Özlü, Ibrahim; Öztürk, Zeynep; Karaman Özlü, Zeynep; Tekin, Erdal; Gür, Ali",Perspect. psychiatr. care,445,33

The excess of cardiac deaths may be explained by the indirect consequences of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include a dramatic reduction of hospital admissions during the pandemic, particularly for acute coronary syndromes; an increase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests; a reduction of outpatient clinic activities and cardiac procedures; long-term cardiovascular effects of COVID-19; and unfavorable cardiac effects of the lockdown imposed by the spread of COVID-19 infection.

Site percolation on lattices with compact neighborhoods can be mapped to problems of lattice percolation of extended shapes, such as disks and spheres, and the thresholds can be related to the continuum thresholds $\eta_c$ for objects of those shapes. This mapping implies $zp_{c} \sim 4 \eta_c = 4.51235$ in 2D and $zp_{c} \sim 8 \eta_c = 2.73512$ in 3D for large $z$ for circular and spherical neighborhoods respectively, where $z$ is the coordination number.

The Västra Götaland Region in the West coast of Sweden is used as a case study. The results show significant inequalities in access to OHDS. Moreover, there are segments of population under a compound marginalization during the COVID-19 pandemic due to (i) limited accessibility to OHDS services, (ii) high incidence of COVID-19 cases in their area that makes physical visits to a store a risk activity, and (iii) high vulnerability (e.g., high share of individuals older than 65).

Clinical manifestations range from severe cases with a lethal outcome to mild or asymptomatic cases. Although there is the same proportion of infected genders, men are more susceptible to severe COVID-19, with a higher risk of death than women. This sex-bias may be explained by biological pathways. MethodsWe performed an epidemiological survey from July 2020 to July 2021 including 1744 unvaccinated adult Brazilian couples with at least one infected spouse despite living together during the COVID-19 infection without protective measures. The presence or absence of infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology results. The couples were divided between groups where both partners were infected (concordant couples) or only one spouse remained asymptomatic despite the close contact with the infected one (discordant couples). Statistical analysis of the collected data was performed aiming to verify a differential transmitter potential between genders in household contact. ResultsThe combination of our data collected from concordant and discordant couples showed that the man is the first (or the only) affected in the major occurrences when compared to women. Our findings support other published surveys and are in concordance with previous studies of our group. ConclusionsThese observations support the hypothesis according to which male individuals are more efficient virus transmitters than females, independently of the use of protective masks. In short, the present study confirmed the existence of gender differences not only for susceptibility to infection and resistance to COVID-19 but also in the transmission rate. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIThere are sex differences in COVID-19 susceptibility and transmission between couples with direct contact without protective measures; C_LIO_LIMen are more efficient virus transmitters than women; C_LIO_LISex-bias in COVID-19 transmission can be explained by differences in viral load in saliva, immune response and also behavioural protective differences between genders.

The model is based on separate accounting for the contribution to the epidemic from two types of immune response to a viral infection - innate and adaptive immunity. Any infected person becomes asymptomatic with probability (1-p) or symptomatic with probability p. In the first case, innate immunity is sufficient to protect a person. In the second case, innate immunity is insufficient, and adaptive immunity comes into play. In the asymptomatic state, the person remains outwardly healthy, mobile and can spread the infection. In the symptomatic state, the person becomes ill, isolated and cannot spread the infection. We assume that the contribution to the epidemic process from asymptomatic carriers is dominant in comparison with the contribution from the usual incubation period in the symptomatic state. The key parameters of the model are the virus lifetime T in the asymptomatic state and the spread rate ss. At moderate ssT values, the model describes a long, slowly decreasing morbidity plateau, which transforms into wave-like solution at ssT. In the case of ssT, which corresponds to a stable non-pathogenic strain, the model solution is limited to single wave only. We believe that the spread of such a non-pathogenic strain and its subsequent dominance is responsible for ending the epidemic after the single wave of incidence in China. A way to stop the epidemic in the rest of the world may consist in displacing the circulating pathogenic virus with its stable non-pathogenic strain.","Dimaschko, J.; Shlyakhover, V.; Iabluchanskyi, M.",SciMedicine Journal,445,20

Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans.

METHODS: We randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry. RESULTS: At 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug.

The Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P = 0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P = 0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P = 0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P = 0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration. CONCLUSIONS: These remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

Methods The clinical data of nine patients who were diagnosed with critical COVID-19 in Hainan General Hospital from January 21, 2020 to February 6, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RT-PCR testing for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was performed with multi-sites synchronize specimens including pharyngeal swab, blood, excrement, and urine. The serum levels of leucocyte, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactic acid between the improved group (five cases) and the deteriorated group (four cases) were compared. The t test was used for comparison of normally distributed continuous data between groups. Results There were eight males (88.9%) and 1 female enrolled. The patients aged 28-77 years old, with an age of (52.9±18.0) years. By March 4, 2020, all five cases in improved group were cured and discharged, three cases in deteriorated group died and 1case remained in critical condition. All multi-sites specimens of patients in improved group turned negative in 2-4 weeks of illness onset, while those of cases in deteriorated group showed sustained viral nucleic acid positive (up to 48th day of illness onset). The white blood cell counts ((13.52±8.24)×10 9 /L vs (10.49±4.46) ×10 9 /L), C-reactive protein ((139.71±87.46) mg/L vs (78.60±55.40) mg/L) and procalcitonin ((2.32±4.03) ng/mL vs (0.28±0.58) ng/mL) , lactic acid ((3.70±4.14) mmol/L vs (2.33±0.53) mmol/L) in deteriorated group were all significantly higher than those in improved group ( t =2.908, 5.009, 4.391 and 2.942, respectively, all P <0.01).

In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of social sites, such as schools, restaurants, shopping centers, residential areas, etc., decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing down others so that the social contacts across the network can be minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize all his/her contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be found for every one, when the resulting distribution of the population over the network reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of network sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types, such as the maximal independent set (r=0), the maximal strong matching (r=1), the maximal set of independent cycles (r=2), etc. They are easy to identify or construct, and can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or allow certain degree of connectivities (with r>0) for more flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular subnetworks. We provide an overview on algorithms that can be used for computing maximal r-regular subnetworks and their associated distancing strategies.","Wu, Zhijun",,445,1

By detecting the characteristics of the text and regional coverage of emotions, an emotional coverage index that reflects the intensity of emotional impact was proposed to determine the mainstream emotion of netizens. By capturing the mutation characteristics of the impact intensity of mainstream emotions, the critical time window of the public opinion toward the event was obtained. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively identify the critical outbreak time window of controversial events, which can help authorities in preventing the further aggravation of events.","Wang, Mingyang; Wu, Huan; Zhang, Tianyu; Zhu, Shengqing",PLoS One,445,16

Here we generated annual estimates of routine childhood MCV1 coverage at 5 × 5-km2 pixel and second administrative levels from 2000 to 2019 in 101 LMICs, quantified geographical inequality and assessed vaccination status by geographical remoteness. After widespread MCV1 gains from 2000 to 2010, coverage regressed in more than half of the districts between 2010 and 2019, leaving many LMICs far from the GVAP goal of 80% coverage in all districts by 2019. MCV1 coverage was lower in rural than in urban locations, although a larger proportion of unvaccinated children overall lived in urban locations; strategies to provide essential vaccination services should address both geographical contexts. These results provide a tool for decision-makers to strengthen routine MCV1 immunization programmes and provide equitable disease protection for all children.",,Nature,445,26

This is a mystery, because sugar binding activities appear essential to many other viruses including influenza and even most other coronaviruses in order to bind to and escape from the glycans (sugars, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides) characteristic of cell surfaces and saliva and mucin. The S1 N terminal Domains (S1-NTD) of the spike protein, largely responsible for the bulk of the characteristic knobs at the end of the spikes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, are here predicted to be ""hiding"" sites for recognizing and binding glycans containing sialic acid. This may be important for infection and the ability of the virus to locate ACE2 as its known main host cell surface receptor, and if so it becomes a pharmaceutical target. It might even open up the possibility of an alternative receptor to ACE2. The prediction method developed, which uses amino acid residue sequence alone to predict domains or proteins that bind to sialic acids, is naïve, and will be advanced in future work. Nonetheless, it was surprising that such a very simple approach was so useful, and it can easily be reproduced in a very few lines of computer program to help make quick comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 sequences and to consider the effects of viral mutations.","Robson, B",Comput Biol Med,445,21

Hence, to collect high-quality data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be the immediate priority. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2020 to December 26, 2020 for eligible studies reporting on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) included patients with COVD-19; (2) recorded the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or insomnia symptom; (3) sample size &#8805;30; (4) with validated screening tools; and (5) passed through the international peer-review process. Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. The quality effects meta-analysis was conducted further to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included for analysis with a total of 4318 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was 38% (95% CI = 25-51), 38% (95% CI = 24-52), and 48% (95% CI = 11-85), respectively. Neither subgroup analysis nor sensitivity analysis can explain the source of high heterogeneity. In addition, the prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms varied based on different screening tools. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are prevalent in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19. Thus, early detection and properly intervention for mental illness in this population are of great significance. Additionally, the quality of included studies to date has been variable, and ongoing surveillance is essential.","Liu, Chaomeng; Pan, Weigang; Li, Li; Li, Bing; Ren, Yanping; Ma, Xin",J Psychosom Res,445,16

METHODS: This study was a systematic review that was done to identify current evidence on transmission modes of COVID19. We searched selected keywords in six important databases to discover related sources on the main objective of the study. To identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the authors screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved documents. The appropriate articles were selected and their results were discussed to make the final inclusion. RESULTS: We identified five potential transmission modes of COVID-19 including airborne, droplet, contact with contaminated surfaces, oral and fecal secretions. Furthermore, some studies have pointed out other modes of virus transmission, such as person to person, and direct contact with animals. CONCLUSION: Droplet and contact with contaminated surfaces were the most frequent transmission modes of COVID-19. Fecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fluid pollution might contribute to a viral transmission. The possibility of fecal transmission of COVID-19 has implications, especially in areas with poor sanitation and the environmental pollution can be caused by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and feces, subsequently, the human environment will change to a potential medium of virus transmission.","Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Salehi, Mohammad Amin; Behnezhad, Farzane; Moghaddam, Hamed Rezakhani; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad",Infectious disorders.

Our aim was to study the influence of baseline ECG parameters, including interatrial block (IAB), in the prognosis of patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Methods and Results The BIT (Baseline Interatrial Block and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) registry included 2527 patients with aortic stenosis treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation. A centralized analysis of baseline ECGs was performed. Patients were divided into 4 groups: normal P wave duration (<120 ms); partial IAB (P wave duration &#8805;120 ms, positive in the inferior leads); advanced IAB (P wave duration &#8805;120 ms, biphasic [+/-] morphology in the inferior leads); and nonsinus rhythm (atrial fibrillation/flutter and paced rhythm). The mean age of patients was 82.6±9.8 years and 1397 (55.3%) were women. A total of 960 patients (38.0%) had a normal P wave, 582 (23.0%) had partial IAB, 300 (11.9%) had advanced IAB, and 685 (27.1%) presented with nonsinus rhythm. Mean follow-up duration was 465±171 days. Advanced IAB was the only independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-1.98 [P=0.010]) and of the composite end point (death/stroke/new atrial fibrillation) (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.94 [P=0.001]). Conclusions Baseline ECG characteristics influence the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Advanced IAB is present in about an eighth of patients and is associated with all-cause death and the composite end point of death, stroke, and new atrial fibrillation during follow-up.","Vicent, Lourdes; Fernández-Cordón, Clara; Nombela-Franco, Luis; Escobar-Robledo, Luis Alberto; Ayesta, Ana; Ariza Solé, Albert; Gómez-Doblas, Juan José; Bernal, Eva; Tirado-Conte, Gabriela; Cobiella, Javier; González-Saldivar, Hugo; López-Otero, Diego; Díez-Villanueva, Pablo; Sarnago, Fernando; Armario, Xavier; Bayés-de-Luna, Antonio; Martínez-Sellés, Manuel",J Am Heart Assoc,445,16

Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,17.913898,3.6577978,2020,Many application problems are formulated as nonlinear binary programming models which are hard to be solved using exact algorithms especially in large dimensions. One of these practical applications is to optimally distribute protective materials for the newly emerged COVID-19. It is defined for a decision-maker who wants to choose a subset of candidate hospitals comprising the maximization of the distributed quantities of protective materials to a set of chosen hospitals within a specific time shift. A nonlinear binary mathematical programming model for the problem is introduced with a real application case study;the case study is solved using a novel discrete binary gaining-sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm (DBGSK). The solution algorithm proposes a novel binary adaptation of a recently developed gaining-sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm (GSK) to solve binary optimization problems. GSK algorithm is based on the concept of how humans acquire and share knowledge through their life span. Discrete binary version of GSK named novel binary gaining-sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm (DBGSK) depends mainly on two binary stages: binary junior gaining-sharing stage and binary senior gaining-sharing stage with knowledge factor 1. These two stages enable DBGSK for exploring and exploitation of the search space efficiently and effectively to solve problems in binary space. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.,"Hassan, S.

However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues. METHODS: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in additional 10 research-intent COVID-19 positive donors. FINDINGS: Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ~13% (17/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) disinfection. INTERPRETATIONS: Our study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.","Sawant, Onkar B; Singh, Sneha; Wright, Robert Emery; Jones, Kayla M; Titus, Michael S; Dennis, Eugene; Hicks, Eric; Majmudar, Parag A; Kumar, Ashok; Mian, Shahzad I",Ocular surf,445,12

DESIGN: We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of deliveries. SETTING: Deliveries were performed over 15 years at a single tertiary hospital. PATIENT(S): We included all parturients who had a live born infant or an intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). INTERVENTION(S): We compared pregnancies resulting from IVF cycles to non-IVF pregnancies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcomes were preterm and term IPD (preeclampsia, placental abruption, small-for-gestational age infant [SGA], or an intrauterine fetal demise [IUFD] due to placental insufficiency). RESULT(S): Of the 69,084 deliveries during the study period, 3,763 (5.4%) were conceived with IVF. The incidence of preterm delivery was 32.6% in IVF pregnancies and 10.8% in non-IVF pregnancies. Multiple gestations were more common in IVF pregnancies. Compared to non-IVF pregnancies, IVF pregnancies were more likely to develop both preterm and term IPD, even after adjustment for maternal age and parity. The risk of preterm IPD was 4 times higher (95% confidence interval, 3.7-4.4) in patients who underwent IVF compared with those who did not undergo IVF. Among parturients who delivered at &#8805;37 weeks of gestation, IVF pregnancies had 1.7 times the risk of term IPD (95% confidence interval, 1.6-1.9) compared with non-IVF pregnancies. CONCLUSION(S): IVF was strongly associated with preterm IPD. We found a similar, but attenuated, association between IVF and term IPD. The stronger association with preterm IPD suggests an association between IVF and placental insufficiency.","Johnson, Katherine M; Hacker, Michele R; Thornton, Kim; Young, Brett C; Modest, Anna M",Fertil. steril,445,2

Response to COVID-19 in Chinese neurosurgery and beyond,17.499287,3.886684,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that there is a lack of healthcare facilities to cope with a pandemic. This has also underscored the immediate need to rapidly develop hospitals capable of dealing with infectious patients and to rapidly change in supply lines to manufacture the prescription goods (including medicines) that is needed to prevent infection and treatment for infected patients. The COVID-19 has shown the utility of intelligent autonomous robots that assist human efforts to combat a pandemic. The artificial intelligence based on neural networks and deep learning can help to fight COVID-19 in many ways, particularly in the control of autonomous medic robots. Health officials aim to curb the spread of COVID-19 among medical, nursing staff and patients by using intelligent robots. We propose an advanced controller for a service robot to be used in hospitals. This type of robot is deployed to deliver food and dispense medications to individual patients. An autonomous line-follower robot that can sense and follow a line drawn on the floor and drive through the rooms of patients with control of its direction. These criteria were met by using two controllers simultaneously: A deep neural network controller to predict the trajectory of movement and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for automatic steering and speed control. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Viscoelastic testing may identify and characterise hypercoagulable states which are not apparent using conventional coagulation assays. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to undertake viscoelastic evaluation of the coagulation state in critically ill adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure METHODS: This was a single-centre observational point prevalence cohort study of adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure requiring respiratory support in the intensive care unit. Coagulation status was evaluated using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) in conjunction with laboratory markers of coagulation. RESULTS: Six patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Each patient had one ROTEM® performed. All patients had supranormal clot amplitude at 10 min (A10) and supranormal clot firmness (maximal clot firmness) measured in at least one ROTEM® pathway, and five were supranormal on all pathways. Minimal clot lysis was present on all analyses. Fibrinogen and D-dimer were elevated and routine markers of coagulation within normal ranges in all patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit exhibit a hypercoagulable state which is not appreciable on conventional tests of coagulation. Supranormal clot firmness, minimal fibrinolysis, and hyperfibrinogenaemia are key findings. Further research is required into the pathophysiology of this hypercoagulable state, as well as the harms and benefits of different anticoagulation strategies.","Collett, Luke Wallace; Gluck, Samuel; Strickland, Richard Michael; Reddi, Benjamin John",Aust. crit. care,445,30

Mitigating the COVID-19 transmission requires not only the state and federal level order of protective measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public awareness of time-dependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We propose a robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of SARS-CoV-2 at all US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths, and we use the daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a community. We found that shortening by [Formula: see text] of the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 can reduce around [Formula: see text] (or 78 K, [Formula: see text] CI: [66 K , 89 K ]) of the COVID-19 associated deaths in the US as of 20 September 2020. Our findings also indicate that reducing infection and deaths by a shortened infectious period is more pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction number close to 1, suggesting that testing should be used along with other mitigation measures, such as social distancing and facial mask-wearing, to reduce the transmission rate. Our deliverable includes a dynamic county-level map for local officials to determine optimal policy responses and for the public to better understand the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 on each day.","Li, Hanmo; Gu, Mengyang",Sci Rep,445,26

This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity to study the propagation pattern of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan based on several assumptions to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases considering that perhaps not all cases could be detected and reported in the complex situation there. Then we used the equation derived from the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to calculate R0 from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R0 and temperature and humidity for four major cities in China to see the association between the transmissibility of COVID-19 and the weather variables. RESULTS: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45 000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R0 in Wuhan was 2.7, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.8 to 2.4. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R0 in Wuhan. R0 negatively correlated with both temperature and humidity, which was significant at the 0.01 level. CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of COVID-19 was strong and importance should be attached to the intervention of its transmission especially in Wuhan. According to the correlation between R0 and weather, the spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms.","Guo, Xiao-Jing; Zhang, Hui; Zeng, Yi-Ping",Infect Dis Poverty,445,23

Several scores for quantifying the degree of involvement have been described, although there is no evidence to show that they have any capacity for predicting unfavorable progress. METHODOLOGY: Prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The sample was stratified according to clinical course, and patients requiring invasive or non-invasive respiratory support were classified as having unfavorable progress. Biomarkers were analyzed at admission and on the same day that thoracic ultrasound was performed. Prognostic scales were also determined at admission. The ultrasound score was obtained in 8 or 14 areas, depending on the patient's ability to sit. RESULTS: We included 44 patients, 13 (29,5%) of whom subsequently needed ventilatory support. Eight areas were explored in all patients and 14 areas in 35 (79.5%). The most affected areas were the posterior lower lobes. Significant differences were found between the 2groups on the SOFA and quick SOFA multidimensional scales, and PCR and LDH on the same day as thoracic ultrasound, and the ultrasound scores. The best area under the ROC curve (AUC) was obtained with the 14-area score, with a result of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99). Its sensitivity and specificity for a cut-off score of 13.5 were 100% and 61.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of scores to quantify lung involvement measured by thoracic ultrasound provides useful information, facilitating risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Ramos Hernández, Cristina; Botana Rial, Maribel; Pazos Area, Luis Alberto; Núñez Fernández, Marta; Pérez Fernández, Silvia; Rubianes González, Martín; Crespo Casal, Manuel; Fernández Villar, Alberto",Arch. bronconeumol.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether point-of-care (POC) PCR testing can be used to reduce staff sick days and improve diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Using a cross-over design, the cobas® Liat® Influenza A/B POC PCR test (Liat) was compared with standard clinical practice during the 2019/2020 influenza season. All adult patients (aged &#8805; 18 years) with fever (&#8805;38°C) and respiratory symptoms were included. Primary end points were the prevalence of influenza infections in the ED and staff sick days. Secondary end points were frequency of antiviral and antibacterial therapy, time between admission and test result or treatment initiation, patient disposition, ED length of stay (LOS), and for inpatients mortality and LOS. Nurses were interviewed about handling and integration of POC testing. The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections coincided with the second half of the study. RESULTS: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study. All 375 patients of the intervention group were tested with Liat, and 103 patients of them (27.6%) tested positive. During the intervention period, staff sick days were reduced by 34.4% (P = .023). Significantly, more patients in the intervention group received antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors (7.2% vs 3.8%, P = .028) and tested patients received antibiotics more frequently (40.0% vs 31.6%, P = .033). Patients with POC test were transferred to external hospitals significantly more often (5.6% vs 1.3%, P = .01). CONCLUSION: We conclude that POC testing for influenza is useful in the ED, especially if it is heavily frequented by patients with respiratory symptoms.","Perlitz, Benjamin; Slagman, Anna; Hitzek, Jennifer; Riedlinger, Dorothee; Möckel, Martin",Influenza other respir. viruses,445,1

This restricts the application of deep learning methods to design algorithms that can effectively identify or authenticate people for vein recognition. This paper proposes an architecture using Siamese neural network structure for few shot palm vein identification. The proposed network uses images from both the palms and consists of two sub-nets that share weights to identify a person. The architecture performance was tested on the HK PolyU multi spectral palm vein database with limited samples.

We describe how it can be exposed through implicit association tests (IATs) and we demonstrate the shy voter effect in a small survey on opinions in Ireland towards the United Kingdom. We argue for inclusion of IATs in traditional polling and point to the fact that these can be conducted accurately online, which also allows polling to reach a larger and more diverse sample of respondents in the days of Covid-19 restrictions which restricts the opportunities for poll sampling from the general public.","Smeaton, Alan; Lee, Hyowon; Morris, Niamh; Hanley, David",,445,7

Despite its common presentation as respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 have also shown neurological manifestation especially stroke. Therefore, the authors sought to determine the etiology, underlying risk factors, and outcomes among patients with COVID-19 presenting with stroke. We conducted a systematic review of the electronic database (PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) using different MeSH terms from November 2019 to June 2020. A total of 39 patients with stroke from 6 studies were included. The mean age of our included patients was 61.4 ± 14.2 years. Majority of the patients (n = 36, 92.3%) with COVID-19 had ischemic stroke, 5.1% (n = 2) had hemorrhagic stroke, and 2.6% (n = 1) had cerebral venous thrombosis at the time of initial clinical presentation. Almost all of the patients presented had underlying risk factors predisposing to stroke which included diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and previous history of cerebrovascular disease. 51.2% (n = 20) of the included patients infected with COVID-19 with stroke died, while remaining patients were either discharged home or transferred to a rehabilitation unit. Exploring the neurological manifestation in terms of stroke among patients with COVID-19 is a step towards better understanding of the virus, preventing further spread, and treating the patients affected by this pandemic.","Fatima, Nida; Saqqur, Maher; Qamar, Fatima; Shaukat, Samia; Shuaib, Ashfaq",Neurol Sci,445,16

Yet, very little is known about what regulation problems such self-organized study groups encounter during their learning process and how they try to cope with these problems. Therefore, this study investigates how completely self-organized groups (i.e., non-guided groups outside the classroom that form without external impulse) regulate their collaborative learning process when faced with different kinds of regulation problems. More specifically, we tested the hypotheses that members of self-organized study groups are more satisfied with their group learning experience (a) the more homogeneous their problem perceptions are within their group, (b) the more they apply immediate (rather than non-immediate) strategies to remedy their regulation problems, and (c) the more frequently they apply regulation strategies. In a longitudinal study, N = 122 students, voluntarily studying for their exams in N = 52 groups, were asked to indicate the types of problems they experienced, the types of strategies they used to tackle those problems, and their satisfaction with their group learning experience after each of their self-organized study meetings. Hierarchical linear modeling confirmed all hypotheses. Qualitative analysis of two selected groups' self-reported situational data provided additional insights about the mechanisms that may have contributed to the results. Our study provides important directions for future research, including the recommendation to identify the processes by which groups (a) can reach homogeneity of problem perceptions and (b) coordinate the choice of appropriate strategies within the group.","Melzner, Nadine; Greisel, Martin; Dresel, Markus; Kollar, Ingo",Int J Comput Support Collab Learn,445,24

Unfortunately, there is no cure for this disease, which highlights the need for further investigation about the pathophysiology of this disease to provide clues for developing novel therapeutic regimens. Herein, we identified that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, a potent lymphangiogenic factor, is up-regulated in endometriotic cells and contributes to increased lymphangiogenesis. Bioinformatic analysis and molecular biological characterization revealed that VEGF-C is negatively regulated by an orphan nuclear receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII). Further studies demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines, via suppression of COUP-TFII level, induce VEGF-C overexpression. More importantly, we show that functional VEGF-C is transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance the lymphangiogenic ability of lymphatic endothelial cells. Autotransplanted mouse model of endometriosis showed lenvatinib treatment abrogated the increased lymphatic vessels development in the endometriotic lesion, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and immune cells infiltration, indicating that blocking VEGF-C signaling can reduce local chronic inflammation and concomitantly endometriosis development. Evaluation of EV-transmitted VEGF-C from patients' sera demonstrates it is a reliable noninvasive way for clinical diagnosis. Taken together, we identify the vicious cycle of inflammation, COUP-TFII, VEGF-C, and lymphangiogenesis in the endometriotic microenvironment, which opens up new horizons in understanding the pathophysiology of endometriosis. VEGF-C not only can serve as a diagnostic biomarker but also a molecular target for developing therapeutic regimens.","Li, Wan-Ning; Hsiao, Kuei-Yang; Wang, Chu-An; Chang, Ning; Hsu, Pei-Ling; Sun, Chung-Hsien; Wu, Shang-Rung; Wu, Meng-Hsing; Tsai, Shaw-Jenq",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,445,20

A comparison of these structures with two configurations provides new insights for the design of substrate-based inhibitors targeting CoV. This indicates a feasible model for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against CoV-associated diseases.The structure-based optimization of these structures has yielded two more efficacious lead compounds, N and O atoms through forming the hydrogen bonding (hydrogen-bonding) with potent inhibition against CoV (Tyr160-Met161-His162) because of water polar medium which has been abbreviated as TMH in this paper.","Mollaamin, Fatemeh Monajjemi Majid",Journal of the Chilean Chemical Society,445,1

Thus, working within the communities in which racial disparities of stroke are prevalent is important.Trials working with such communities may have low participant retention at least partially attributable to social determinants of health such as limited time, transportation and access to medical care. Trial outcome adaptations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to compare in-person to virtual retention strategies as a possible strategy to improve trial retention. Methods: Reach Out is a health system focused, multi-component, health theory based, mobile health behavioral intervention to reduce blood pressure (BP) among Emergency Department (ED) patients at a safety net hospital in the under-resourced, minority, majority community of Flint, Michigan. The primary outcome is change in systolic blood pressure. Outcomes were conducted inperson from 10/4/2019 to 3/13/2020 at various locations throughout the community that were convenient for each participant. As a result of COVID-19 and the resulting state mandated stay-athome order, outcomes were converted to phone, text, and picture-based elements. Virtual outcomes consists of: 1) a texted picture validating BP cuff is in correct body placement;2) 3 self-reported blood pressures;and 3) telephone outcome survey. Virtual outcomes were offered at times convenient to participants throughout the daytime, evening, and weekend. Results: Prior to COVID-19, 6-month outcomes were conducted in-person. Of possible in-person outcomes, 76 of 140 (54%) were completed. Tele-outcomes commenced on 4/9/2020.

A detailed analysis of the first human case of HO-1 deficiency revealed that HO-1 is involved in the protection of multiple tissues and organs from oxidative stress and excessive inflammatory reactions, through the release of multiple molecules with anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory functions. HO-1 production is induced in vivo within selected cell types, including renal tubular epithelium, hepatic Kupffer cells, vascular endothelium, and monocytes/macrophages, suggesting that HO-1 plays critical roles in these cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that impaired HO-1 production results in progressive monocyte dysfunction, unregulated macrophage activation and endothelial cell dysfunction, leading to catastrophic systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Data from reported human cases of HO-1 deficiency and numerous studies using animal models suggest that HO-1 plays critical roles in various clinical settings involving excessive oxidative stress and inflammation.

The balance of protective versus pathological immune responses in COVID-19 is incompletely understood. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are antimicrobial T cells that recognize bacterial metabolites, and can also function as innate-like sensors and mediators of antiviral responses. Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in the circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses indicated significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69high and CXCR3low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and later release back into the circulation when disease is resolved. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their possible involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","Parrot, Tiphaine; Gorin, Jean-Baptiste; Ponzetta, Andrea; Maleki, Kimia T; Kammann, Tobias; Emgård, Johanna; Perez-Potti, André; Sekine, Takuya; Rivera-Ballesteros, Olga; Gredmark-Russ, Sara; Rooyackers, Olav; Folkesson, Elin; Eriksson, Lars I; Norrby-Teglund, Anna; Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf; Björkström, Niklas K; Aleman, Soo; Buggert, Marcus; Klingström, Jonas; Strålin, Kristoffer; Sandberg, Johan K",Sci. immunol,445,20

Given the high-volume of locally advanced cervical cancer in our safety-net hospital, we developed a strategy in close collaboration with our gynecology oncology and anesthesia colleagues to allow for completely clinic-based intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This technical report will highlight our experience with the use of paracervical blocks (PCBs) and oral multimodal analgesia (MMA) for appropriately selected cervical ICBT cases, allowing for completely clinic-based treatment. RESULTS: 18 of 19 (95%) screened patients were eligible for in-clinic ICBT. The excluded patient had significant vaginal fibrosis. 38 of 39 intracavitary implants were successfully transitioned for entirely in-clinic treatment utilizing PCBs and oral MMA (97% success rate). One case was aborted due to inadequate analgesia secondary to a significantly delayed case start time (PO medication effect diminished). 95% of patients reported no pain at the conclusion of the procedure. The median (IQR) D2cc for rectum and bladder were 64.8 (58.6-70.2) Gy and 84.1 (70.9-89.4) Gy, respectively. Median (IQR) CTV high-risk D90 was 88.0 (85.6-89.8) Gy. CONCLUSIONS: In a multidisciplinary effort, we have successfully transitioned many ICBT cases to the clinic with the use of PCB local anesthesia and oral multimodality therapy in direct response to the current pandemic, thereby mitigating exposure risk to patients and staff as well as reducing overall health care burden.","Brunnhoelzl, Daniel; Hanania, Alexander N; Echeverria, Alfredo; Sunde, Jan; Tran, Connie; Ludwig, Michelle",Brachytherapy,445,22

During this long period, one of the longest in Europe, the restrictions produced effects on people's psychological well-being, with consequences that also continued after lock- down. The purpose of the study is to investigate these effects and how they changed in the general population over a period of time. We are also interested in exploring people's post-lockdown anxiety and concerns. We conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The longitudinal study consisted of four administrations covering a period of 10 weeks between April (baseline) and June (last follow-up). Levels of anxiety and depression were assessed by GAD-7 and PHQ-9, coping strategies were assessed by Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and social support was assessed by MSPSS. Post-lockdown anxiety was explored by developing a set of ad-hoc questions. PCA was used to determine the principal categories of post-lockdown anxiety/concern resulting from the ad-hoc questions. Longitudinal data, given their nested structure, were analyzed through mixed modeling. Of the 411 responders at baseline, 169 had at least 3 out of 4 data points;the analysis was therefore conducted on this sample. Levels of depression and anxiety were found to be significantly higher in the study sample in comparison with normative samples for each of the four-time points;levels of coping showed that scores from the study sample were significantly lower than normative data at all-time points. Levels of perceived social support were significantly lower than normative data at the baseline and the first follow-up. The results of the study suggest that the lockdown experience had enduring consequences on the mental health of individuals. Prevention and support interventions to limit the psychological distress caused by COVID-19 should be taken into consideration in countries experiencing a second wave of the pandemic.

While the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other co-receptors has elucidated the molecular and structural basis for viral entry, the pathobiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in human tissues are less understood. Recent advances in bioengineering have opened opportunities for the use of organotypic human tissue models to investigate host-virus interactions and test antiviral drug candidates in a physiological context. Although it is too early to accurately quantify the added value of these systems compared with conventional cell systems, it can be assumed that these advanced three-dimensional (3D) models contribute toward improved result translation.

By the 1st September 2020, a staggering number of vaccines (over 200) had started pre-clinical development of which 39 had entered clinical trials, including some approaches that have not previously been licensed for human vaccines. Vaccines have been widely considered as part of the exit strategy to enable the return to previous patterns of working, schooling and socialising. Importantly, to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic, production needs to be scaled up from a small number of pre-clinical doses to enough filled vials to immunise the world's population, which requires close engagement with manufacturers and regulators. It will require a global effort to control the virus, necessitating equitable access for all countries to effective vaccines. This review explores the immune responses required to protect against SARS-CoV-2 and the potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology. It describes the profile of the different platforms and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The review also addresses the critical steps between promising pre-clinical leads and manufacturing at scale. The issues faced during this pandemic and the platforms being developed to address it will be invaluable for future outbreak control.

These studies provide us opportunities to identify signals by considering the experiments jointly. We study the question of how to provide reproducibility guarantees when we test composite null hypotheses on multiple features. Specifically, we test the unions of the null hypotheses from multiple experiments.

Considering the fact of a heavily populated and diversified country like India, we have proposed a novel fractional-order mathematical model to elicit the transmission dynamics of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the control strategy for India. The classical SEIR model is employed in three compartments, namely: quarantined immigrated population, non-quarantined asymptomatic immigrated population, and local population subjected to lockdown in the containment areas by the government of India to prevent the spread of disease in India. We have also taken into account the physical interactions between them to evaluate the coronavirus transmission dynamics. The basic reproduction number (R0) has been derived to determine the communicability of the disease. Numerical simulation is done by using the generalised Euler method. To check the feasibility of our analysis, we have investigated some numerical simulations for various fractional orders by varying values of the parameters with help of MATLAB to fit the realistic pandemic scenario. © 2021, Lviv Polytechnic National University.

As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are structurally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.","Gan, Hin Hark; Twaddle, Alan; Marchand, Benoit; Gunsalus, Kristin C",J Mol Biol,445,26

Methods: The clinical data of 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 21 to February 9, 2020. According to the patient's antiviral treatment regimen, 178 patients were divided into 4 groups including LPV/r group (59 patients), arbidol group (36 patients), combination therapy with LPV/r plus arbidol group (25 patients) and the conventional treatment group without any antiviral drugs (58 patients). The main observation end points of the study was the negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in pharyngeal swab. Results: The baseline of 4 groups before treatment was consistent and comparable. The negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the 2019-nCoV in pharyngeal swab was (10.20 ± 3.49), (10.11 ± 4.68), (10.86 ± 4.74), (8.44 ± 3.51) days separately in the LPV/r group, the arbidol group, the combination therapy group, and the conventional treatment group without significant difference (F = 2.556, P = 0.058). There was also no significant difference in the rate of negative conversion rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, the improvement ration in clinical symptoms, and the improvement ration of pulmonary infection in the lung CT imaging (P> 0.05). However, a statistically significant difference was found in the proportion of deterioration changing from mild/moderate to severe/critical type at day 7 (&#967;(2) = 9.311, P = 0.017) as follows: the combination therapy group (24.0%, 6/25), the arbidol group ( 16.7%, 6/36), LPV/r group (5.4%, 3/56) and conventional treatment group (5.2%, 3/58). Moreover, the frequency of adverse reactions in the three groups receiving antiviral drugs was significantly higher than that in the conventional treatment group (&#967;(2) = 14.875, P = 0.002). Conclusions: No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients.

METHODS: In this study, we used data provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) and analyzed a total of 5,068 patients with COVID-19, excluding 19 pregnant women and 544 individuals with missing data. We performed logistic regression analysis to determine the impact of early symptoms on survival and severe disease. Logistic regression models included sex, age, number of comorbidities, symptoms on admission, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature as explanatory variables, and death and oxygen therapy as outcome variables. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses revealed that the male sex, older age (&#8805; 60 years), higher number of comorbidities, presence of symptoms on admission, heart rate &#8805; 120 bpm, and body temperature &#8805; 37.5°C presented with higher risk of in-hospital death and oxygen therapy requirement. Conversely, rhinorrhea and headache were associated with a low risk of death and oxygen therapy requirement.

Recently, the severity of COVID-19 has been attributed to a systemic, thrombotic, and inflammatory disease that damages not only the lungs but also multiple organs, including the heart, brain, toes, and liver. This systemic form of COVID-19 may be due to inflammation and vascular endothelial cell injury. The vascular endothelial glycocalyx comprises glycoproteins and plays an important role in systemic capillary homeostasis maintenance. The glycocalyx covers the entire vascular endothelium, and its thickness varies among organs. The endothelial glycocalyx is very thin in the pulmonary capillaries, where it is affected by gaseous exchange with the alveoli and the low intravascular pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Despite the clearly important roles of the glycocalyx in vascular endothelial injury, thrombosis, vasculitis, and inflammation, the link between this structure and vascular endothelial cell dysfunction in COVID-19 remains unclear. In this prospective review, we summarize the importance of the glycocalyx and its potential as a therapeutic target in cases of systemic COVID-19.","Okada, Hideshi; Yoshida, Shozo; Hara, Akira; Ogura, Shinji; Tomita, Hiroyuki",Microcirculation,445,20

The BBB selectively regulates the transport of large molecules into the brain and thereby maintains brain homeostasis. Receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) is one mechanism to deliver essential proteins into the brain parenchyma. Receptors expressed in the brain endothelial cells have been explored to ferry therapeutic antibodies across the BBB in bifunctional antibody formats. In this study, we generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to the basigin receptor, which recently has been proposed as a target for RMT across the BBB. Antibody binding properties such as affinity have been demonstrated to be important factors for transcytosis capability and efficiency. Nevertheless, studies of basigin mAb properties' effect on RMT are limited. Here we characterize different basigin mAbs for their ability to associate with and subsequently internalize human brain endothelial cells. The mAbs were profiled to determine whether receptor binding epitope and affinity affected receptor-mediated uptake efficiency. By competitive epitope binning studies, basigin mAbs were categorized into five epitope bins. mAbs from three of the epitope bins demonstrated properties required for RMT candidates judged by binding characteristics and their superior level of internalization in human brain endothelial cells.","Christensen, Sarah Christine; Krogh, Berit Olsen; Jensen, Allan; Andersen, Christian Brix Folsted; Christensen, Søren; Nielsen, Morten Schallburg",Sci Rep,445,29

Although these measures were proven to be successful in stopping the outbreak in China, the potential adverse effects of countrywide quarantine have not been thoroughly investigated. METHODS: In this study, we performed an online survey to evaluate the psychological effects of quarantine using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale in February 2020 when the outbreak had nearly peaked in China. Along with the anxiety scores, limited personal information, such as age, gender, region, education, occupation, and specifically, the type and duration of quarantine, was collected for analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 992 valid questionnaires from 23 provinces in China, clinically significant anxiety symptoms were observed in 9.58% of respondents according to clinical diagnostic standards in China. The specific groups of people showing higher levels of anxiety were (a) adolescents (<18 years); (b) respondents with education lower than junior high school; (c) people with chronic diseases; and (d) frontline medical personnel. Other characteristics, such as gender, marital status, region, and acquaintance with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, did not affect anxiety levels significantly. Respondents who experienced different forms of quarantine showed different anxiety levels. People undergoing centralized quarantine have higher levels of anxiety. Unexpectedly, longer durations of quarantine did not lead to a significant increase in anxiety level. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a rather mild psychological influence caused by the countrywide quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide a reference for other countries and regions battling COVID-19.","Zhu, Jing; Su, Li; Zhou, Yi; Qiao, Juan; Hu, Wei",Brain Behav,445,26

This study was designed to develop a national health emergency management program based on risk assessment for COVID-19. METHOD: Mixed-methods research was used. Based on recommendations of the national epidemiology committee, two risk scenarios were used as basic scenarios for risk assessment. Two rounds of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted between January and May 2020 with thirty representatives of the health system. The data were collected, analyzed, and Integrated by the research team. FINDINGS: In the risk matrix, ""Contamination of environment and Individuals"" and ""Burn out of Medical staff"" occupied the red zone (Intolerable risk). ""Defects in screening and admissions"", ""Process disruption in Medical care and Rehabilitation"", ""Increased mental disorders"", ""Social dissatisfaction"","" The decline in healthcare Services"", and ""Loss of medical staff"" were identified as the orange zone (Significant risk) of the matrix. CONCLUSION: The risk of environmental, individual contamination, and healthcare workers' burnout is the priority in Iran.

Native T1 mapping in particular has shown promise as a useful biomarker to support diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic decision-making in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies. METHODS: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Bayesian inference are a category of artificial neural networks which model the uncertainty of the network output. This study presents an automated framework for tissue characterisation from native shortened modified Look-Locker inversion recovery ShMOLLI T1 mapping at 1.5 T using a Probabilistic Hierarchical Segmentation (PHiSeg) network (PHCUMIS 119-127, 2019). In addition, we use the uncertainty information provided by the PHiSeg network in a novel automated quality control (QC) step to identify uncertain T1 values. The PHiSeg network and QC were validated against manual analysis on a cohort of the UK Biobank containing healthy subjects and chronic cardiomyopathy patients (N=100 for the PHiSeg network and N=700 for the QC). We used the proposed method to obtain reference T1 ranges for the left ventricular (LV) myocardium in healthy subjects as well as common clinical cardiac conditions. RESULTS: T1 values computed from automatic and manual segmentations were highly correlated (r=0.97). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the automated and manual measurements. The average Dice metric was 0.84 for the LV myocardium. The sensitivity of detection of erroneous outputs was 91%. Finally, T1 values were automatically derived from 11,882 CMR exams from the UK Biobank. For the healthy cohort, the mean (SD) corrected T1 values were 926.61 (45.26), 934.39 (43.25) and 927.56 (50.36) for global, interventricular septum and free-wall respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed pipeline allows for automatic analysis of myocardial native T1 mapping and includes a QC process to detect potentially erroneous results. T1 reference values were presented for healthy subjects and common clinical cardiac conditions from the largest cohort to date using T1-mapping images.","Puyol-Antón, Esther; Ruijsink, Bram; Baumgartner, Christian F; Masci, Pier-Giorgio; Sinclair, Matthew; Konukoglu, Ender; Razavi, Reza; King, Andrew P",J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,445,2

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence and severity of new T1DM cases in children in Romania. We analyzed the differences between a group of 312 patients diagnosed with T1DM in the period 2003–2019 and a group of 147 children diagnosed during the pandemic. The data were investigated using statistical analysis of a series of relevant variables. The total number of newly diagnosed T1DM increased by 30.08% in the period March 2020–February 2021 compared to the previous years. The patients in the pandemic group had a higher mean age at the onset of T1DM, were less frequently living in an urban area, and presented a higher mean value of HbA1c. Diabetic ketoacidosis at the onset of T1DM was 67.40% more frequent, and a higher percentage of these patients presented with a severe form.

This study aimed to test whether levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in combination with D-dimer were predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical characteristics of 305 COVID-19 patients were analysed and were compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Of the 305 patients, 85 (27.9%) died and 220 (72.1%) were discharged from hospital. Compared with discharged cases, non-survivor cases were older and their BUN and D-dimer levels were significantly higher (P < 0.0001). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable Cox regression analyses identified BUN and D-dimer levels as independent risk factors for poor prognosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated levels of BUN and D-dimer were associated with increased mortality (log-rank, P < 0.0001). The area under the curve for BUN combined with D-dimer was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97), with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 91%. Based on BUN and D-dimer levels on admission, a nomogram model was developed that showed good discrimination, with a concordance index of 0.94. Together, initial BUN and D-dimer levels were associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. The combination of BUN &#8805; 4.6 mmol/L and D-dimer &#8805; 0.845 µg/mL appears to identify patients at high risk of in-hospital mortality, therefore it may prove to be a powerful risk assessment tool for severe COVID-19 patients.","Cheng, Anying; Hu, Liu; Wang, Yiru; Huang, Luyan; Zhao, Lingxi; Zhang, Congcong; Liu, Xiyue; Xu, Ranran; Liu, Feng; Li, Jinping; Ye, Dawei; Wang, Tao; Lv, Yongman; Liu, Qingquan",Int J Antimicrob Agents,445,16

We assessed whether COVID-19 worry was related to indicators of mental health and preparedness for future care, in an adult lifespan sample. METHOD: An online study (n = 485; age 18-82, M = 49.31, SD = 15.39) included measures of COVID-19 worry, depression, general anxiety, health anxiety, hostile and benevolent ageism, preparedness for future care, and demographic information. RESULTS: Age and living alone were positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry, as were health anxiety, general anxiety, benevolent ageism, and preparedness for future care needs via gathering information. A significant interaction indicated that among individuals reporting lower health anxiety, greater preference for gathering information was positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry; however, for individuals having high health anxiety, gathering information about future care was not related to COVID-19 worry, as their COVID-19 worry levels were moderately high. CONCLUSION: Older age was associated with greater COVID-19 worry, perhaps in response to the much publicized greater risk for negative outcomes in this population. In spite of this specific concern, indicators of older adults' continued mental health emerged. Preparedness for future care is also highlighted, as well as clinical implications.","Maxfield, Molly; Pituch, Keenan A",Aging Ment Health,445,24

However, the effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes, and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterized by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment is likely to alter the expression of the key entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the human kidney. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, Xiao; Eales, James M; Scannali, David; Nazgiewicz, Alicja; Prestes, Priscilla; Maier, Michelle; Denniff, Matthew; Xu, Xiaoguang; Saluja, Sushant; Cano-Gamez, Eddie; Wystrychowski, Wojciech; Szulinska, Monika; Antczak, Andrzej; Byars, Sean; Skrypnik, Damian; Glyda, Maciej; Król, Robert; Zywiec, Joanna; Zukowska-Szczechowska, Ewa; Burrell, Louise M; Woolf, Adrian S; Greenstein, Adam; Bogdanski, Pawel; Keavney, Bernard; Morris, Andrew P; Heagerty, Anthony; Williams, Bryan; Harrap, Stephen B; Trynka, Gosia; Samani, Nilesh J; Guzik, Tomasz J; Charchar, Fadi J; Tomaszewski, Maciej",Eur. heart j,445,24

The inhalation of traffic-related air pollution, including NO2, can cause a range of problems to human health. Due to their developing organs, children are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of air pollution inhalation. Accordingly, schools and associated travel behaviours present an important area of study for the reduction of child exposure to these harmful pollutants. COVID-19 reached the UK in late January 2020. On the 23rd of March that year, the UK government announced a nationwide stay-at-home order, or lockdown, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside of their own homes. The lockdown was accompanied by the closure of schools, public facilities, amenities, businesses and places of worship. The current study aims to assess the significance of nationwide NO2 reductions at schools in England as a consequence of the lockdown in order to highlight the benefits of associated behavioural changes within the context of schools in England and potential child exposure. NO2 data were collected from all AURN (Automatic Urban and Rural Network) monitoring sites within 500 m of nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges in England. A significant reduction of mean NO2 concentrations was observed in the first month of the UK lockdown at background (-35.13%) and traffic (-40.82%) sites. Whilst lockdown restrictions are undoubtedly unsustainable, the study results demonstrate the possible reductions of NO2 at schools in England and potential reductions of child exposure that are achievable when public behaviours shift towards active travel, work from home policies and generally lower use of polluting vehicles.","Brown, Louis; Barnes, Jo; Hayes, Enda",Sci Total Environ,445,1

Early SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a powerful transcriptomic response in peripheral blood with conserved components that are heavily interferon-driven but also marked by indicators of early B-cell activation and antibody production. Interferon responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrate unique patterns of dysregulated expression compared to other infectious and healthy states. Heterogeneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways are present in early COVID-19, as are IL1 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which persist into late disease. Classifiers based on differentially expressed genes accurately distinguished SARS-CoV-2 infection from other acute illnesses (auROC 0.95 [95% CI 0.92-0.98]).

When technicians visually analyzed the antigen test results, the sensitivity was 71.6% (95% CI: 59.9%-81.5%) and the specificity was 99.2% (95% CI: 98.5%-99.7%). Among symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 89.4% (95% CI; 76.9%-96.5%) with digital immunoassay antigen tests, and 85.1% (95% CI; 71.7%-93.8%) with visually analyzed the antigen test, respectively. ConclusionsThe findings indicated that RapidTesta SARS-CoV-2 analysis with the DIA device had sufficient analytical performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples. When positive DIA results are recorded without a visually recognizable red line at the positive line location on the test cassette, additional RT-PCR evaluation should be performed.","Suzuki, Hiromichi; Akashi, Yusaku; Ueda, Atsuo; Kiyasu, Yoshihiko; Takeuchi, Yuto; Maehara, Yuta; Ochiai, Yasushi; Okuyama, Shinya; Notake, Shigeyuki; Nakamura, Koji; Ishikawa, Hiroichi",,445,26

Prefectures with larger bilateral migration flows and shorter travel distances with Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, experienced a wider spread of COVID-19. In addition, richer prefectures with higher incomes were better able to contain the virus at the early stages of community transmission. Using a spatial general equilibrium model, we show that around 28% of the infections outside Hubei province can be explained by the rapid development in transportation infrastructure and the liberalization of migration restrictions in the recent decade.","Li, Bingjing; Ma, Lin",J Urban Econ,445,24

The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions as well as the underlying economic policies behind the loans that IFIs are granting to States are studied, identifying clear signals that fiscal discipline and pro-market options will continue being the priorities as soon as the emergency has been overcome. The study explains how the adjustment and austerity policies implemented in the countries in the region have adversely and disproportionally affected women's rights, in particular reinforcing the invisibilization of gender inequalities in the domestic and care work and how this situation, in turn, has put women in a situation of greater vulnerability to the pandemic. It also criticizes the (self)called ""gender approach"" of IFIs for being merely instrumental to economic growth without consideration to the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's rights. The responsibility of IFIs for complicity with economic reforms with known adverse effects on gender equality is studied. Given the policy and legal implications of the findings presented in this research, the article concludes that States in the region should consider carefully the conditions of the loans being offered by IFIs, for which it is crucial to conduct ex ante evaluations of the impact of these financial contacts on the human rights of the population, and in particular on gender equality.","Bohoslavsky, Juan Pablo; Rulli, Mariana",Rev.

In particular, the concept of multiplex network is utilized to differentiate between social interactions that happen in households and workplaces. In addition, weak interactions among crowds, transient interactions within social gatherings, and dense human contact between foreign workers in dormitories are also taken into consideration. Such a categorization in terms of a multiplex of social network connections together with the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) epidemic model have enabled a more precise study of the feasibility and efficacy of control measures such as social distancing, work from home, and lockdown, at different moments and stages of the pandemics. Using this model, we study an epidemic outbreak that occurs within densely populated residential areas in Singapore. Our simulations show that residents in densely populated areas could be infected easily, even though they constitute a very small fraction of the whole population. Once infection begins in these areas, disease spreading is uncontrollable if appropriate control measures are not implemented.","Chung, N N; Chew, L Y",Sci Rep,445,16

For example, a location-disease-time tensor of case counts can have multiple delayed updates of recent temporal slices for some locations or diseases. Recovering such missing or noisy (under-reported) elements of the input tensor can be viewed as a generalized tensor completion problem. Existing tensor completion methods usually assume that i) missing elements are randomly distributed and ii) noise for each tensor element is i.i.d. zero-mean. Both assumptions can be violated for spatio-temporal tensor data. We often observe multiple versions of the input tensor with different under-reporting noise levels. The amount of noise can be time- or location-dependent as more updates are progressively introduced to the tensor. We model such dynamic data as a multi-version tensor with an extra tensor mode capturing the data updates. We propose a low-rank tensor model to predict the updates over time. We demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the ground-truth values of many real-world tensors. We obtain up to 27.2% lower root mean-squared-error compared to the best baseline method. Finally, we extend our method to track the tensor data over time, leading to significant computational savings.","Qian, Cheng; Kargas, Nikos; Xiao, Cao; Glass, Lucas; Sidiropoulos, Nicholas; Sun, Jimeng",,445,16

Consequently, a large number of long single-stranded DNA products can be produced, and these negatively charged DNA products will bind a massive of positively charged electroactive molecular of Ru(NH3)63+ due to the electrostatic adsorption. Therefore, significantly amplified electrochemical signals can be generated for sensitive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the range of 0.1-1000 pM with the detection limit as low as 26 fM.

In this study, we present a novel mixed reality (MR) tool to simulate and guide learners through a simple fault diagnosis task of a three-phase power supply. The tool was created as a web-based application that could be accessed from budget smartphones in order to cover the majority of users. Comparisons were made between novices using MR guidance and those with more experience in the task who did not have additional guidance, finding that the novices outperformed the experts across all metrics measured. This indicates that MR could be a valuable tool to supplement traditional vocational learning methods, particularly at a time when physical access to equipment and facilities is scarce. MR has applications across the engineering industry, but the target task of a three-phase power supply was chosen as it has particular relevance to the offshore wind industry, which faces a shortage of skilled engineers and technicians in the coming years.","Smith, Eleanor McRae Kenneth Semple Gordon Welsh Hugh Evans Dorothy Blackwell Paul",Sustainability,445,16

This study aimed to evaluate postdischarge SARS-CoV-2 status of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy that, at birth, were negative to SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational study of neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Seven pregnant women with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection have been evaluated in our institution. One woman had a spontaneous abortion at 8 weeks of gestational age, four women recovered and are still in follow-up, and two women delivered. Two newborns were enrolled in the study. At birth and 3 days of life, newborns were negative to SARS-CoV-2. At 2-week follow-up, one newborn tested positive although asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of follow-up of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy, since they remain at risk of contracting the infection in the early period of life and long-term consequences are still unknown. KEY POINTS: · Newborns to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy can acquire the infection later after birth.. · Newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy need a long-term follow-up, even if they tested negative at birth.. · Specific guidelines for the long-term follow-up of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy are needed..","Buonsenso, Danilo; Costa, Simonetta; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Cattani, Paola; Posteraro, Brunella; Marchetti, Simona; Carducci, Brigida; Lanzone, Antonio; Tamburrini, Enrica; Vento, Giovanni; Valentini, Piero",Am J Perinatol,445,17

The goal of this study was to predict the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants from genomic sequence data. METHODS: we used a target-based molecular modeling strategy combined with surface potential analysis of the NTD and RBD. RESULTS: we observed that both domains act synergistically to ensure optimal virus adhesion, which explains why most variants exhibit concomitant mutations in the RBD and in the NTD. Some mutation patterns affect the affinity of the spike protein for ACE-2. However, other patterns increase the electropositive surface of the spike, with determinant effects on the kinetics of virus adhesion to lipid raft gangliosides. Based on this new view of the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants, we defined an index of transmissibility (T-index) calculated from kinetic and affinity parameters of coronavirus binding to host cells. The T-index is characteristic of each variant and predictive of its dissemination in animal and human populations. CONCLUSIONS: the T-index can be used as a health monitoring strategy to anticipate future Covid-19 outbreaks due to the emergence of variants of concern.","Fantini, Jacques; Yahi, Nouara; Azzaz, Fodil; Chahinian, Henri",J Infect,445,16

Inflammatory cytokines specific to early prognostication in this population have not been well studied. We evaluated whether novel inflammatory cytokines obtained from adults with IHCA helped predict favorable neurologic outcome. METHODS: The study population included adults with IHCA who underwent ACLS-guided resuscitation between March 2014 and May 2019 at an academic tertiary medical center. Peripheral blood samples were obtained within 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours of IHCA and analysis of 15 cytokines were performed. The primary outcome of interest was presence of favorable neurologic outcome at hospital discharge, defined as a Glasgow Outcome Score of 4 or 5. RESULTS: Of the 105 adults with IHCA studied, 27 (25.7%) were noted to have survival with a favorable neurologic outcome while 78 (74.3%) did not. Patients who survived with favorable neurologic outcome were more often men (88.9% vs 61.5%, p = 0.008) and had higher rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias as their initial rhythm (34.6% vs 11.7%, p = 0.018). Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-R1 within 6 or 24 hours were significantly lower in patients with favorable neurologic outcome compared with those who had unfavorable neurologic outcome. In multivariable analysis, IL-10 levels within 6 hours was the only independent predictor of favorable neurologic outcomes [odds ratio (OR) 0.895, 95% confidence interval 0.805-0.996, p = 0.041]. CONCLUSION: In this contemporary observational study of adults with IHCA receiving ACLS-guided resuscitative and post-resuscitative care, inflammatory cytokines specific to early prognostication in adults with IHCA exist. Further larger scale studies examining the association of these inflammatory cytokines with prognosis are warranted.","Patel, Jignesh K; Sinha, Niraj; Hou, Wei; Shah, Rian; Qadeer, Asem; Tran, Linh; Parikh, Puja B; Parnia, Sam",Resuscitation,445,1

Comparison of the post-intervention linear trends of covid-19 confirmed cases from Italy with that from Sweden shows a positive and statistically significant difference. It reflects a dynamic in the growth rate of confirmed cases in Italy higher than that observed in Sweden despite the total containment of the population. The results obtained therefore lead to the conclusion that the measure of total population containment is ineffective in the countries of the sample.

These psychological issues can even be experienced by patients who were asymptomatic or had mild to moderate symptoms, potentially impacting their quality of life. METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective observational study to analyse the psychological impact of COVID-19 in recovered patients who presented as prospective convalescent plasma (CP) donors. An interview for the psychological assessment of the prospective donors was carried out. Depression and anxiety in the participants were assessed by HAM-A, and HAM-D scores and Quality of Life were assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF scale. RESULTS: A total of 51 prospective donors were assessed, with a mean age of 34.37 (±9.08) years, with the majority being males (46). No clinically significant depression and anxiety were found on the basis of HAM-D and HAM-A scores. The worst affected quality of life parameter, based on the WHOQOL-BREF scale, was physical quality of life followed by environmental, psychological, and social relationships. Moreover, due to infection, social stigma was experienced by 49.02% of the donors, while 21.97% had anxiety related to convalescent plasma donation as a common livid experience. CONCLUSION: Poor quality of life and social stigma during the recovery phase is prevalent in COVID-19 recovered patients, for which formulation of holistic support strategies are the need of the hour.","Maheshwari, A; Varshney, M; Gupta, K; Bajpai, M",Transfus. clin. biol,445,20

It was named COVID-19, and to date, thousands of cases of infection and death are reported worldwide. This disease is associated with a wide range of symptoms, which makes accurate diagnosis of it difficult. During previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, researchers found that the patients with fever, cough, or sore throat had a 5% influenza virus-positive rate. This finding made us think that the wide range of symptoms and also relatively high prevalence of death in our patients may be due to the coinfection with other viruses. Thus, we evaluated the coinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with other respiratory viruses in dead patients in North Khorasan. We evaluated the presence of influenza A/B virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses in 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive dead patients, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR tests. We found coinfection with influenza virus in 22.3%, RSV, and bocavirus in 9.7%, parainfluenza viruses in 3.9%, human metapneumovirus in 2.9%, and finally adenovirus in 1.9% of SARS-CoV-2 positive dead cases. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of coinfection with influenza A virus and the monopoly of coinfection with Human metapneumovirus in children.","Hashemi, Seyed A; Safamanesh, Saghar; Ghasemzadeh-Moghaddam, Hamed; Ghafouri, Majid; Azimian, Amir",J. med. virol,445,23

This paper initiates the study of finding a stable many-to-one matching, under cardinal valuations, while satisfying fairness among the agents on either side. Specifically, motivated by several real-world settings, we focus on leximin optimal fairness and seek leximin optimality over many-to-one stable matchings. We first consider the special case of ranked valuations where all agents on each side have the same preference orders or rankings over the agents on the other side (but not necessarily the same valuations). For this special case, we provide a complete characterisation of the space of stable matchings. This leads to FaSt, a novel and efficient algorithm to compute a leximin optimal stable matching under ranked isometric valuations (where, for each pair of agents, the valuation of one agent for the other is the same). The running time of FaSt is linear in the number of edges. Building upon FaSt, we present an efficient algorithm, FaSt-Gen, that finds the leximin optimal stable matching for ranked but otherwise unconstrained valuations. The running time of FaSt-Gen is quadratic in the number of edges. We next establish that, in the absence of rankings, finding a leximin optimal stable matching is NP-Hard, even under isometric valuations. In fact, when additivity and non-negativity are the only assumptions on the valuations, we show that, unless P=NP, no efficient polynomial factor approximation is possible. When additivity is relaxed to submodularity, we find that not even an exponential approximation is possible.","Narang, Shivika; Biswas, Arpita; Narahari, Y",,445,16

Treatment varies from topicals to systemic drugs and data on susceptibility to viral infections in psoriatic patients are scarce. The objectives of this study were to analyze psoriatic patients on different therapies who were at risk for COVID-19 for seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, comorbidities and outcomes in order to unveil the immunological mechanisms involved in the anti-viral response in patients with psoriasis. Seventy-five patients with psoriasis were divided according to treatment: immunobiologics, methotrexate, topicals and acitretin. Twenty healthy controls were included. Plasma samples were collected for: IgG SARS-COV-2 (ELISA);IL-27, IL-29 and IL-18 (ELISA);and IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNF (cytometric array). Seropositivity for SARS-COV-2 was detected in 24 out of 75 psoriasis patients and did not relate to COVID-19 symptoms and/or hospitalization, despite associated comorbidities. Psoriasis patients who were asymptomatic for SARS-COV-2 exhibited immune imbalance with high levels of IL-18, IL-17A and IL-6, and low levels of IL-27 compared to healthy controls. Psoriasis groups showed significant increased cytokine levels only in the group with immunobiologics. Despite immune deviations and lower IL-27, which has a potential antiviral impact, psoriatic patients did not exhibit complications related to COVID-19. An understanding of this kind of proinflammatory profile of psoriatic patients and of the lack of severe outcomes for COVID-19 is essential to establish novel therapeutic approaches and preventive measures, including with regard to the concomitance of viral infections.","Yendo, Tatiana Mina Sato Maria Notomi Branco Anna Cláudia Calvielli Castelo Pietrobon Anna Julia Teixeira Franciane Mouradian Emidio Ramos Yasmim Álefe Leuzzi Alberca Ricardo Wesley Valêncio Cesar Giudice Arruda Vivian Nunes Romiti Ricardo Arnone Marcelo Hirayama André Luis da Silva Duarte Alberto Jose da Silva Aoki Valeria Orfali Raquel Leao",Vaccines,445,1

On the other hand, due to the unexpected 'extra time' there was room for new experiences and for personal reflections on what is essential in life, to perceive nature and relations more consciously etc. We, therefore, intended to analyze perceived changes of attitudes and behaviors during the time of lockdown, and whether these perceptions would contribute to personal wellbeing during the pandemic. METHODS: An anonym cross-sectional online survey was performed for data collection, using standardized questionnaires, i.e., the WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO-5), Brief Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale (BMLSS), Awe/Gratitude scale (GrAw-7), and the newly developed Perceived Changes Questionnaire (PCQ). RESULTS: Within the number of respondents (n = 1277), women were predominating (67.5%). Participants' mean age was 50.9 ± 14.9 years. Exploratory factor analyses showed that the 24-item Perceived Changes Questionnaire differentiated five factors that would account for 61% of variance: (1) Nature/Silence/Contemplation (Cronbach's alpha = .87), (2) Spirituality (Cronbach's alpha = .83), (3) Relationships (Cronbach's alpha = .80), (4) Reflection on life (Cronbach's alpha = .74), (5) Digital media usage (Cronbach's alpha = .74). Strongest changes were observed for Relationships and Nature/Silence/Contemplation. Perceived changes were stronger among older persons, among persons with higher wellbeing, and among those who relied on their faith as a resource. These changes were predicted best by a person's perception of wondering awe in distinct situations with subsequent feelings of gratitude. Stepwise regression analyzes revealed that participants' wellbeing was explained best by low perceived burden and high life satisfaction (R2 = .46). Awe/gratitude, perceived changes in terms of Nature/Silence/Contemplation and low Reflections of live are further variables that would predict a person's wellbeing among the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: During the Corona pandemic, people tried to find ways to adapt to the outcomes of the restrictions. The perceived changes of attitudes and behaviors can be interpreted in terms of a reappraisal strategy. These can be measured with the extended version of the PCQ which was found to have good quality indices and a plausible factor structure. The reported changes contribute to persons' wellbeing only to some extend, indicating that they represent an independent quality of relevance in peoples' life.","Büssing, Arndt; Rodrigues Recchia, Daniela; Hein, Rudolf; Dienberg, Thomas",Health Qual Life Outcomes,445,16

More precisely, the principle of respect for autonomy has been shown to be ill suited to face the ethical challenges posed by the current health crisis. Individual wishes and choices have been subordinated to public interests. Patients have received trial therapies under extraordinary procedures of informed consent. The principle of respect for autonomy, at least in its mainstream interpretation, has been particularly questioned during this pandemic. Further reflection on the nature and value of autonomy is urgently needed. Relational autonomy has been proposed as an alternative account of autonomy that can more adequately respond to contemporary ethical issues in general and to a pandemic such as the one we are currently facing in particular. As relational autonomy is an emerging notion in current bioethics, it requires further consideration and development to be properly operationalized. This paper aims to show how six different philosophical branches--namely, philosophy of nature, philosophical anthropology, existential phenomenology, discourse ethics, hermeneutics, and cultural anthropology--have incorporated the category of relation throughout the twentieth century. We first delve into primary philosophical sources and then apply their insights to the specific field of medical ethics. Learning from the historical developments of other philosophical fields may provide illumination that will enable bioethics to experience a successful ""relational turn"", which has been partially initiated in contemporary bioethics but not yet achieved.","Gómez-Vírseda, Carlos; Usanos, Rafael Amo",Med. health care philos,445,16

Adjusted crude CFR measures can better explain the pandemic situation by improving the CFR estimation. However, no study has thoroughly investigated the COVID-19 adjusted CFR of the SAARC countries. This study estimated both survival interval and underreporting adjusted CFR of COVID-19 for these countries. Moreover, we assessed the crude CFR between genders and across age groups and observed the CFR changes due to the imposition of fees on COVID-19 tests in Bangladesh. Using the daily records up to October 9, we implemented a statistical method to remove the delay between disease onset and outcome bias, and due to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases, reporting rates lower than 50% (95% CI: 10%-50%) bias in crude CFR. We found that Afghanistan had the highest CFR, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. Our estimated crude CFR varied from 3.708% to 0.290%, survival interval adjusted CFR varied from 3.767% to 0.296% and further underreporting adjusted CFR varied from 1.096% to 0.083%. Furthermore, the crude CFRs for men were significantly higher than that of women in Afghanistan (4.034% vs. 2.992%) and Bangladesh (1.739% vs. 1.337%) whereas the opposite was observed in Maldives (0.284% vs. 0.390%), Nepal (0.006% vs. 0.007%), and Pakistan (2.057% vs. 2.080%). Besides, older age groups had higher risks of death. Moreover, crude CFR increased from 1.261% to 1.572% after imposing the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authorities of countries with higher CFR should be looking for strategic counsel from the countries with lower CFR to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to combat the pandemic.

Data regarding in-hospital mortality and its risk factors, as well as the impact of hospital overcrowding in Latin America has not been thoroughly explored. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive adult patients hospitalized with severe confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia at a SARS-CoV-2 referral center in Mexico City from February 26th, 2020, to June 5th, 2020. A total of 800 patients were admitted with confirmed diagnosis, mean age was 51.9 ± 13.9 years, 61% were males, 85% were either obese or overweight, 30% had hypertension and 26% type 2 diabetes. From those 800, 559 recovered (69.9%) and 241 died (30.1%). Among survivors, 101 (18%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 458 (82%) were managed outside the intensive care unit (ICU); mortality in the ICU was 49%. From the non-survivors, 45.6% (n = 110) did not receive full support due to lack of ICU bed availability. Within this subgroup the main cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 95% of the cases, whereas among the non-survivors who received full (n = 105) support the main cause of death was septic shock (45%) followed by ARDS (29%). The main risk factors associated with in-hospital death were male sex (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.34-3.12), obesity (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14-2.32)-in particular morbid obesity (RR 3.38, 95%CI 1.63-7.00)-and oxygen saturation < 80% on admission (RR 4.8, 95%CI 3.26-7.31). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found similar in-hospital and ICU mortality, as well as risk factors for mortality, compared to previous reports. However, 45% of the patients who did not survive justified admission to ICU but did not receive IMV / ICU care due to the unavailability of ICU beds. Furthermore, mortality rate over time was mainly due to the availability of ICU beds, indirectly suggesting that overcrowding was one of the main factors that contributed to hospital mortality.","Olivas-Martínez, Antonio; Cárdenas-Fragoso, José Luis; Jiménez, José Víctor; Lozano-Cruz, Oscar Arturo; Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; Tovar-Méndez, Víctor Hugo; Medrano-Borromeo, Carla; Martínez-Valenzuela, Alejandra; Román-Montes, Carla Marina; Martínez-Guerra, Bernardo; González-Lara, María Fernanda; Hernandez-Gilsoul, Thierry; Herrero, Alfonso Gulias; Tamez-Flores, Karla María; Ochoa-Hein, Eric; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Galindo-Fraga, Arturo; Kershenobich-Stalnikowitz, David; Sifuentes-Osornio, José",PLoS One,445,21

To recapitulate the phenotype of an adult cardiomyocyte, differentiating progenitors need to upregulate mitochondrial glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Here we cultured and differentiated CDCs using protocols aimed to maintain stemness or to promote differentiation, including triggering fatty acid oxidation using an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;). Metabolic changes were characterised in undifferentiated CDCs and during differentiation towards a cardiac phenotype. CDCs from rat atria were expanded on fibronectin or collagen IV via cardiosphere formation. Differentiation was assessed using flow cytometry and qPCR and substrate metabolism was quantified using radiolabelled substrates. Collagen IV promoted proliferation of CDCs whereas fibronectin primed cells for differentiation towards a cardiac phenotype. In both populations, treatment with 5-Azacytidine induced a switch towards oxidative metabolism, as shown by changes in gene expression, decreased glycolytic flux and increased oxidation of glucose and palmitate. Addition of a PPAR&#945; agonist during differentiation increased both glucose and fatty acid oxidation and expression of cardiac genes. We conclude that oxidative metabolism and cell differentiation act in partnership with increases in one driving an increase in the other.","Pakzad, Khadijeh Kathy; Tan, Jun Jie; Anderson, Stephanie; Board, Mary; Clarke, Kieran; Carr, Carolyn A",Stem Cell Res,445,16

Targeting host factor(s) which are critically involved in immune signaling pathways for modulation of host immunity offers to treat a broad range of infectious diseases. Upon pathogen-associated ligands binding to the Toll-like/ IL-1R family, and other cellular receptors, followed by recruitment of intracellular signaling adaptor proteins, primarily MyD88, trigger the innate immune responses. But activation of host innate immunity strongly depends on the correct function of MyD88 which is tightly regulated. Dysregulation of MyD88 may cause an imbalance that culminates to a wide range of inflammation-associated syndromes and diseases. Furthermore, recent reports also describe that MyD88 upregulation with many viral infections is linked to decreased antiviral type I IFN response, and MyD88-deficient mice showed an increase in survivability. These reports suggest that MyD88 is also negatively involved via MyD88-independent pathways of immune signaling for antiviral type I IFN response. Because of its expanding role in controlling host immune signaling pathways, MyD88 has been recognized as a potential drug target in a broader drug discovery paradigm. Targeting BB-loop of MyD88, small molecule inhibitors were designed by structure-based approach which by blocking TIR-TIR domain homo-dimerization have shown promising therapeutic efficacy in attenuating MyD88-mediated inflammatory impact, and increased antiviral type I IFN response in experimental mouse model of diseases. In this review, we highlight the reports on MyD88-linked immune response and MyD88-targeted therapeutic approach with underlying mechanisms for controlling inflammation and antiviral type I IFN response. HIGHLIGHTS: â¢ Host innate immunity is activated upon PAMPs binding to PRRs followed by immune signaling through TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins mainly MyD88. â¢ Structure-based approach led to develop small-molecule inhibitors which block TIR domain homodimerization of MyD88 and showed therapeutic efficacy in limiting severe inflammation-associated impact in mice. â¢ Therapeutic intervention of MyD88 also showed an increase in antiviral effect with strong type I IFN signaling linked to increased phosphorylation of IRFs via MyD88-independent pathway. â¢ MyD88 inhibitors might be potentially useful as a small-molecule therapeutics for modulation of host immunity against inflammatory diseases and antiviral therapy. â¢ However, prior clinical use of more in-depth efforts should be focused for suitability of the approach in deploying to complex diseases including COPD and COVID-19 in limiting inflammation-associated syndrome to infection.","Saikh, Kamal U",Immunol Res,445,29

Evidence suggests patients can auto-emit aerosols containing viable viruses, these aerosols could be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Our aim was to assess i) the degree of viable virus propagated from PAP circuit mask leak, ii) the efficacy of a ventilated plastic canopy to mitigate virus propagation. METHODS: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108â copies·mL-1) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit. Mask leak was systematically varied at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli host quantified viable virus (via plaque forming unit) settling on surfaces around the room. The efficacy of a low-cost ventilated headboard created from a tarpaulin hood and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. RESULTS: Mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose-dependent manner (&#967;2=58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Moderate mask leak (&#8805;21â L·min-1) was associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a vented mask. The highest frequency of viruses was detected on surfaces 1â m away, however, viable viruses were recorded up to 3.86â m from the source. A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates &#8805;170â m3·hr-1 eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. CONCLUSION: Mask leak from PAP may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Subclinical mask leak levels should be treated as an infectious risk. Low-cost patient hoods with HEPA filtration are an effective countermeasure.","Landry, Shane A; Barr, Jeremy J; MacDonald, Martin I; Subedi, Dinesh; Mansfield, Darren; Hamilton, Garun S; Edwards, Bradley A; Joosten, Simon A",Eur. respir. j,445,16

The secondary aims were to determine whether: 1) there were clinical predictors of COVID-19 status; and 2) whether social lockdown influenced the incidence and epidemiology of hip fractures. METHODS: A national multicentre retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting to six trauma centres or units with a hip fracture over a 46-day period (23 days pre- and 23 days post-lockdown). Patient demographics, type of residence, place of injury, presentation blood tests, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, anaesthetic, length of stay, COVID-19 status, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Of 317 patients with acute hip fracture, 27 (8.5%) had a positive COVID-19 test. Only seven (26%) had suggestive symptoms on admission. COVID-19-positive patients had a significantly lower 30-day survival compared to those without COVID-19 (64.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 45.7 to 83.3 vs 91.7%, 95% CI 88.2 to 94.8; p < 0.001). COVID-19 was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality risk adjusting for: 1) age, sex, type of residence (hazard ratio (HR) 2.93; p = 0.008); 2) Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (HR 3.52; p = 0.001); and 3) ASA (HR 3.45; p = 0.004). Presentation platelet count predicted subsequent COVID-19 status; a value of < 217 × 109/l was associated with 68% area under the curve (95% CI 58 to 77; p = 0.002) and a sensitivity and specificity of 63%. A similar number of patients presented with hip fracture in the 23 days pre-lockdown (n = 160) and 23 days post-lockdown (n = 157) with no significant (all p &#8805; 0.130) difference in patient demographics, residence, place of injury, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, ASA, or management. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was independently associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate for patients with a hip fracture. Notably, most patients with hip fracture and COVID-19 lacked suggestive symptoms at presentation. Platelet count was an indicator of risk of COVID-19 infection. These findings have implications for the management of hip fractures, in particular the need for COVID-19 testing.

Although the clinical and laboratory characteristics of this illness have been reported in patients from China and Europe, data are scant in the United States. Methods We extracted data regarding all patients hospitalized at our hospital with COVID-19 infection between March 1 and April 4, 2020. Presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and complications were recorded from electronic medical records (EMRs). The primary composite endpoint was admission to intensive care unit (ICU), shock, or death. Results We had a total of 43 patients tested for COVID-19 at the emergency room (ER) or during hospitalization, 16 (37%) of whom were admitted with COVID-19 infection. The mean age was 65.5 years and 75% were males. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (88%), and dyspnea (81%). A loss of smell and taste sensations were reported by three (19%) patients. Low oxygen saturation was present in 38% of patients, whilst 31% were hypotensive on admission. Hyponatremia (50%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 100%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 80%) were common. Acute renal failure, myocardial injury, and elevation in aminotransferases occurred in 69%, 19%, and 38% patients, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 50% of patients. A total of three patients died; all were aged 70 years or older. Conclusions Laboratory abnormalities and acute renal failure were common in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 infection in our center. Admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation were common.","Aggarwal, Saurabh; Garcia-Telles, Nelson; Aggarwal, Gaurav; Lavie, Carl; Lippi, Giuseppe; Henry, Brandon Michael",Diagnosis (Berl),445,1

METHOD: An online survey was delivered to a U.S. sample (N = 934), assessing the influences of risk perception and fear associated with COVID-19, beliefs about and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, self-efficacy, social and psychological contexts, and demographic characteristics on people's intention to get COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: Most respondents intended to get vaccinated. However, they tended to underestimate their risks of contracting COVID-19. Disease exposure led to higher uptake intent via the mediation of fear. Safety concerns negatively influenced vaccination intention, while perceived community benefits were positively associated with vaccination intention. Positive attitudes toward vaccines and recent vaccine history were positively linked to vaccination intent. CONCLUSION: This study attests the effectiveness of HBT constructs in predicting people's intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

The incident raises several questions about racism in China. How should we interpret this heavy-handed treatment of black people? Was this an isolated incident? What motivated such operations? In this article, I explain social control of Guangzhou's African communities as a problem of municipal politics. What underlies the government's heavy handed approach, I argue, are those communities' ties to rurality, which constitute a roadblock in the city's urban upgrade. Using Dengfeng Village, one of the best known African communities in China, as a case study, I show that efforts to upgrade the area by the local state and the real estate industry were frustrated by the community's status as an urban village. Africans, whom Chinese have historically associated with rurality, are seen as contributing to a space that has long been stigmatized as a spatial manifestation of rural people's lack of self-discipline. To better reveal the interconnection between social control and urban politics, I place official action in context of the history of the community's formation and the lived experience. This analysis of Dengfeng applies to various extents to other major African communities in Guangzhou. © 2020 This is an Open Access.","Huang, G.",Journal of Contemporary Eastern Asia,445,14

For maximum impact, multi-modal MRI protocols will be needed to measure the effects of SARS-CoV2 infection on the brain by diverse potentially pathogenic mechanisms, and with high reliability across multiple sites and scanner manufacturers. Methods: A multi-modal brain MRI protocol comprising sequences for T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (swMRI) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) was defined in close approximation to prior UK Biobank (UKB) and C-MORE protocols for Siemens 3T systems. We iteratively defined a comparable set of sequences for General Electric (GE) 3T systems. To assess multi-site feasibility and between-site variability of this protocol, N=8 healthy participants were each scanned at 4 UK sites: 3 using Siemens PRISMA scanners (Cambridge, Liverpool, Oxford) and 1 using a GE scanner (Kings College London). Over 2,000 Imaging Derived Phenotypes (IDPs) measuring both data quality and regional image properties of interest were automatically estimated by customised UKB image processing pipelines. Components of variance and intra-class correlations were estimated for each IDP by linear mixed effects models and benchmarked by comparison to repeated measurements of the same IDPs from UKB participants. Results: Intra-class correlations for many IDPs indicated good-to-excellent between-site reliability. First considering only data from the Siemens sites, between-site reliability generally matched the high levels of test-retest reliability of the same IDPs estimated in repeated, within-site, within-subject scans from UK Biobank. Inclusion of the GE site resulted in good-to-excellent reliability for many IDPs, but there were significant between-site differences in mean and scaling, and reduced ICCs, for some classes of IDP, especially T1 contrast and some dMRI-derived measures. We also identified high reliability of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) IDPs derived from swMRI images, multi-network ICA-based IDPs from resting-state fMRI, and olfactory bulb structure IDPs from T1, T2-FLAIR and dMRI data. Conclusion: These results give confidence that large, multi-site MRI datasets can be collected reliably at different sites across the diverse range of MRI modalities and IDPs that could be mechanistically informative in COVID brain research. We discuss limitations of the study and strategies for further harmonization of data collected from sites using scanners supplied by different manufacturers. These protocols have already been adopted for MRI assessments of post-COVID patients in the UK as part of the COVID-CNS consortium.","Duff, Eugene; Zelaya, Fernando; Almagro, Fidel Alfaro; Miller, Karla L; Martin, Naomi; Nichols, Thomas E; Taschler, Bernd; Griffanti, Ludovica; Arthofer, Christoph; Wang, Chaoyue; Bethlehem, Richard A.I.; Eickel, Klaus; Gunther, Matthias; Menon, David K; Williams, Guy; Facer, Bethany; Wood, Greta K; Lythgoe, David J; Acqua, Flavio Dell; Williams, Steven C.R.; Houston, Gavin; Keller, Simon; Breen, Gerome; Michael, Benedict D; Jezzard, Peter; Smith, Stephen M; Bullmore, Edward T",,445,23

Frontline medical workers experienced difficulty due to the high risk of being infected and long and distressing work shifts. The current study aims to evaluate psychological symptoms in frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 epidemic in China and to perform a comparison with the general population. METHODS: An online survey was conducted from 14 February 2020 to 29 March 2020. A total of 899 frontline medical workers and 1104 respondents in the general population participated. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and resilience were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and abbreviated Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 30.43%, 20.29%, and 14.49% of frontline medical workers in Hubei Province and 23.13%, 13.14%, and 10.64% of frontline medical workers in other regions reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, respectively. In addition, 23.33%, 16.67%, and 6.67% of the general population in Hubei Province and 18.25%, 9.22%, and 7.17% of the general population in other regions reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, respectively. The resilience of frontline medical staff outside Hubei Province was higher than that of the general population outside Hubei Province. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of frontline medical workers and the general public experienced psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Overall, including gold in a stock portfolio could provide a valuable asset class that can improve the risk-adjusted performance of stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we find that the estimated portfolio weights and hedge ratios are sensitive to structural breaks, and ignoring the breaks can lead to overestimation of the hedging effectiveness of gold for US sectoral stocks.

As more epidemiological data regarding COVID-19 patients is acquired, factors that increase the severity of the infection are being identified and reported. One of the most consistent co-morbidities associated with worse outcome in COVID-19 patients is diabetes, along with age and cardiovascular disease. Studies on the association of diabetes with other acute respiratory infections, namely SARS, MERS, and Influenza, outline what seems to be an underlying factor in diabetic patients that makes them more susceptible to complications. In this review we summarize what we think may be the factors driving this pattern between diabetes, aging and poor outcomes in respiratory infections. We also review therapeutic considerations and strategies for treatment of COVID-19 in diabetic patients, and how the additional challenge of this co-morbidity requires attention to glucose homeostasis so as to achieve the best outcomes possible for patients.","Mazucanti, Caio Henrique; Egan, Josephine Mary",Immun.

We advance three main arguments. First, religion plays an important role in affecting how likely it is that people will become infected with COVID-19. Second, religion should not be seen as a 'problem' with regards to COVID-19 but as an important part of the worldview and lifestyle of many people. Third, there are valuable health promotion lessons we can learn not only from the intersection of religion and other infectious diseases, but also from approaches taken within science education. Contentious science topics such as evolution and vaccine hesitancy have been effectively communicated to those with a religious faith who are disposed to reject them by reframing and considering religion as a worldview and treating those who do not accept standard scientific theories sensitively. Religion has much to contribute to health promotion, including introducing perspectives on life's meaning and on death that can differ from those held by many without religious faith. Furthermore, religious leaders are important gatekeepers to their communities and can therefore play a vital role in policy implementation, even when that policy makes no overt reference to religion. Our contention is that by working with those of faith in the context of COVID-19, health promotion can be enhanced.","Barmania, Sima; Reiss, Michael J",Glob Health Promot,445,21

COVID-19 spreads between humans through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The COVID-19 outbreak originated in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. As of 29 Sept 2020, over 235 countries, areas or territories across the globe reported a total of 33,441,919 confirmed cases, and 1,003,497 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19. Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection, but in most cases disease severity is associated with age and pre-existing diseases that compromise immunity, like cancer. Numerous reports suggest that people with cancer can be at higher risk of severe illness and related deaths from COVID-19. Therefore, managing cancer care under this pandemic is challenging and requires a collaborative multidisciplinary approach for optimal care of cancer patients in hospital settings. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients, their care, and treatment.

According to the existing clinical data, this virus not only causes respiratory diseases and affects the lungs but also induces histopathological or functional changes in various organs like the testis and also the male genital tract. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), also ACE 2 and TMPRSS2 play an important role in the cellular entry for SARS-CoV-2. Because the male genital system presents high ACE 2 expression, the importance of this pathway increases in COVID-19 cases. As the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the male genital system in direct or indirect ways and showed a negative impact on male reproduction, this paper focuses on the possible mechanisms underlying the damage caused by COVID-19 to the testis and also other components of the male genital tract.","Seymen, Cemile Merve",J. med. virol,445,16

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late phase in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 µM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 µM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached 3 times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.","Yao, Xueting; Ye, Fei; Zhang, Miao; Cui, Cheng; Huang, Baoying; Niu, Peihua; Liu, Xu; Zhao, Li; Dong, Erdan; Song, Chunli; Zhan, Siyan; Lu, Roujian; Li, Haiyan; Tan, Wenjie; Liu, Dongyang",Clin Infect Dis,445,16

Increased use of assistive technologies further aligns with the General Medical Council's aims that medical educators provide an 'accessible training experience'. The study examined medical students' receptiveness to different types of interactive teaching. Two undergraduate cohorts received teaching on the Mental State Examination, either socially-distanced delivered by traditional powerpoint or remotely by mind-mapping software on a tablet hand-held digital device. We required an effective program which would retain the popular interactive elements of Psychiatry teaching and promote inclusivity across students' diverse learning styles.MethodTwo cohorts of Year 2 students from the Universities of Dundee and St Andrew's Scottish Graduate-Entry Medicine (scotGEM) course took part in an Introduction to Psychiatry seminar which involved a presentation of the Mental State Examination. One was conducted in a face-to-face setting via traditional PowerPoint. The second was conducted via remote-conferencing with mindmaps of key concepts drawn and screen-shared live to students as teaching progressed.This was a qualitative study, with online links to questionnaires for 24 student participants across 5 domains. (1. The tutorial met my learning objectives, 2. The format was suitable for me, 3. The balance of theory and cases was suitable for me, 4. The tutorial was of appropriate length, 5. I was satisfied with the performance) Response options included: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree. A section was also included with open-ended questions pooled for thematic analysis.ResultResponse rate reached &gt;60% with &gt;80% respondents answering strongly agree across all domains. Thematic results demonstrated positive responses across both teaching sessions, with the interactive elements valued by students. Comments included: “great job was done with the delivery of the session considering it was online rather than in person”;“drawing element was fantastic”;“Good: interactivity of the session drawing and creativity element”.ConclusionThe Mental State Examination (MSE) via live-drawn mind-maps allows salient clinical information to be conceptualised in non-linear diagramatic format. This paediological approach can offer further access points across wide range of learning styles. This pilot study demonstrated such interactive components of Psychiatry teaching continue to be well received and can be effectively delivered remotely. Such sessions also serve to promote inclusivity, linking those who are geographically distant in addition to the visual learner and the neurodiverse. We aim to incorporate these dynamic teaching sessions into our online induction programs and disseminate Intelligent Tutorials to our remote and rural learners throughout Scotland.","Breslin, Kathleen Mohsen Sara Kumar Praveen",BJPsych Open,445,23

The incidence of thrombotic complications is dependent on setting (intensive care unit (ICU) versus general ward) and the threshold for performing diagnostic tests (screening versus diagnostic algorithms triggered by symptoms). Since these thrombotic complications are associated with in-hospital mortality, all current guidelines and consensus papers propose pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Several trials are ongoing to study the optimal intensity of anticoagulation for this purpose. As for the management of thrombotic complications, treatment regimens from non-COVID-19 guidelines can be adapted, with choice of anticoagulant drug class dependent on the situation. Parenteral anticoagulation is preferred for patients on ICUs or with impending clinical deterioration, while oral treatment can be started in stable patients.

Methods: We conducted a nested cross-sectional and mixed-methods study in a sample of 81 third-year medical students. Two face-to-face interventions were designed and conducted to offer tools to improve study habits, time management, and prioritizing skills. A nine-item structured questionnaire was administered. Descriptive statistics was performed for the quantitative section and thematic analysis for the qualitative section. Results: Of the study population, 74.1% (60/81) completed the online questionnaire, 65.4% were female, and the mean age of the sample was 21.4±1.2 years old. Overall, ~50% of participants affirmed that the workshops were useful to improve time management, organize tasks and adapt to the new study modality imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 60% of the students found the application of the provided tools during the interventions (SMART and COMPASS) useful to determine personal values and set a proper mindset for coping with distance learning. Further, 93.3% of the respondents applied the SMART strategy learned to set goals at least once during the confinement time. These findings were also seen in the thematic analysis. Conclusions: Overall, most of the students found the workshops useful and were able to practice what they had learned during this pandemic lockdown.

Methods Since 2010, we have conducted questionnaire surveys on all older residents, who are not certified in the long-term care insurance, living in one district of Tokyo municipality. These residents are divided into two groups by birth month, that is those born between April and September and those born between October and March, and each group completes the survey every 2?years (in April and May). Study participants were older residents who were born between April and September and who completed the survey in spring 2018 and in spring 2020, the pandemic period. Depressed mood and frailty were assessed using the Kihon Checklist, which is widely used by local governments in Japan. We had no control group in this study. Results A total of 1736 residents responded to both surveys. From 2018 to 2020, the depressed mood rate increased from 29% to 38%, and frailty increased from 10% to 16%. The incidence of depressed mood and frailty was 25% and 11%, respectively. Incidence of depressed mood was related to subjective memory impairment and difficulty in device usage, and incidence of frailty was related to being older, subjective memory impairment, lack of emotional social support, poor subjective health, and social participation difficulties. Conclusions Older people with subjective memory impairment may be a high-risk group during the coronavirus pandemic. Telephone outreach for frail older people could be an effective solution. We recommend extending the scope of the ?reasonable accommodation? concept beyond disability and including older people to build an age-friendly and crisis-resistant community.","Okamura, Tsuyoshi Sugiyama Mika Inagaki Hiroki Miyamae Fumiko Ura Chiaki Sakuma Naoko Edahiro Ayako Taga Tsutomu Tsuda Shuji Awata Shuichi",Psychogeriatrics,445,16

Research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through close contact via respiratory droplets, but there is the possibility for ocular transmission, with the conjunctiva as a conduit as well as a source of infection. DISCUSSION: Ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 include follicular conjunctivitis, and have been repeatedly noted as an initial or subsequent symptom of COVID-19-positive patients. Particularly in patients with ocular manifestations, there is evidence that the virus may present in tears, based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The virus may therefore be transmittable from the ocular surface to a new host via contact with the ocular mucosa, tears, or subsequent fomites. CONCLUSIONS: All health care professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, and use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks by both the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious.","Dockery, Dominique M; Rowe, Susannah G; Murphy, Marjorie A; Krzystolik, Magdalena G",J Emerg Med,445,15

A European regional analysis,17.696232,3.9356384,2020,"This study explored the influence of athletic identity and sports participation on the psychological well-being of athletes during a pandemic. The objective of the study was to understand the psychological impact of the coronavirus lockdown measure on athletes who were not able to carry out their normal daily routine. Athletes from nine different sports completed an online survey during the sixth week of the total lockdown in Nigeria. The online survey consists of an athletic identity scale and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data collected were analyzed using Multiple regression and the Mann-Whitney test at 0.05 level of significance. The result of the findings revealed that category of sports (individual and team) (M = 0.73, beta = -6.116) and athletic identity (M = 59.16, beta = -0.166) predicts psychological distress to some degree. Few individual sports athletes and athletes with low athletic identity are prone to higher levels of psychological distress than team sports athletes and athletes with high athletic identity during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. Individual sports athletes reported elevated levels of psychological distress compared to team sports athletes (z = -2.186, p = 0.03, r = 0.27). In conclusion, the results have confirmed that some athletes competing in individual sports experience elevated levels of psychological distress during the coronavirus pandemic, therefore they need the support of a sports psychologist during such periods to help in maintaining their psychological well-being.","Uroh, C.

We exploit a panel component of our design (N = 4,910) to strongly link anti-intellectualism and within-respondent change in mask usage. Finally, we provide experimental evidence of anti-intellectualism's importance in information search behaviour with two conjoint studies (N ~ 2,500) that show that preferences for COVID-19 news and COVID-19 information from experts dissipate among respondents with higher levels of anti-intellectual sentiment. Anti-intellectualism poses a fundamental challenge in maintaining and increasing public compliance with expert-guided COVID-19 health directives.","Merkley, Eric; Loewen, Peter John",,445,32

In modern conditions of growing threats to information security, the role of developments that provide stable and secure authentication when accessing information resources is significantly increased. These developments must provide a security level that corresponds to the importance of the protected data and the level of risk of the user’s current actions. At the same time, the authentication system should be user-friendly and have the lowest possible cost of ownership. The paper considers one of the options for creating software that meets this set of requirements based on machine learning technology. The first section of this study describes the problems (including those related to the current crisis driven by the COVID-19 pandemic) that the organizations face when building reliable user authentication systems. It also analyzes existing technologies and concludes that it is necessary to use an adaptive approach based on machine learning. The second section presents the mathematical model of an adaptive algorithm and describes the assumptions and estimates that drastically simplify the computational complexity of the algorithm. The third section considers the practical implementation option and the principles of building and functioning of the adaptive authentication system. The fourth section discusses possible scenarios for using this approach in commercial systems. The fifth section is dedicated to conclusions on the productivity and prospects of using the described technology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Noginova, L.

However, surgical skills training cannot be replaced easily by videos, as a high level of tutor-student interaction is required. Thus, we developed a new web-based surgical skill learning session (WSSL). This case-control study evaluates the surgical skills competency of medical students taught by the WSSL. METHODS: This case-control study compares WSSL with face-to-face tutorials. Students were assigned randomly to one of two groups according to the teaching method. Independent blinded assessment was performed by a standardized marking scheme, modified from the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) global rating scale. RESULTS: We recruited 62 final-year medical students into the study, with 33 randomized to the face-to-face teaching group (control group), and 29 to the WSSL group(case group) according to their student number. The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups were comparable. The mean score at the clinical competency assessment of the control group was 4.8/5 (range 4-5) and that of the case group was 4.7/5 (range 4-5) (p = 1).

They are prone to acquiring the infection and are threatened by high mortality rates in case of infection. However, HD patients were not included in the efficacy trials of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Such efficacy data would have been critical because HD patients show decreased responses against various other vaccines and this could translate to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as well. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study that contained a group of 81 HD patients and 80 healthy controls. All of them had been vaccinated with the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA vaccine (two doses, as per the manufacturer's recommendation). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody response was measured for all participants 21 days after the second dose. The groups were compared using univariate quantile regressions and a multivariate analysis. The adverse events (AEs) of the vaccination were assessed via a questionnaire. Finally, a correlation between the HBs-Antibody response and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in the HD patients was established. RESULTS: The HD patients had significantly lower Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titres than the control patients 21 days after vaccination (median was 171 U/ml for dialysis patients and 2,500 U/ml for the controls). Further, the HD group presented less AEs than the control group. No correlation was found between the antibody response to previous Hepatitis B vaccination and that of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: HD patients present highly diminished SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titres compared to a cohort of controls. Therefore, they could be much less protected by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations than expected. Further studies to test alternative vaccination schemes should be considered.","Simon, Benedikt; Rubey, Harald; Treipl, Andreas; Gromann, Martin; Hemedi, Boris; Zehetmayer, Sonja; Kirsch, Bernhard",Nephrol. dial. transplant,445,29

To mount an effective response to this epidemic, it is necessary to understand the public's perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the hypothesis that people's perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 influence their attitudes and behaviors. METHODS: This study used an open dataset of web-based questionnaires about COVID-19. The questionnaires were provided by Nexoid United Kingdom. We selected the results of a questionnaire on COVID-19-related behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions among the US public. The questionnaire was conducted from March 29 to April 20, 2020. A total of 24,547 people who lived in the United States took part in the survey. RESULTS: In this study, the average self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 was 33.2%, and 49.9% (12,244/24,547) of the respondents thought that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were less than 30%. The self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 among women was 1.35 times that of males. A 5% increase in perceived infection risk was significantly associated with being 1.02 times (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.02; P<.001) more likely to report having close contact with >10 people, and being 1.01 times (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.01; P<.001) more likely to report that cohabitants disagreed with taking steps to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, there was no significant association between participants who lived with more than 5 cohabitants or less than 5 cohabitants (P=.85). Generally, participants who lived in states with 1001-10,000 COVID-19 cases, were aged 20-40 years, were obese, smoked, drank alcohol, never used drugs, and had no underlying medical conditions were more likely to be in close contact with >10 people. Most participants (21,017/24,547, 85.6%) agreed with washing their hands and maintaining social distancing, but only 20.2% (4958/24,547) of participants often wore masks. Additionally, male participants and participants aged <20 years typically disagreed with washing their hands, maintaining social distancing, and wearing masks. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first attempt to describe the determinants of the US public's perception of the threat of COVID-19 on a large scale. The self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 differed significantly based on the respondents' genders, states of residence, ages, body mass indices, smoking habits, alcohol consumption habits, drug use habits, underlying medical conditions, environments, and behaviors. These findings can be used as references by public health policy makers and health care workers who want to identify populations that need to be educated on COVID-19 prevention and health.","Xiu, Xiaolei; Wang, Anran; Qian, Qing; Wu, Sizhu",J Med Internet Res,445,10

However, the changes of cytokine profiles of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, as well as the underlying mechanisms that are involved, remain unknown. Using a cytokine array containing 174 inflammation-related cytokines, we found significantly altered cytokine profiles in severe COVID-19 patients compared with those in mild patients or healthy controls, and identified leptin, CXCL-10, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-&#945; as the top differentially expressed cytokines. Notably, leptin showed high consistency with CXCL-10 and TNF-&#945; in predicting disease severity, and correlated with body mass index, decreased lymphocyte counts, and disease progression. Further analysis demonstrated that monocytes in severe patients with higher leptin levels were inclined toward M1 polarization. Mechanistic studies revealed that leptin synergistically up-regulated expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and surface markers with IL-6 in monocytes through STAT3 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Collectively, our results suggest that overweight COVID-19 patients were prone to have higher leptin levels, which further activated monocytes, resulting in amplified or dysregulated immune responses. Taken together, our findings argue that leptin correlates severity of COVID-19 and may indicate a possible mechanism by which overweight patients have a greater tendency to develop severe conditions.","Wang, Jingya; Xu, Yinyin; Zhang, Xiaoli; Wang, Sheng; Peng, Ziyi; Guo, Jing; Jiang, Hongmei; Liu, Jing; Xie, Ying; Wang, Jingjing; Li, Xin; Liao, Juan; Wan, Chao; Yu, Lihua; Hu, Jinsong; Liu, Beizhong; Liu, Zhiqiang",J. leukoc. biol,445,6

Recurrent incidence of secondary infections (e.g., systemic bacterial infections, cellulitis, and elevated mortality), may be associated with the presence of field-type HEV in Canadian turkey farms. We speculate that field-type HEV and vaccine/vaccine-like strains can be differentiated through analysis of the viral genomes, hexon genes, and the specific virulence factors (e.g., ORF1, E3, and fib knob domain). Nine out of sixteen spleens obtained from cases suspected of immunosuppression by HEV were analyzed. The limited data obtained showed that: (1) field-type HEV circulates in many non-vaccinated western Canadian flocks; (2) field-type HEV circulates in vaccinated flocks with increased recurrent bacterial infections; and (3) the existence of novel point mutations in hexon, ORF1, E3, and specially fib knob domains. This is the first publication showing the circulation of wild-type HEV in HEV-vaccinated flocks in Western Canada, and the usefulness of a novel procedure that allows whole genome sequencing of HEV directly from spleens, without passaging in cell culture or passaging in vivo. Further studies focusing more samples are required to confirm our observations and investigate possible vaccination failure.","Palomino-Tapia, Victor; Mitevski, Darko; Inglis, Tom; van der Meer, Frank; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal",Viruses,445,22

Here, we aim to investigate the causes, risk factors, and outcomes of AKI in COVID-19 patients. We found that angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) were mainly expressed by different cell types in the human kidney. However, in autopsy kidney samples, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleoprotein was detected in ACE2+ or TMPRSS2+ renal tubular cells, whereas the RNAscope® Assay targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike gene was positive mainly in the distal tubular cells and seldom in the proximal tubular cells. In addition, the TMPRSS2 and kidney injury marker protein levels were significantly higher in the SARS-CoV-2-infected renal distal tubular cells, indicating that SARS-CoV-2-mediated AKI mainly occurred in the renal distal tubular cells. Subsequently, a cohort analysis of 722 patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that AKI was significantly related to more serious disease stages and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The progressive increase of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level during the course of COVID-19 suggests that the patient’s condition is aggravated. These results will greatly increase the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chen, Z.; Hu, J.; Liu, L.; Chen, R.; Wang, M.; Xiong, M.; Li, Z.

This study aimed to assess whether cluster infection prevention is possible by evaluating the association between viral transmission and meteorological factors. METHODS: This study included 1263 people who were successively diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hokkaido, Japan between January 24, 2020 and June 30, 2020. After obtaining the values from the Japanese Meteorological Agency, the average scores of air temperature and humidity were calculated and compared with COVID-19 reproduction numbers, and the association between COVID-19 incidence or reproduction number and meteorological factors was assessed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 reproduction number in Hokkaido had three peaks that came several days before the surge in COVID-19 cases. The peaks are indicative of cluster infections. There was a strong negative correlation between the kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the reproduction number. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Analysis of the reproduction number is important for predicting or suppressing COVID-19 infection clusters. The authors found a strong association between meteorological factors, such as kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the incidence of COVID-19 infection.

PURPOSE: This study examined 159 counties within Georgia to identify community characteristics associated with county-level COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and death rates. METHODS: Data from the 2020 County Health Rankings, the 2010 US Census, and the Georgia Department of Public Health COVID-19 Daily Status Report were linked using county Federal Information Processing Standard codes and evaluated through multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: The percentages of children in poverty, severe housing problems, and people not proficient in the English language were significant predictors associated with increases in case, hospitalization, and death rates. Diabetic prevalence was significantly associated with increases in the hospitalization and death rates; in contrast, the percentages of people with excessive drinking and female were inversely associated with hospitalization and death rates. Other independent variables showing an association with death rate included the percentages of people reporting fair or poor health and American Indian/Alaska Native. IMPLICATION: Local authorities' proper allocation of resources and plans to address community social determinants of health are essential to mitigate disease transmission and reduce hospitalizations and deaths associated with COVID-19, especially among vulnerable groups.","Nguyen, Tran Ha; Shah, Gulzar H; Schwind, Jessica S; Richmond, Holly L",J Public Health Manag Pract,445,1

Surface contamination usually happens when infected water droplets from exhalation/sneeze/cough of COVID sick person settle on nearby surfaces. To curb this, social distancing and good hand hygiene advise is advocated by World health Organization (WHO). We argue that COVID 19 coronovirus can also be airborne in a puff cloud loaded with infected droplets generated by COVID sick person. An elementary calculation shows that a $5~\mu m$ respiratory infected droplet can remain suspended for about 9.0 minutes and a $2~\mu m$ droplet can remain suspended for about an hour!

This is found as a common population level observation during natural calamities or emergency situations like a pandemic. The current study was conducted to determine the magnitude of self-reported insomnia, and to identify its associated factors among the apparently healthy Indian adult population having access to social media during the lockdown period of COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey was conducted from April 20 - May 19, 2020 in India using online questionnaire comprising Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, variables related to concern, fear and apprehension about COVID19 pandemic, and different socio-clinical variables. The questionnaire was disseminated via different social media platforms and responses from 1081 respondents were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Moderate clinical insomnia was present in 13.32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.23%-14.50%), and severe clinical insomnia was present in 1.85% (95% CI: 1.08%-3.14%). For higher levels of insomnia mild anxiety was associated with a proportional odds ratio (OR) of 1.83 (95% CI: 1.24-2.71), and moderate and severe anxiety had an OR of 4.01 (95% CI: 2.57-6.25). Factors associated with higher severity of insomnia were middle age group (36-50 years), being a professional, living alone, perceiving COVID as serious disease, urban residence and those having comorbidity. The OR for being concerned for staying indoors was 5.09 (95% CI: 4.09-5.33), whereas the OR for fear of scarcity in availability of masks and sanitizers was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.26-1.75); and the OR for fear of unavailability of essential goods was 3.20 (95% CI: 2.06-4.98). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors like generalized anxiety, higher age, higher perceived severity, and various concerns related to COVID19 pandemic were identified to be associated with higher degrees of insomnia. Necessary psychosocial interventions, may be required to address the burden of insomnia in a timely and long-term mode.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Acharya, Rudraprasad; Dey, Abhijit; Chakraborty, Arup",Sleep Med,445,21

Specific care activities, in particular aerosol-generating procedures, may have a higher risk of transmission. The rapid emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has created significant challenges in health care facilities, particularly with severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) used to protect health care personnel (HCP). Evidence-based recommendations for what PPE to use in conventional, contingency, and crisis standards of care are needed. Where evidence is lacking, the development of specific research questions can help direct funders and investigators. OBJECTIVE: Develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support HCP in their decisions about infection prevention when caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. METHODS: IDSA formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel including front-line clinicians, infectious disease specialists, experts in infection control and guideline methodologists with representation from the disciplines of preventive care, public health, medical microbiology, pediatrics, critical care medicine and gastroenterology. The process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. RESULTS: The IDSA guideline panel agreed on eight recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other interventions undergoing evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination of direct and indirect evidence, the panel was able to provide recommendations for eight specific questions on the use of PPE for HCP providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. Where evidence was lacking, attempts were made to provide potential avenues for investigation. There remain significant gaps in the understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and PPE recommendations may need to be modified in response to new evidence.","Lynch, John B; Davitkov, Perica; Anderson, Deverick J; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Guzman-Cottrill, Judith; Dhindsa, Jasmine; Duggal, Abhijit; Jain, Mamta K; Lee, Grace M; Liang, Stephen Y; McGeer, Allison; Lavergne, Valery; Murad, M Hassan; Mustafa, Reem A; Morgan, Rebecca L; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Sultan, Shahnaz",Clin. infect. dis,445,16

Once calibrated to titers of human convalescent sera reported in each study, a robust correlation was seen between neutralizing titer and efficacy (&#961; = 0.79) and binding antibody titer and efficacy (&#961; = 0.93), despite geographically diverse study populations subject to different forces of infection and circulating variants, and use of different endpoints, assays, convalescent sera panels and manufacturing platforms.

We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids among these patients was responsible for this finding, and tested if inhaled glucocorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an open-label, parallel-group, phase 2, randomised controlled trial (Steroids in COVID-19; STOIC) of inhaled budesonide, compared with usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild COVID-19 symptoms. The trial was done in the community in Oxfordshire, UK. Participants were randomly assigned to inhaled budsonide or usual care stratified for age (&#8804;40 years or >40 years), sex (male or female), and number of comorbidities (&#8804;1 and &#8805;2). Randomisation was done using random sequence generation in block randomisation in a 1:1 ratio. Budesonide dry powder was delivered using a turbohaler at a dose of 800 µg per actuation. Participants were asked to take two inhalations twice a day until symptom resolution. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, including emergency department assessment or hospitalisation, analysed for both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. The secondary outcomes were self-reported clinical recovery (symptom resolution), viral symptoms measured using the Common Cold Questionnare (CCQ) and the InFLUenza Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire (FLUPro), body temperature, blood oxygen saturations, and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416399. FINDINGS: From July 16 to Dec 9, 2020, 167 participants were recruited and assessed for eligibility. 21 did not meet eligibility criteria and were excluded. 146 participants were randomly assigned-73 to usual care and 73 to budesonide. For the per-protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in ten (14%) of 70 participants in the budesonide group and one (1%) of 69 participant in the usual care group (difference in proportions 0·131, 95% CI 0·043 to 0·218; p=0·004). For the ITT population, the primary outcome occurred in 11 (15%) participants in the usual care group and two (3%) participants in the budesonide group (difference in proportions 0·123, 95% CI 0·033 to 0·213; p=0·009). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was eight. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (median 7 days [95% CI 6 to 9] in the budesonide group vs 8 days [7 to 11] in the usual care group; log-rank test p=0·007). The mean proportion of days with a fever in the first 14 days was lower in the budesonide group (2%, SD 6) than the usual care group (8%, SD 18; Wilcoxon test p=0·051) and the proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide group when compared with the usual care group. As-needed antipyretic medication was required for fewer proportion of days in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (27% [IQR 0-50] vs 50% [15-71]; p=0·025) Fewer participants randomly assigned to budesonide had persistent symptoms at days 14 and 28 compared with participants receiving usual care (difference in proportions 0·204, 95% CI 0·075 to 0·334; p=0·003).

An Exploratory Study of Effects on Mood,17.915785,3.8654325,2021,"Background and Aims: The WHO has solicited all countries to eliminate HCV by 2030. The Italian government started routine screening for HCV infection in January 2021, initially targeting subjects born between 1969 and 1989. With the aim of achieving micro-elimination, we designed a hospital-wide project focusing on inpatients born from 1935 to 1985 and conducted it in our institution. Method: All inpatients aged 35 to 85, admitted from 10 February 2020 to 9 February 2021 for many different diseases and conditions underwent HCV antibody (HCVAb) testing by third-generation ELISA. When positive, reflex HCV RNA testing and genotyping were performed. Clinical history, fibrosis diagnosis, laboratory data and concomitant medications were available for all. Results: The HCV screening rate of inpatients was 100%. In total, 11,748 participants were enrolled, of whom 53.50% were male. The HCVAb positivity rate was 3.03%. The HCVAb rate increased with age and was higher for patients born between 1935 and 1944 (4.81%). The rate of HCV RNA positivity was 0.97%. The vast majority (80.70%) of HCV RNA-positive participants were 55 or older;in about 40% of cases, HCV RNA-positive patients were unaware of their infection. Although 16 patients died after HCV chronic infection diagnosis (two due COVID-19) or HCV treatment prescription (one due to COVID-19), 74.56% of patient HCV diagnoses were linked to HCV treatment, despite their co-morbidities. All patients older than 65 who died had an active HCV infection. Conclusion: The present study revealed a rate of active HCV infections among inpatients lower than what has been reported in the past in the general population;this appears to be a result of the widespread use of pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). The overall rate of active infection was lower than the rate observed in the 1935–1954 cohort. The high rate of inpatients unaware of HCV infections and the high number of deaths among subjects with an active HCV infection born from 1935 to 1954, suggest that, at least in southern Italy, targeted screening of this birth cohort may be required to reduce the number of undiagnosed cases and hidden infections. © 2021 by the authors.

METHODS: We analyzed data from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases registered from February 27-August 31, 2020 in Mexico City's public database. Individuals were classified as non-HCW and HCW (subcategorized as physicians, nurses and other HCW). In hospitalized individuals, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze potential factors associated with death and compare mortality risk among groups. RESULTS: A total of 125,665 patients were included. Of these, 13.1% were HCW (28% physicians, 38% nurses and 34% other HCW). Compared with non-HCW, HCW were more frequently female, younger and free of comorbidities. Overall, 25,771 (20.5%) were treated as inpatients and 11,182 (8.9%) deaths were reported. Deaths in the total population and in hospitalized patients were significantly higher in non-HCW than in HCW (9.9% vs 1.9%, P<.001; and 39.6% vs 19.3%, P<.001, respectively). In hospitalized patients, using a multivariate model, the risk of death in HCW in general was lower (OR 0.53) compared to non-HCW, and by specific occupation, in physicians, nurses and other HCW risk was OR 0.60, 0.29, 0.61, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HCW represent an important proportion of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico City. While the mortality risk in HCW is lower compared with non-HCW, a high mortality rate in hospitalized patients was observed in this study. Among HCW, nurses had lower risk of death compared to physicians and other HCW.","Guerrero-Torres, Lorena; Caro-Vega, Yanink; Crabtree-Ramírez, Brenda; Sierra-Madero, Juan G",Clin. infect. dis,445,16

A more balanced risk management approach is required because absolute suppression of risk is unrealistic in all facets of life. Contact tracing remains a limiting factor in achieving such a balance. The use of Bluetooth or pairing devices is proposed to address this challenge. This simple approach, when applied in a manner that satisfies privacy and trust concerns, would allow high-risk encounters to be quickly identified, namely those where participants have spent 15 minutes or more within 6 ft of each other per current guidelines. If an attendee later tests positive for COVID-19 and tracing is required, the event organizer can provide a limited list of potential close contacts rather than an exhaustive list of all attendees. Contact tracers can, therefore, limit efforts to this concise group rather than needing to contact thousands of people or conduct mass media communications. Such a system, if institutionalized, supports risk assurance and safety measures for businesses by demonstrating a commitment to staff, customer protection, and ensuring high-risk encounters are logged, reinforcing longer-term societal pandemic resilience.","Ryan, Benjamin J; Coppola, Damon; Williams, James; Swienton, Raymond",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,445,25

ACE2 is involved in modulating blood pressure and establishing blood pressure homeostasis. Recently, a critical debatable question has arisen whether using antihypertensive medications will have a favorable impact on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or a deleterious one, mainly because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy can modulate the expression of ACE2 protein. The concern is that the use of ACEIs and ARBs will increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. On the other hand, several genetic association studies have examined the relationship between ACE2 genetic variants and the risk of developing hypertension in different ethnic populations. In this review, we discuss the ongoing arguments in the literature about ACE2's role in mortality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients comorbid with hypertension and critically evaluate the current debate about the usage or discontinuation of ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, we explore the two opposing roles that ACE2 genetic variants might be playing in COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 receptor effectiveness and mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.Bosso et al. discuss the ongoing arguments about ACE2's role in the mortality associated with COVID-19 cases and weigh on the current debate about the usage or discontinuation of ACEI/ARB anti-hypertensive medication.

Resting motor threshold (MT) is a measure of cortical excitability, largely driven by glutamate. Perampanel, a glutamate &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor blocker, is predicted to increase the cortical excitability threshold. This study aimed to evaluate TMS to functionally assess target engagement in a study of perampanel in ALS. METHOD: We studied the MT of ALS patients randomized to a single dose of perampanel or placebo 5:1 hourly for 4 h. Twelve patients participated at 4 mg and 7 returned for dosing and retesting at 8 mg. The study was terminated in April 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019-related restrictions, after 7 out of 12 planned patients had received the 8 mg dose. Serum concentrations were also measured. RESULTS: Ten patients received the 4 mg dose (2 received placebo) and 5 received the 8 mg dose (2 received placebo). Motor Threshold increased at 2 h after dosing in the combined treatment group +7% of maximal stimulator output (P < .01). Change could be detected in the larger 4 mg group (P = .02), but not in the smaller 8 mg dose group (P = .1). No side effects were reported after single dose exposure. DISCUSSION: This study shows that perampanel effects the physiology of upper motor neurons. Studies aiming at gauging the effect of perampanel on ALS disease progression are already ongoing. Motor threshold may serve as a marker of biological target engagement.","Oskarsson, Björn; Mauricio, Elizabeth A; Shah, Jaimin S; Li, Zhuo; Rogawski, Michael A",Muscle nerve,445,16

The Royal College of Psychiatrists decided to run the final part of the membership exam, the Clinical Assessment of Skills and Competencies (CASC) online for the first time in September 2020. We aimed to prepare candidates in the Northern Ireland deanery for this by developing a virtual mock examination using the Zoom platform.MethodIn previous years, higher psychiatry trainees in the Northern Ireland deanery have run successful face to face mock examinations to help pre-membership trainees prepare for the CASC. We adapted some of this material to our virtual examination. 16 stations were run in total, in two circuits of eight. These stations were mapped to the Royal College CASC blueprint. Higher trainees were recruited to act as examiners, with core trainees acting as simulated patients. The mock examination was advertised through the local deanery and all candidates sitting in September availed of the opportunity (a total of 8 trainees).Zoom was used as the platform due to ease of use, familiarity and breakout room function. Each station formed one breakout room, and a facilitator moved candidates between rooms and provided timing prompts. Instructions were emailed to candidates in advance.A comfort break was provided between circuits. At the end of the mock examination, everyone was returned to the main room and examiners gave general feedback and tips. Individual feedback was provided by collating mark schemes for each candidate, which included free text feedback, and sending these via email.ResultDespite the evident challenges involved, the mock CASC ran smoothly. There was one minor delay of approximately 3 minutes due to technical difficulties, which was easily recouped. We obtained qualitative feedback from candidates which was positive, with trainees commenting that they felt “more at ease … less worried” about a digital exam, and that it was “efficient and effective”.All candidates who sat the mock examination were successful in the face to face CASC sitting which followed in September.ConclusionWe were able to successfully adapt what was previously an in-person mock CASC exam to the new digital format in a way that reflected how the actual CASC exam will run, and it was considered beneficial preparation by the candidates who sat this mock. This has improved trainee experience at a time when many teaching opportunities have been suspended.","Somerville, Laura McMurray Peter Sing Vivian Campbell Stephanie McGee Meta",BJPsych Open,445,20

These changes led to a decrease in patient volume, impacting physician trainee education due to lost clinical and didactic opportunities. We measured the prevalence of trainee concern over missed educational opportunities and investigated the risk factors leading to such concerns. METHODS: All residents and fellows at a large academic medical center were invited to participate in a web-based survey in May of 2020. Participants responded to questions regarding demographic characteristics, specialty, primary assigned responsibility during the previous 2 weeks (clinical, education, or research), perceived concern over missed educational opportunities, and burnout. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between missed educational opportunities and the measured variables. RESULTS: 22% (301 of 1375) of the trainees completed the survey. 47% of the participants were concerned about missed educational opportunities. Trainees assigned to education at home had 2.85 [95%CI 1.33-6.45] greater odds of being concerned over missed educational opportunities as compared with trainees performing clinical work. Trainees performing research were not similarly affected [aOR = 0.96, 95%CI (0.47-1.93)]. Trainees in pathology or radiology had 2.51 [95%CI 1.16-5.68] greater odds of concern for missed educational opportunities as compared with medicine. Trainees with greater concern over missed opportunities were more likely to be experiencing burnout (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Trainees in radiology or pathology and those assigned to education at home were more likely to be concerned about their missed educational opportunities. Residency programs should consider providing trainees with research or at home clinical opportunities as an alternative to self-study should future need for reduced clinical hours arise.","Lou, Sunny S; Goss, Charles W; Evanoff, Bradley A; Duncan, Jennifer G; Kannampallil, Thomas",BMC Med Educ,445,30

However, there were only two previous case reports on newly diagnosed DM in COVID-19 patients. Here, we described three patients who had newly diagnosed DM associated with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiological factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in women admitted for labour and delivery, in the context of universal screening at four Boston-area hospitals. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we reviewed the health records of all women admitted for labour and delivery at four hospitals from the largest health system in Massachusetts between 19 April 2020 and 27 June 2020. We calculated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic infection. We calculated associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients (3.2%, 95% confidence interval 2.5, 3.8) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on admission for labour and delivery out of 2945 patients included in the analysis; 80 (86.0%) of the patients who tested positive were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection included the following: younger age, obesity, African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity, residence in heavily affected communities (as measured in cases reported per capita), presence of a household member with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, non-health care essential worker occupation and MassHealth or Medicaid insurance compared to commercial insurance. 93.8% of patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission had one or more identifiable factors associated with disease acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: In this large sample of deliveries during the height of the surge in infections during the spring of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely concentrated in patients with distinct demographic characteristics, those largely from disadvantaged communities.

DESIGN: A systematic review has been conducted to synthesise existing evidence on risk factors affecting COVID-19 outcomes across Africa. DATA SOURCES: Data were systematically searched from MEDLINE, Scopus, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies for review were included if they were published in English and reported at least one risk factor and/or one health outcome. We included all relevant literature published up until 11 August 2020. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We performed a systematic narrative synthesis to describe the available studies for each outcome. Data were extracted using a standardised Joanna Briggs Institute data extraction form. RESULTS: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria of which four were exclusively on Africa and the remaining 11 papers had a global focus with some data from Africa. Higher rates of infection in Africa are associated with high population density, urbanisation, transport connectivity, high volume of tourism and international trade, and high level of economic and political openness. Limited or poor access to healthcare are also associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates. Older people and individuals with chronic conditions such as HIV, tuberculosis and anaemia experience severe forms COVID-19 leading to hospitalisation and death. Similarly, high burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high prevalence of tobacco consumption and low levels of expenditure on health and low levels of global health security score contribute to COVID-19 related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, institutional, ecological, health system and politico-economic factors influenced the spectrum of COVID-19 infection, severity and death. We recommend multidisciplinary and integrated approaches to mitigate the identified factors and strengthen effective prevention strategies.","Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; Koye, Digsu Negese; Fetene, Dagnachew Muluye; Woldegiorgis, Mulu; Kinfu, Yohannes; Geleto, Ayele Bali; Melaku, Yohannes Adama; Mohammed, Hassen; Alene, Kefyalew Addis; Awoke, Mamaru Ayenew; Birhanu, Mulugeta Molla; Gebremedhin, Amanuel Tesfay; Gelaw, Yalemzewod Assefa; Shifti, Desalegn Markos; Muluneh, Muluken Dessalegn; Tegegne, Teketo Kassaw; Abrha, Solomon; Aregay, Atsede Fantahun; Ayalew, Mohammed Biset; Gebre, Abadi Kahsu; Gebremariam, Kidane Tadesse; Gebremedhin, Tesfaye; Gebremichael, Lemlem; Leshargie, Cheru Tesema; Kibret, Getiye Dejenu; Meazaw, Maereg Wagnew; Mekonnen, Alemayehu Berhane; Tekle, Dejen Yemane; Tesema, Azeb Gebresilassie; Tesfay, Fisaha Haile; Tesfaye, Wubshet; Wubishet, Befikadu Legesse; Dachew, Berihun Assefa; Adane, Akilew Awoke",BMJ Open,445,26

Older age, male sex and certain underlying diseases, including cancer, appear to significantly increase the risk for severe COVID­19. SARS­CoV­2 infection of host cells is facilitated by the angiotensin­converting enzyme 2 (ACE­2), and by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and other host cell proteases such as cathepsin L (CTSL). With the exception of ACE­2, a systematic analysis of these two other SARS­CoV2 infection mediators in malignancies is lacking. Here, we analysed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 and CTSL across a wide spectrum of tumors and controls. TMPRSS2 was overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma, with PRAD and READ exhibiting the highest expression of all cancers. CTSL was upregulated in lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B­cell lymphoma, oesophageal carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lower grade glioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thymoma. Hypo­methylation of both genes was evident in most cases where they have been highly upregulated. We have expanded on our observations by including data relating to mutations and copy number alterations at pan­cancer level. The novel hypotheses that are stemming out of these data need to be further investigated and validated in large clinical studies.","Katopodis, Periklis; Anikin, Vladimir; Randeva, Harpal S; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Chatha, Kamaljit; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",Int J Oncol,445,25

Authors’ reply,17.82325,3.855669,2020,"BACKGROUND: The functional mechanism is unknown for many genetic variants associated with substance use disorder phenotypes. Rs678849, an intronic variant in the delta-opioid receptor gene (OPRD1), has been found to predict regional brain volume, addiction risk, and the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in treating opioid use disorder. The variant has also been implicated as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for several genes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify functional differences between the two alleles of rs678849 in vitro. We hypothesized that the two alleles of rs678849 would have different effects on transcriptional activity due to differential interactions with transcription factors. METHODS: 15bp regions containing the C or T alleles of rs678849 were cloned into luciferase constructs and transfected into BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells to test the effect on transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using nuclear lysates from BE(2)C cell or human postmortem medial prefrontal cortex were used to identify proteins that differentially bound the two alleles. RESULTS: At 24 hours post-transfection, the C allele construct had significantly lower luciferase expression than the T allele construct and empty vector control (ANOVA p < .001). Proteomic analysis and supershift assays identified XRCC6 as a transcription factor specifically binding the C allele, whereas hnRNP D0 was found to specifically bind the T allele. CONCLUSION: These functional differences between the C and T alleles may help explain the psychiatric and neurological phenotype differences predicted by rs678849 genotype and the potential role of the variant as an eQTL.","Crist, Richard C; Arauco-Shapiro, Gabriella; Zhang, Alexander; Reiner, Benjamin C; Berrettini, Wade H; Doyle, Glenn A",Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,445,29

This study aims to collate and analyse funding for the Ebola epidemic and Zika outbreak between 2014 and 2019 in order to understand the shortcomings in funding reporting and suggest improvements. METHODS: Data were collected via a literature review and analysis of financial reporting databases, including both amounts donated and received. Funding information from three financial databases was analysed: Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation's Development Assistance for Health database, the Georgetown Infectious Disease Atlas and the United Nations Financial Tracking Service. A systematic literature search strategy was devised and applied to seven databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, HMIC, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and EconLit. Funding information was extracted from articles meeting the eligibility criteria and measures were taken to avoid double counting. Funding was collated, then amounts and purposes were compared within, and between, data sources. RESULTS: Large differences between funding reported by different data sources, and variations in format and methodology, made it difficult to arrive at precise estimates of funding amounts and purpose. Total disbursements reported by the databases ranged from $2.5 to $3.2 billion for Ebola and $150-$180 million for Zika. Total funding reported in the literature is greater than reported in databases, suggesting that databases may either miss funding, or that literature sources overreport. Databases and literature disagreed on the main purpose of funding for socioeconomic recovery versus outbreak response. One of the few consistent findings across data sources and diseases is that the USA was the largest donor. CONCLUSION: Implementation of several recommendations would enable more effective mapping and deployment of outbreak funding for response activities relating to COVID-19 and future epidemics.","Quirk, Emily Jade; Gheorghe, Adrian; Hauck, Katharina",,445,12

Regrettably, no vaccines or drugs are currently available for this new critical emerging human disease. Joining the global fight against COVID-19, in this study we aim at identifying a potential novel inhibitor for SARS COV-2 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16) which is one of the most attractive targets in the virus life cycle, responsible for the viral RNA protection via a cap formation process. Firstly, nsp16 enzyme bound to Sinefungin was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 6WKQ), then, a 3D pharmacophore model was constructed to be applied to screen 48 Million drug-like compounds of the Zinc database. This resulted in only 24 compounds which were subsequently docked into the enzyme. The best four score-ordered hits from the docking outcome exhibited better scores compared to Sinefungin. Finally, three molecular dynamics (MD) simulation experiments for 150 ns were carried out as a refinement step for our proposed approach. The MD and MM-PBSA outputs revealed compound 11 as the best potential nsp16 inhibitor herein identified, as it displayed a better stability and average binding free energy for the ligand-enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin.","El Hassab, Mahmoud A; Ibrahim, Tamer M; Al-Rashood, Sara T; Alharbi, Amal; Eskandrani, Razan O; Eldehna, Wagdy M",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,445,29

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate a potential difference in eye movement pattern in observes which are exposed to images showing a face without and with facecover to identify if there is truly a change of gaze when identifying (masked) facial features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eye movement of a total of 64 study participants (28 males and 36 females) with a mean age of 31.84±9.0 years was analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Eye movement analysis was conducted based on positional changes of eye features within an x- and y- coordinate system while two images (face without/with facecover) were displayed for 8 seconds. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the sequence of focussing on facial regions was not altered when wearing a facecover and followed the sequence: perioral, nose, periorbital. Wearing a facecover significantly increased the time of focussing on the periorbital region and increased also the number of repeated eye fixations during the interval of visual stimulus presentation. No statistically significant differences were observed between male and female participants in their eye movement pattern across all investigated variables with p > 0.433.

Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that age, frequency of volunteering before the epidemic, and Present-Hedonistic time perspective predict donating items to people in need, but none of the tested variables predicted donating money to combat COVID-19. The findings suggest that charitable behavior, especially in the context of extraordinary social situations, needs to be treated as a multifaceted phenomenon.

Prevention-effective adherence proposes that PrEP adherence should be aligned with the risk of HIV, which could be applied to both daily and ED PrEP adherence measurement. The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between the use of PrEP and sex events among the MSM PrEP users and identify factors associated with adherence among daily and ED MSM PrEP users. METHODS: A multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study was conducted at three hospital-based clinics in three urban cities of Taiwan from January 2018 to December 2019. MSM ages 18 years or older - at high risk of HIV acquisition and taking PrEP during the study period - were included in the analysis. MSM PrEP users were allowed to choose between daily and ED PrEP based on their preference. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, mental health, sexual behaviours, substance use and PrEP-taking behaviours were collected at each visit. RESULTS: A total of 374 MSM were included in the analysis with 1,054 visits. More than half (56%) of the PrEP users chose ED at the baseline and 150 regimen switches were reported by 21% of the participants. There was only one seroconversion documented during the study period. Most (84.2%) of the MSM PrEP users were able to adhere to PrEP during the most recent anal intercourse in the past one month. Among ED PrEP users with suboptimal adherence, the majority (81.9%) missed the pre-coital dose. In the multivariable analysis, we found that participants who switched from daily to an ED dosing regimen were associated with poorer adherence to PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of PrEP adherence was observed among the majority of MSM in a real-world setting. On the other hand, Taiwanese MSM switching from daily to ED dosing regimens were less likely to adhere to PrEP, suggesting that novel approaches focusing on a dosing switch would be necessary for MSM to improve their adherence to PrEP.","Wu, Huei-Jiuan; Wen-Wei Ku, Stephane; Chang, Howard H; Li, Chia-Wen; Ko, Nai-Ying; Strong, Carol",J Int AIDS Soc,445,24

Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of 'proximity events' these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for 'intelligent physical distancing' in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions. In our paper, we outline some ethical considerations that need to be addressed in any deployment of this kind of approach as part of a multidimensional public health response.

METHODS: Pregnancy-related VTE hospitalizations were identified through a code-targeted search of the Hadassah Medical Center's computerized database. A manual analysis of relevant medical records was performed, and cases diagnosed throughout the year 2020 were compared to those diagnosed during 2019 and 2018. Statistical analyses studied obstetrical outcomes, as well as the extent and treatment of VTE events during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those of preceding years, stratified by pre-, intra-, and post-lockdown periods. RESULTS: The incidence of pregnancy-related thromboembolic events during 2020 was 0.16% of all deliveries, significantly higher than in 2018 and 2019 (0.06% and 0.1%, respectively; P < 0.05). Higher rates of VTE events were found during post-lockdown periods in 2020, compared with corresponding time periods in 2019 and 2018.

Identifying and disentangling the drivers of resulting hospitalisation incidence at the local scale is key to predict, mitigate and manage epidemic surges, but also to develop targeted measures. However, this type of analysis is often not possible because of the lack of spatially-explicit health data and spatial uncertainties associated with infection. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we propose an analytical framework to investigate potential drivers of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 hospitalisation incidence when data are only available at the hospital level. Specifically, the approach is based on the delimitation of hospital catchment areas, which allows analysing associations between hospitalisation incidence and spatial or temporal covariates. We illustrate and apply our analytical framework to Belgium, a country heavily impacted by two COVID-19 epidemic waves in 2020, both in terms of mortality and hospitalisation incidence. RESULTS: Our spatial analyses reveal an association between the hospitalisation incidence and the local density of nursing home residents, which confirms the important impact of COVID-19 in elderly communities of Belgium. Our temporal analyses further indicate a pronounced seasonality in hospitalisation incidence associated with the seasonality of weather variables. Taking advantage of these associations, we discuss the feasibility of predictive models based on machine learning to predict future hospitalisation incidence. CONCLUSION: Our reproducible analytical workflow allows performing spatially-explicit analyses of data aggregated at the hospital level and can be used to explore potential drivers and dynamic of COVID-19 hospitalisation incidence at regional or national scales.","Dellicour, Simon; Linard, Catherine; Van Goethem, Nina; Da Re, Daniele; Artois, Jean; Bihin, Jérémie; Schaus, Pierre; Massonnet, François; Van Oyen, Herman; Vanwambeke, Sophie O; Speybroeck, Niko; Gilbert, Marius",Int J Health Geogr,445,16

This study aimed to quantitatively investigate the fit of most of the common FFRs used during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. Methods: A total of 37 volunteers were fit tested in 20 selected FFRs in a randomized order. The selected FFRs were underwent quantitative fit testing by PortaCount® model 8038. To determine the effects of face sizes on respirator fit, the participants' facial dimensions were measured using a digital caliper. Results: The rate of passing fit tests for the studied FFRs were surprisingly low with 11 out of 20 FFRs having less than 10% passing fit tests and the best performers having only 43% and 27% passing fit tests (brands 2 and 20, respectively). Cup-shaped respirators provided significantly greater fit than the vertical flat-fold ones (p < 0.001). A significantly different FFs were found among the respirator brands (F = 13.60, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, unacceptably low fit factors were obtained from the studied FFRs. The main reasons for this are suspected to single size and style for each studied FFR.

We describe the clinical progress and lung ultrasound findings of a Singaporean COVID-19 intensive care unit patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Methods: The clinical course of one COVID-19 patient managed in the intensive care unit was traced. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 virus infection and intubated after developing respiratory failure. Serial point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound was performed by the managing intensivist daily, and correlated with the clinical progress and chest X-ray imaging done for the patient. Results: The patient exhibited lung ultrasound findings consistent with that described for viral pneumonias. This included numerous B-lines and subpleural consolidations with disrupted pleural lines distributed symmetrically, predominantly in bilateral upper BLUE points, and lower BLUE points bilaterally. Coalescing B-lines leading on to the development of bilateral “white lung” were associated with worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome. An increased density or reduction of the B-lines was associated with clinical improvement or deterioration, respectively. Conclusions: Trained clinicians, who are familiar with point-of-care lung ultrasonography, may consider point-of-care bedside ultrasound as an important adjunct to history and physical examination for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 when advanced imaging is not available because of logistical reasons or infectious control. This applies in particular to cases where resources are limited, and patient transfers to facilities offering such services may prove hazardous.","Peh, Wee Ming; Chan, Steffi Kang Ting; Lee, Yi Lin; Gare, Pravin Shivaji; Ho, Vui Kian",J.

Among the approaches taken by China, three ways consisting of lockdown; the willingness of people to be patient in obeying the actions taken; distancing; in our view, it is further urged to be the similar consensus adopted by each country as at least the three basic principles that required for in the strategy against the COVID-19 outbreak. Vietnam can be a representative example to discuss, understand and realize the importance of these three basic principles enough to say that it also supports them as the first country to date, to our knowledge, with all sufferers of COVID-19 successfully cured at one time, discussing what essentially has not been analyzed concerning the traditional epidemiological approach known to effectively control the transmission of an outbreak. Main text: Vietnam has responded timely by immediately announced the state of national health emergency and implemented a partial quarantine or lockdown policy with initially only a ban on coming from and going out to China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau and the people in Vietnam, unspeakably, are patient and spread out or distanced. These actions of the Vietnamese seem to have had arguably an impact on all COVID-19 sufferers successfully cured in one time and the absence of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection that lasted for some time. Conclusions: The recent study who thereafter concludes the need for global coordination in interventions and responses to the outbreak by reflecting lessons from China has demonstrated the implications supporting our view of the need for a consensus similarly by each authority regarding at least the three basic principles that required for to be performed in controlling the outbreak transmission, COVID-19, in the form of the lockdown, patience in facing outbreak situations, and distancing that all of those performed simultaneously.","Amin, Firman Zulkifli; Sari, Mila Kurnia; Amin, Zulkifli",Internet J.

For the trend analysis, the infant mortality rates stratified by causes of death between 2007 and 2016 were evaluated using polynomial regression models. There was a decreasing linear trend in infant mortality rates in the state, but individually only four of the 16 health regions followed this trend. Half of the deaths occurred in the early neonatal period. Causes avoidable by adequate attention to women during pregnancy and childbirth and to the newborn represented 51.1% of the deaths. There was an increasing tendency of proportional mortality for causes not manifestly avoidable. It is acknowledged that it is important to know the trend of rates in order to define priority population groups for early interventions that increase survival and reduce infant mortality.

METHOD: 905 COVID-19 patients from 7 different centers were enrolled. The demography data, clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and treatments were collected accordingly for further analyses. RESULTS: Around 9.5% of the enrolled COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with CDBC. Older patients or patients with cardiovascular comorbidities have increased CDBC probability. Increased body temperature, longer fever duration, anhelation, gastrointestinal symptoms, illness severity, intensive care unit attending, ventilation treatment, glucocorticoid therapy, longer hospitalization time are correlated to CDBC. Among laboratory results, increased white blood cell counting (mainly neutrophil), lymphocytopenia, increased procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reaction protein, D-dimer, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, brain natriuretic peptide, myoglobin, blood sugar and decreased albumin are also observed, indicating multiple system functional damage. Radiology results suggested ground glass opacity mixed with high density effusion opacities and even pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: The aged COVID-19 patients with increased inflammatory indicators, worse lymphopenia and cardiovascular comorbidities are more likely to have clinically diagnosed bacterial co-infection.

Interventions included combinations of high-volume intraoral suction (HVS[IO]), high-volume extraoral suction (HVS[EO]) and an air cleaning system (ACS).Method A sequence of six AGPs were performed on a phantom head. Real-time aerosol measurements (particle size range 0.0062-9.6 µm) were acquired from six locations within a typical dental treatment room (35 m3).Results The majority (>99%) of AGP particles were <0.3 µm diameter and remained at elevated levels around the dental team during the AGPs. With no active aerosol-management interventions, AGP particles were estimated to remain above the baseline range for up to 30 minutes from the end of the sequence of procedures.Conclusions The results emphasise the importance of personal protection equipment, particularly respiratory protection. Use of HVS(IO), either alone or in combination with the ACS, reduced particle concentrations to baseline levels on completion of AGPs. These data indicate potential to eliminate fallow time. The study was performed using a phantom head so confirmatory studies with patients are required.","Ehtezazi, Touraj; Evans, David G; Jenkinson, Ian D; Evans, Philip A; Vadgama, Vijay J; Vadgama, Jaimini; Jarad, Fadi; Grey, Nicholas; Chilcott, Robert P",Br. dent. j,445,1

Background: Deciphering the tissue and organ interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be important to discern the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the human protein-host protein interactions in the small intestine. Methods: Public databases and published works were used to collect data related to small intestine tissue and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and showed interactions of host proteins in the small intestine. Associated modules, biological processes, functional pathways, regulatory transcription factors, disease ontology categories, and possible drug candidates for therapeutic targets were identified. Results: Thirteen primary protein neighbors were found for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. ACE2 and its four partners were observed in a highly clustered module; moreover, 8 host proteins belonged to this module. The protein digestion and absorption as a significant pathway was highlighted with enriched genes of ACE2, MEP1A, MEP1B, DPP4, and XPNPEP2. The HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B transcription factors were found to be regulating the expression of ACE2. A significant association with 12 diseases was deciphered and 116 drug-target interactions were identified. Conclusion: The protein-host protein interactome revealed the important elements and interactions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine, which can be useful in clarifying the mechanisms of gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation. The results suggest that antiviral targeting of these interactions may improve the condition of COVID-19 patients.","Khodadoost, Mahmoud; Niknam, Zahra; Farahani, Masoumeh; Razzaghi, Mohammadreza; Norouzinia, Mohsen",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,445,21

RESULTS: 92 patients were included: 40 women, age 42.8 ± 3.9 years, disease duration of 23.1 ± 12.6 years. Seventeen patients used Dexcom G5® and 75 Free Style Libre®. TIR 70-180 mg/dL (59.3 ± 16.2 vs 62.6 ± 15.2%), time > 180 (34.4 ± 18.0 vs 30.7 ± 16.9%), >250 (11.1 ± 10.6 vs 9.2 ± 9.7%) and Glucose Management Indicator (7.2 ± 0.8 vs 7.0 ± 0.8%) significantly improved (PL vs WL, respectively, p < 0.05). Time in hypoglycemia remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic may be managed successfully in terms of glycemic control by population with T1D prone to hypoglycemia using CGM. The strict daily routine at home could probably explain the improvement in the time in glycemic target without increasing the time in hypoglycemia.","Mesa, Alex; Viñals, Clara; Pueyo, Irene; Roca, Daria; Vidal, Mercè; Giménez, Marga; Conget, Ignacio",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,445,1

Two components with the highest bitterness intensities (BIs), such as 7-methoxycoumarin and 8-prenylkaempferol were selected. The bitter taste perceived thresholds of 7-methoxycoumarin and 8-prenylkaempferol were 0.062 mmol/L and 0.022 mmol/L, respectively. Moreover, the correlation between the contents of the two bitter components and the BIs of Z. bungeanum were proved. The results of siRNA and flow cytometry showed that 7-methoxycoumarin and 8-prenylkaempferol could activate the bitter receptor hTAS2R14.

When viruses jump into a new species the outcome of infection ranges from asymptomatic to lethal, historically ascribed to ""genetic resistance to viral disease."" People have exploited these differences for good and bad, for developing vaccines from cowpox and horsepox virus, controlling rabbit plagues with myxoma virus and introducing smallpox during colonization of America and Australia. Differences in resistance to viral disease are at the core of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crisis, yet our understanding of the mechanisms in any interspecies leap falls short of the mark. Here I review how the two key parameters of viral disease are countered by fundamentally different genetic mechanisms for resistance: (1) virus transmission, countered primarily by activation of innate and adaptive immune responses; and (2) pathology, countered primarily by tolerance checkpoints to limit innate and adaptive immune responses. I discuss tolerance thresholds and the role of CD8 T cells to limit pathological immune responses, the problems posed by tolerant superspreaders and the signature coronavirus evasion strategy of eliciting only short-lived neutralizing antibody responses. Pinpointing and targeting the mechanisms responsible for varying pathology and short-lived antibody were beyond reach in previous zoonoses, but this time we are armed with genomic technologies and more knowledge of immune checkpoint genes. These known unknowns must now be tackled to solve the current COVID-19 crisis and the inevitable zoonoses to follow.","Goodnow, Christopher C",Immunol. cell biol,445,21

We carried out a retrospective observational study of 169 patients, 96 (58.9%) of whom had a high viral load and the remaining had a low viral load. Compared with patients with a low viral load, patients with a high viral load did not exhibit differences regarding preexisting cardiovascular risk factors or comorbidities. There were no differences in symptoms, vital signs, or laboratory tests in either group, except for the maximum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which was higher in the group with a higher viral load (24 [interquartile range 9.5-58.5] versus 8.5 [interquartile range 3-22.5] ng/L, P = 0.007). There were no differences in the need for hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit, or the need for mechanical ventilation in clinical management. In-hospital mortality was greater in patients who had a higher viral load than in those with low viral load (24% versus 10.4%, P = 0.029). High viral loads were associated with in-hospital mortality in the binary logistic regression analysis (odds ratio: 2.701, 95% Charlson Index (CI): 1.084-6.725, P = 0.033). However, in an analysis adjusted for age, gender, CI, and cTnI, viral load was no longer a predictor of mortality.

We hypothesized that early bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) exposures would be associated with sex-dependent changes in preschool executive function. METHODS: A subsample of the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) cohort (n = 312) provided maternal second trimester (prenatal) and 3-month postpartum (postnatal) urine samples, from which BPA and BPS concentrations were quantified. When children were age 2 and 4, mothers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P). Changes in standardized T scores on the BRIEF-P indexes of inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition were investigated. RESULTS: Adjusted multivariate regression analyses showed that child sex modified the associations between maternal postnatal BPA and changes in executive function. Higher maternal postnatal BPA concentrations predicted increasing difficulties from age 2 to 4 in the domains of inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition in female, but not male children. The other bisphenol concentrations were not associated with changes in executive function. CONCLUSION: Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, these findings justify further investigation on the effects of postnatal bisphenol exposure on child cognitive development. IMPACT: Higher concentrations of maternal BPA at 3-month postpartum were associated with increasing difficulties in inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition from age 2 to 4 in girls, but not boys.Prenatal BPA and prenatal/postnatal BPS were not significant predictors of change in executive function in boys and girls.The current study extends previous research to show that maternal postnatal BPA could also impact child executive function.Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, the current findings suggest that additional precautions may be needed to protect infants' neurodevelopment from indirect exposure to BPA.","England-Mason, Gillian; Liu, Jiaying; Martin, Jonathan W; Giesbrecht, Gerald F; Letourneau, Nicole; Dewey, Deborah",Pediatr. res,445,24

There is an urgent need for novel strategies to combat bacterial infections caused by MDR strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Quorum sensing (QS) is a critical communication system in bacterial community controlling survival and virulence. The awareness of the importance of QS in bacterial infections has stimulated research to identify QS inhibitors (QSIs) to defeat microbes. In this study, four FDA-approved drugs (besides azithromycin as positive QSI) were tested for potential QS inhibition against clinical A. baumannii isolates and P. aeruginosa (PAO1) standard strain. The inhibitory effect of these drugs on virulence factors of both microbes has been investigated. The studied virulence factors include biofilm formation, twitching and swarming motilities, proteolytic enzyme production, and resistance to oxidative stress. The four tested drugs (erythromycin, levamisole, chloroquine, and propranolol) inhibited QS in Chromobacterium violaceum by 84, 72, 55.1, and 37.3%, respectively. They also significantly inhibited virulence factors in both PAO1 and A. baumannii at sub-inhibitory concentrations. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR and mice mortality test, where tested drugs highly repressed the expression of abaI gene and showed significantly improved mice survival rates. In addition, molecular docking studies against AbaI and AbaR proteins of QS system in A. baumannii revealed the potential inhibition of QS by tested drugs. Beside their known activities, the tested drugs could be given new life as QSIs to combat A. baumannii nosocomial infections (alone or in combination with antimicrobials).","Seleem, Noura M; Abd El Latif, Hemat K; Shaldam, Moataz A; El-Ganiny, Amira",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,445,24

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study, analysing routinely collected clinical data from CPME reports in a rapid response to the pandemic lockdown. SETTING: Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides all routine CPME for Birmingham, England, population 1.1 million including 288 000 children. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged under 18 years attending CPME during an 18-week period from late February to late June during the years 2018-2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of referrals, source of disclosure and outcomes from CPME. RESULTS: There were 78 CPME referrals in 2018, 75 in 2019 and 47 in 2020, this was a 39.7% (95% CI 12.4% to 59.0%) reduction in referrals from 2018 to 2020, and a 37.3% (95% CI 8.6% to 57.4%) reduction from 2019 to 2020. There were fewer CPME referrals initiated by school staff in 2020, 12 (26%) compared with 36 (47%) and 38 (52%) in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In all years 75.9% of children were known to social care prior to CPME, and 94% of CPME concluded that there were significant safeguarding concerns. CONCLUSIONS: School closure due to COVID-19 may have harmed children as child abuse has remained hidden. There needs to be either mandatory attendance at schools in future or viable alternatives found. There may be a significant increase in safeguarding referrals when schools fully reopen as children disclose the abuse they have experienced at home.","Garstang, Joanna; Debelle, Geoff; Anand, Indu; Armstrong, Jane; Botcher, Emily; Chaplin, Helen; Hallett, Nutmeg; Morgans, Clare; Price, Malcolm; Tan, Ern Ern Henna; Tudor, Emily; Taylor, Julie",BMJ Open,445,26

To date, there is some evidence that the incidence of simple AA in children may have decreased during the first lockdown period in spring 2020, whereas the number of complicated AA cases remained unchanged or increased slightly. Despite a worrying trend toward delayed presentation, most pediatric patients with AA were treated expediently during this time with comparable outcomes to previous years. Hospitals must consider their individual capacity and medical resources when choosing between operative and non-operative management of children with AA.

PURPOSE: To estimate the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop symptoms. DATA SOURCES: Searches of Google News, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and PubMed using the keywords antibodies, asymptomatic, coronavirus, COVID-19, PCR, seroprevalence, and SARS-CoV-2. STUDY SELECTION: Observational, descriptive studies and reports of mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 that were either cross-sectional or longitudinal in design; were published through 17 November 2020; and involved SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antibody testing of a target population, regardless of current symptomatic status, over a defined period. DATA EXTRACTION: The authors collaboratively extracted data on the study design, type of testing performed, number of participants, criteria for determining symptomatic status, testing results, and setting. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty-one eligible studies and reports were identified, of which 43 used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18 used antibody testing to detect current or prior infection. In the 14 studies with longitudinal data that reported information on the evolution of symptomatic status, nearly three quarters of persons who tested positive but had no symptoms at the time of testing remained asymptomatic. The highest-quality evidence comes from nationwide, representative serosurveys of England (n = 365 104) and Spain (n = 61 075), which suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. LIMITATION: For PCR-based studies, data are limited to distinguish presymptomatic from asymptomatic infection. Heterogeneity precluded formal quantitative syntheses. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. Longitudinal studies suggest that nearly three quarters of persons who receive a positive PCR test result but have no symptoms at the time of testing will remain asymptomatic.

Vitamin K activates both hepatic coagulation factors and extrahepatic endothelial anticoagulant protein S, required for thrombosis prevention. In times of vitamin K insufficiency, hepatic procoagulant factors are preferentially activated over extrahepatic proteins. Vitamin K also activates matrix Gla protein (MGP), which protects against pulmonary and vascular elastic fiber damage. We hypothesized that vitamin K may be implicated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), linking pulmonary and thromboembolic disease. METHODS: 135 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were compared with 184 historical controls. Poor outcome was defined as invasive ventilation and/or death. Inactive vitamin K-dependent MGP (dp-ucMGP) and prothrombin (PIVKA-II) were measured, inversely related to extrahepatic and hepatic vitamin K status, respectively. Desmosine was measured to quantify the rate of elastic fiber degradation. Arterial calcification severity was assessed by computed tomography. RESULTS: Dp-ucMGP was elevated in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p<0.001), with even higher dp-ucMGP in patients with poor outcomes (p<0.001). PIVKA-II was normal in 82.1% of patients. Dp-ucMGP was correlated with desmosine (p<0.001), and coronary artery (p=0.002) and thoracic aortic (p<0.001) calcification scores. CONCLUSIONS: Dp-ucMGP was severely increased in COVID-19 patients, indicating extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency, which was related to poor outcome while hepatic procoagulant factor II remained unaffected. These data suggest a mechanism of pneumonia-induced extrahepatic vitamin K depletion leading to accelerated elastic fiber damage and thrombosis in severe COVID-19 due to impaired activation of MGP and endothelial protein S, respectively. A clinical trial could assess whether vitamin K administration improves COVID-19 outcomes.","Dofferhoff, Anton S M; Piscaer, Ianthe; Schurgers, Leon J; Visser, Margot P J; van den Ouweland, Jody M W; de Jong, Pim A; Gosens, Reinoud; Hackeng, Tilman M; van Daal, Henny; Lux, Petra; Maassen, Cecile; Karssemeijer, Esther G A; Vermeer, Cees; Wouters, Emiel F M; Kistemaker, Loes E M; Walk, Jona; Janssen, Rob",Clin. infect. dis,445,16

METHODS: Thirty-six American head and neck surgical oncology practices responded to questions regarding the triage strategies employed from March to May 2020. RESULTS: Of the programs surveyed, 11 (31%) had official department or hospital-specific guidelines for mitigating care delays and determining which surgical cases could proceed. Seventeen (47%) programs left the decision to proceed with surgery to individual surgeon discretion. Five (14%) programs employed committee review, and 7 (19%) used chairman review systems to grant permission for surgery. Every program surveyed, including multiple in COVID-19 outbreak epicenters, continued to perform complex head and neck cancer resections with free flap reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic experience in the United States, head and neck surgical oncology divisions largely eschewed formal triage policies and favored practices that allowed individual surgeons discretion in the decision whether or not to operate. Better understanding the shortcomings of such an approach could help mitigate care delays and improve oncologic outcomes during future outbreaks of COVID-19 and other resource-limiting events.

427664,427664,427664,Message to the Department -- Support to Civil Authorities,17.985966,3.8820996,2020,"Purpose: A major justification for the state subsidy of university education at public institutions (and, in some countries, of private universities too) is the economic and social benefits accruing to society as whole from a significantly university-educated workforce and citizenship. Based upon a broad range of research findings, a particular societal benefit emanating from higher education relates to good citizenship: that it leads to more open mindedness and tolerant political attitudes. We examined these issues using a representative sample of students from Israeli universities to clarify the extent to which these outcomes would be paralleled in the Israeli setting, where the university experience differs markedly from that found typically in the West. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a comparison of political tolerance levels between first- and final-year students enrolled in regular undergraduate study programs (of four days a week or more). However since a change in tolerance is likely to be contingent also on the amount of time that the student spends on campus during the study year, we introduce, as a control group, students enrolled in compressed study programs (of three days a week or less) and compare changes in their tolerance levels with tolerance changes of students enrolled in regular programs. Research questionnaires were distributed to undergraduate students at three universities from the three major districts in Israel–north, south and center. The achieved sample size was 329 students. Findings: Using Difference-in-Differences techniques, we looked for any changes in students' general political tolerance, over the course of their studies. Surprisingly, we found no such effect on political tolerance attitudes. Israeli students are older and often married and though nominally full-time students, they often hold down a full-time job. Thus they come and go to attend lectures but do not otherwise spend much time on campus. Given the somewhat perfunctory nature of the university experience for most Israeli students, it does not to lead to more open-minded and tolerant political attitudes. Practical implications: Some broader, practical applications of the research, beyond the Israeli case, are presented, particularly related to distance learning and to the impact of COVID-19. Attention is given to more recent “Cancel culture” developments on university campuses. Originality/value: The results have wider implications, to other university setting in other countries. Changes in political attitudes may occur in university settings where campus life is well developed, with opportunities for student interaction, formally in extra-curricular events or through social mixing outside the lecture hall. Where the university experience is more minimally confined to attendance at lectures these desirable outcomes may not be forth coming. These findings are relevant to other university frameworks where campus attendance is marginal, such as in open university education and, even more explicitly, in purely internet-based higher education study. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dadon-Golan, Z.; Ziderman, A.; BenDavid-Hadar, I.",Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education,445,1

While myopia has been associated with scleral remodelling and changes in posterior scleral shape, there has been little research examining how myopia affects in-vivo anterior sclera shape. We compared anterior scleral shape in emmetropes, low to moderate myopes, and high myopes. METHODS: In this prospective study, the Eye Surface Profiler instrument was used to quantify anterior eye surface shapes of forty-five young adult participants (58 % females) aged between 18 and 35 years, including 15 emmetropes, 15 low to moderate myopes, and 15 high myopes. Sagittal height and axial radius of curvature of regions over the nasal and temporal corneal periphery and anterior sclera were exported and analysed. RESULTS: After quality control of the data, 39 and 43 subjects had data analysed from the nasal and temporal sides, respectively. The nasal sides of the surfaces of the corneal periphery and anterior sclera had greater sagittal height in high myopes than in emmetropes across all regions (mean sagittal heights 2.44 ± 0.07 and 2.21 ± 0.04 mm, respectively, p = 0.02), but no significant differences were found between low to moderate myopes with emmetropes or with high myopes. No significant refractive group differences occurred for temporal anterior eye surface height. High myopes' nasal-temporal asymmetry of sagittal height was less than of emmetropes (means 0.20 ± 0.07 and 0.46 ± 0.06 mm, respectively, p = 0.02). High myopes also exhibited less nasal-temporal axial radius of curvature asymmetry than emmetropes (mean 0.35 ± 0.08 and 0.71 ± 0.08 mm, respectively, p = 0.01) across all regions. CONCLUSIONS: High myopes exhibited a different anterior eye surface shape than emmetropes, having greater sagittal height in the nasal corneal periphery and anterior sclera. There was less nasal-temporal asymmetry of sagittal height and axial radius of curvature in high myopes than in emmetropes. Asymmetric growth of the eye associated with myopia development may be the underlying reason. These findings have implications for design of contact lenses, particularly soft and larger rigid lenses such as mini-sclerals.","Niyazmand, Hamed; Read, Scott A; Atchison, David A; Collins, Michael J",Cont. lens anterior eye,445,10

MethodsThis is a phase 2, prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multi-centre study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate MVC-COV1901. The study comprised 3,844 participants of [≥] 20 years who were generally healthy or with stable pre-existing medical conditions. The study participants were randomly assigned in a 6:1 ratio to receive either MVC-COV1901 containing 15 g of S-2P protein or placebo containing saline. Participants received two doses of MVC-COV1901 or placebo, administered 28 days apart via intramuscular injection. The primary outcomes were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 from Day 1 (the day of first vaccination) to Day 57 (28 days after the second dose). Immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 was assessed through geometric mean titres (GMT) and seroconversion rates (SCR) of neutralising antibody and antigen-specific immunoglobulin. This clinical trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04695652. FindingsFrom the start of this phase 2 trial to the time of interim analysis, no vaccine-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were recorded. The most common solicited adverse events across all study participants were pain at the injection site (64%), and malaise/fatigue (35%). Fever was rarely reported (<1%). For all participants in the MVC-COV1901 group, at 28 days after the second dose against wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus, the GMT was 662{middle dot}3 (408 IU/mL), the GMT ratio was 163{middle dot}2, and the seroconversion rate was 99{middle dot}8%. InterpretationMVC-COV1901 shows good safety profiles and promising immunogenicity responses.

Together with the emergence of new variants, the potential waning of the vaccination immunity could pose threats to public health. It is tenable that the timing of such a gradual drop in the immunity of most of the vaccinated population would synchronize with the near-complete restoration of normalcy. Should also testing be relaxed, we might witness a potentially disastrous COVID-19 wave in winter 2021/2022. In response to this risk, many countries, including the U.S., are opting for the administration of a third vaccine dose, the booster shot. Here, in a projected study with an outlook of six months, we explore the interplay between the rate at which boosters are distributed and the extent to which testing practices are implemented. Projections are based on a highly granular agent-based model that provides a close, one-to-one digital reproduction of a real, medium-sized U.S. town. Focusing on the dominant Delta variant, we contemplate the waning immunity provided by the locally available Johnson&Johnson, Pfizer, and Moderna vaccines. Theoretical projections indicate that the administration of boosters at the rate at which the vaccine is currently administered could yield a severe resurgence of the pandemic, even worse than the first wave experienced in spring and summer 2020. Our projections suggest that the peak levels of mid spring 2021 in the vaccination rate may prevent the occurrence of such a scenario. Our study highlights the importance of testing, especially to detect infection of asymptomatic individuals in the very near future, as the release of the booster reaches full speed.","Truszkowska, Agnieszka; Zino, Lorenzo; Butail, Sachit; Caroppo, Emanuele; Jiang, Zhong-Ping; Rizzo, Alessandro; Porfiri, Maurizio",,445,10

One of them is food, Fruit and Vegetable Markets (FVM). Lockdown implementation had different impacts in different countries, like Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) where they have logistics and supply chain of food, fruits and vegetable items and noted a shift in supply from food service to the retail channel, although the fresh food supply remains unaffected. A similar trend was seen in the metro cities of India, where online shopping has increased. In the food supply sector, both retailers and farmers had to face difficulty in storing, transporting, and selling of the goods and had to bear losses due to increased wastage. Although with an increased demand, organic farming has increased but still increased expenditure, less yield, and selling of the products are the major challenges in front of them. Food, fruit and vegetable wastes have considerably reduced at the food supply due to the obvious impact of lockdown on food supplies, however, a shortage of cold storages and supply chain at the farmer level in developing countries has resulted in more wastage. Developed countries reported increased illegal dumping of wastes in the rural areas and the stoppage of the recycling services due to the lockdown. Also, a shift in the habits of the consumer due to health and food-related issues has been seen throughout the world resulting in reduced waste generation at the consumer level. Despite all this, agricultural producer and the retail industry appears to be best placed to weather the storm. The major challenges related to the industry are sustainability in the food chain and maintaining smooth logistics and necessary precautionary measures in the event of health crises in the future.","Zia, M.; Ahmed, S.; Kumar, A.",Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,445,32

H. pylori is also a class I carcinogen of gastric cancer. VacA is the only exocrine toxin of H. pylori, which plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori. The production of VacA in natural circumstances is complex with heavy workload and low yield. Therefore, it is very important to obtain recombinant VacA protein which is stable and biologically active. This study therefore aims to explore the expression, purification and stable storage of VacA toxin of H. pylori in E.coli, and to provide experimental basis for further exploration of the role of VacA in H. pylori -induced inflammation of cancer. RESULTS: A 2502-bp fragment and VacA gene were identified. An 89.7-kDa VacA34-854 recombinant protein was expressed and purified from the recombinant engineering bacteria and was preserved stably in 50 mM acetic acid buffer (pH 2.9). The amount of the recombinant protein was larger in the inclusion bodies than in the supernatant. In addition, after a 24-h culture with VacA recombinant protein, GES-1 cells demonstrated evidence of apoptosis including early nuclear immobilization and clustering under inverted microscope and TEM. It was found that VacA recombinant protein induced apoptosis by TUNEL assay.

However, nursing informatics has not yet been sufficiently developed in Peru due to organizational, material, cultural and sociotechnical challenges. Moreover, pandemics such as COVID-19 require urgent action to transform health care delivery, to expand telenursing and distance learning nursing programs and initiatives in Peru. Therefore, it is essential to promote research and capacity-building programs in nursing informatics in Peru and foster global collaborative networks between public and private institutions. © 2021, Universidad de Concepcion.

This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified. It is necessary to offer correct and transparent information about these vaccines to reduce the concerns and increase the trust of the population, to thereby guarantee the success of the vaccination campaigns.","Rodríguez-Blanco, Noelia; Montero-Navarro, Sergio; Botella-Rico, José M; Felipe-Gómez, Antonio J; Sánchez-Más, Jesús; Tuells, José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),445,16

This is possible thanks to machine learning algorithms applied to publicly available database of confirmed corona cases, recovered cases and death toll. In this purpose, we separate i) the total cases into 14 groups corresponding to 14 incubation periods, ii) the recovered cases into 406 groups corresponding to a combination of incubation and recovery periods, and iii) the death toll into 406 groups corresponding to a combination of incubation and decease periods. In this paper, we focus on recovery and decease periods and their correlation with the incubation period. The estimated mean recovery period we obtain is 22.14 days (95% Confidence Interval(CI): 22.00 to 22.27), and the 90th percentile is 28.91 days (95% CI: 28.71 to 29.13), which is in agreement with statistical supported studies. The bimodal gamma distribution reveals that there are two groups of recovered individuals with a short recovery period, mean 21.02 days (95% CI: 20.92 to 21.12), and a long recovery period, mean 38.88 days (95% CI 38.61 to 39.15). Our study shows that the characteristic of the decease period and the recovery period are alike. From the bivariate analysis, we observe a high probability domain for recovered individuals with respect to incubation and recovery periods. A similar domain is obtained for deaths analyzing bivariate distribution of incubation and decease periods.","Paul, Subhendu; Lorin, Emmanuel",,445,1

METHODS: All patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 21, 2020 to April 14, 2020 in Wuhan. We retrospectively analyzed the patients admitted to the ICU (137 patients) and general wards (114 patients) of Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital in China. The population characteristics, symptoms, and laboratory examination results between the patients in the ICU and those in the general wards were compared. Furthermore, the differences between the deceased patients in the ICU and those discharged from the ICU were compared. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, no presence of complications, presence of 1 complication, and presence of 3 or more complications (P<0.05). There were also significant differences between the patients in terms of the laboratory examination results including elevated urea nitrogen, creatinine, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, troponin I, phosphokinase isoenzyme-MB, and B-type natriuretic peptide; and decreased platelets, lymphocyte absolute value, and eosinophil absolute value (<0.05).

Variable definitions, selection bias, mainly retrospective analyses of hospitalized patients and different methodologies are implemented in the research of this new disease. Central nervous system (CNS) pathology presents most frequently features of non-specific neuroinflammation with microglial activation and lymphoid infiltrations, ischemic/hypoxic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disease, and microthrombi. Some brain specimens remain unaffected or show only non-specific changes of the critical status. Interpretations of the neuropathological findings are not always balanced in a clinical context and discrepant in consequence. Designing of longitudinal neuropathological studies, more frequent autopsies, and building of COVID-19 brain banks, together with neuroimaging analyses is essential. Genetic predispositions or immunological factors corresponding to the disease profile as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum biomarkers of COVID-19, the impact of different virus variants and influence of the therapy need to be identified.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate among the non-congregate population in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. METHODS: The infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were calculated for adults residing in non-congregate settings in Connecticut before June 2020. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were estimated using the seroprevalence estimates from the recently conducted Post-Infection Prevalence study. Information on total hospitalizations and deaths was obtained from the Connecticut Hospital Association and the Connecticut Department of Public Health. RESULTS: Before June 1, 2020, nearly 113,515 (90% CI 56,758-170,273) individuals were estimated to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and there were 7792 hospitalizations and 1079 deaths among the non-congregate population. The overall COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate was 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%-13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI, 0.63%-1.90%) and there was variation in these rate estimates across subgroups; older individuals, men, non-Hispanic Black individuals, and those belonging to 2 of the counties had a higher burden of adverse outcomes, though the differences between most subgroups were not statistically significant.

METHODS: Data come from an online cohort of PrEP-using MSM in the Southern United States from October 2019 to July 2020. Participants were administered ten surveys in total, including one ad hoc survey specifically on COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of this ad hoc survey (n=56) and present changes in sexual behaviors and utilization of and access to sexual health services. Using linear mixed-effects regression models, we also analyzed data from the larger cohort and document how sexual behaviors and PrEP use varied longitudinally across several months. RESULTS: A fifth of participants discontinued or changed how often they take PrEP because of COVID-19. A quarter of the cohort documented challenges when attempting to access PrEP, HIV testing, or STD testing. For all sexual behaviors examined longitudinally-number of male sexual partners, anal sex acts, condomless anal sex, oral sex (all measured in the past 2 weeks)-there was a decrease from February to April followed by an increase from April to June. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest reduced access to and utilization of STD and HIV services coupled with a continuation of behaviors which confer STD/HIV risk.

At present, there is no effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. Hand disinfection is a cost-effective way to prevent its transmission. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, we should wash our hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) with at least 60% alcohol are the alternative. With diligent hand disinfection reinforced during COVID-19, there is an increased prevalence of contact dermatitis. This commentary highlights the fact that contact dermatitis is a readily treatable condition and should not cause any deviation of proper hand hygiene. In irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), the management strategies are selection of less irritating hand hygiene products, frequent use of moisturisers to rebuild the skin barrier, and education on proper hand hygiene practices. In allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), the identification and avoidance of the contact allergen is the key to treatment. However, ACD is less common and only accounts for 20% of the cases. The identified allergens in hand cleansers are predominantly preservative excipients and ACD attributable to ABHR are very uncommon. Alcohol-free hand rubs are widely available on the market but it is not a recommended alternative to ABHRs by the CDC.","Tan, See Wei; Oh, Choon Chiat",Ann Acad Med Singap,445,16

We sought to determine if empiric therapeutic anticoagulation (AC) affected survival in COVID-19 patients compared to standard prophylactic AC. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 402 COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 15 and May 31, 2020 was performed. Clinical outcomes were compared between 152 patients treated with therapeutic AC to 250 patients on prophylactic AC. An elastic net logistic regression was designed to first identify the important variables affecting mortality. These variables were then included as covariates to AC in standard multivariate logistic regression models studying the effect of AC on death. Nonparametric survival analysis was conducted, and Kaplan Meier curves were constructed. RESULTS: Increased mortality was associated with therapeutic AC [OR 3.42 (2.06, 5.67)]. The log-rank test was statistically significant at p = 0.001 showing higher mortality for patients treated with therapeutic AC compared to prophylactic AC. Subset analysis of critically ill and intubated patients had similar survival curves regardless of AC dose. The log-rank test was not significant even with Prentice modification. For non-ICU patients, the log rank test favoring prophylactic AC disappeared when the analysis was stratified by D-dimer level less or greater than 3 µg/mL. Approximately 9% of patients receiving therapeutic AC experienced clinically significant bleeding or thrombocytopenia, versus 3% in those receiving prophylactic AC. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, therapeutic anticoagulation provided no mortality benefit over thromboprophylaxis, independent of co-morbidities or disease severity. More adverse events were observed with therapeutic AC.","Lynn, Lei; Reyes, Juan A; Hawkins, Katrina; Panda, Arjun; Linville, Laura; Aldhahri, Walaa; Kango, Ghazal; Shah, Sneha; Ayanian, Shant; Teufel, Karolyn",Thromb Res,445,27

The importance of these accounts appears to have increased given the unprecedented changes with COVID-19 and the dramatic and unpredictable change to the application cycle including the use of virtual interviews, suggesting a perceived need for increased online engagement with applicants. The purpose of this study was to determine the patterns of creation and usage of Twitter and Instagram accounts of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited General Surgery residency programs and their associated surgical departments. METHORDS: A cross-sectional study of the use of Twitter and Instagram by the 332 ACGME-accredited General Surgery residency programs and their associated departments was conducted in February 2021. Twitter and Instagram accounts were identified by accessing program/department websites as well as social media platform and internet searches. Year of creation, number of followers, and number of posts (July 1, 2018-December 31, 2020) were collected. Trends in usage were compared across years stratified by platform and by account owner (department vs. residency). RESULTS: Instagram accounts are more than five-times greater for residencies compared to departments (42% vs 8%, p < 0.001). There was not a significant difference between the number of department and residency Twitter accounts (26% vs 23%, pâ¯=â¯0.37). Significantly more residency Instagram and Twitter accounts were created or first posted in 2020 compared to department accounts (Instagram: 100 vs 7, p < 0.001; Twitter: 31 vs 6, pâ¯=â¯0.001). Over 18% of residency programs had both Twitter and Instagram accounts compared to only 6% of departments (p < 0.001). However, department Twitter and Instagram accounts had significantly higher median total posts from 7/1/2018-12/31/2020 (Twitter: pâ¯=â¯0.0001, Instagram pâ¯=â¯0.004). While the number of Instagram followers and accounts being followed were similar between residencies and departments, department Twitter accounts had a larger median number of followers (1141 vs. 430, p=0.003) and account followings (308 vs. 192, pâ¯=â¯0.001) compared to residency accounts. CONCLUSIONS: The number of residency social media accounts has significantly increased in 2020 compared to account creation of departments, with Instagram account creation exceeding that of Twitter and of departments. The opposite pattern in usage was seen related to number of posts, and with Twitter, followers, and number of followings, with departments outpacing residencies. This significant increase in account creation may have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to a virtual interview season, suggesting an unprecedented need for online engagement with applicants. As the increased social media presence will likely persist in future application cycles, further study about the impact of residency social media use on recruitment and applicant decision-making as well as effective strategies, is needed.","Bludevich, Bryce M; Fryer, Madeline; Scott, Erin M; Buettner, Hannah; Davids, Jennifer S; LaFemina, Jennifer",J. surg. educ,445,16

METHODS: A quantitative correlational research study was conducted, using a web-based survey. RESULTS: About 1576 participants were involved: 1018 women (64.6%) and 558 men (35.4%). A significant decline in the mean well-being scores during the quarantine, compared to before, was reported. A positive correlation between the well-being scores and the number of sexual intercourse (SI) before and during the quarantine was found. The mean number of SI decreased significantly during the quarantine. The main reasons were: poor privacy (43.2%) and lack of psychological stimuli (40.9%). About 1124 respondents (71.3%) did not report sexual desire (SD) reduction. A positive association between SD and SI during the quarantine was found. About 61.2% did not report autoerotism reduction. In those who reported decreased masturbation activity, the main causes were poor privacy (46.4%) and lack of desire (34.7%). We found that men presented lower SD during the quarantine, than women (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Potentially, the more time available might lead couples to reconnect at an intimate level and to improve their sexuality. However, the majority of quarantined participants experienced reduced number of SI per week, with poor household privacy and lack of psychological stimuli as cited causes, even as a majority did not report reduced autoeroticism.","Cito, Gianmartin; Micelli, Elisabetta; Cocci, Andrea; Polloni, Gaia; Russo, Giorgio Ivan; Coccia, Maria Elisabetta; Simoncini, Tommaso; Carini, Marco; Minervini, Andrea; Natali, Alessandro",Urology,445,24

Currently, severe and nonsevere COVID-19 types are differentiated by only a few features, which do not comprehensively characterize the complicated pathological, physiological, and immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the different disease types. In addition, these type-defining features may not be readily testable at the time of diagnosis. Objective: In this study, we aimed to use a machine learning approach to understand COVID-19 more comprehensively, accurately differentiate severe and nonsevere COVID-19 clinical types based on multiple medical features, and provide reliable predictions of the clinical type of the disease. Methods: For this study, we recruited 214 confirmed patients with nonsevere COVID-19 and 148 patients with severe COVID-19. The clinical characteristics (26 features) and laboratory test results (26 features) upon admission were acquired as two input modalities. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that these features differed substantially between two clinical types. Machine learning random forest models based on all the features in each modality as well as on the top 5 features in each modality combined were developed and validated to differentiate COVID-19 clinical types. Results: Using clinical and laboratory results independently as input, the random forest models achieved &gt;90% and &gt;95% predictive accuracy, respectively. The importance scores of the input features were further evaluated, and the top 5 features from each modality were identified (age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gender, and diabetes for the clinical features modality, and dimerized plasmin fragment D, high sensitivity troponin I, absolute neutrophil count, interleukin 6, and lactate dehydrogenase for the laboratory testing modality, in descending order). Using these top 10 multimodal features as the only input instead of all 52 features combined, the random forest model was able to achieve 97% predictive accuracy. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on how the human body reacts to SARS-CoV-2 infection as a unit and provide insights on effectively evaluating the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 based on more common medical features when gold standard features are not available. We suggest that clinical information can be used as an initial screening tool for self-evaluation and triage, while laboratory test results should be applied when accuracy is the priority.","Chen, Yuanfang Liu Ouyang Bao Forrest S.; Li, Qian Han Lei Zhang Hengdong Zhu Baoli Ge Yaorong Robinson Patrick Xu Ming Liu Jie Chen Shi",Journal of Medical Internet Research,445,23

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been interest in elderberry supplements to treat or prevent illness, but also concern that elderberry might overstimulate the immune system and increase the risk of 'cytokine storm'. We aimed to determine benefits and harms of elderberry for the prevention and treatment of viral respiratory infections, and to assess the relationship between elderberry supplements and negative health impacts associated with overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched six databases, four research registers, and two preprint sites for studies. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data from studies, assessed risk of bias using Cochrane tools, and evaluated certainty of estimates using GRADE. Outcomes included new illnesses and the severity and duration of illness. RESULTS: We screened 1187 records and included five randomized trials on elderberry for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illness. We did not find any studies linking elderberry to clinical inflammatory outcomes. However, we found three studies measuring production of cytokines ex vivo after ingestion of elderberry. Elderberry may not reduce the risk of developing the common cold; it may reduce the duration and severity of colds, but the evidence is uncertain. Elderberry may reduce the duration of influenza but the evidence is uncertain. Compared to oseltamivir, an elderberry-containing product may be associated with a lower risk of influenza complications and adverse events. We did not find evidence on elderberry and clinical outcomes related to inflammation. However, we found evidence that elderberry has some effect on inflammatory markers, although this effect may decline with ongoing supplementation. One small study compared elderberry to diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and provided some evidence that elderberry is as effective or less effective than diclofenac in cytokine reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Elderberry may be a safe option for treating viral respiratory illness, and there is no evidence that it overstimulates the immune system. However, the evidence on both benefits and harms is uncertain and information from recent and ongoing studies is necessary to make firm conclusions.","Wieland, L Susan; Piechotta, Vanessa; Feinberg, Termeh; Ludeman, Emilie; Hutton, Brian; Kanji, Salmaan; Seely, Dugald; Garritty, Chantelle",BMC Complement Med Ther,445,25

The levels of primary DNA damage were estimated with the alkaline comet assay, while cytogenetic abnormalities were determined with the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay. Additionally, CBMN slides of 20 exposed and 16 control participants were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), coupled with pancentromeric probes to establish the incidence of centromere-positive micronuclei, nuclear buds, and nucleoplasmic bridges. Blood lead levels (B-Pb) were measured with atomic absorption spectrometry.

Compared to controls, occupationally exposed workers demonstrated significantly higher B-Pb (298.36±162.07 vs 41.58±23.02), MN frequency (18.71±11.06 vs 8.98±7.50), centromere positive MN (C+ MN) (8.15±1.8 vs 3.69±0.47), and centromere negative MN (C- MN) (14.55±1.80 vs 4.56±0.89). Exposed women had significantly higher comet tail intensity (TI) and length (TL) than control women. Furthermore, workers showed a positive correlation between age and nuclear buds and MN, between MN and years of exposure, and between S-B12 levels and TI and ALAD activity, while a negative correlation was found between TI and B-Pb. These findings suggest that occupational settings in the manufacture of lead-containing products pose significant genotoxic risks, which calls for developing more effective work safety programmes, including periodical monitoring of B-Pb and genetic endpoints.","Kasuba, Vilena; Milic, Mirta; Zeljezic, Davor; Mladinic, Marin; Pizent, Alica; Kljakovic-Gaspic, Zorana; Balija, Melita; Jukic, Irena",Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,445,24

Past experience and scientific evidence at the end of March 2020],17.50528,3.7789023,2020,"Panic disorder (PD) is a common and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by panic attacks coupled with excessive anxiety. Both genetic factors and environmental factors play an important role in PD pathogenesis and response to treatment. However, PD is clinically heterogeneous and genetically complex, and the exact genetic or environmental causes of this disorder remain unclear. Various approaches for detecting disease-causing genes have recently been made available. In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have attracted attention for the identification of disease-associated loci of multifactorial disorders. This review introduces GWAS of PD, followed by a discussion about the limitations of GWAS and the major challenges facing geneticists in the post-GWAS era. Alternative strategies to address these challenges are then proposed, such as epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) using next-generation sequencing. To date, however, few reports have described these analyses, and the evidence remains insufficient to confidently identify or exclude rare variants or epigenetic changes in PD. Further analyses are therefore required, using sample sizes in the tens of thousands, extensive functional annotations, and highly targeted hypothesis testing.","Morimoto, Yoshiro; Ono, Shinji; Kurotaki, Naohiro; Imamura, Akira; Ozawa, Hiroki",,445,0

The rationale for the same is to prevent the transfer of the virus from hands that have come in contact with fomites. While both alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) or washing with soap and water are claimed to have been effective, hand sanitizers have gained more popularity due to the ease of use. The increased frequency of ABHR use and the aerosols generated pose a potential threat to the skin and exposed mucosal surfaces, especially that of the eye due to the proximity of use. The adverse effects of alcohol in these sanitizers can be manifold. An allergic or inflammatory response can occur depending on the predisposing or preexisting conditions.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and usability of a family member and a clinician completed home evaluation process using an adapted commercial MagicPlan mobile application (MPMA) and laser distance measurer (LDM). SETTING: An acute inpatient rehabilitation unit and homes in the community. METHODS: MPMA allows users to create floor plans (FPs), which may include virtually inserted pieces of durable medical equipment (DME). The MPMA with an LDM allows users to virtually demonstrate that ordered DME will fit within the measured environments. After training with an online educational module, the family member of someone on the acute inpatient unit (lay participant) went home to measure room dimensions and to create FPs using the MPMA and LDM. After completing the task, lay participants returned the FPs for review by clinicians responsible for ordering DME. RESULTS: Forty-three lay participants and nine clinicians finished the study. Clinicians were satisfied with 75% of the FPs created by the lay participants using version 2 of the educational module. The lay participants and clinicians both thought the MPMA is useful and recommended its use. CONCLUSION: The MPMA with an LDM can be used to virtually complete a home evaluation and to evaluate for the appropriateness of various considered DME. The method of performing home evaluations may lead to more appropriate DME recommendations to improve functional independence for individuals with disabilities.

A Pandemic Impact On Construction Contracts,17.547443,4.001998,2020,"BACKGROUND: Public health organizations have begun to use social media to increase awareness of health harm and positively improve health behavior. Little is known about effective strategies to disseminate health education messages digitally and ultimately achieve optimal audience engagement. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the difference in audience engagement with identical antismoking health messages on three social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) and with a referring link to a tobacco prevention website cited in these messages. We hypothesized that health messages might not receive the same user engagement on these media, although these messages were identical and distributed at the same time. METHODS: We measured the effect of health promotion messages on the risk of smoking among users of three social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) and disseminated 1275 health messages between April 19 and July 12, 2017 (85 days). The identical messages were distributed at the same time and as organic (unpaid) and advertised (paid) messages, each including a link to an educational website with more information about the topic. Outcome measures included message engagement (ie, the click-through rate [CTR] of the social media messages) and educational website engagement (ie, the CTR on the educational website [wCTR]). To analyze the data and model relationships, we used mixed effects negative binomial regression, z-statistic, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. RESULTS: Comparisons between social media sites showed that CTRs for identical antitobacco health messages differed significantly across social media (P<.001 for all). Instagram showed the statistically significant highest overall mean message engagement (CTR=0.0037; 95% CI 0.0032-0.0042), followed by Facebook (CTR=0.0026; 95% CI 0.0022-0.0030) and Twitter (CTR=0.0015; 95% CI 0.0013-0.0017). Facebook showed the highest as well as the lowest CTR for any individual message. However, the message CTR is not indicative of user engagement with the educational website content. Pairwise comparisons of the social media sites differed with respect to the wCTR (P<.001 for all). Messages on Twitter showed the lowest CTR, but they resulted in the highest level of website engagement (wCTR=0.6308; 95% CI 0.5640-0.6975), followed by Facebook (wCTR=0.2213; 95% CI 0.1932-0.2495) and Instagram (wCTR=0.0334; 95% CI 0.0230-0.0438). We found a statistically significant higher CTR for organic (unpaid) messages (CTR=0.0074; 95% CI 0.0047-0.0100) compared with paid advertisements (CTR=0.0022; 95% CI 0.0017-0.0027; P<.001 and P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence-based insights to guide the design of health promotion efforts on social media. Future studies should examine the platform-specific impact of psycholinguistic message variations on user engagement, include newer sites such as Snapchat and TikTok, and study the correlation between web-based behavior and real-world health behavior change. The need is urgent in light of increased health-related marketing and misinformation on social media.","Reuter, Katja; Wilson, Melissa L; Moran, Meghan; Le, NamQuyen; Angyan, Praveen; Majmundar, Anuja; Kaiser, Elsi M; Unger, Jennifer B",JMIR Public Health Surveill,445,16

Spatio-temporal analysis by state were performed, mainly from April to September 2020, including descriptive analyses through mapping and time series representations, and the fit of linear mixed models and time series clustering to analyze trends by state. The association of comorbidities and other variables with the risks were studied by fitting a spatial panel data linear model (splm). As results, we observed that on average the greatest risks were reached by July, and that highest risks were observed in some states, Baja California Norte, Chiapas, and Sonora; interestingly, some densely populated states, as Mexico City, had lower values. Different trends by state were observed, and a four-order polynomial, including fixed and random effects, was necessary to model them. The most general structure is one in which the risks increase and then decrease and was observed in states belonging to two clusters; however, there is a cluster corresponding to states with a retarded increase, and another in which increasing risks through time were observed. A cyclic behavior in terms of states having a second increasing trend was observed. Finally, according to the splm, percentage of men, being in the group of 50 years and over, chronic kidney disease failure, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and hypertension were positively associated with the case-fatality risks. This analysis may provide valuable insight into COVID-19 dynamics in future outbreaks, as well as the determinants of these trends at a state level; and, by combining spatial and temporal information, provide a better understanding of COVID-19 case-fatality.","Ramamp, Ricardo; iacuterez-Aldana,; Naranjo, Lizbeth; Gomez-Verjan, Juan Carlos; Bello-Chavolla, Omar Yaxmehen",,445,7

The study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety levels of pediatric Hematology/Oncology patients during the COVID19 pandemic and evaluate the association between anxiety levels and physical, emotional, and social aspects of HRQoL. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 292 children between 2.5 - 13 years with chronic hematological/oncological disorders. Pediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scale and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale were used for assessment of HRQoL and anxiety, respectively. Linear regression was performed to assess the association between background and COVID-19 related factors with anxiety level. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was performed to assess the association between the three HRQoL dimensions with child anxiety and different independent variables. Transfusion-dependent patients had lower anxiety levels than patients receiving chemotherapy (B=-14.45, 95% CI=-21.94,-6.95).Children who were aware of the pandemic had lower anxiety scores than those who were not, while those suffering from canceled clinic days had higher anxiety levels (B=-8.66,95% CI=-14.86,-2.45, and B = 7.33,95% CI =1.22,13.45, respectively). Anxiety significantly reduced the three HRQoL domains (B=-0.36, 95% CI=-0.47, -0.24 for physical functioning, B=-0.45, 95% CI =-0.56, -0.33 for social functioning and B=-0.50, 95% CI=-0.63,-0.38 for emotional functioning).

Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. RESULTS: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications.

A structure-based docking design technique was explored in designing a novel derivative of chloroquine for the treatment and management of new COVID 19 disease. To achieve this, the molecular docking simulation method was used to investigate the level of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (Drugs presently under clinical trial) interactions on SARS-CoV2 enzyme (a causative agent of COVID 19 disease). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which has been debated as drugs for the management of COVID 19 were subjected to molecular docking analysis, and the binding energies generated were found to be -6.1 kcal/mol and -6.8 kcal/mol respectively. Moreover, novel 2-((4-((7-chloroquinolin-4 yl) amino)pentyl)((methylamino)methyl)amino) ethan-1-ol as an anti-SARS-CoV2 protease was designed through the structural modification of hydroxychloroquine. The binding energy of this drug candidate was found to be -6.9 kcal/mol. This novel drug was found to formed hydrogen and conventional interactions with the binding site of SARS-CoV2 protease through amino acids such as Glutamic acid (GLU166), Glycine (GLY143), Phenylalanine (PHE140), Asparagine (ASN142), Histidine (HIS163), His (HIS172, HIS41, HIS163), Leucine (LEU41, LEU27), Glycine (GLY143), Glutamine (GLN189), Methionine (MET49, MET165), Serine (SER 46), Cysteine (CYS145) and Threonine (THR25). With this binding energy, this new drug candidate could bind better to the human SARS-CoV2 protease' binding site. This research provides a clue for other scientists on various ways of designing and identify the types of amino acids that may be responsible for biochemical action on SARS-CoV2 protease.","Abdulfatai, U.; Uzairu, A.; Shallangwa, G.

The Bayesian linear mixed effects model is designed for this application which allows student-specific error variances to vary. The novel Bayesian missing value imputation method is flexible which seamlessly generates missing values given complete data. We observed an increase in overall average marks for the courses requiring lower-level cognitive skills according to Bloom's Taxonomy and a decrease in marks for the courses requiring higher-level cognitive skills, where larger changes in marks were observed for the underachieving students.

This would be the first exoplanet detected around a main sequence star by a radio telescope. Radial velocity confirmation of such a planet has proven inconclusive, and it remains possible that the radio emission could be generated by a stellar coronal process. Using data from TESS, we shed light on this question by probing the stellar activity and flares of GJ 1151 as well as fourteen other M dwarfs detected by LOFAR. GJ 1151 and three other star-planet interaction candidates are found to be inactive, with no rotational modulation and few, if any, flares. The remainder of the LOFAR detected M dwarfs flare frequently. We consider it unlikely that stellar activity is responsible for the bright, circularly-polarized emission from GJ 1151 and its three analogs, and support the star-planet magnetic interaction interpretation.","Pope, Benjamin J.S.; Callingham, Joseph R.; Feinstein, Adina D.; Gunther, Maximilian N.; Vedantham, Harish K.; Ansdell, Megan; Shimwell, Timothy W.",,445,16

In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms to infer the trajectories of cellular changes and identify their transcriptional programs. Our study generated cellular trajectories that show the COVID-19 pathogenesis of healthy-to-moderate and healthy-to-severe on macrophages and T cells, and we observed more diverse trajectories in macrophages compared to T cells. Furthermore, our deep-learning algorithm DrivAER identified several pathways (e.g., xenobiotic pathway and complement pathway) and transcription factors (e.g., MITF and GATA3) that could be potential drivers of the transcriptomic changes for COVID-19 pathogenesis and the markers of the COVID-19 severity.

Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status. Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days. Among hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, COVID-19 is independently associated with higher NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) and lower apolipoprotein E and HDL concentrations. These features might act as mediators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and emerge as new therapeutic targets. Further investigations are required to define the role of NEFAs in the pathogenesis and the dysregulated immune response associated with COVID-19.Trial registration: NCT04435223.","Nguyen, Maxime; Bourredjem, Abderrahmane; Piroth, Lionel; Bouhemad, Bélaïd; Jalil, Antoine; Pallot, Gaetan; Le Guern, Naig; Thomas, Charles; Pilot, Thomas; Bergas, Victoria; Choubley, Hélène; Quenot, Jean-Pierre; Charles, Pierre-Emmanuel; Lagrost, Laurent; Deckert, Valerie; de Barros, Jean-Paul Pais; Guinot, Pierre-Grégoire; Masson, David; Binquet, Christine; Gautier, Thomas; Blot, Mathieu",Sci Rep,445,1

The world-wide plague caused by the COVID-19 virus precipitated the first global police event presenting an occasion for researchers and scholars to apply existing theory and empirical understanding to extra-ordinary circumstances. Consideration of the politics of the police during the plague reveals a tectonic shift in the world system. The transnational and comparative study of police and policing reveals the contours of the emerging system of world power all the more clearly in a moment of crisis. The pandemic panic presents an historical moment during which, figuratively speaking, policing power crystalizes and can be seen clearly. On the global stage, in response to the pandemic panic authoritarian and totalitarian policing practices are demonstrated alongside those in putative democracies. Emerging and observable practices of rule by law are antithetical to democratic policing in the general social interest, and rule of law rhetoric justifying militarized law enforcement action in many places continues to bring police into further disrepute. The coming era will continue to be a time where, in most places “the strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they must”—as the ancient historian Thucydides observed in the aftermath of the fratricidal Peloponnesian War more than two millennia ago. The pandemic panic shows in the starkest statistical numbers that, where social justice is achieved, the outcome of the politics of the police is not the command of the sovereign.","Sheptycki, James",Aust.

STUDY AIMS: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, threat perception, illness representations. METHODS: Cross-sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used, for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. RESULTS: A total of 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, from all levels of area deprivation (i.e., 3.8% in the most deprived decile and 15.6% in the most affluent decile). Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exacerbated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the results of pre-Covid-19 pandemic studies about associations between sociodemographics and mental health. Loneliness, lack of social support and thoughts about Covid-19 exacerbated these effects and offer pointers for pre-emptive action.","Hubbard, Gill; den Daas, Chantal; Johnston, Marie; Dixon, Diane",Int. j. behav. med,445,16

The effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women are still largely unknown. Several adverse perinatal outcomes have been reported in COVID-19-positive pregnant women, including pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, pre-term labor, and stillbirth. Histopathological examination of COVID-19 placentas can contribute significant data regarding maternal and fetal health and can elucidate more findings in this novel disease. A 23-year-old female with morbid obesity and scant antenatal care presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and fever;she was found to be positive for COVID-19. Grossly, her placenta showed no abnormalities. Histological examination of her placenta showed chronic lymphoplasmacytic deciduitis, villous fibrosis, loss of capillarization, extravasation of erythrocytes, chorangiosis, and thrombosis of upstream stem vessels, including large fetal vessels on the chorionic plate. These changes were deemed to be consistent with fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV).

Indeed, in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 promotes a dysfunctional immune response that dysregulates the cytokine secretory pattern. Hypercytokinemia underlies the hyperinflammatory state leading to injury of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, as well as to lung infiltration sustained by neutrophils and macrophages. Within such a pathogenic context, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other cytokines/chemokines play a pivotal pro-inflammatory role. Therefore, cytokines and their receptors, as well as cytokine-dependent intracellular signalling pathways can be targeted by potential therapies aimed to relieve the heavy burden of cytokine storm. In particular, the anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is emerging as one of the most promising pharmacologic treatments.

For this study, changes in the air quality index (AQI) and the concentrations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3) were evaluated during the Covid-19 control period in northern China. Overall, the air quality improved, most likely due to reduced emissions from the transportation and secondary industrial sectors. Specifically, the transportation sector was linked to the NO2 emission reductions, while lower emissions from secondary industries were the major cause for the reductions of PM2.5 and CO. The reduction in SO2 concentrations was only linked to the industrial sector. However, the reductions in emissions did not fully eliminate air pollution, and O3 actually increased, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO2 and as a result greater O3 production. These results also highlight need to control emissions from the residential sector.","Wang, Yichen; Yuan, Yuan; Wang, Qiyuan; Liu, ChenGuang; Zhi, Qiang; Cao, Junji",Sci Total Environ,445,20

PURPOSE: Medication reconciliation (MR) is a complicated and tedious process but is crucial to prevent errors when ordering patients' discharge medications during a hospital admission. Our institution currently uses a variety of methods to gather a patient's medication history, including review of the medical records and electronic pharmaceutical claims data (EPCD) from a commercial health information exchange organization, as well as a patient or caregiver interview. Occasionally, more information is needed to obtain the most accurate history. To augment current methods, EPCD can also be accessed for patients with Medicaid insurance using a state Medicaid Web portal. We aimed to evaluate the utility of the Medicaid Web portal for reducing medication errors during the MR process at hospital admission. SUMMARY: A single-center, prospective, quality improvement initiative was conducted to evaluate 100 patient medication lists for all nonobstetric Medicaid patients admitted to our institution to identify discrepancies in medication lists when the state Medicaid Web portal was used in addition to standard MR methods. We found that, when EPCD from commercial organizations were available, they matched the patient's current medication list 64% of the time. One in 4 patients had at least 1 discrepancy on their verified medication list that was identified using the Medicaid Web portal. The discrepancies identified were addressed and corrected in real time to improve patient care. CONCLUSION: EPCD from the state Medicaid Web portal could supplement the use of current methods to obtain a more accurate medication history and reduce the number of erroneously ordered discharge medications during hospital admission.","Parks, Lauren K; McGrane, Ian R; Hartzell, Jayme L",Am. j. health system pharm,445,29

However, under unique circumstances with diligent preparation, vital oncologic operations can be performed safely. METHODS: Prospective comparison of surgical cases during the pandemic from December 2019 to May 2020 to the correlating time frame from December 2018 to May 2019. RESULTS: A significant decline in case volume was not appreciated until the United States declared a national state of emergency, allowing patients with cancer to continue to undergo curative tumor resection until then (428.3 ± 51.5 vs 166.6 ± 59.8 cases/week; P < .001). The decrease was consistent with the mean case volume during the holidays (213.8 ± 76.8 vs 166.6 ± 59.8 case/week; P = .648). Evaluation of surgical subspecialties demonstrated a significant decrease for all subspecialties with the greatest decline in sarcoma (P = .002) and endocrine (P = .001) surgeries, while vascular (P = .004) and thoracic (P = .011) surgeries had the least.

Monitoring the burden of disease by serological assay could be used as an early warning system for imminent outbreaks as an increased seroprevalance often precedes larger outbreaks. However, the multitude of highly pathogenic viruses necessitates the need to identify specific antibodies against several targets from both humans as well as from potential reservoir animals such as bats. In order to address this, we have developed a broadly reactive multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) for the detection of antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses from both humans and animals. To this aim, nucleoproteins (NP) of Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV) and nucleocapsid proteins (NP) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus and Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus were employed in a 5-plex assay for IgG detection. After optimisation, specific binding to each respective NP was shown by testing sera from humans and non-human primates with known infection status. The usefulness of our assay for serosurveillance was shown by determining the immune response against the NP antigens in a panel of 129 human serum samples collected in Guinea between 2011 and 2012 in comparison to a panel of 88 sera from the German blood bank. We found good agreement between our MMIA and commercial or in-house reference methods by ELISA or IIFT with statistically significant higher binding to both EBOV NP and MARV NP coupled microspheres in the Guinea panel. Finally, the MMIA was successfully adapted to detect antibodies from bats that had been inoculated with EBOV- and MARV- virus-like particles, highlighting the versatility of this technique and potentially enabling the monitoring of wildlife as well as human populations with this assay. We were thus able to develop and validate a sensitive and broadly reactive high-throughput serological assay which could be used as a screening tool to detect antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses.","Surtees, Rebecca; Stern, Daniel; Ahrens, Katharina; Kromarek, Nicole; Lander, Angelika; Kreher, Petra; Weiss, Sabrina; Hewson, Roger; Punch, Emma K; Barr, John N; Witkowski, Peter T; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Marzi, Andrea; Dorner, Brigitte G; Kurth, Andreas",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,445,26

The imposition of lockdown, quarantine, and isolation measures by most countries to curtail the spread of the coronavirus led to the rapid development of information, communication, and technological (ICT) solutions to minimize the effect of the lockdown, and as an alternative to normal day-to-day physical interactions. Telemedicine involves the delivery of health care services by qualified health professionals using ICT for the exchange of valid information where distance is a critical factor, thus enhancing access to health care services. The use of ICT as a tool to improve access to health care services and for tackling the raging pandemic was one of the options embraced and considered by many countries. Indeed, there are indications that the use of telemedicine as a complementary option to current traditional medical practice will continue in the post-COVID period. The shift to telemedicine has severe health and environmental health implications and should be done with caution. Poor management of generated electronic waste was found to be responsible for environmental pollution and health hazards affecting major organs of the human body. Countries, especially those in the developing world, lack infrastructure for effective implementation of policies required to appropriately manage electronic waste. Therefore, it is highly imperative that adequate measures are put in place to mitigate the potential hazardous effects of the shift to telemedicine.","Adejumo, Oluseyi Ademola Oludamilola Adebola Adejumo",Malawi Medical Journal,445,26

In view of the earlier evidence about effectiveness of repurposed lopinavir/ritonavir against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV), as well as preliminary docking studies conducted by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization approved the restricted public health use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination amongst symptomatic COVID-19 patients detected in the country.

Diabetic patients' mortality rates with COVID-19 are higher than those of cardiovascular or cancer patients. Recently, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has shown successful results in reversing diabetes in both rats and clinical trials based on different mechanisms from aerobic glycolysis to beta cells regeneration. BCG is a multi-face vaccine that has been used extensively in protection from tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy and has been repositioned for treatment of bladder cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Recently, COVID-19 epidemiological studies confirmed that universal BCG vaccination reduced morbidity and mortality in certain geographical areas. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies that have shown low numbers of reported COVID-19 cases. Some countries have started clinical trials that included a single dose BCG vaccine as prophylaxis from COVID-19 or an attempt to minimize its side effects. This proposed research aims to use BCG vaccine as a double-edged weapon countering both COVID-19 and diabetes, not only as protection but also as therapeutic vaccination. The work includes a case study of regenerated pancreatic beta cells based on improved C-peptide and PCPRI laboratory findings after BCG vaccination for a 9 year old patient. The patient was re-vaccinated based on a negative tuberculin test and no scar at the site of injection of the 1st BCG vaccination at birth. The authors suggest and invite the scientific community to take into consideration the concept of direct BCG re-vaccination (after 4 weeks) because of the reported gene expressions and exaggerated innate immunity consequently. As the diabetic MODY-5 patient (mutation of HNF1B, Val2Leu) was on low dose Riomet® while eliminating insulin gradually, a simple analytical method for metformin assay was recommended to ensure its concentration before use as it is not approved yet by the Egyptian QC labs.","Ayoub, B M; Ramadan, E; Ashoush, N; Tadros, M M; Hendy, M S; Elmazar, M M; Mousa, S A",Pharmazie,445,28

Nevertheless, some controversy still exists and there is limited information of the ACEIs/ARBs effect size on COVID-19 prognosis. AIM AND METHODS: We aimed to measure the effect of ACEIs and/or ARBs on COVID-19 severe clinical illness by a meta-analysis. Literature search included all studies published since the COVID-19 outbreak began (December 2019) until May 9, 2020. We analyzed information from studies that included tested COVID-19 patients with arterial hypertension as comorbidity prior to hospital admission and history of taking ACEIs, ARBs, or ACEIs/ARBs. RESULTS: We included 16 studies that involved 24,676 COVID-19 patients, and we compared patients with critical (nâ¯=â¯4134) vs. non-critical (nâ¯=â¯20,542) outcomes. The overall assessment by estimating random effects shows that the use of ACEIs/ARBs is not associated with higher risk of in-hospital-death and/or severe illness among hypertensive patients with COVID-19 infection. On the contrary, effect estimate shows an overall protective effect of RAAS inhibitors/blockers (ACEIs, ARBs, and/or ACEIs/ARBs) with â¼ 23 % reduced risk of death and/or critical disease (OR: 0.768, 95%CI: 0.651-0.907, p=0.0018). The use of ACEIs (OR:0.652, 95%CI:0.478-0.891, p=0.0072) but not ACEIs/ARBs (OR:0.867, 95%CI:0.638-1.179, p =NS) or ARBs alone (OR:0.810, 95%CI:0.629-1.044, p=NS) may explain the overall protection displayed by RAAS intervention combined.

Not surprisingly, these actions directly impacted demand for nonessential goods and services, but the full impact of this shock on the broader economy will depend on the nature and strength of value chains. In a world where production chains are increasingly fragmented, a shock in one industry (or a group of industries) in one country will affect other domestic industries as well as international trade, leading to impacts on production in other countries. We employ the World Input-Output Database to depict the interdependencies among both industries and countries, which provides a full representation of global value chains. By assuming a homogeneous impact on demand for nonessential goods and services around the world, we demonstrate asymmetric effects on production by industry and international trade, leading to asymmetric relative impacts on national economies. Our results indicate that if demand for nonessential goods and services decreases by 50%, the global gross domestic product will decline by 23%, leading to relative impacts that are larger in China, Indonesia, and some European countries. Also, international trade declines by almost 30%, largely due to a reduction in economic activity associated with the production of raw materials and certain types of manufacturing. This work highlights the relevancy of going beyond measuring the direct effects of COVID-19 and provides insights into how international trade linkages will induce broader economic impacts across the globe.","Ferreira, J.

AXL is a candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the respiratory system, and the GAS6/AXL axis is targeted in current clinical trials against COVID-19. However, GAS6 and TAMs have not been evaluated in COVID-19 patients at emergency admission. METHODS: Plasma GAS6, AXL, and MERTK were analyzed in 132 patients consecutively admitted to the emergency ward during the first peak of COVID-19. RESULTS: GAS6 levels were higher in the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, increasing progressively with the severity of the disease. Patients with initial GAS6 at the highest quartile had the worst outcome, with a 3-month survival of 65%, compared to a 90% survival for the rest. Soluble AXL exhibited higher plasma concentration in deceased patients, without significant differences in MERTK among SARS-CoV-2-positive groups. GAS6 mRNA was mainly expressed in alveolar cells and AXL in airway macrophages. Remarkably, THP-1 human macrophage differentiation neatly induces AXL, and its inhibition (bemcentinib) reduced cytokine production in human macrophages after LPS challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma GAS6 and AXL levels reflect COVID-19 severity and could be early markers of disease prognosis, supporting a relevant role of the GAS6/AXL system in the immune response in COVID-19.","Morales, Albert; Rojo Rello, Silvia; Cristóbal, Helena; Fiz-López, Aida; Arribas, Elisa; Marí, Montserrat; Tutusaus, Anna; de la Cal-Sabater, Paloma; Nicolaes, Gerry A F; Ortiz-Pérez, José T; Bernardo, David; García de Frutos, Pablo",,445,1

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 5·7% (95% CI 5·1-6·4) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 14·9% (13·2-16·9) by Jan 15, 2021. With 26·5% (23·4-29·8) of adult residents having been infected in Île-de-France (Paris region) compared with 5·1% (4·5-5·8) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 0·50) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 0·74). The proportion infected was twice as high (20·4%, 15·6-26·3) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (9·7%, 6·9-14·1). 40·2% (34·3-46·3) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 49·3% (42·9-55·9) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 0·89). INTERPRETATION: Our simple approach to estimate the proportion of adults that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 can help to characterise the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemic dynamics, and the performance of surveillance in different regions.

For the detection of COVID-19 from radiology images, many organizations are proposing the use of Deep Learning. University of Waterloo and DarwinAI, have designed their own Deep Learning model COVIDNet-CT to detect COVID-19 from infected chest CT images. Additionally, they have introduced a CT image dataset COVIDx-CT, from CT images collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation. COVIDx-CT contains 104,009 CT image slices across 1,489 patient cases. After obtaining remarkable results on the identification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images by using the COGNEX VisionPro Deep Learning Software 1.0 this time we test the performance of the software on the identification of COVID-19 from CT images. COGNEX Deep Learning Software: VisionPro Deep Learning, is a Deep Learning software that is used across various domains ranging from factory automation to life sciences. In this study, we train the classification model on 82,818 chest CT training and validation images from the COVIDx-CT dataset in 3 classes - normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 and then test the results of the classification on the 21,191 test images are compared with the results of COVIDNet-CT and various other state of the art Deep Learning models from the open-source community. Also, we test how reducing the number of images in the training set effects the results of the software. Overall, VisionPro Deep Learning gives the best results with F-scores over 99%, even as the number of images in the training set is reduced significantly. This software is by no means a stand-alone solution in the detection of COVID-19 but can aid radiologists and clinicians in achieving faster and understandable diagnosis using the full potential of Deep Learning, without the prerequisite of having to code in any programming language.","Sarkar, Arjun; Vandenhirtz, Joerg; Nagy, Jozsef; Bacsa, David; Riley, Mitchell",,445,1

METHODS: This study first examined current epidemiological reports to better understand the risk of mortality from COVID-19. Past epidemiological studies from severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS were also examined given similar virology. Next, at best and at worst mortality cases were considered with the goal of estimating the probability of mortality. To accomplish this for the general population, microdata from the National Health Interview Survey pooled sample (2016, 2017, and 2018 IPUMS NHIS with a sample of 34,881 adults at least 60 years of age) were utilized. Primary measures included age and health status (diabetes, body mass index, and hypertension). A logit regression with 100,000 simulations was employed to derive the estimates and probabilities. RESULTS: Age exhibited a positive association for the probability of death with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.22 (p<0.05, 1.05-1.42, 95% C.I.). A positive association was also found for obesity (OR 1.03, p<0.01, 1.02-1.04 95% C.I.) and hypertension (OR 1.36, p<0.01, 1.09-1.66 95% C.I.) for the at best case. Diabetes was significant but only for the at best case. DISCUSSION: This study found mortality increased with age and was notable for the 74-79 age group for the at best case and the 70-79 age group of the at worst case. Obesity was also important and suggested a higher risk for mortality. Hypertension also exhibited greater risk but the increase was minimal. Given the volume of information and misinformation, these findings can be applied by health professionals, gerontologists, social workers, and local policymakers to better inform older adults about mortality risks and, in the process, re-establish public trust.","Sharma, Andy",,445,1

We describe here the first case of a pregnant woman with Covid-19 acute infection and non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH). Case description: A woman at 36 weeks of gestation was referred to our Maternity Hospital for premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Her medical history was positive for NCAH on chronic steroid replacement till the age of 17 years (cortisone acetate and dexamethasone, both in the morning). At admission, her naso-oro-pharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. Due to hyperpyrexia and late preterm PROM, cesarean section was planned, and she was started on a 100 mg-bolus of hydrocortisone, followed by continuous infusion of 200 mg/24 h. A female neonate in good clinical condition and with a negative nasopharyngeal Covid-19 swab was delivered. On second postpartum day, the mother was in good condition and was switched to oral steroid therapy. On third postpartum day she worsened, with radiological signs of acute pulmonary embolism.

(preprint),17.519722,4.0217214,2021,"BACKGROUND: Throughout March 2020, leaders in countries across the world were making crucial decisions about how and when to implement public health interventions to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). They urgently needed tools to help them to explore what will work best in their specific circumstances of epidemic size and spread, and feasible intervention scenarios. OBJECTIVE: We sought to rapidly develop a flexible, freely available simulation model for use by modelers and researchers to allow investigation of how various public health interventions implemented at various time points might change the shape of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. METHODS: ""COVOID"" (COVID-19 Open-Source Infection Dynamics) is a stochastic individual contact model (ICM), which extends the ICMs provided by the open-source EpiModel package for the R statistical computing environment. To demonstrate its use and inform urgent decisions on March 30, 2020, we modeled similar intervention scenarios to those reported by other investigators using various model types, as well as novel scenarios. The scenarios involved isolation of cases, moderate social distancing, and stricter population ""lockdowns"" enacted over varying time periods in a hypothetical population of 100,000 people. On April 30, 2020, we simulated the epidemic curve for the three contiguous local areas (population 287,344) in eastern Sydney, Australia that recorded 5.3% of Australian cases of COVID-19 through to April 30, 2020, under five different intervention scenarios and compared the modeled predictions with the observed epidemic curve for these areas. RESULTS: COVOID allocates each member of a population to one of seven compartments. The number of times individuals in the various compartments interact with each other and their probability of transmitting infection at each interaction can be varied to simulate the effects of interventions. Using COVOID on March 30, 2020, we were able to replicate the epidemic response patterns to specific social distancing intervention scenarios reported by others. The simulated curve for three local areas of Sydney from March 1 to April 30, 2020, was similar to the observed epidemic curve in terms of peak numbers of cases, total numbers of cases, and duration under a scenario representing the public health measures that were actually enacted, including case isolation and ramp-up of testing and social distancing measures. CONCLUSIONS: COVOID allows rapid modeling of many potential intervention scenarios, can be tailored to diverse settings, and requires only standard computing infrastructure. It replicates the epidemic curves produced by other models that require highly detailed population-level data, and its predicted epidemic curve, using parameters simulating the public health measures that were enacted, was similar in form to that actually observed in Sydney, Australia. Our team and collaborators are currently developing an extended open-source COVOID package comprising of a suite of tools to explore intervention scenarios using several categories of models.","Churches, Timothy; Jorm, Louisa",JMIR Public Health Surveill,445,29

Here, we advocate a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no means exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org. The website deploys the predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on ultrasound lung images.

Hybrid constructed wetlands with four substrate layers (HCW) and modified hybrid constructed wetland (MHCW-1 and MHCW-2) with seven substrate layers were designed to evaluate the enhanced treatment capacity for wastewaters. To this end, we carried out an outdoor experiment at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam to treat its wastewaters from April to August 2019. All constructed wetland units were planted with reed Phragmites australis and cyperus Cyperus alternifolius; and specifically wetland MHCW-2 was cultured with earthworm Perionys excavates. Results indicated that MHCW-1 and MHCW-2 with seven substrate layers had higher removal efficiencies of NO3--N, TKN and TP than HCW system. More substrate layers in MHCW-1 and MHCW-2 also resulted in increase of Cu and Pb removal efficiencies, with 73.5%, 79.4%, 71.5% and 67.8%, respectively. Particularly, earthworm addition in MHCW-2 was more efficient in decreasing the concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), with removal efficiency over 70%.","Huong, Mai; Costa, Dan-Tam; Van Hoi, Bui",Water Sci Technol,445,16

Methods: The method of cross-sectional study was applied. A questionnaire survey of CRC patients in China was carried out. Their basic and treatment information during the COVID-19 were collected and associated effects on treatment, nursing, state of psychology and needs of social support were analyzed. Results: Of the 1147 participants in the study, 635 (55.4%) were male and 512 (44.6%) were female with mean age of (52.8±12.8) years. The treatment or follow up of 896 (78.1%) CRC patients were affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 253 patients (22.1%) had their treatment regiments changed, of whom 141 (12.3%) had their chemotherapy regiments postponed or changed, and 83 patients (7.2%) had their surgical treatment affected. Among the above 83 patients, 39 patients (3.4%) underwent emergency surgery. A total of 277 patients (24.1%) had their out-of-hospital care needs affected, mainly due to maintenance of PICC (49.5%, 137/277). CRC patients had poorer sleep quality and increased levels of insomnia than before (P<0.001), and were more distressed, anxious, depressed, and angry than they were before. They presented the more requirements of help (P<0.001). In addition, 376 patients (32.8%) had received telemedicine services, but only 36.4% (137/376) of them were satisfied. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has effect on the integrated treatment of CRC patients include diagnosis, treatment, examination and prognosis. While protecting CRC patients from being infected with SARS-CoV-2, health-care workers should also actively help them to receive timely and correct treatment and pay attention to their nursing, nutritional, psychological and social support needs in the COVID-19 epidemic.","Yang, Y; Gao, Z Y; Chen, Y K; Wang, H Y; Chen, J J; Song, C; Gu, J",Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi,445,20

From 10 March to 1 May 2020, NewYork-Presbyterian laboratories performed 27,377 SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays from 22,338 patients. Repeat testing was performed for 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had initial negative and 802 had initial positive results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to have severe disease and low viral loads. The negative predictive value of the first-day result among repeat-tested patients was 81.3% The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays was estimated between 58% and 96%, depending on the unknown number of false-negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to negative was unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20 to 30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Conversion from first-day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. Sixty patients fluctuated between positive and negative results over several weeks, suggesting that caution is needed when single-test results are acted upon. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely, 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same day or next 2 days after a negative test for patients with high suspicion for COVID-19.","Green, Daniel A; Zucker, Jason; Westblade, Lars F; Whittier, Susan; Rennert, Hanna; Velu, Priya; Craney, Arryn; Cushing, Melissa; Liu, Dakai; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Boehme, Amelia K; Sepulveda, Jorge L",J. clin. microbiol,445,24

However, a significant proportion of people report that they do not intend to have a vaccine, often because of concerns they have about vaccine side effects or safety. This study will assess the impact of theory-based messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention, drawing on the Necessity-Concerns framework to address previously reported beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, and assess whether hypothesised variables (illness coherence, perceived necessity and concerns) mediate change in vaccination intention. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, parallel two-arm, individually randomised (1:1) trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years, living in Scotland and not vaccinated for COVID-19. A quota sampling approach will be used with the aim of achieving a nationally representative sample on gender, region and ethnic group, with oversampling of individuals with no educational qualifications or with only school-level qualifications. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages addressing necessity beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. Comparator: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages containing general information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Self-reported intention to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 if invited, immediately post-intervention. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Self-reported COVID-19 illness coherence, perceived necessity of a COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about a COVID-19 vaccine, immediately post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: Quasi-randomisation performed automatically by online survey software, by creating a variable derived from the number of seconds in the minute that the participant initiates the survey. Participants starting the survey at 0-14 or 30-44 seconds in the minute are allocated to the intervention and 15-29 or 45-59 seconds to the comparator. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment but will not be informed of the purpose of the study until they have completed the follow-up survey. Investigators will be blinded to allocation as all procedures will be undertaken digitally and remotely without any investigator contact with participants.

But current enforcement measures of mask mandates are mostly monitored by humans, and thus may be hard to execute effectively in densely populated and fast-moving venues like airports and public transit. An automated mask detection monitoring system could greatly reduce the required human labor. In this study, a facial mask detection software model, usable in existing surveillance applications such as airport monitoring systems, is developed using Keras, a high-level deep learning API, and TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The model uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which were trained from a database of roughly 12,000 images of faces, with roughly a 50-50 split of masked and unmasked, with the goal of achieving binary classification to detect whether a person is wearing a mask. The DCNN mask detection software achieved a validation accuracy of 98 percent. We also used computer vision techniques from OpenCV including facial detection and contours to detect the location of the people's faces. The DCNN was then paired with this application to achieve live feed object detection by first detecting a person, and then determine whether they are wearing a mask. Finally, we explore the potential implementation and applications of the facial detection model via the linkage of cameras in monitoring areas to signal and notify officials. As more countries are developing mask wearing regulations, automated masked face detection is a key real-world application [3]. Transportation systems are one area that have been considerably affected by the pandemic, as cities around the world had to enforce massive restrictions on public transport in order to limit transmission of the virus and ensure the safe passage of key workers during the emergency response [4]. Masks have since been required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, transportation hubs such as airports and stations [5]. However, Machine Learning and Deep Learning can help to combat Covid-19 in many ways. Enabling researchers and clinicians to evaluate a vast amount of data to make various predictions. In particular, face mask detection may prove to be useful as a guide for government surveillance on people in public areas susceptible to transmission, to ensure that face mask regulations are upheld. To achieve this, deep learning binary classification facial mask model based on VGG19 and one -shot object detection methods will be trained. We contribute a dual face-and-mask detection system that can provide immediate feedback in live surveillance systems. The method introduced is fast and accurate and can work for live mask-checking in busy public areas, alleviating some of the human effort and error typically subject to the mask mandating task. © 2021 IEEE.","Zhang, E.","2021 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference, ICNS 2021",445,20

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: During containment in France because of COVID-19, the judicial authorities had to deal with the risk of contamination within immigration detention centers (IDC). In the Paris IDC, which can usually receive up to 240 individuals, measures have been taken to limit the risk of contamination by releasing individuals without prior judicial conviction and testing the others by a nasal swab. FINDINGS: The test was done for all the present individuals (48), except two who refused. Eight tests (17.4%) were positive and only one was symptomatic. Individuals testing positive for COVID-19 were transferred into COVID-centers specially created during this health crisis.

In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organizations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1565 positive samples (172 per 100â000 population) from 1376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6â% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. In total, 1035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a discrete sublineage associated with six care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients, indicating infection control measures were effective; and found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.","Page, Andrew J; Mather, Alison E; Le-Viet, Thanh; Meader, Emma J; Alikhan, Nabil-Fareed; Kay, Gemma L; de Oliveira Martins, Leonardo; Aydin, Alp; Baker, David J; Trotter, Alexander J; Rudder, Steven; Tedim, Ana P; Kolyva, Anastasia; Stanley, Rachael; Yasir, Muhammad; Diaz, Maria; Potter, Will; Stuart, Claire; Meadows, Lizzie; Bell, Andrew; Gutierrez, Ana Victoria; Thomson, Nicholas M; Adriaenssens, Evelien M; Swingler, Tracey; Gilroy, Rachel A J; Griffith, Luke; Sethi, Dheeraj K; Aggarwal, Dinesh; Brown, Colin S; Davidson, Rose K; Kingsley, Robert A; Bedford, Luke; Coupland, Lindsay J; Charles, Ian G; Elumogo, Ngozi; Wain, John; Prakash, Reenesh; Webber, Mark A; Smith, S J Louise; Chand, Meera; Dervisevic, Samir; O039,; Grady, Justin",Microb. genom,445,32

aims: The outbreak of COVID-19 is currently a major concern, and timely understanding of people's mental health status in the workplace has become an important issue Physical-psychological parameters such as mental workload and job stress are among the most important components in determining the job performance of employees in work environments This study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 epidemic on job stress and mental workload of employees in a chemical industry Methods: This longitudinal study was conducted in two stages (before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran) from December 2019 to May 2020 in a chemical industry in Bushehr province It should be noted that the first phase of this study was conducted before the outbreak of coronavirus in the form of a cross-sectional study However, after the outbreak of coronavirus and in order to investigate the changing trend in the parameters of mental workload and job stress among participants, this study was performed in two stages in the form of a longitudinal study The statistical population included all employees working in a chemical industry The sample size was calculated using Cochran's formula with an error level of 0 05 and included 182 workers who were selected by simple random sampling method The inclusion criterion was having at least one year of work experience and exclusion criteria were the presence of chronic mental illness, the use of sedatives, and insufficient willingness to participate in the study Participants were able to drop out of the study at any stage if they were unwilling Before starting the study and completing the questionnaires, all the necessary information about how to complete the questionnaires was explained to the staff and they expressed their willingness to take part in the study However, to prevent a decrease in the number of participants in the study, the number of employees who entered the study included 200 people (182 people + 10% of the total sample size (18 workers)) The NASA-TLX mental workload questionnaire and the HSE job stress questionnaire were used to evaluate mental workload and job stress, respectively The data collected during the present study were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistical software version 25 The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the normality of data distribution The findings of this statistical test showed that the distribution of data was normal in all cases (p &gt;0 05) Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency) were reported and statistical analysis was performed using paired sample t-test (to compare the mean of characteristics of the two psychological components of mental workload and job stress before and during the outbreak of coronavirus) as well as Chi-Square / Fisher's exact test All tests were performed at a significance level of 0 05 Results: The means of age and work experience of the subjects were 32 88±9 53 and 9 45±4 23 years, respectively The results of mental workload assessment based on the NASA-TLX index showed that the mean score of mental workload before and during the prevalence of coronavirus disease was 56 32± 9 58 and 66 45±11 82, respectively, and that there was a significant relationship between these values (p &lt;0 05) Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between the mean score of the dimensions of mental demand, overall performance, and frustration level before and during the outbreak of coronavirus It was also found that the average score of all aspects of mental workload, except for temporal demand and overall performance, increased during the outbreak of coronavirus The greatest increase was observed in the values of mental demand components and frustration level (Table 2) The results of the job stress assessment showed that the mean score of job stress before and during the outbreak of coronavirus disease was 80 78±18/29 and 68 88±12 74, respectively Moreover, it was found that the prevalence of coronavirus disease significantly increased the job stress level of employees (p 0 05) Ultimately, these findings showed a significant relationship between the values of mental workload and job stress in employees before and during the coronavirus disease (p&lt;0 05) Conclusion: An examination of people's mental workload based on the NASA-TLX index revealed that the prevalence of COVID-19 significantly increased the mental workload of the studied staff It was found that the mean values of the dimensions of mental demand and the frustration level were significantly increased at the time of the outbreak of COVID-19 The findings revealed that the prevalence of COVID-19 had increased the level of mental workload imposed on employees, as well as the level of frustration, insecurity, and stress of employees when performing their duties It was also found that the COVID-19 epidemic significantly reduced employee performance, making staff less satisfied with their overall performance in the workplace Previous studies have also shown that the spread of viral diseases can increase a person's workload, which is consistent with the results of the present study The study revealed that occupational stress levels increased during the outbreak of coronavirus Previous studies have shown that the spread of viral diseases such as Mers and COVID-19 increases the level of anxiety, stress, insomnia, and depression among people A study by Kim et al revealed that after the outbreak of viral diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV), a person's level of burnout and stress increased, which could severely affect a one’s job performance, which is in tandem with the results of the present study The present study was conducted for the first time to investigate the effect of coronavirus outbreak on physical-psychological components in the industrial sector in Iran Therefore, the results of the present study can provide a novel insight into the impact of coronavirus epidemic on the components of mental workload and job stress in different work environments The findings of the present study revealed that the prevalence of coronavirus disease has been able to affect different physical and psychological dimensions of personnel in the workplace Therefore, psychological intervention is essential to improve

The best strategy is to provide early intervention to stop the spread of the disease. In general, Computer Tomography (CT) is used to detect tumors in pneumonia, lungs, tuberculosis, emphysema, or other pleura (the membrane covering the lungs) diseases. Disadvantages of CT imaging system are: inferior soft tissue contrast compared to MRI as it is X-ray-based Radiation exposure. Lung CT image segmentation is a necessary initial step for lung image analysis. The main challenges of segmentation algorithms exaggerated due to intensity in-homogeneity, presence of artifacts, and closeness in the gray level of different soft tissue. The goal of this paper is to design and evaluate an automatic tool for automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection segmentation and measurement using chest CT images. The extensive computer simulations show better efficiency and flexibility of this end-to-end learning approach on CT image segmentation with image enhancement comparing to the state of the art segmentation approaches, namely GraphCut, Medical Image Segmentation (MIS), and Watershed. Experiments performed on COVID-CT-Dataset containing (275) CT scans that are positive for COVID-19 and new data acquired from the EL-BAYANE center for Radiology and Medical Imaging. The means of statistical measures obtained using the accuracy, sensitivity, F-measure, precision, MCC, Dice, Jacquard, and specificity are 0.98 , 0.73 , 0.71 , 0.73 , 0.71 , 0.71 , 0.57 , 0.99 respectively; which is better than methods mentioned above. The achieved results prove that the proposed approach is more robust, accurate, and straightforward.","Oulefki, Adel; Agaian, Sos; Trongtirakul, Thaweesak; Kassah Laouar, Azzeddine",Pattern Recognit,445,1

METHODS: Existing UK data from 222,933 knee and 209,760 hip arthroplasty patients were used to model an individual's probability of gaining meaningful improvement after surgery based on their preoperative Oxford Knee or Hip Score (OKS/OHS). A clinically meaningful improvement after arthroplasty was defined as &#8805; 8 point improvement in OHS, and &#8805; 7 in OKS. RESULTS: The upper preoperative score threshold, above which patients are unlikely to achieve any meaningful improvement from surgery, is 41 for knees and 40 for hips. At lower scores, the probability of improvement increased towards a maximum of 88% (knee) and 95% for (hips). CONCLUSION: By our definition of meaningful improvement, patients with preoperative scores above 41 (OKS) and 40 (OHS) should not be routinely referred to secondary care for possible arthroplasty. Using lower thresholds would incrementally increase the probability of meaningful benefit for those referred but will exclude some patients with potential to benefit. The findings are useful to support the complex shared decision-making process in primary care for referral to secondary care; and in secondary care for experienced clinicians counselling patients considering knee or hip arthroplasty, but should not be used in isolation.

Instead, the strategy has been largely based on strong recommendations for society. Even though Sweden has not had any form of lockdown, the Covid-19 pandemic has during a relatively short period of time brought changes for society, significantly disrupting everyday life. The pandemic poses both challenges and opportunities for sustainable future transport, not least public transport provision, supply and use. The purpose of this study is to investigate how changes for society have translated into changes for mobility as an element of everyday life during the early stages of a pandemic. This study draws on a map-based online survey (public participatory GIS) which was purposefully designed to allow people to contribute with their experiences in order to capture how the current situation has affected several different facets of people?s everyday life. Results suggest that effects on mobility, such as the possibility to telework, affect different groups differently and may exacerbate existing differences in terms of gender, geography and mobility. In order to mitigate negative effects, transport policy needs to be tailored in order to take these heterogeneities into account. Both spatio-temporal adjustment and modal adjustment were dominant themes for most activities, although the dominance of these themes varied among the activities. Our findings give an indication of both the short and long-term impacts on everyday mobility in the Swedish context, for groups of inhabitants in the city of Malmo?. Through deepening our understanding of the processes at play, we suggest eight possible policy responses that can be carefully tailored, both in the interim and into the future.","Bohman, H.; Ryan, J.; Stjernborg, V.; Nilsson, D.",Transport Policy,445,16

A patient-tailored program was developed to assess its efficacy regarding prevention of COVID-19 infection among patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery and healthcare workers (HCWs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 9th to April 9th 2020, 91 patients were selected for elective surgery by means of: i) Pre-hospital screening aimed at avoiding hospitalization of symptomatic or suspicious COVID-19 patients, and ii) prioritisation of surgical procedure according to specific disease features. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (93.4%) were fit for surgery, while five patients (5.5%) were temporarily excluded through 'telephone triage'; another two patients were excluded at in-hospital triage. A total of 71 out of 85 patients (83.5%) were diagnosed with invasive cancer, most of whom were undergoing breast-conserving surgery (61 out of 85 patients, 71.8%). The mean in-hospital stay was 2.2 days (SD=0.7 days). After hospital discharge, no patient needed re-admission due to post-operative complications; moreover, no COVID-19 infection among patients or HCWs was detected. CONCLUSION: Safe breast cancer surgery was accomplished for both patients and HCWs by means of a careful preoperative selection of patients and in-hospital preventative measures. This screening program can be transferred to high-volume Breast Units and it may be useful in implementing European Community recommendations for prevention of COVID-19 infection.","Fregatti, Piero; Gipponi, Marco; Giacchino, Maria; Sparavigna, Marco; Murelli, Federica; Toni, Maria Luisa; Calabrò, Maria Teresa; Orsino, Lina; Friedman, Daniele",In Vivo,445,16

In this study, we explored COVID-19 testing and the impact of the pandemic among participants from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV cohort, predominantly composed of low-income minorities living with and without HIV. METHODS: Between July and August 2020, a telephone survey was administered to 299 Miami Adult Studies on HIV participants to assess COVID-19 testing, prevention behaviors, and psychosocial stressors. Health care utilization, antiretroviral adherence, food insecurity, and substance use during the pandemic were compared with those of their last cohort visit (7.8 ± 2.9 months earlier). RESULTS: Half of surveyed participants had been tested for COVID-19, 8 had tested positive and 2 had been hospitalized. PLWH (n = 183) were 42% times less likely than HIV-uninfected participants to have been tested. However, after adjustment for age, employment, COVID-19 symptoms, mental health care, and substance use, the effect of HIV status was no longer significant. PLWH were more likely to have seen a health care provider, use face coverings, and avoid public transportation and less likely to be food insecure and drink hazardously. There were significant changes in substance use patterns during the pandemic when compared with those before. CONCLUSION: PLWH, compared with their HIV-uninfected peers, were more likely to engage in preventive measures and health care during the pandemic, potentially reducing their exposure to COVID-19. There were no reported changes in antiretroviral adherence or health care utilization, but there were changes in substance use; these need to be monitored as this crisis progresses.","Tamargo, Javier A; Martin, Haley R; Diaz-Martinez, Janet; Trepka, Mary Jo; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan; Johnson, Angelique; Mandler, Raul N; Siminski, Suzanne; Gorbach, Pamina M; Baum, Marianna K",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,445,16

Flipped classroom techniques, with multiple hands-on exercises, were developed for first-year medical students (MD/PhD [n = 9], Clinical and Translational Research Pathway (CTRP) students [n = 9]). Four focus groups (n = 13 students) and individual interviews with the two instructors were conducted in May 2020. From individual interviews with instructors and focus groups with medical students, the course and its components were favorably reviewed. Students thought the course was novel, important, relevant, and practical-and teaching strategies were effective (e.g., short lectures, interactive small group exercises, and projects). Most students expressed concerns about lack of time for course preparation. Sharper focus and streamlining of preparation work may be required. Pre- and post-student self-assessments of rigor and reproducibility competencies showed average post-scores ranging from high/moderate to strong understanding (n = 11).

Although biologic therapies are effectivefor synovitis, they can exacerbate the ILD. RA patients with significantILD but minimal synovitis have limited therapeutic options. Casereports and retrospective analyses suggest that Abatacept may haveefficacy in RA-ILD. However, use of potent immunosuppression inpatients with chronic lung disease may increase the incidence of lowerrespiratory tract infection (LRTI). The purpose of this prospective studywas to evaluate the safety of Abatacept in patients with progressiveRA-ILD.MethodsThis was a prospective, open-label, study of 19 RA patients (2010ACR/EULAR criteria) with ILD. Patients were included if either serialthoracic computed tomography (CT) or pulmonary function tests (PFT)indicated progressive ILD over the preceding 14 months. IntravenousAbatacept was administered at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks.PFTs, thoracic CT scan and questionnaires were performed atbaseline and week 20. The number of LRTI was recorded.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with admission and subsequent mortality among COVID-19-infected asthmatics. METHODS: Adults at our institution with a positive polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 between March 14 and April 27, 2020, were retrospectively identified. Comorbidities, laboratory results, and mortality rates during hospitalization were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 737 of 951 (77.5%) asthma patients with COVID-19 were seen in the emergency department (ED), and 78.8% of these ED patients (581 of 737) were admitted. Individuals with previously measured mean absolute eosinophil counts (AEC) &#8805;150 cells/µL were less likely to be admitted (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.98, P = .04), whereas concomitant heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were risk factors for admission. Hospitalized patients with asthma with peak hospital-measured AEC &#8805;150 cells/µL (n = 104) were less likely to die compared with those whose AEC remained <150 cells/µL (n = 213) (mortality rate 9.6% vs 25.8%; OR = 0.006, 95% CI: 0.0001-0.64, P = .03). This group had also higher preadmission mean AEC (237 ± 181 vs 163 ± 147 cells/µL, P = .001, OR = 2012, 95% CI: 27.3-14,816). The mortality rate in patients with asthma alone (no associated CHF, CKD, COPD, diabetes, or hypertension) was similar to that of patients without asthma or any of these comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatics, pre-existing eosinophilia (AEC &#8805;150 cells/µL) was protective from COVID-19-associated admission, and development of eosinophilia (AEC &#8805;150 cells/µL) during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality.

Favorable clinical outcomes are possible if timely management and drainage are performed unless ventricular failure develops. OBSERVATION: Cardiac tamponade in COVID-19, based on the limited reported cases, seems to be more common among middle-aged men with observed complications in black and ethnic minorities. Prognosis is worse amongst patients with concomitant ventricular failure. DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a case series of three COVID-19 patients complicated by cardiac tamponade, requiring surgical intervention at a single institution in New York. INTERVENTION: Pericardial window, Pericardiocentesis. OUTCOME: One patient had recurrence of cardiac tamponade with hemorrhagic component but fully recovered and was discharged home. Two patients developed cardiac tamponade with concomitant biventricular failure, resulting in death. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Cardiac tamponade with possible concomitant biventricular failure can develop in COVID-19 patients; incidence seems to be highest at the point of marked inflammatory response. Concomitant ventricular failure seems to be a predictor of poor prognosis.","Hakmi, Hazim; Sohail, Amir; Brathwaite, Collin; Ray, Beevash; Abrol, Sunil",J. card. surg,445,4

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: QResearch database, comprising 1205 general practices in England with linkage to covid-19 test results, Hospital Episode Statistics, and death registry data. 6.08 million adults aged 19-100 years were included in the derivation dataset and 2.17 million in the validation dataset. The derivation and first validation cohort period was 24 January 2020 to 30 April 2020. The second temporal validation cohort covered the period 1 May 2020 to 30 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to death from covid-19, defined as death due to confirmed or suspected covid-19 as per the death certification or death occurring in a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the period 24 January to 30 April 2020. The secondary outcome was time to hospital admission with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance, including measures of discrimination and calibration, was evaluated in each validation time period. RESULTS: 4384 deaths from covid-19 occurred in the derivation cohort during follow-up and 1722 in the first validation cohort period and 621 in the second validation cohort period. The final risk algorithms included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, and a range of comorbidities. The algorithm had good calibration in the first validation cohort. For deaths from covid-19 in men, it explained 73.1% (95% confidence interval 71.9% to 74.3%) of the variation in time to death (R2); the D statistic was 3.37 (95% confidence interval 3.27 to 3.47), and Harrell's C was 0.928 (0.919 to 0.938). Similar results were obtained for women, for both outcomes, and in both time periods. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths within 97 days was 75.7%. People in the top 20% of predicted risk of death accounted for 94% of all deaths from covid-19. CONCLUSION: The QCOVID population based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for deaths and hospital admissions due to covid-19. The absolute risks presented, however, will change over time in line with the prevailing SARS-C0V-2 infection rate and the extent of social distancing measures in place, so they should be interpreted with caution. The model can be recalibrated for different time periods, however, and has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves.","Clift, Ash K; Coupland, Carol A C; Keogh, Ruth H; Diaz-Ordaz, Karla; Williamson, Elizabeth; Harrison, Ewen M; Hayward, Andrew; Hemingway, Harry; Horby, Peter; Mehta, Nisha; Benger, Jonathan; Khunti, Kamlesh; Spiegelhalter, David; Sheikh, Aziz; Valabhji, Jonathan; Lyons, Ronan A; Robson, John; Semple, Malcolm G; Kee, Frank; Johnson, Peter; Jebb, Susan; Williams, Tony; Hippisley-Cox, Julia",BMJ,445,24

Older adults, especially those with high needs, experience social isolation and have high rates of emergency visits and limited satisfaction with the care they receive. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies present opportunities to address these challenges. To date, limited information is available on Canadian older adults' attitudes toward and use of mHealth technologies for self-tracking purposes-an area that is increasingly important and relevant during the COVID-19 era. OBJECTIVE: This study presents contributions to an underresearched area on older adults and mHealth technology use. The aim of this study was to compare older adults' use of mHealth technologies to that of the general adult population in Canada and to investigate the factors that affect their use. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey on mHealth and digital self-tracking was conducted. A web-based questionnaire was administered to a national sample of 4109 Canadian residents who spoke either English or French. The survey instrument consisted of 3 sections assessing the following items: (1) demographic characteristics, health status, and comorbidities; (2) familiarity with and use of mHealth technologies (ie, mobile apps, consumer smart devices/wearables such as vital signs monitors, bathroom scales, fitness trackers, intelligent clothing); and (3) factors influencing the continued use of mHealth technologies. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population in the use of smart technologies and internet (P<.001). Approximately 47.4% (323/682) of the older adults in the community reported using smartphones and 49.8% (340/682) indicated using digital tablets. Only 19.6% (91/463) of the older adults using smartphones/digital tablets reported downloading mobile apps, and 12.3% (47/383) of the older adults who heard of smart devices/wearables indicated using them. The majority of the mobile apps downloaded by older adults was health-related; interestingly, their use was sustained over a longer period of time (P=.007) by the older adults compared to that by the general population. Approximately 62.7% (428/682) of the older adults reported tracking their health measures, but the majority did so manually. Older adults with one or more chronic conditions were mostly nontrackers (odds ratio 0.439 and 0.431 for traditional trackers and digital trackers, respectively). No significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population with regard to satisfaction with mHealth technologies and their intention to continue using them. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging mHealth technologies in partnership with health care providers and sharing of health/well-being data with health care professionals and family members remain very limited. A culture shift in the provision of care to older adults is deemed necessary to keep up with the development of mHealth technologies and the changing demographics and expectations of patients and their caregivers.","Jaana, Mirou; Paré, Guy",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,445,16

In this analysis, we aimed to review the current evidence in order to clarify the complex correlation between infections and lung cancer. In detail, we mainly explored the potential impact on immunotherapy outcome/safety of (1) bacterial infections, with a detailed focus on antibiotics; and (2) viral infections, discriminating among (a) human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), (b) hepatitis B/C virus (HBV-HCV), and (c) Sars-Cov-2. A series of studies suggested the prognostic impact of antibiotic therapy administration, timing, and exposure ratio in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, probably through an antibiotic-related microbiota dysbiosis. Although cancer patients with HIV, HBV, and HCV were usually excluded from clinical trials evaluating immunotherapy, some retrospective and prospective trials performed in these patient subgroups reported similar results compared to those described in not-infected patients, with a favorable safety profile. Moreover, patients with thoracic cancers are particularly at risk of COVID-19 severe outcomes and mortality. Few reports speculated about the prognostic implications of anticancer therapy, including immunotherapy, in lung cancer patients with concomitant Sars-Cov-2 infection, showing, to date, inconsistent results. The correlation between infectious diseases and immunotherapy remains to be further explored and clarified in the context of dedicated trials. In clinical practice, the accurate and prompt multidisciplinary management of lung cancer patients with infections should be encouraged in order to select the best treatment options for these patients, avoiding unexpected toxicities, while maintaining the anticancer effect.","Belluomini, Lorenzo; Caldart, Alberto; Avancini, Alice; Dodi, Alessandra; Trestini, Ilaria; Kadrija, Dzenete; Sposito, Marco; Tregnago, Daniela; Casali, Miriam; Riva, Silvia Teresa; Sartori, Giulia; Menis, Jessica; Milella, Michele; Pilotto, Sara",Int. j. mol. sci.

Consequently, early detection and analysis of the infection patterns are crucial for controlling infection spread as well as devising a treatment plan. This work proposes a two-stage deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based framework for delineation of COVID-19 infected regions in Lung CT images. In the first stage, initially, COVID-19 specific CT image features are enhanced using a two-level discrete wavelet transformation. These enhanced CT images are then classified using the proposed custom-made deep CoV-CTNet. In the second stage, the CT images classified as infectious images are provided to the segmentation models for the identification and analysis of COVID-19 infectious regions. In this regard, we propose a novel semantic segmentation model CoV-RASeg, which systematically uses average and max pooling operations in the encoder and decoder blocks. This systematic utilization of max and average pooling operations helps the proposed CoV-RASeg in simultaneously learning both the boundaries and region homogeneity. Moreover, the idea of attention is incorporated to deal with mildly infected regions. The proposed two-stage framework is evaluated on a standard Lung CT image dataset, and its performance is compared with the existing deep CNN models.

This virus has a high infectivity rate and has impacted a significant chunk of the population worldwide. The spectrum of disease ranges from mild to severe with respiratory system being the most commonly affected. Cardiovascular system often gets involved in later stages of the disease with acute cardiac injury, heart failure and arrhythmias being the common complications. In addition, the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease in these patients are often associated with poor prognosis. It is still not clear regarding the exact mechanism explaining cardiovascular system involvement in COVID-19. Multiple theories have been put forward however, more robust studies are required to fully elucidate the ""heart and virus"" link. The disease has already made its presence felt on the global stage and its impact in the developing countries is going to be profound. These nations not only have a poorly developed healthcare system but there is also a huge burden of cardiovascular diseases. As a result, COVID-19 would adversely impact the already overburdened healthcare network leading to impaired cardiovascular care delivery especially for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure patients.","Kunal, Shekhar; Gupta, Kashish; Sharma, Shashi Mohan; Pathak, Vijay; Mittal, Shruti; Tarke, Chandrakant",Monaldi arch. chest dis,445,17

Especially, only a few studies used validated olfactory tests for this. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate how many patients with olfactory function impairment, which was detected in a validated olfactory test 3 months after COVID-19 disease, showed improvement in olfactory function after 6 months. METHODS: About 26 patients with a PCR-confirmed, former COVID-19 disease, with an impaired olfactory function after three months, were included in the study. The olfactory function was evaluated with the sniffing sticks test, the taste function with taste sprays. RESULTS: Smelling function improved in all but one patient (96%). All measured subitems, i.e. olfactory threshold, identification and discrimination of odours significantly improved. In the whole mouth taste test all patients showed normal taste function. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: 6 months after COVID-19 disease, olfactory function improves in just about all patients. Long-term measurements must investigate whether complete regeneration of the olfactory function will occur in all patients.","Otte, Martin Sylvester; Bork, Marie-Luise; Zimmermann, Philipp Heinrich; Klussmann, Jens Peter; Luers, Jan Christoffer",Acta Otolaryngol,445,16

In our opinion, one of the main reasons for this is the raise hand function of the respective web conference systems, which (independent of the system used) results in an unobtrusive signal that can easily be missed by the lecturer. Given the necessary focus on one's own presentation, questions can therefore only be perceived with a considerable time delay and can only be integrated into the lessons to a limited extent. Thus, the idea arose to display question requests of the auditorium by a clear visual signal in PowerPoint® itself. Methodology: With Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Microsoft PowerPoint® holds an integrated programming language that extends its functionality. Accordingly, VBA was used to program a routine running in the background of the presentation, which periodically retrieves the contents of a web-based ""signal file"" in a cycle of a few seconds. The content of this signal file, in turn, can be modified by the students by calling up an URL (i.e. from any Internet-capable device) - this results in a (customizable) visual signal in PowerPoint® that is temporarily visible and does not further interfere with the presentation. Conclusion: With the concept presented here, a raise hand function was realized in PowerPoint®, which manifests itself as a clear visual signal independent of the web conferencing system used. This enables the lecturers to respond instantly to questions from the audience during live transmission of lectures.","Volf, Ivo",GMS J Med Educ,445,24

It is purported that socioeconomic factors may drive this association, but data supporting this assertion are sparse. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether socioeconomic factors mediate the association of race/ethnicity with COVID-19 incidence and outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults tested for (cohort 1) or hospitalized with (cohort 2) COVID-19 between March 1 - July 23, 2020 at the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics. Our primary exposure was race/ethnicity. We considered socioeconomic factors as potential mediators of our exposure's association with outcomes. We used standard statistics to describe our cohorts and multivariable regression modeling to identify associations of race/ethnicity with our primary outcomes, one for each cohort, of test positivity (cohort 1) and hospital mortality (cohort 2). We performed a mediation analysis to see if household income, population density, and household size mediated the association of race/ethnicity with outcomes. RESULTS: Our cohorts included 15,473 patients tested (29.0% non-Hispanic White, 48.1% Hispanic White, 15.0% non-Hispanic Black, 1.7% Hispanic Black, 1.6% Other) and 295 patients hospitalized (9.2% non-Hispanic White, 56.9% Hispanic White, 21.4% non-Hispanic Black, 2.4% Hispanic Black, 10.2% Other). Among those tested, 1,256 patients (8.1%) tested positive and, of the hospitalized patients, 47 (15.9%) died. After adjustment for demographics, race/ethnicity was associated with test positivity-odds-ratio (95% CI) vs. non-Hispanic White for Non-Hispanic Black: 3.21 (2.60-3.96), Hispanic White: 2.72 (2.28-3.26), and Hispanic Black: 3.55 (2.33-5.28). Population density mediated this association (percent mediated (95% CI): 17% (11%-31%)), as did median income (27% (18%-52%)), and household size (20% (12%-45%)). There was no association between race/ethnicity and mortality although this analysis was underpowered. CONCLUSIONS: Black race and Hispanic ethnicity are associated with an increased odds of COVID-19 positivity. This association is substantially mediated by socioeconomic factors.","Gershengorn, Hayley B; Patel, Samira; Shukla, Bhavarth; Warde, Prem R; Bhatia, Monisha; Parekh, Dipen; Ferreira, Tanira",Ann.

In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS: The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil Santamaría, María; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Redondo Rodríguez, Iratxe; Jaureguizar Alboniga-Mayor, Joana; Picaza Gorrotxategi, Maitane","Rev. psiquiatr. salud ment.

The discriminative ability was evaluated by comparing participants scores on the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L with general population scores. Furthermore, the discriminative ability between subgroups of participants with different disease severity levels was estimated. Correlations between the EQ-5D index and clinical parameters were used to measure construct validity. Test-retest reliability was measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between baseline, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up scores of participants with stable symptoms. Finally, the responsiveness of the EQ-5D was calculated by mean differences, effect sizes and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for participants with improved symptoms. Participants reported significantly more problems on the dimensions ""mobility"", ""usual activities"", ""pain/discomfort"" and ""anxiety/depression"" than the general population. The EQ-5D-5L was able to discriminate between different disease severity levels. The EQ-5D index and clinical scales were significantly correlated with absolute values of correlation coefficients varying between 0.21 and 0.59. Furthermore, ICCs between 0.65 and 0.91 indicated good test-retest reliability for the EQ-5D index. The ICCs for the EQ-VAS between baseline and 3-month follow-up, and posttreatment and 3-month follow-up were statistically significant with 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, whereas the ICC between baseline and posttreatment was 0.08 and not statistically significant. Effect sizes to measure the responsiveness ranged between -0.008 and 0.40 for the EQ-5D index and - 0.32 and 0.40 for the EQ-VAS. Furthermore, the area under the curve in ROC analyses was between 0.40 and 0.64 for the EQ-5D index and 0.60 and 0.70 for the EQ-VAS. Discriminative ability, test-retest reliability and construct validity of the EQ-5D-5L were good, whereas the responsiveness was rather weak. Nevertheless, the EQ-5D-5L can be used to measure HrQoL in adolescents and young adults with PTSD.

France has implemented a strategy to fight this virus which relies essentially on widespread RT-PCR virological testing in order to isolate positive patients. Antigenic tests have recently been made available to help the diagnostics. We have conducted a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of these antigenic tests, comparing them to the reference RT-PCR method. METHOD: Between December 7, 2020 and January 31, 2021, each patient we received in our laboratories for an RT-PCR test was enrolled. Out of 271,649 patients, 4,881 had been submitted to an antigenic test (TDR) in the preceding 24 hours. Comparing the data resulting from both tests, we established the sensitivity and the specificity of the antigenic tests. For our analysis we included the parameter of symptom and/or the value of Cycles threshold (Ct) in our parameters. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the TDRs compared to all the positive RT-PCR tests is 56%. We further demonstrate the correlation between the symptom duration and the reduction of the nasopharyngeal viral load. Based on this data, we have established that the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases very rapidly after symptom onset, contrary to the estimated viral load in the RT-PCR. Indeed, less the 24 hours after clinical symptom onset, the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases from 74% to 60%. By including the Ct value in our parameters, we have established that, despite a high viral load and clinical symptoms since 7 days or less, the sensitivity of the TDRs is 66%. Although, a high number of asymptomatic patients among carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we have estimated a specificity of 93% for our test. CONCLUSIONS: Performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the TDR, as assessed in practice, are inferior to those given by the manufacturer, which raises several questions. What is the impact of falsely negative results for patients carrying a high viral load? Are the implemented measures sufficient to prevent the epidemic?","Bernard, Mathieu; Cosentino, Gina; Pieri, Laura; Zachary, Pierre; Buser, Michael; Kbaier, Laurent; Giannoli, Jean-Marc",Ann Biol Clin (Paris),445,15

This is possibly because many interventions for child mental health lie outside the realm of narrowly defined biomedical interventions and platforms, with the majority of interventions targeting psychological and social mechanisms and a strong emphasis on prevention. This situation must change, however, as child mental health interventions have potentially the greatest impact on the burden of mental disorders, and other health and social outcomes, than at any other time in the life course. There is now a growing body of evidence that indicates which interventions are ready for scale-up or show sufficient promise for further research and refinement. These are primarily delivered in community or school platforms through nonspecialist workers in partnership with parents and teachers. They include interventions to promote early child development, parenting interventions through childhood into adolescence, school interventions aimed at reengineering school environments and strengthening life skills, and interventions for the early detection and management of neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems through trans-diagnostic interventions based on impairments. Above all, what is needed is a population-based approach, which emphasizes the goal of coverage of evidence-based interventions for all children; with a particular focus on disadvantaged children; with seamless coordination of preventive and treatment interventions across platforms of care; and utilizing collaborative, stepped-care delivery paradigms.","Patel, Vikram; Rahman, Atif",Child Adolesc Ment Health,445,20

As a possible cause, our aim was to investigate which parameters increase the sensitivity or protection against COVID-19 between RT-PCR positive and RT-PCR negative cases in patients admitted to the emergency department. METHODS: In the pandemic process, patients admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were evaluated retrospectively. RT-PCR test was divided into + (for Group 1) and - (Group 2). The gender, age, clinical information, application symptoms, and comorbidity data of the patients were evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven cases were evaluated in the study. Group 1: 88 cases, M/F ratio: 46/42 and average age 48 ± 17.3 years, Group 2: 79 cases, M/F ratio was approximately 3/2, and the average age was 48.3 ± 19.4 years. When the groups were compared in terms of symptoms, fever, cough, weakness, and headache were prominent in Group 1, whereas the contact was significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Among the comorbid diseases, only COPD showed a significant difference between the groups, and it was found significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cough, headache, and fever were found valuable in the detection of cases. Attention should be paid to contact isolation to circumvent the pandemic process with less damage. Having chronic diseases, especially COPD, increases the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Close monitoring and control of chronic diseases can positively change the course of COVID-19.","Akpinar, Guleser; Demir, Mehmet C; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Sonmez, Feruza T; Karaman, Kivanc; Keskin, Banu H; Ince, Nevin; Guclu, Derya",Clin. lab,445,16

Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of ""service-oriented"" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or ""kin-centred care"" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what ""person-centredness"" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.","Lachman, P.; Batalden, P.; Vanhaecht, K.",,445,16

A major problem in its cure is its early screening and detection, which will decide on its treatment. Due to the fast contactless spreading of the virus, its screening is unusually difficult. Moreover, the results of COVID-19 tests may take up to 48 h. That is enough time for the virus to worsen the health of the affected person. The health community needs effective means for identification of the virus in the shortest possible time. In this study, we invent a medical device utilized consisting of composable sensors to monitor remotely and in real-time the health status of those who have symptoms of the coronavirus or those infected with it. The device comprises wearable medical sensors integrated using the Arduino hardware interfacing and a smartphone application. An IoT framework is deployed at the backend through which various devices can communicate in real-time. The medical device is applied to determine the patient's critical status of the effects of the coronavirus or its symptoms using heartbeat, cough, temperature and Oxygen concentration (SpO2) that are evaluated using our custom algorithm. Until now, it has been found that many coronavirus patients remain asymptomatic, but in case of known symptoms, a person can be quickly identified with our device. It also allows doctors to examine their patients without the need for physical direct contact with them to reduce the possibility of infection. Our solution uses rule-based decision-making based on the physiological data of a person obtained through sensors. These rules allow to classify a person as healthy or having a possibility of infection by the coronavirus. The advantage of using rules for patient's classification is that the rules can be updated as new findings emerge from time to time.

Nurses working part time (p = 0.02), with lower perceived physical health (p = 0.01), a lower self-care self-regulation score (p < 0.001), and higher work stress (p < 0.05) showed poorer sleep quality. Factors associated with subcomponents of sleep quality varied. Poor sleep quality among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported. Various factors, including work environmental factors were associated with the sleep quality in this sample. Hospital administrators should consider developing intervention programs for improving the work environment, which would impact sleep quality, health status, and job performance.","Kim-Godwin, Yeoun Soo; Lee, Meen Hye; Logan, Jeongok G; Liu, Xiaoyue",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),445,24

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to look at this relationship using individual-level data. We find that for Mexico City there is evidence of a positive relationship between pollution and mortality that significantly grows with age and that appears to be mostly driven by long- rather than short-term exposure. By using a rich set of individual- and municipal-level covariates we are able to isolate the effect of exposure to pollution from other crucial factors, thus alleviating endogeneity concerns related to selection. Our results provide yet another reason for the need to implement environmental strategies that will reduce the exposure to air pollution: it is a key element to improve the general population's health. In addition, and considering that at this moment we do not know when the pandemic will stop or if SARS-CoV-2 will become a recurrent threat, the relationship that we uncovered suggests that financial resources should be allocated to improve medical services in those areas where PM2.5 concentrations tend to be high.","López-Feldman, Alejandro; Heres, David; Marquez-Padilla, Fernanda",Sci Total Environ,445,13

Coupled ECG-electromagnetic (EM) guidance shows promise for use in placement of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) when compared with the classic blind technique. However, ECG-EM guidance has not been appropriately compared with the reference standard of fluoroscopy (FX) guidance. Here, we aimed to compare ECG-EM guidance with FX guidance with regard to the final tip position of PICCs. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. A total of 120 patients (age range, 19-94 years) referred for PICC placement were randomized to the ECG-EM or FX group. All interventions were performed by PICC team members who had the same standardized training and experience. Final tip position was assessed using chest radiography and was classified as optimal, suboptimal, or inadequate requiring repositioning on the basis of the distance from the PICC tip to the cavoatrial junction (CAJ). Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for final catheter tip position (mean distance from CAJ) and Fisher and chi-square tests for proportions. RESULTS. PICCs were successfully inserted in 118 patients (53 men and 65 women). Catheter tip positions were optimal or suboptimal in 100% of the FX group and 77.2% of the ECG-EM group. Furthermore, precision of placement was significantly better (p = .004) in the FX group (mean distance from the PICC tip to the CAJ = 0.83 cm) than in the ECGEM group (mean distance from the PICC tip to the CAJ = 1.37 cm). Thirteen (22.8%) of the PICCs placed using ECG-EM guidance, all of which were inserted from the left side, were qualified as inadequate requiring repositioning and required another intervention. CONCLUSION. Our results revealed significant differences in final tip position between the ECG-EM and FX guidance techniques and indicate that ECG-EM guidance cannot appropriately replace FX guidance among unselected patients. However, ECGEM guidance could be considered as an acceptable technique for patients in whom the PICC could be inserted from the right side. TRIAL REGISTRATION.

MethodsIn a multicenter case-control analysis of US adults hospitalized March 11 - May 5, 2021, we evaluated vaccine effectiveness to prevent Covid-19 hospitalizations by comparing odds of prior vaccination with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) between cases hospitalized with Covid-19 and hospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. ResultsAmong 1210 participants, median age was 58 years, 22.8% were Black, 13.8% were Hispanic, and 20.6% had immunosuppression. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was most common variant (59.7% of sequenced viruses). Full vaccination (receipt of two vaccine doses [≥]14 days before illness onset) had been received by 45/590 (7.6%) cases and 215/620 (34.7%) controls. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 86.9% (95% CI: 80.4 to 91.2%). Vaccine effectiveness was similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and highest in adults aged 18-49 years (97.3%; 95% CI: 78.9 to 99.7%). Among 45 patients with vaccine-breakthrough Covid hospitalizations, 44 (97.8%) were [≥]50 years old and 20 (44.4%) had immunosuppression. Vaccine effectiveness was lower among patients with immunosuppression (59.2%; 95% CI: 11.9 to 81.1%) than without immunosuppression (91.3%; 95% CI: 85.5 to 94.7%). ConclusionDuring March-May 2021, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were highly effective for preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations among US adults.

Early reports indicate possible neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, highly variable prevalence rates, and uncertainty regarding causal or coincidental occurrence of symptoms. As neurological involvement of any systemic disease is frequently associated with adverse effects on morbidity and mortality, obtaining accurate and consistent global data on the extent to which COVID-19 may impact the nervous system is urgently needed. To address this need, investigators from the Neurocritical Care Society launched the Global Consortium Study of Neurological Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID). The GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium rapidly implemented a Tier 1, pragmatic study to establish phenotypes and prevalence of neurological manifestations of COVID-19. A key component of this global collaboration is development and application of common data elements (CDEs) and definitions to facilitate rigorous and systematic data collection across resource settings. Integration of these elements is critical to reduce heterogeneity of data and allow for future high-quality meta-analyses. The GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium specifically designed these elements to be feasible for clinician investigators during a global pandemic when healthcare systems are likely overwhelmed and resources for research may be limited. Elements include pediatric components and translated versions to facilitate collaboration and data capture in Latin America, one of the epicenters of this global outbreak. In this manuscript, we share the specific data elements, definitions, and rationale for the adult and pediatric CDEs for Tier 1 of the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium, as well as the translated versions adapted for use in Latin America. Global efforts are underway to further harmonize CDEs with other large consortia studying neurological and general aspects of COVID-19 infections. Ultimately, the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium network provides a critical infrastructure to systematically capture data in current and future unanticipated disasters and disease outbreaks.","McNett, Molly; Fink, Ericka L; Schober, Michelle; Mainali, Shraddha; Helbok, Raimund; Robertson, Courtney L; Mejia-Mantilla, Jorge; Kurtz, Pedro; Righy, Cássia; Roa, Juan D; Villamizar-Rosales, Carlos; Altamirano, Valeria; Frontera, Jennifer A; Maldonado, Nelson; Menon, David; Suarez, Jose; Chou, Sherry H Y",Neurocritical care,445,1

Resveratrol appeared to activate NK cells most effectively among the substances tested and synergistically increased IFN-Î³ secretion and NK cell cytotoxicity with interleukin-2 (IL-2). CD107a, NKp30, and NKG2D expression levels were upregulated on the surface of NK cells upon treatment with resveratrol in combination with IL-2 compared with treatment with IL-2 alone. Moreover, NK cell activity in human and mouse whole blood was enhanced upon treatment with resveratrol. Most importantly, administration of resveratrol effectively inhibited tumour growth and metastasis in mice. In conclusion, we suggest that resveratrol may represent a candidate anti-cancer drug that acts by activating NK cells in vivo.","Lee, Yoojin; Shin, Heewook; Kim, Jongsun",J Innate Immun,445,16

These sectors are becoming increasingly interlinked in environmental policy-making and with regard to achieving supply security. There is a pressing need for a systematization of impacts and responses beyond individual disruptions. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the implications of COVID-19 on the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. First, it integrates the academic literature related to single cases and disruptions to provide a broader view of COVID-19 demand- and supply-side disruptions and immediate effects. Then, the major, long-term impact categories of medicalization/hygienization, (re)localization of production, and demand fluctuations are highlighted. These impacts result in priority cross-links such as irrigation, energy requirements for local food production, energy use for water and wastewater treatment, or water for energy use. Finally, sector-level insights on impacts and responses are provided, drawing from illustrative cases. The analysis of impacts of COVID-19 on the WEF nexus reflects heterogeneous experiences of short-term adaptations, and highlights the revaluation of the water-food-trade nexus. Revived debates on food sufficiency can benefit from green applications to minimize expected trade-offs. The current crisis also reveals some gaps in the WEF nexus debates with regard to the lack of risk-based perspectives and the need for a better consideration of spatial aspects in resource integration. Regarding resource-security issues in the WEF nexus, the COVID-19 stress test boosts debates concerning the adequacy of the production value chains (e.g., contingency and storage, diversification, and self-sufficiency) and the value of cross-border integration (e.g., trade, globalization, and aid).","Al-Saidi, Mohammad; Hussein, Hussam",Sci Total Environ,445,26

Results show that the predominant interaction is that in which viewers pose questions to speakers. Our analyses also revealed that attendees hardly reached the highest levels of knowledge construction through unguided interaction. Often, user interactions went beyond emotional expressions towards evaluation and therefore, could reach a higher level of knowledge construction.

Interactive music provides one of the most effective psychosocial interventions for people with dementia;it can allay agitation and promote wellbeing. Since COVID-19 has halted the delivery of in-person musical activities, it is important for the welfare of people with dementia and their carers to investigate what alternatives to live music making exist, how these alternatives are delivered and how their accessibility can be expanded. This community case study examines recent practice in online music-making in response to COVID-19 restrictions for people with dementia and their supporters, focusing on a UK context. It documents current opportunities for digital music making, and assesses the barriers and facilitators to their delivery and accessibility. Online searches of video streaming sites and social media documented what music activities were available. Expert practitioners and providers collaborated on this study and supplied input about the sessions they had been delivering, the technological challenges and solutions they had found, and the responses of the participants. Recommendations for best practice were developed and refined in consultation with these collaborators. Over 50 examples of online music activities were identified. In addition to the challenges of digital inclusion and accessibility for some older people, delivering live music online has unique challenges due to audio latency and sound quality. It is necessary to adapt the session to the technology's limitations rather than expect to overcome these challenges. The recommendations highlight the importance of accessibility, digital safety and wellbeing of participants. They also suggest ways to optimize the quality of their musical experience.

While its origin remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market with the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. METHODS: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidence, stratified according to contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for market-to-human and human-to-human transmission, the reporting probability, and the early effects of public health interventions. RESULTS: We estimated R at 0.24 (95% CrI: 0.01-1.38) for market-to-human transmission and 2.37 (95% CrI: 2.08-2.71) for human-to-human transmission during the early spread in China (2019-2020). Moreover, we estimated that the reporting rate for cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 2-34 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our R estimate tied to market-to-human transmission had substantial uncertainty, but it was significantly lower compared with the reproduction number driving human-to-human transmission. Our results also suggest that asymptomatic and subclinical infections constitute a substantial component of the COVID-19 morbidity burden.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Kagaya, Katsushi; Chowell, Gerardo",Int J Infect Dis,445,21

Black babies are commonly born underweight, and in some states, infants born to African American mothers die at twice the rate as infants born to non-Hispanic white mother regardless of education level and socioeconomic status.19 It takes a birthing parent between six and eight weeks to recover from childbirth, and in some instances, up to two years post-birth if there are complications that require extended physical and emotional recovery.20 Without critical attention to how essential Black workers and parents are affected by this ongoing crisis of care, the vulnerable will continue to face higher rates of death, especially during this pandemic. Grassroots activists have documented how neighborhoods without well-funded community healthcare centers, birthing centers, and medical professionals and supplies simultaneously face culturally incompetent medical professionals in hospitals, which are most often located outside their communities.23 Many recent studies have found that health disparities and provider attitudes are deeply connected.24 Furthermore, scholars have found that healthcare professionals consider Black Americans to be less cooperative, less compliant, and less responsible in medical spaces.25 Since COVID-19, medical professionals have experienced increased pressure to address the demand for testing, prevention, and education on respiratory conditions as well as to provide care under stressful circumstances and rising numbers of cases.","Destine, Shaneda Brooks Jazzmine Rogers Christopher",Feminist Studies,445,16

Previous studies have found few patients with asthma among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia cases. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe asthma exacerbation is not known. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of asthma exacerbation in patients with asthma hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compare symptoms and laboratory and radiological findings in patients with and without asthma with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: We included 106 patients between March 4 and April 6, 2020, who were hospitalized in the Chest Diseases Department of Strasbourg University Hospital; 23 had asthma. To assess the patients' asthma status, 3 periods were defined: the last month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (p1), prehospitalization (p2), and during hospitalization (p3). Severe asthma exacerbations were defined according to Global INitiative for Asthma guidelines during p1 and p2. During p3, we defined severe asthma deterioration as the onset of breathlessness and wheezing requiring systemic corticosteroids and inhaled ß2 agonist. RESULTS: We found no significant difference between patients with and without asthma in terms of severity (length of stay, maximal oxygen flow needed, noninvasive ventilation requirement, and intensive care unit transfer); 52.2% of the patients with asthma had Global INitiative for Asthma step 1 asthma. One patient had a severe exacerbation during p1, 2 patients during p2, and 5 patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled ß2 agonist during p3. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that patients with asthma appeared not to be at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Different degrees of liver injury or liver dysfunctions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, currently, it remains unclear to what extent liver diseases should be considered as significant risk factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Moreover, the mechanisms involved in liver injury in severe COVID-19 infection are not yet well understood. AREA COVERED: This review summarizes the current evidence on liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and the effects of preexisting liver disease on the disease severity. This review also illustrates the possible underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver injury, as well as provides recommendations to prevent liver damage in COVID-19 infection. EXPERT OPINION: The elevated levels of ALT, AST, GGT and bilirubin are common in more severe patients than non-severe or mild COVID-19 patients. Patients with preexisting medical conditions including chronic hepatic diseases are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 infection. The drug's effects, possible viral inclusion in liver cells, systemic inflammation and hypoxia are potential causes of liver injury in severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, further studies are needed focusing on the preexisting hepatic diseases on prevention, treatment and outcome of COVID-19.","Ali, Nurshad; Hossain, Khaled",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,445,16

It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling MPS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AMPK-PGC-1&#945;-SIRT3 axis is associated with depression of mitochondrial function in the rat MPS model. Methods: A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group and experimental group. The expression level of mRNA and protein of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) was analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR. The histopathological findings were investigated through electron microscopes in GM of all groups. Results: Our results showed that MPS induces continuous depression of mitochondrial biogenesis and function via down-regulation of PGC-1&#945;-SIRT3 axis accompanying with ATP fuel crisis as compared to control group. However, the expression level of SIRT3 mRNA did not change. Additionally, a correlated reduction of the mRNA and protein expression level of NRF-1 and TFAM, known as the downstream target of PGC-1&#945;, suggesting further transcription of nuclear genes encoding mitochondria functional proteins for promoting mitochondria proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation and energy production is continuously depressed. Furthermore, phosphorylation extent of AMPK is also declined following MPS, and it is negatively correlated with reduction of ATP generation, suggesting that the complex network involves different inhibition in transcription, post-translational modification and a plethora of other effectors that mediate the inhibition roles. Conclusion: We here suggested that the down-regulation in AMPK-PGC-1&#945;-SIRT3 axis network may be the basis for the association between mitochondrial dysfunction and MPS, where a vicious circle further aggravates the disease symptoms with ongoing ATP energy crisis.","Ye, Le; Li, Mingli; Wang, Zhankui; Yang, Zhongwei; Zhang, Jinyuan; Fang, Hongwei; He, Zhenzhou; Wang, Xiangrui",J Pain Res,445,16

In order to investigate the relationship between tactile preference and innate sociability, mice were subjected to the classic three-chambered test of social approach, where mice displayed significant preference towards the experimenter's hand. These findings suggest that gentle stroking evoked by an experimenter can play an important role in reward and preference and establish an affiliative relationship between mice and humans.

In this paper, an open-source approach is presented where we have collected tweets from the Twitter API and then reprocessing, analyzing and, visualizing these tweets using python. Furthermore, Twitter data streaming will be processed and cleaned to parse data that can be classified based on opinion with a text mining algorithm using text blob Python. Feature extraction is done for the relationship between words by the Bigram and N-gram methods.","Fauziyyah, Anni Karimatul",Jurnal Ilmiah Sinus,445,20

This study aimed to identify the knowledge needs of the global OR workforce, and characterize supportive evidence to establish consensus. METHODS: A rapid, modified Delphi exercise was performed, open to all stakeholders, informed via an online international collaborative evaluation. RESULTS: The consensus exercise was completed by 339 individuals from 41 countries (64·3 per cent UK). Consensus was reached on 71 of 100 statements, predominantly standardization of OR pathways, OR staffing and preoperative screening or diagnosis. The highest levels of consensus were observed in statements relating to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and risk distribution (96-99 per cent), clear consent processes (96 per cent), multidisciplinary decision-making and working (97 per cent). Statements yielding equivocal responses predominantly related to technical and procedure choices, including: decontamination (40-68 per cent), laminar flow systems (13-61 per cent), PPE reuse (58 per cent), risk stratification of patients (21-48 per cent), open versus laparoscopic surgery (63 per cent), preferential cholecystostomy in biliary disease (48 per cent), and definition of aerosol-generating procedures (19 per cent). CONCLUSION: High levels of consensus existed for many statements within each domain, supporting much of the initial guidance issued by professional bodies.

However, the clinical outcomes of preoperative T-mab combined chemotherapy with radical gastrectomy remain unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the clinical outcomes of this multimodal treatment. METHODS: From among a total of 199 patients who received T-mab-based chemotherapy for stage IV HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer between 2011 and 2018, the subjects of this retrospective analysis were 20 patients who subsequently underwent radical gastrectomy. RESULTS: Seven patients had gastroesophageal junction cancer and 13 had gastric cancer. Eleven patients had unresectable stage IV cancer and 9 had resectable metastatic disease. Chemotherapy regimens included capecitabine, cisplatin + T-mab (11 patients), and S-1, oxaliplatin + T-mab (nine patients). The median number of chemotherapy cycles before surgery was three (range, 2-62). During preoperative chemotherapy, grade 3/4 adverse events developed in six patients. None suffered grade &#8805; 3b postoperative complications. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 58.9% and 89.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combined preoperative T-mab-based chemotherapy and surgery appears to be safe and effective for stage IV HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, with a clinically meaningful impact on RFS and OS.","Takahashi, Ryo; Nunobe, Souya; Osumi, Hiroki; Takahari, Daisuke; Yamamoto, Noriko; Ida, Satoshi; Kumagai, Koshi; Ohashi, Manabu; Sano, Takeshi; Hiki, Naoki",Surg Today,445,24

Notably, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections mostly depends on the control of cytokine storm and the increasingly recognized pathological role of uncontrolled neutrophil activation. Here, we used an integrative approach with publicly available RNA-Seq data sets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with SARS-CoV-2, according to sex and age. Female and young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with male and elderly patients, indicating a stronger immune modulation. Among them, we found an association between upregulated cytokine/chemokine- and downregulated neutrophil-related DEGs. This was correlated with a closer relationship between female and young subjects, while the relationship between male and elderly patients was closer still. The association between these cytokine/chemokines and neutrophil DEGs is marked by a strongly correlated interferome network. Here, female patients exhibited reduced transcriptional levels of key proinflammatory/neutrophil-related genes, such as CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1ß, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL, compared with male patients. These genes are well known to be protective against inflammatory damage. Therefore, our work suggests specific immune-regulatory pathways associated with sex and age of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provides a possible association between inverse modulation of cytokine/chemokine and neutrophil transcriptional signatures.","Freire, Paula P; Marques, Alexandre Hc; Baiocchi, Gabriela C; Schimke, Lena F; Fonseca, Dennyson Lm; Salgado, Ranieri C; Filgueiras, Igor S; Napoleao, Sarah Ms; Plaça, Desirée R; Akashi, Karen T; Hirata, Thiago Dominguez Crespo; El Khawanky, Nadia; Giil, Lasse M; Cabral-Miranda, Gustavo; Carvalho, Robson F; Ferreira, Luis Carlos S; Condino-Neto, Antonio; Nakaya, Helder I; Jurisica, Igor; Ochs, Hans D; Camara, Niels Olsen Saraiva; Calich, Vera Lúcia G; Cabral-Marques, Otavio",JCI insight,445,1

We confirm the previously documented average deterioration in mental health for the whole sample of individuals interviewed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we find that the average increase in mental distress varies by ethnicity and gender. Both women -regardless of their ethnicity- and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) men experienced a higher average increase in mental distress than White British men, so that the gender gap in mental health increases only among White British individuals. These ethnic-gender specific changes in mental health persist after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Finally, we find some evidence that, among men, Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani individuals have experienced the highest average increase in mental distress with respect to White British men.","Proto, Eugenio; Quintana-Domeque, Climent",PLoS One,445,16

Determination of the metabolomic profile may help to explain the heterogeneous spectra of COVID-19 clinical phenotypes and be useful in monitoring disease progression as well as therapeutic treatments. In this sense, saliva has proven to be a strategic biofluid, owing not only to its appeal as a noninvasive sampling method but also due to the capacity of the virus to invade epithelial cells of the oral mucosa and salivary gland ducts via ACE2 receptors. Accordingly, important changes in metabolism have been described relating to COVID-19, indicating that metabolomics may open new avenues for understanding the pathophysiology of this disease, especially via longitudinal study designs.

On the basis of current literature, a Developmental Cascade Model of BPD is offered in which specific difficulties during one developmental period contribute to specific difficulties in a succeeding period, resulting in increasingly broad areas of dysregulation over time. Furthermore, to address specificity, we contrast trajectories toward BPD with trajectories toward antisocial behavior, noting shared and divergent predictors.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and preventive practices of Iranians toward the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 925 people who completed an online questionnaire in March 2020. The study used 21 and 14 questions, respectively, to assess the knowledge and preventive practices of the population in regard to COVID-19. Cronbach's alpha was 0.75 for the knowledge scale and 0.71 for the practice scale. To determine the importance of each independent variable in explaining the participant's practice, a multiple regression model was applied. KEY RESULTS: The results indicated a moderate level of knowledge and preventive practices in regard to COVID-19 in most of the respondents (56.8% and 56.5%, respectively). According to the multiple regression analysis, knowledge showed the highest effect on the practice of the participants (ß = 0.479). The determination coefficient for the model (R2 = 0.509) also showed approximately 51% of the variance in practice was explained by gender, occupational status, knowledge, cost of hand sanitizer, and the belief in the effectiveness of using such necessities. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptable rates of knowledge and practice were observed in most Iranians. However, approximately 10% of the participants were unaware of the effective measures for preventing the infection, which can cause active transmission of the virus. In addition to considering the importance of high community awareness in prevention and isolation measures, the government should provide disinfectants and other materials at a low price to reduce the transmission, as this may lead to effective practice to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19.

These two entities clinically manifest with mild and subacute respiratory symptoms, often with a delayed diagnosis due to the atypical ARDS and silent hypoxemia presentation. Radiological features are often indistinguishable between the two. With the increase in antemortem lung biopsies and autopsies being performed, more histopathological findings of OP and its variant, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP), are being diagnosed. These entities are known complications of viral infections as a delayed immunological process, explaining the favorable response to corticosteroids. Clinicians should be vigilant to diagnose this under-recognized entity of secondary OP in people with COVID-19 when clinical deterioration occurs, especially with compatible radiologic findings and recent cessation of corticosteroids. Despite the proven benefits of corticosteroids in treating COVID-19, treatment approaches can be more effective as OP often requires higher doses and a more prolonged therapy duration for remission and preventing relapses. The purpose of our narrative review is to compare the similarities between COVID-19 pneumonia and OP, emphasizing the clinical, radiological, and histopathological features based on the evidence available in the literature.","Chong, Woon H; Saha, Biplab K; Chopra, Amit",Heart Lung,445,1

This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with COVID-19 at 7 designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The patients were followed up until June 30, 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with unsuccessful ECMO weaning. Propensity score matching was used to match patients who received veno-venous ECMO with those who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)-only therapy. Of 88 patients receiving ECMO therapy, 27 and 61 patients were and were not successfully weaned from ECMO, respectively. Additionally, 15, 15, and 65 patients were further weaned from IMV, discharged from hospital, or died during hospitalization, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a lymphocyte count &#8804;0.5×109/L and D-dimer concentration >4× the upper limit of normal level at ICU admission, a peak PaCO2 >60 mmHg at 24 h before ECMO initiation, and no tracheotomy performed during the ICU stay were independently associated with lower odds of ECMO weaning. In the propensity score-matched analysis, a mixed-effect Cox model detected a lower hazard ratio for 120-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission during hospitalization in the ECMO group. The presence of lymphocytopenia, higher D-dimer concentrations at ICU admission and hypercapnia before ECMO initiation could help to identify patients with a poor prognosis. Tracheotomy could facilitate weaning from ECMO. ECMO relative to IMV-only therapy was associated with improved outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Fang, Jing; Li, Rui; Chen, Yue; Qin, Juan-Juan; Hu, Ming; Huang, Chao-Lin; Cheng, Lin; He, Yi; Li, Yi; Zhou, Qiang; Zhou, Dai-Xing; Huang, Fei; Lei, Fang; Yang, Bo; Chen, Jun; Deng, Hong-Ping; Yuan, Yu-Feng; Xia, Jia-Hong; Wan, Song; Li, Hong-Liang; Wei, Xiang",Curr Med Sci,445,15

Here, we present the structure of the Vag8–C1-INH complex determined using cryo-electron microscopy at a 3.6-Å resolution.

This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified. It is necessary to offer correct and transparent information about these vaccines to reduce the concerns and increase the trust of the population, to thereby guarantee the success of the vaccination campaigns.","Rodríguez-Blanco, Noelia; Montero-Navarro, Sergio; Botella-Rico, José M.; Felipe-Gómez, Antonio J.; Sánchez-Más, Jesús; Tuells, José",Int J Environ Res Public Health,445,16

It forms the infectious part of the exposome, which collates all environmental factors contributing to the development of disease and studies the sum total of burden which leads to the loss of adaptive mechanisms in the body. These studies complement genome-wide association studies, which establish the genetic predisposition to disease. The infectome is a component which spans the whole life and may begin at the earliest stages right up to the time when the first symptoms manifest, and may thus contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmunity at the prodromal/asymptomatic stages. We provide practical examples and research tools as to how we can investigate disease-specific infectomes, using laboratory approaches employed from projects studying the “immunome” and “microbiome”. It is envisioned that an understanding of the infectome and the environmental factors that affect it will allow for earlier patient-specific intervention by clinicians, through the possible treatment of infectious agents as well as other compounding factors, and hence slowing or preventing disease development.","Bogdanos, Dimitrios P.; Smyk, Daniel S.; Invernizzi, Pietro; Rigopoulou, Eirini I.; Blank, Miri; Sakkas, Lazaros; Pouria, Shideh; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Immunol Res,445,24

The objectives were to (i) examine associations between AF, 30‐day thromboembolic events and mortality in adults with COVID‐19 and (ii) examine associations between COVID‐19, 30‐day thromboembolic events and mortality in adults with AF. METHODS: A study was conducted using a global federated health research network. Adults aged ≥50 years who presented to 41 participating healthcare organizations between 20 January 2020 and 1 September 2020 with COVID‐19 were included. RESULTS: For the first objective, 6589 adults with COVID‐19 and AF were propensity score matched for age, gender, race, and comorbidities to 6589 adults with COVID‐19 without AF. The survival probability was significantly lower in adults with COVID‐19 and AF compared to matched adults without AF (82.7% compared to 88.3%, Log‐Rank test P < .0001; Risk Ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.61 (1.46, 1.78)) and risk of thromboembolic events was higher in patients with AF (9.9% vs 7.0%, Log‐Rank test P < .0001; Risk Ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.41 (1.26, 1.59)). For the second objective, 2454 adults with AF and COVID‐19 were propensity score matched to 2454 adults with AF without COVID‐19. The survival probability was significantly lower for adults with AF and COVID‐19 compared to adults with AF without COVID‐19, but there was no significant difference in risk of thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS: AF could be an important risk factor for short‐term mortality with COVID‐19, and COVID‐19 may increase risk of short‐term mortality amongst adults with AF.","Harrison, Stephanie L.; Fazio‐Eynullayeva, Elnara; Lane, Deirdre A.; Underhill, Paula; Lip, Gregory Y.

The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article. Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals. Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging. Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.

The best studied nidoviruses, the corona- and arteriviruses, employ a unique transcription mechanism, which involves discontinuous RNA synthesis, a process resembling similarity-assisted copy-choice RNA recombination. During infection, multiple subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are transcribed from a mirror set of sg negative-strand RNA templates. The sg mRNAs all possess a short 5′ common leader sequence, derived from the 5′ end of the genomic RNA. The joining of the non-contiguous ‘leader’ and ‘body’ sequences presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis. To study whether toroviruses use a similar transcription mechanism, we characterized the 5′ termini of the genome and the four sg mRNAs of Berne virus (BEV). We show that BEV mRNAs 3–5 lack a leader sequence. Surprisingly, however, RNA 2 does contain a leader, identical to the 5′-terminal 18 residues of the genome. Apparently, BEV combines discontinuous and non-discontinous RNA synthesis to produce its sg mRNAs. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the mechanism and evolution of nidovirus transcription.","van Vliet, A.L.W.; Smits, S.L.; Rottier, P.J.M.; de Groot, R.J.",The EMBO Journal,445,7

MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R were attenuated in mice (mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p.i., respectively) compared to MP-G64R and MP-26M (mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p.i., respectively). MP-26M and MP-G64R infection induced early onset, severe generalised necrotising myositis, whereas MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R infection induced a later onset, mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis. Our findings demonstrate that only the 3D-S264L mutation attenuates HEV71 in mice, suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model.","Sadeghipour, Sara; McMinn, Peter C.",Virus Res,445,1

Media reports from the height of the pandemic's initial international surge frequently highlighted that many people were engaging in music-related activities (from singing and dancing to playing music from balconies and attending virtual concerts) to help them cope with the strain of the pandemic. Our first goal in this study was to investigate changes in music-related habits due to the pandemic. We also investigated whether engagement in distinct music-related activities (singing, listening, dancing, etc.) was associated with individual differences in musical reward, music perception, musical training, or emotional regulation strategies. To do so, we collected detailed (~1 h-long) surveys during the initial peak of shelter-in-place order implementation (May–June 2020) from over a thousand individuals across different Countries in which the pandemic was especially devastating at that time: the USA, Spain, and Italy. Our findings indicate that, on average, people spent more time in music-related activities while under confinement than they had before the pandemic. Notably, this change in behavior was dependent on individual differences in music reward sensitivity, and in emotional regulation strategies. Finally, the type of musical activity with which individuals engaged was further associated with the degree to which they used music as a way to regulate stress, to address the lack of social interaction (especially the individuals more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus), or to cheer themselves up (especially those who were more worried about the pandemic consequences). Identifying which music-related activities have been particularly sought for by the population as a means for coping with such heightened uncertainty and stress, and understanding the individual differences that underlie said propensities are crucial to implementing personalized music-based interventions that aim to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms.","Ferreri, Laura; Singer, Neomi; McPhee, Michael; Ripollés, Pablo; Zatorre, Robert J.; Mas-Herrero, Ernest",Front Psychol,445,16

As its severe pathogenicity is concerned, it is important to study it thoroughly to aid in the discovery of a cure. In this study, the microRNAs (miRNAs) of COVID-19 were annotated to provide a powerful tool for the study of this novel coronavirus. We obtained 16 novel coronavirus genome sequences and the mature sequences of all viruses in the microRNA database (miRbase), and then used the miRNA mature sequences of the virus to perform the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis in the coronavirus genome, extending the matched regions of approximately 20 bp to two segments by 200 bp. Six sequences were obtained after deleting redundant sequences. Then, the hairpin structures of the mature miRNAs were determined using RNAfold. The mature sequence on one hairpin arm was selected into a total of 4 sequences, and finally the relevant miRNA precursor prediction tools were used to verify whether the selected sequences are miRNA precursor sequences of the novel coronavirus. The miRNAs of the novel coronavirus were annotated by our newly developed method, which will lay the foundation for further study of this virus.","Yu, Tie-Ying; Chen, Min; Wang, Chun-De",,445,30

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the presence of HRV-C in fecal samples of children with gastroenteritis. STUDY DESIGN: 734 fecal samples from hospitalized children with gastroenteritis were subject to picornavirus detection by RT-PCR of the conserved 5′-NCR. Positive samples were subject to VP4 and 3D(pol) gene analysis for species determination. The clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV-C and other picornaviruses was analyzed. RESULTS: Picornaviruses were detected in 113 (15.4%) of 734 fecal samples from children with gastroenteritis by RT-PCR of 5′-NCR, with 58 containing potential HRVs and 55 containing other enteroviruses. PCR of the VP4 and 3D(pol) regions was positive in 21 and 19 samples respectively (both regions positive in 8 samples). Sequencing analysis showed the presence of HRV-C in four samples, and diverse picornaviruses including HRV-A (n = 2), HEV-A (n = 2), HEV-B (n = 2), HEV-C (n = 21) and HPeV (n = 2) in other samples, with co-detection of HRV-C and HPeV in one sample. Of the four children with HRV-C detected in fecal samples, three presented with diarrhea in the absence of respiratory symptoms, while one also had acute bronchiolitis. The four HRV-C strains from fecal samples belonged to the existing clade of diverse HRV-C genotypes, indistinguishable from previous respiratory strains. CONCLUSIONS: HRV-C can be detected in fecal samples of children with gastroenteritis, in the absence of respiratory symptoms. This study also represented the first to detect HPeV in our population.","Lau, Susanna K.P.; Yip, Cyril C.Y.; Lung, David Christopher; Lee, Paul; Que, Tak-Lun; Lau, Yu-Lung; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Woo, Patrick C.Y.; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",J Clin Virol,445,1

Therefore, the aim with this study was to determine the risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with asthma and COPD. METHODS: We performed a nationwide cohort study including patients with COVID-19 from February 1 to July 10, 2020. All patients with COVID-19 registered in the Danish registers were included. With ICD-codes and medication history, patients were divided into asthma, COPD or no asthma or COPD. Primary outcome was a combined outcome of severe COVID-19, intensive care or death. RESULTS: Among 5104 patients with COVID-19 (median age 54.8 years (25–75(th)% 40.5 to 72.3); women, 53.0%), 354 had asthma and 432 COPD. The standardised absolute risk of the combined endpoint was 21.2% (95% CI 18.8 to 23.6) in patients with COPD; 18.5% (95% CI 14.3 to 22.7) in patients with asthma and 17.2% (95% CI 16.1 to 18.3) in patients with no asthma or COPD. Patients with COPD had slightly increased risk of the combined endpoint compared with patients without asthma or COPD (Risk difference 4.0%; 95% CI 1.3 to 6.6; p=0.003). In age standardised analyses, there were no differences between the disease groups. Low blood eosinophil counts (<0.3×10^9 cells·liter(−1)) were associated with increased risk of severe outcomes among patients with COPD. CONCLUSION: Patients with COPD have slightly increased risk of developing severe outcomes of COVID-19 compared with patients without obstructive lung diseases. However, in age standardised analysis, the risk difference disappears.","Hansen, Erik Soeren Halvard; Moeller, Amalie Lykkemark; Backer, Vibeke; Andersen, Mikkel Porsborg; Kober, Lars; Kragholm, Kristian; Torp-Pedersen, Christian",ERJ Open Res,445,17

Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. RESULTS Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified IgG product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized ELISA activity (per mg/mL IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B and anti-D antibodies) were reduced to minimal levels. CONCLUSIONS Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG) that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma. The first clinical study in which the hIVIG will be evaluated will be Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) [NCT04546581].","Vandeberg, Peter; Cruz, Maria; Diez, José María; Merritt, W.

Currently, no specific drugs for COVID-19 but many antiviral agents have been authorised by several national agencies. Most of them are under investigation in both preclinical and clinical trials; however, pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are needed to identify the most suitable dose to achieve the desired effect on SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the efforts of the scientific community have focused on the screening of therapies able to counteract the most severe effects of the infection, as well as on the search of sensitive and selective analytical methods for drug detection in biological matrices, both fluids and tissues. In the last decade, many analytical methods have been proposed for the detection and quantification of antiviral compounds currently being tested for COVID-19 treatment. In this review, a critical discussion on the overall analytical procedure is provided, i.e (a) sample pre-treatment and extraction methods such as protein precipitation (PP), solid-phase extraction (SPE), liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe), (b) detection and quantification methods such as potentiometry, spectrofluorimetry and mass spectrometry (MS) as well as (c) methods including a preliminary separation step, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to UV-Vis or MS detection. Further current trends, advantages and disadvantages and prospects of these methods have been discussed, to help the analytical advances in reducing the harm caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Acquavia, Maria A.; Foti, Luca; Pascale, Raffaella; Nicolò, Antonia; Brancaleone, Vincenzo; Cataldi, Tommaso R.I.; Martelli, Giuseppe; Scrano, Laura; Bianco, Giuliana",Talanta,445,30

No country has been spared from its onslaught. Treatments that can reduce the risk of infection and mortality from the disease are desperately needed. Though high quality randomized controlled trials are lacking, some observational and interventional studies that explore the link between vitamin D and RTIs exist. Vitamin D modulates both innate as well as adaptive immunity and may potentially prevent or mitigate the complications associated with RTIs. Evidence linking vitamin D to COVID-19 include that the outbreak occurred in winter in the northern hemisphere at a time when vitamin D levels are lowest in resident populations, that blacks and minority ethnic individuals who are known to have lower levels of vitamin D appear to be disproportionately affected and have more severe complications from the disease, that vitamin D deficiency has been shown to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome and that case fatality rates increase with age and in populations with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with lower vitamin D levels. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge about the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19, the evidence linking vitamin D and RTIs, especially COVID-19, the mechanistic reasons behind the possible protective effect of vitamin D in COVID-19, and the evidence with regard to vitamin D supplementation in RTIs.

Alphaviruses, including Chikungunya, O’nyong’nyong, Sindbis, Barmah Forest, Ross River, and Mayaro viruses, are associated with acute and/or chronic rheumatic symptoms. Identification of Mxra8 as a viral entry receptor in the alphaviral replication pathway creates opportunities for treatment and prevention.

The present study was conducted to explore the lived experiences of nurses providing altruistic care to patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present qualitative phenomenological study was conducted in spring 2020 on twelve nurses (eight women and four men) selected by purposive sampling from hospitals admitting patients with COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran. Data were collected through open, in-depth, semi-structured interviews and were analyzed using the Glaizer technique. RESULTS: The lived experiences of nurses dealing with COVID-19 included: (Raoofi et al., 2020) Disquietude, with subcategories including shock and the dilemma of staying or leaving; (Kim and Choi, 2016) Intellectuality, with subcategories including patience, self-sacrifice, spiritual growth; (Lai et al., 2020) Human transcendence, with subcategories including love of the profession, community's appreciation, and improving the value of nursing. CONCLUSION: Nurses' experience of providing patient care has a transcendental nature, such that nurses went from the usual fears to transcendence in internal and social aspects. The experience of passing through these stages took place over a short period of time, and nurses felt good about this achievement.

The Middle East has a death toll of ∼50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over 350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19. Methods The approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Findings We identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East. Interpretation The phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA vaccines were constructed to express Ebola virus GP. Mice were injected with GP DNA vaccines and their splenocytes were used for hybridoma production. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), limiting dilution subcloning, antibody purification methods, and Western blot assays were used to select GP-specific hybridomas and purify monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from the hybridoma cells. RESULTS: Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity, were selected by ELISA. When purified MAbs from 12 hybridomas were tested for their reactivity to GP, 11 MAbs, except for 1 MAb (from the A6-9 hybridoma) displaying an IgG2a type, were identified as IgM isotypes. Those 11 MAbs failed to recognize GP. However, the MAb from A6-9 recognized the mucin-like region of GP and remained reactive to the antigen at the lowest tested concentration (1.95 ng/mL). This result suggests that IgM-secreting hybridomas are predominantly generated by DNA vaccination. However, boosting with GP resulted in greater production of IgG-secreting hybridomas than GP DNA vaccination alone. CONCLUSION: DNA vaccination may preferentially generate IgM-secreting hybridomas, but boosting with the protein antigen can reverse this propensity. Thus, this protein boosting approach may have implications for the production of IgG-specific hybridomas in the context of the DNA vaccination platform. In addition, the purified monoclonal IgG antibodies may be useful as therapeutic antibodies for controlling Ebola virus infection.","Lee, Si-Hyeong; Han, Baek-Sang; Choe, Jongseon; Sin, Jeong-Im",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,445,18

METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, multicenter cohort study using prospectively collected data from adult patients hospitalized during influenza virus circulation, for at least 24h, for community-acquired ILI (with symptom onset <7 days). Data were collected from five French teaching hospitals over six consecutive winters (2012-2018). Respiratory viruses were identified by multiplex RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. hMPV+ patients were compared to hMPV– patients, influenza+ and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)+ patients using multivariate logistic regressions. Primary outcome was the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized for ILI. RESULTS: Among the 3148 patients included (1449 (46%) women, 1988 (63%) aged 65 and over; 2508 (80%) with chronic disease), at least one respiratory virus was detected in 1604 (51%, 95%CI [49-53]), including 100 cases of hMPV (100/3148, 3% 95%CI [3, 4]), of which 10 (10%) were viral co-infection. In the hMPV+ patients, mean length of stay was 7 days, 62% (56/90) developed a complication, 21% (14/68) were admitted to intensive care unit and 4% (4/90) died during hospitalization. In comparison with influenza+ patients, hMPV+ patients were more frequently > 65 years old (aOR=3.3, 95%CI[1.9-6.3]) and presented more acute heart failure during hospitalization (aOR=1.8, 95%CI[1.0-2.9]). Compared to RSV+ patients, hMPV+ patients had less cancer (aOR=0.4, 95%CI[0.2-0.9]) and were less likely to smoke (aOR=0.5, 95%CI[0.2-0.9]) but had similar outcomes especially high rate of respiratory and cardiovascular complications.

This was further examined to determine whether conforming to recommended guidelines on PA and sedentary behaviour was improved. Based on an online survey (n = 818) incorporating the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), self-reported body mass change showed that in 32.2% of participants body mass increased, with 39.1% reporting an increase in food intake. Never exercising at the gym or undertaking an exercise class (online or live), increased by 50.8% during lockdown, with 53.5% changing from exercising frequently to never exercising, suggesting a lack of engagement with online and home workouts. However, outdoor running and cycling >2 times/week increased by 38% during lockdown. Walking at least 30 min continuously on >2 occasions/week increased by 70% during lockdown with minimum 10-min walks on 7 days per week increasing by 23%. The lockdown had a negative impact on sitting time (>8 h a day), which increased by 43.6% on weekdays and 121% at weekends. Furthermore, sitting <4 h/day decreased during lockdown (46.5% and 25.6% for weekdays and weekends, respectively). Those citing tiredness or lack of time as a barrier to exercise reduced by 16% and 60%, respectively, from pre-lockdown to during lockdown. More of the sedentary group met the Public Health England PA recommendations, however most participants still did not meet the UK Government guidelines for PA. Improvements in health per additional minutes of physical activity will be proportionately greater in those previously doing <30 min/week, the area where most improvements were found although, conversely sitting time was greatly increased.

Research to date has focused primarily on exposure to single pesticides or pesticide classes in isolation; there are little data on the effect of exposure to pesticide mixtures on child and adolescent neurodevelopment. METHODS: Using California’s Pesticide Use Reporting database, we estimated agricultural pesticide use within 1 km of the home during the prenatal and postnatal (ages 0–5 years) periods among participants in the Center for the Health Assessment for Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) birth cohort. We implemented a Bayesian Hierarchical linear mixed-effects model to examine associations with maternal- and youth-reported behavioral and emotional problems from the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2) at ages 16 and 18 years (n = 593). RESULTS: We observed mostly null associations between pesticide applications and neurobehavioral outcomes. There were some trends of modestly increased internalizing behaviors and attention problems in association with organophosphate insecticide use near the home during the prenatal period. In the postnatal period, a two-fold increase in glyphosate applications was associated with more youth-reported depression (β = 1.2, 95% credible intervals [CrI] = 0.2, 2.2), maternal-reported internalizing behaviors (β = 1.23, 95% CrI = 0.2, 2.3), and anxiety (β = 1.2, 95% CrI = 0.2, 2.3). We observed some protective associations with imidacloprid during the prenatal period, particularly in sex-specific analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We found only some subtle associations between some pesticides and neurobehavioral outcomes. This study extends previous work by considering potential exposure to mixtures of pesticides.","Hyland, Carly; Bradshaw, Patrick T.; Gunier, Robert B.; Mora, Ana M.; Kogut, Katherine; Deardorff, Julianna; Sagiv, Sharon K.; Bradman, Asa; Eskenazi, Brenda",Environ Epidemiol,445,10

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, paid caregivers had the potential to inadvertently spread COVID-19. We sought to characterize the effects of COVID-19 on HCAs and examine HCAs’ infection prevention and control (IPC) policies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a qualitative analysis of data collected from a national survey of HCAs. Surveys were e-mailed to members of a national HCA association on March 18, 2020. Questions included queries on demographics, COVID-19 exposures, effects of COVID-19, and IPC protocols. RESULTS: 1204 HCAs responded with an average census of 96.2 (5-2800) patients daily. Across 36 states, 238 HCAs reported COVID-19 cases or exposures among caregivers. HCAs experienced challenges related to changing patient needs (e.g. decreased caregiver requests), staffing shortages (e.g., fear of COVID-19, inability to train caregivers), and management issues (e.g., inability to obtain supplies). ICP protocols varied in how HCAs followed recommended guidelines, responded to COVID-19 exposures, performed infection surveillance, and implemented precautions. Additionally, HCAs had varying policies for caregiver PTO. CONCLUSIONS: HCAs experienced COVID-19 exposures and/or cases early in the pandemic. HCAs identified staffing and PPE shortages, and lack of IPC guidance as challenges. Although caregivers are providing essential care for millions of older adults, they have been largely absent from federal, state, and health system strategies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Future policies must include HCAs and their caregivers to optimize care for older adults.","Rowe, Theresa; Patel, Mallika; O’Conor, Rachel; McMackin, Sheila; Hoak, Vicki; Lindquist, Lee A.",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,445,1

Moreover, currently available vaccines and therapeutic antibodies were shown to be less effective against new variants, in particular, the South African (SA) variant, termed 501Y.V2 or B.1.351. To assess the efficacy of the CT-P59 monoclonal antibody against the SA variant, we sought to perform as in vitro binding and neutralization assays, and in vivo animal studies. CT-P59 neutralized B.1.1.7 variant to a similar extent as to wild type virus. CT-P59 showed reduced binding affinity against a RBD (receptor binding domain) triple mutant containing mutations defining B.1.351 (K417N/E484K/N501Y) also showed reduced potency against the SA variant in live virus and pseudovirus neutralization assay systems. However, in vivo ferret challenge studies demonstrated that a therapeutic dosage of CT-P59 was able to decrease B.1.351 viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, comparable to that observed for the wild type virus. Overall, although CT-P59 showed reduced in vitro neutralizing activity against the SA variant, sufficient antiviral effect in B.1.351-infected animals was confirmed with a clinical dosage of CT-P59, suggesting that CT-P59 has therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients infected with SA variant.

Countries have been impacted variably, with differing disease control measures implemented. The working equid community includes some of the world’s most marginalised people, who rely on animals for their daily lives and livelihoods. The aim of this study was to learn about the effects of the pandemic on the working equid community, and in doing so, to develop credible methods to collect data in future unprecedented events. There were 1530 survey respondents from a population of individuals who received support from equid welfare projects across 14 low- or middle-income countries projects during November and December 2020. The main findings were that, compared to prior to the pandemic, equids were working less, individuals were receiving less income, with expenses staying the same or increasing. In the short term, different indicators show that the effect on equine welfare has been inconsistent, but most owners reported no change in their equid’s health. However, it is predicted that there will be negative long-term impacts on human and equid welfare due to financial insecurity. This requires monitoring. Collaboration with humanitarian organisations, governments, and animal welfare non-governmental organisations is required to mitigate deep-rooted issues involving the working equid community. ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic was declared on 11 March 2020. The working equid community includes some of the world’s most marginalised people, who rely on animals for their daily lives and livelihoods. A cross-sectional study investigated the effects of COVID-19 on working equid communities, with the intention of developing methods for replication in future unprecedented events. A multi-language survey was developed, involving 38 predominantly closed questions, and carried out face-to-face, over telephone, or online. There were 1530 respondents from a population of individuals who received support from equid welfare projects across 14 low- or middle-income countries projects during November and December 2020. Overall, at the time of survey completion, 57% (875/1522) of respondents reported that their equids were working less, 76% (1130/1478) reported a decreased monthly income from equids, and 78% (1186/1519) reported a reduction in household income compared to pre-pandemic levels. Costs of equid upkeep remained the same for 58% (886/1519) of respondents and 68% (1034/1518) reported no change in the health of their equid. The potential long-term impacts on human and equid welfare due to reported financial insecurities necessitates monitoring. A One Welfare approach, involving collaboration with governments, humanitarian, and animal welfare non-governmental organisations is required to mitigate deep-rooted issues.","Wild, Isabella; Gedge, Amy; Burridge, Jessica; Burford, John",Animals (Basel),445,20

Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) can be effective in reducing illicit opioid use and fatal overdose, and improving multiple health and social outcomes. Despite evidence for its effectiveness, there are significant deficits in OAT globally. COVID-19 has required rapid adaptation of remote models of healthcare. Telemedicine is not used routinely in OAT, and little is known about the current levels of use and effectiveness. The objective of this review is to describe models of telemedicine and their efficacy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review uses the review methodology described by Arksey and O’Malley and adapted by Levac et al. The search strategy developed by the medical librarian at the Irish College of General Practitioners in conjunction with the research team will involve five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and OpenGrey) and the hand searching of reference lists. A limited initial search of two databases will be completed to refine search terms, followed by a second comprehensive search using newly refined search terms of all databases and finally hand searching references of included studies. To be included, studies must report on remote ways of providing OAT (including assessment, induction and monitoring) or related psychosocial support; be published in English after 2010. Two researchers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles considered for inclusion. Data will be extracted onto an agreed template and will undergo a descriptive analysis of the contextual or process-oriented data and simple quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is not required for this scoping review. The results of this scoping review will inform the development of a national remote model of OAT. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences.","Crowley, Des; Homeniuk, Robyn; Delargy, Ide",BMJ Open,445,26

The disease is characterized by a variable clinical phenotype, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to severe and/or critical disease, which bears poor prognosis and outcome because of the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) requiring ICU hospitalization, multi-organ failure and death. Therefore, the determination of risk factors predisposing to disease phenotype is of outmost importance. The aim of our study was to evaluate which predisposing factors, including MBL2 genotyping, affected clinical phenotype in 264 COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that older age along with underlying comorbidities, primarily obesity, chronic inflammatory disorders and diabetes mellitus, represent the most important risk factors related to hospitalization, the development of pneumonia and SARS. Moreover, we found that the presence of the MBL deficiency-causing B allele (rs1800450) was significantly associated with almost 2-fold increased risk for developing pneumonia and requiring hospitalization, suggesting its usage as a molecular predictor of severe disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.","Speletas, Matthaios; Dadouli, Katerina; Syrakouli, Argyro; Gatselis, Nikolaos; Germanidis, Georgios; Mouchtouri, Varvara A.; Koulas, Ioannis; Samakidou, Anna; Nikolaidou, Anastasia; Stefos, Aggelos; Mimtsoudis, Iordanis; Hatzianastasiou, Sophia; Koureas, Michalis; Anagnostopoulos, Lemonia; Tseroni, Maria; Tsinti, Gerasimina; Metallidis, Symeon; Dalekos, George; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos",Immunobiology,445,1

In patients who continually test positive for COVID-19, it is essential to determine precisely which risk factors contribute to the increase in viral shedding duration. We present a case about a 62-year-old man who has persistently tested positive for COVID-19 for more than 230 days. We followed his treatment course, in which he had been hospitalized multiple times since the onset of symptoms back in April 2020. We have determined that patients with immunosuppression, especially those taking corticosteroids, are at increased risk of prolonged viral shedding.

Preliminary data indicated beneficial effects not only for the affected staff but also for the peer responders who considered their role to be challenging but gratifying. Challenges during program implementation included persistent blame culture, limited awareness of program availability, and lack of financial resources. Common goals of the support programs (e.g., fostering coping strategies, promoting individual resilience) are consistent with Safety II and may promote system resilience. Investing in second victim support structures should be a top priority for healthcare institutions adopting a systemic approach to safety and striving for just culture.","Busch, Isolde Martina; Moretti, Francesca; Campagna, Irene; Benoni, Roberto; Tardivo, Stefano; Wu, Albert W.; Rimondini, Michela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,445,9

Cancer vaccines aim to clear active disease instead of aiming to prevent disease, the only exception being the recently approved vaccine that prevents cancers caused by the Human Papillomavirus. The development of therapeutic cancer vaccines has been disappointing with many early cancer vaccines that showed promise in preclinical models often failing to translate into efficacy in the clinic.

Methods: Retrospective descriptive observational study using the ""Net Promoter Score"" (NPS), which classifies patients as promoters or detractors. Three PQ dimensions (accessibility, professionals, and information) were measured in 160 patients discharged home BA, and in a further 160 in the first 2 months DA. A standard of ≥90% promoters and ≤10% detractors was verified by lot acceptance (LQAS) in different access routes and times. Factors related to the probability that a patient was a promoter, or a detractor were analysed using logistic regression. Results: The mean score was lower in accessibility than in the other dimensions (8.6 vs. 9.1 and 9.0; p <.0001). DA, accessibility obtained better results (NPS 70 vs. 32, p <.001). Per access route, Paediatrics and Ophthalmology improved and Maternity did not experience changes. LQAS showed more lots accepted DA (85% vs. 72%). The likelihood for a patient to be a promoter was higher DA (OR 1.85, p <.0001), especially in accessibility (OR 3.08, p <0.0001). The likelihood to be a detractor was reduced (OR .54, p <.05), and also greater in accessibility (OR .39, p <.05). Conclusions: PQ improved during the period of alert, its declaration being the most influential factor. This improvement is evident in paediatric and ophthalmological patients, but imperceptible in Maternity or Traumatology, perhaps because the pandemic acted as an adequacy corrector.","Ferrer, Julio Jose Lopez-Picazo; Gutiérrez, Inmaculada Vidal-Abarca; Fernández, Dolores Beteta; Ibáñez, Mercedes López",J Healthc Qual Res,445,13

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey was to map the teaching situation in QB13 palliative medicine in SS 2020 under the influence of COVID-19 and from this to derive the need for networking and support for the coming semesters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The key persons involved in palliative care education in all 41 medical faculties in Germany were identified and invited by the coordination office of the German Society for Palliative Medicine (DGP) to participate in an online survey using SurveyMonkey®. The questionnaire consisted of 15 items dealing with the evaluation of the past semester and the need for support for the coming semester. RESULTS: Out of 41 contacted teachers 16 participated in the survey. Most of them described the challenge of teaching in SS 2020 as successful. Support from the faculties was provided primarily in the form of digital teaching structures. A digital teaching design is also planned for the coming semester. Power point slides with sound and the conference tool Zoom® are often used. CONCLUSION: The design of examinations in SS 2020 is rated worse in the self-evaluation than the teaching design.

The top 10 sequences all exhibited strong binding to the S1 protein. Two aptamers, named MSA1 (K(d) = 1.8 nM) and MSA5 (K(d) = 2.7 nM), were assessed for binding to the heat-treated S1 protein, untreated S1 protein spiked into 50% human saliva and the trimeric spike protein of both the wildtype and the B.1.1.7 variant, demonstrating comparable affinities in all cases. MSA1 and MSA5 also recognized the pseudotyped lentivirus of SARS-CoV-2 with respective K(d) values of 22.7 pM and 11.8 pM. Secondary structure prediction and sequence truncation experiments revealed that both MSA1 and MSA5 adopted a hairpin structure, which was the motif pre-designed into the original library.

The duration of wear, the session (AM/PM), the brand of mask and the presence of previous COVID‐19 symptoms were also recorded. RESULTS: Twenty‐eight data sets were collected from twelve participants (1M:11F). Of the FFP3 masks worn, nineteen (67.86%) were ARCO(TM), eight (28.57%) were 3M(TM) masks and one (3.57%) was 3M+(TM). At baseline, the mean SpO2 was 98.39% and the mean pulse rate was 72.11. Prior to mask removal, the mean SpO2 was 97.82% and the mean pulse rate was 70.04. At the end of the session, the mean SpO2 was 98.14% and the mean pulse rate was 69.54. The mean duration of wear was 150.34 min. Data sets were collected evenly across AM (14) and PM (14) sessions. Five participants (17.86%) reported previous COVID‐19 symptoms. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrated a mean reduction of 0.25% in oxygen saturation and 3.56% in pulse rate, following the use of an FFP3 mask. These changes in physiological parameters are not clinically significant and sessional use appears to be safe.","Rehman, Ilyaas; Ali, Sarah; O’Brien, Conor; Goodall, Christine",Oral Surg,445,1

The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. The National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices of Argentina has recently authorized the use of this method.","Genoud, Valeria; Stortz, Martin; Waisman, Ariel; Berardino, Bruno G.; Verneri, Paula; Dansey, Virginia; Salvatori, Melina; Remes Lenicov, Federico; Levi, Valeria",PLoS One,445,16

These treatment modalities are obviously of great benefit to the patient, but also present a great challenge to the innate immune system, since they involve direct exposure of non-biological materials, cells of non-hematological origin as well as endothelial cells, damaged by ischemia-perfusion in solid organs to proteins and cells in the blood. The result of such an exposure may be an inappropriate activation of the complement and contact/kallikrein systems, which produce mediators capable of triggering the platelets and PMNs and monocytes, which can ultimately result in thrombotic and inflammatory (i.e., a thrombo-inflammatory) response to the treatment modality. In this concept review, we give an overview of the mechanisms of recognition within the innate immunity system, with the aim to identify suitable points for intervention.

Despite the common use of vitamin B6 to control vomiting in children with gastroenteritis, no study has been performed in this field. This study aimed to assess the value of vitamin B6 in the prevention of vomiting in patients with mild to moderate gastroenteritis. METHODOLOGY: This study was a double blind controlled clinical trial on 96 children with mild to moderate gastroenteritis with age range of 6 months to 12 years admitted in Mofid Children’s Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups of 48 subjects matched for age, sex and symptoms of dehydration. Vitamin B6 was given in case group and control group was given placebo. The severity of dehydration and vomiting in patients before and after treatment were evaluated by a physician. All data were recorded in the questionnaire and results in the two treatment groups were compared by using SPSS software (Version 15, Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of patients whom underwent Vitamin B6 treatment was 2.9±2.4 versus 2.5±2 in placebo group. Significant difference between mean age, gender, and severity of dehydration in children of two groups wasn’t observed. After treatment in both treatment groups, 40 patients (83.3%) had mild dehydration, and 8 patients (16.7%) had moderate dehydration. Vomiting was noted in 28 patients (58.3%) after treatment with vitamin B6 and in 37 patients (77.1%) after treatment with placebo. The mean frequency of vomiting after treatment with vitamin B6 was 1.7±1.3 times and in the control group (treated with distilled water) was 1.5±0.77 time, but no significant difference between the severity of dehydration, controlling vomiting and the mean frequency of vomiting was observed in both groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: It seems that the use of oral vitamin B6 treatment has no benefit and impact compared with the placebo. Thus, use of vitamin B6 in the prevention of vomiting due to acute mild to moderate gastroenteritis is not only scientifically, but in the present study it was proved to be ineffective. This work was done on a comparative basis and further researches are recommended.","Derakhshanfar, Hojjat; Amree, Arash Hadian; Alimohammadi, Hossein; Shojahe, Majid; Sharami, Ali",Glob J Health Sci,445,20

Patients receiving disease modifying therapy (DMT) for MS have a higher background risk of infection-related health care utilization when compared to the general population. Therefore, there is a need of evidence-based recommendations to reduce the risk of infection and also managing MS patients with SARS-CoV-2. Case Description: We present three patients with history of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on DMTs presenting with worsening MS symptoms likely pseudo exacerbation who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Discussion: An extensive review of 7 articles was performed, in addition to a brief review on DMTs use in MS patients with COVID-19. In our cases, all patients were on DMT and severe course of disease was noted in 2 cases. No fatality was observed. Conclusions: This review provides a base on the clinical characteristics, outcomes and the roles of DMTs in MS patients suffering from n-cov-2. Physicians need to be vigilant about considering COVID-19 infection related relapse in the MS patients, especially in this COVID-19 pandemic era and look for pseudo-exacerbation. As most cases are found to have mild course and full recovery on DMTs, further research is needed to formulate evidence-based guidelines. This review will particularly be helpful for the researchers and registries to collect future data on MS and COVID-19.","Kataria, Saurabh; Tandon, Medha; Melnic, Violina; Sriwastava, Shitiz",eNeurologicalSci,445,1

The present study aimed to assess sleep quality and its associated factors among community non-medical anti-epidemic workers. METHOD: A survey was conducted using anonymous online questionnaire to collect information from 16 March 2020 to 24 March 2020. A total of 474 participants were included, with a 94.23% completion rate. The questionnaire contained demographic data, physical symptoms, and contact history with COVID-19. The researchers assessed perceived social support by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), assessed perceived stress by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and measured sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, 46.20% reported poor sleep quality. A binary logistic regression revealed that having educational background of junior college or above, being a member of the police force, having contacted individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, having chronic disease(s), having illness within 2 weeks, and having high or moderate perceived stress were significant factors associated with an increased risk of poor sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Demographic factors, physical symptoms, history of contact with COVID-19, and perceived stress are significantly associated with poor sleep quality of community non-medical anti-epidemic workers. Thus, targeting these factors might be helpful in enhancing sleep quality of community workers.","Si, Guanglin; Xu, Yi; Li, Mengying; Zhang, Yuting; Peng, Shuzhen; Tan, Xiaodong",BMC Public Health,445,1

Modulating the formation of DC–T‐cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC–T‐cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size‐dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of >1 µm (L‐GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA‐ROCK‐MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (≈500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L‐GO treatment enhances DC–T‐cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton‐dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM‐1. L‐GO acts as a “nanozipper,” facilitating the aggregation of DC–T‐cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L‐GO‐adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS‐CoV‐2 spike 1, leading to >99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS‐CoV‐2 strain.

They exhibited variable histological changes in the epithelium of the small intestine, ranging from degeneration of single cells and detachment of groups of cells from the villous tips to regenerative processes of the crypt epithelia. Post-mortem diagnosis was based on the immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen within intestinal epithelial cells and on the electron microscopical demonstration of coronavirus particles in the faeces. In addition, one animal was immunohistochemically positive for antigens of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and exhibited intestinal changes consistent with FeLV-associated enteritis. Two cats were tested serologically for feline immunodeficiency antibodies, with negative results.

In order to outline a standard/baseline model of care, we think that it can be useful to refer to already existing rehabilitative plans with a long-standing tradition in Italy, such as those ones prescribed for work-related respiratory diseases like pneumoconiosis, in which long-term outcomes share some clinical characteristics with post-infective lung fibrosis. Such programs include diagnostic procedures (spirometry, ECG, blood tests) and treatments like respiratory physio-kinesiotherapy and postural drainage of the lungs; mechanical pulmonary ventilation for rehabilitative purposes, with or without drugs, along with standard medical and, when required, oxygen therapy; inhalation therapies with mineral waters; physical activity and psychological support. In conclusion, we believe that spa facilities can be a proper setting for respiratory rehabilitation and that already existing programs employed in occupational medicine can be a good starting point to plan rehabilitative strategies for post-COVID-19 patients. In particular, health spa centers can be useful not only to offer tailored programs of physical rehabilitation but also to provide patients with a psychologically supportive and health-promoting environment. Further studies on the topic are advised to properly assess and quantify with adequate outcome measurements the beneficial effect of a spa-based rehabilitative program in post-COVID-19 patients.","Antonelli, Michele; Donelli, Davide",Int J Biometeorol,445,16

The virus has mutated in three major directions, resulting in three groups to date. Analysis of the basic structure of the group of viruses was completed by April and shared across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of the second and subsequent peaks. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of which the virus overcame previously effective protection and caused second waves of the disease. Currently, each country may possess such a unique, stronger variant. Some of them slowly entered other countries and caused epidemics. These viruses could also serve as sources of further mutations by exchanging parts of the genome, which could create variants with superior infectivity.","Konishi, Tomokazu",bioRxiv,445,1

Coccidioidomycosis is an endemic fungal infection which presents with mild-to-moderate pneumonia in most cases. Case Presentation: The presented case is a 67-year-old woman living in the southwestern United States who is under close observation for well-differentiated liposarcoma of the abdominal wall. She presented with persistent cough and fatigue following COVID-19 infection. Imaging revealed new pulmonary nodules, a chest wall mass and bone lesions. The imaging appearance of these lesions was consistent with metastatic disease, although distant metastasis is not typical in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Biopsy of the chest wall mass revealed granulomatous fungal infection and serology was positive for coccidioidomycosis. At the time of diagnosis, the patient was lymphopenic, possibly a sequela of recent COVID-19 infection and which may have contributed to the development of her atypical disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis. Patient was treated with fluconazole for the coccidioidomycosis and continued observation for mild progression of the liposarcoma. On follow-up imaging, the chest wall mass and lung nodules have decreased in size and the patient remains on antifungal treatment. There has been no further increase in the liposarcoma mass. Conclusion: COVID-19 may be associated with increased risk of atypical forms of infectious diseases in cancer patients, which physicians should be aware of before giving systemic treatments for cancer. In endemic regions, co-infection by coccidioidomycosis should be suspected in cases of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection.","Nassif, Elise F.; Maloney, Nolan; Conley, Anthony P.; Keung, Emily Z.",Front Med (Lausanne),445,33

Following footpad infection with ectromelia virus (ECTV), a mouse-specific pathogen, C57BL/6 (B6) mice survive without disease, while B6 mice broadly deficient in IFNAR succumb rapidly. We now show that for survival to ECTV, only hematopoietic cells require IFNAR expression. Survival to ECTV specifically requires IFNAR in both natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes. However, intrinsic IFNAR signaling is not essential for adaptive immune cell responses or to directly protect non-hematopoietic cells such as hepatocytes, which are principal ECTV targets. Mechanistically, IFNAR-deficient NK cells have reduced cytolytic function, while lack of IFNAR in monocytes dampens IFN-I production and hastens virus dissemination. Thus, during a pathogenic viral infection, IFN-I coordinates innate immunity by stimulating monocytes in a positive feedback loop and by inducing NK cell cytolytic function.","Melo-Silva, Carolina R.; Alves-Peixoto, Pedro; Heath, Natasha; Tang, Lingjuan; Montoya, Brian; Knudson, Cory J.; Stotesbury, Colby; Ferez, Maria; Wong, Eric; Sigal, Luis J.",PLoS Pathog,445,22

The determinants for selecting antibody combinations and the mechanism that antibody cocktails prevent viral escape remain unclear. We compared the critical residues in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) used by multiple neutralizing antibodies and cocktails and identified a combination of two antibodies CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 for preventing viral escape. The two antibodies simultaneously bind to non-overlapping epitopes and independently compete for receptor binding. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly escapes from individual antibodies by generating resistant mutations in vitro, but it doesn’t escape from the cocktail due to stronger mutational constraints on RBD-ACE2 interaction and RBD protein folding requirements. We also identified a conserved neutralizing epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for antibody CoV2-12. Treatments with CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 individually and in combination confer protection in mice. These findings provide insights for rational selection and mechanistic understanding of antibody cocktails as candidates for treating COVID-19.","Ku, Zhiqiang; Xie, Xuping; Davidson, Edgar; Ye, Xiaohua; Su, Hang; Menachery, Vineet D.; Li, Yize; Yuan, Zihao; Zhang, Xianwen; Muruato, Antonio E.; i Escuer, Ariadna Grinyo; Tyrell, Breanna; Doolan, Kyle; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Wrapp, Daniel; Bates, Paul F.; McLellan, Jason S.; Weiss, Susan R.; Zhang, Ningyan; Shi, Pei-Yong; An, Zhiqiang",Nat Commun,445,16

Further, a reflection is made of the situation of Dentistry, specifically in the field of Orthodontics in Brazil. The difference between genders is discussed, with the intention to map the progress of women in management and leadership positions, in both the academic and professional fields. DESCRIPTION: In Brazil, within Dentistry and Orthodontics, despite being in a numerical majority, women are still underrepresented in the area of professional leadership. This is true for Research Groups and Research Productivity; an example being the relatively low authorship of publications in a Brazilian journal of Orthodontics. They are also underrepresented as lead presenters at professional meetings, whilst there are also few female Presidents of professional organizations and associations. CONCLUSION: Despite being in a numerical majority, it is also important that women act in a more co-ordinated and consistent manner to achieve greater representation in these areas. The necessary changes in the structure in order to achieve this are not only of women and for women, but they must also involve the whole of society so that leadership, rights and duties are equally distributed between the genders.","QUINTÃO, Cátia Cardoso Abdo; BARRETO, Luísa Schubach da Costa; de MENEZES, Luciane Macedo",Dental press journal of orthodontics,445,16

Polymerase chain reaction and serological testing platforms are not the only actors impacted by the crisis, transfusion services are facing important difficulties. A positive direct antiglobulin test is frequently observed for patients encountering COVID-19. Patients with severe symptoms may develop anaemia and become good candidates for blood transfusions. The interpretation of a positive direct antiglobulin test for patients recently transfused and suffering from COVID-19 is complex. The differentiation between COVID-19 induced antibodies and possible associated transfusion alloantibodies is therefore crucial. In this context, the elution technique incorporated in an appropriate decision-making process plays its full role. This intricate topic is presented through a case report followed by literature review and finally decision-making process for COVID-19 patients necessitating red blood cells administration.","Cabo, Julien; Brochier, Alice; Saussoy, Pascale; Dievoet, Marie-Astrid van; Capirchio, Lena; Delire, Bénédicte; Deneys, Véronique",Transfus Clin Biol,445,24

Based on the reactivity patterns of these mutants with a panel of MAbs, at least five non-overlapping antigenic sites were defined using eight MAbs which recognized seven distinct epitopes on the H9 HA molecule. Based on the reactivity patterns with the panel of monoclonal antibodies, 21 H9N2 virus strains isolated from birds and mammals were divided into 7 antigenically distinct groups. The present findings indicate that it is important to monitor the antigenic variation in H9 influenza viruses. The panel of MAbs in the present study, thus, should be useful for detailed antigenic analysis of the H9 HAs for epidemiological studies, the selection of vaccine strains, and diagnosis.","Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Kishida, Noriko; Isoda, Norikazu; Kida, Hiroshi",Arch Virol,445,16

However, awareness of the presence of illness can cause people to change their behaviour by, for example, staying at home and avoiding social contacts. Such changes can be used to control epidemics but they exact an economic cost. Our aim is to study the costs and benefits of using individual-based social distancing undertaken by healthy individuals as a form of control. METHODS: Our model is a standard SIR model superimposed on a spatial network, without and with addition of small-world interactions. Disease spread is controlled by allowing susceptible individuals to temporarily reduce their social contacts in response to the presence of infection within their local neighbourhood. We ascribe an economic cost to the loss of social contacts, and weigh this against the economic benefit gained by reducing the impact of the epidemic. We study the sensitivity of the results to two key parameters, the individuals’ attitude to risk and the size of the awareness neighbourhood. RESULTS: Depending on the characteristics of the epidemic and on the relative economic importance of making contacts versus avoiding infection, the optimal control is one of two extremes: either to adopt a highly cautious control, thereby suppressing the epidemic quickly by drastically reducing contacts as soon as disease is detected; or else to forego control and allow the epidemic to run its course. The worst outcome arises when control is attempted, but not cautiously enough to cause the epidemic to be suppressed. The next main result comes from comparing the size of the neighbourhood of which individuals are aware to that of the neighbourhood within which transmission can occur. The control works best when these sizes match and is particularly ineffective when the awareness neighbourhood is smaller than the infection neighbourhood. The results are robust with respect to inclusion of long-range, small-world links which destroy the spatial structure, regardless of whether individuals can or cannot control them. However, addition of many non-local links eventually makes control ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for the design of control strategies using social distancing: a control that is too weak or based upon inaccurate knowledge, may give a worse outcome than doing nothing.","Maharaj, Savi; Kleczkowski, Adam",BMC Public Health,445,26

We used biophysical and crystallographic data and an array of classical molecular mechanics and quantum mechanical techniques, including automated docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, linear-scaling DFT, QM/MM, and interactive MD in virtual reality, to investigate the molecular features underlying recognition of the natural Mpro substrates. Analyses of the subsite interactions of modelled 11-residue cleavage site peptides, ligands from high-throughput crystallography, and designed covalently binding inhibitors were performed. Modelling studies reveal remarkable conservation of hydrogen bonding patterns of the natural Mpro substrates, particularly on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond. They highlight the critical role of interactions beyond the immediate active site in recognition and catalysis, in particular at the P2/S2 sites. The binding modes of the natural substrates, together with extensive interaction analyses of inhibitor and fragment binding to Mpro, reveal new opportunities for inhibition. Building on our initial Mpro-substrate models, computational mutagenesis scanning was employed to design peptides with improved affinity and which inhibit Mpro competitively. The combined results provide new insight useful for the development of Mpro inhibitors.","Chan, H. T.

Although several vaccine candidates have received emergency use authorization (EUA), there are still a limited number of vaccine doses available. To increase the number of vaccinated individuals, there are ongoing discussions about administering partial vaccine doses, but there is still a paucity of data on how vaccine fractionation affects vaccine-elicited immunity. We performed studies in mice to understand how the priming dose of a SARS CoV-2 vaccine affects long-term immunity to SARS CoV-2. We first primed C57BL/6 mice with an adenovirus-based vaccine encoding SARS CoV-2 spike protein (Ad5-SARS-2 spike), similar to that used in the CanSino and Sputnik V vaccines. This prime was administered either at a low dose (LD) of 10(6) PFU or at a standard dose (SD) of 10(9) PFU, followed by a SD boost in all mice four weeks later. As expected, the LD prime induced lower immune responses relative to the SD prime. However, the LD prime elicited immune responses that were qualitatively superior, and upon boosting, mice that were initially primed with a LD exhibited significantly more potent immune responses. Overall, these data demonstrate that limiting the priming dose of a SARS CoV-2 vaccine may confer unexpected benefits. These findings may be useful for improving vaccine availability and for rational vaccine design.","Sanchez, Sarah; Palacio, Nicole; Dangi, Tanushree; Ciucci, Thomas; Penaloza-MacMaster, Pablo",bioRxiv,445,20

In this work, various Deep CNN based approaches are explored for detecting the presence of COVID19 from chest CT images. A decision fusion based approach is also proposed, which combines predictions from multiple individual models, to produce a final prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed decision fusion based approach is able to achieve above 86% results across all the performance metrics under consideration, with average AUROC and F1-Score being 0.883 and 0.867, respectively.

Wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective decontamination of feed mill surfaces; however, this is not practical on a commercial feed production scale. Another potential mitigation strategy would be using chemically treated rice hulls flushed through the feed manufacturing equipment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) or formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush batches as potential chemical mitigation strategies for PEDV during feed manufacturing. Feed without evidence of PEDV RNA contamination was inoculated with PEDV. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, this feed had a cycle threshold (Ct) = 30.2 and was confirmed infective in bioassay. After manufacturing the PEDV-positive feed, untreated rice hulls, formaldehyde-treated rice hulls, 2% MCFA- (a 1:1:1 blend of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acid) treated rice hulls, or 10% MCFA-treated rice hulls were flushed through laboratory scale mixers. For the untreated rice hulls, 3 of 6 samples had detectable PEDV RNA, whereas 1 of 6 formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush samples and 2 of 6 of the 2% MCFA rice hull flush samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, PEDV RNA was not detected in any of the 10% MCFA rice hull flush samples. Then, rice hulls treated with 10% MCFA were mixed and discharged through a production scale mixer and bucket elevator following PEDV-positive feed. No rice hull flush or feed samples from the mixer following chemically treated rice hull flush had detectible PEDV RNA. However, one 10% MCFA rice hull sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout had detectible PEDV RNA. Dust collected following mixing of PEDV contaminated feed had detectable PEDV RNA (Ct = 29.4) and was infectious. However, dust collected immediately after the 10% MCFA rice hull flush batch had a reduced quantity of PEDV RNA (Ct = 33.7) and did not cause infection. Overall, the use of rice hull flushes effectively reduced the quantity of detectible RNA present after mixing a batch of PEDV-positive feed. Chemical treatment of rice hulls with formaldehyde or 10% MCFA provided additional reduction in detectible RNA. Finally, dust collected after manufacturing PEDV-inoculated feed has the potential to serve as a vector for PEDV transmission.","Gebhardt, Jordan T; Cochrane, Roger A; Woodworth, Jason C; Jones, Cassandra K; Niederwerder, Megan C; Muckey, Mary B; Stark, Charles R; Tokach, Mike D; DeRouchey, Joel M; Goodband, Robert D; Bai, Jianfa; Gauger, Philip C; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Jianqiang; Main, Rodger G; Dritz, Steve S",Journal of Animal Science,445,7

The goals of the research study were to (1) understand the public health aspects of sickle cell disease, and (2) understand the overlap between public health aspects and clinical aspects that can inform research and practice beneficial to stakeholders in sickle cell disease management. The approach involved the construction of datasets from textual data sources produced by experts on sickle cell disease including from landmark publications published in 2020 on sickle cell disease in the United States. The interactive analytics of the integrated datasets that we produced identified that community-based approaches are common to both public health and clinical aspects of sickle cell disease. An interactive visualization that we produced can aid the understanding of the alignment of governmental organizations to recommendations for addressing sickle cell disease in the United States. From a global perspective, the interactive analytics of the integrated datasets can support the knowledge transfer stage of the SICKLE recommendations (Skills transfer, Increasing self-efficacy, Coordination, Knowledge transfer, Linking to adult services, and Evaluating readiness) for effective pediatric to adult transition care for patients with sickle cell disease.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six sequences were monophyletic and clustered in lineage D of Betacoronavirus. The extension of two fragments allowed us to classify our sequences within the RdRp Group Unit defined for Kenyan Betacoronavirus from the same host species.

In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041).

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the HIV care continuum in Jiangsu province, China. METHODS: Data on newly diagnosed HIV persons for analysis were retrieved from Chinas’ web-based Comprehensive Response Information Management System (CRIMS) for HIV/AIDS from 2016 to 2020. We recorded data for the first 3 months (January to March, 2020) of strictly implementing COVID-19 measures from publicly available disease databases of the Jiangsu provincial Health Committee. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and exponential smoothing in forecasting the parameters. Subgroup differences were accessed using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Compared to the estimated proportions, the HIV testing rates decreased by 49.0% (919,938) in the first three months of implementing COVID-19 measures. Of an estimated 1555 new HIV diagnosis expected in the same period, only 63.0% (980) new diagnoses were recorded. According to actual data recorded during the said period, 980 positively tested persons received confirmatory tests, of which 71.4% (700) were reportedly linked to care. And only 49.5% (235) out of the expected 475 newly diagnosed HIV persons received CD4 cell count testing. Meanwhile 91.6% (208) of newly diagnosed HIV persons who received CD4 count tests reportedly initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to the 227 expected.

The objective of the present study was to determine the nutritional immunity information-seeking behaviour during COVID-19 in India. DESIGN: Google Trends (GTs) data on relevant COVID-19 and nutritional topics were systematically selected and retrieved. Data on newly reported COVID-19 cases were also examined on a daily basis. The cross-correlation method was used to determine the correlation coefficient between the selected terms and daily new COVID-19 cases, and the joinpoint regression models were utilised to measure monthly percent change (MPC) in relative search volumes (RSV). SETTING: Online. PARTICIPANTS: People using Google search during the period 1 January 2020–31 August 2020 in India. RESULTS: The date of peak searches can be attributed to the COVID-19 guidelines announcement dates. All the nutritional terms showed a significant increase in average monthly percentage change. The higher than the average daily rise in COVID-19 cases leads to a higher than average increase in RSV of nutritional terms with the greatest association after 14–27 d. The highest mean relative search volume for nutritional terms was from Southern India (49·34 ± 7·43), and the lowest was from Western India (31·10 ± 6·30). CONCLUSION: There was a significant rise in the Google searches of nutritional immunity topics during COVID-19 in India.

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (CINHAL, MEDLINE and Scopus) were searched to identify primary studies up to April 2021. METHODS: Papers reporting qualitative or quantitative studies exploring the subjective experience and/or preferences of nurses around shift patterns were considered, with no restrictions on methods, date or setting. Key study features were extracted including setting, design and results. Findings were organised thematically by key features of shift work. RESULTS: 30 relevant papers were published between 1993 and 2021. They contained mostly qualitative studies where nurses reflected on their experience and preferences around shift patterns. The studies reported on three major aspects of shift work: shift work per se (i.e. the mere fact of working shift), shift length, and time of shift. Across all three aspects of shift work, nurses strive to deliver high quality of care despite facing intense working conditions, experiencing physical and mental fatigue or exhaustion. Preference for or adaptation to a specific shift pattern is facilitated when nurses are consulted before its implementation or have a certain autonomy to self-roster. Days off work tend to mitigate the adverse effects of working (short, long, early or night) shifts. How shift work and patterns impact on experiences and preferences seems to also vary according to nurses’ personal characteristics and circumstances (e.g. age, caring responsibilities, years of experience). CONCLUSIONS: Shift patterns are often organised in ways that are detrimental to nurses’ health and wellbeing, their job performance, and the patient care they provide.

Once the RNA molecules have successfully entered the target cells, they could inhibit the expression of specific gene sequence through RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism and generate therapeutic effects. The biggest obstacle to translating siRNA therapy from the laboratories into the clinics is delivery. An ideal delivery agent should protect the siRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape inside the cells, with negligible toxicity. Lung targeting could be achieved by systemic delivery or pulmonary delivery. The latter route of administration could potentially enhance siRNA retention in the lungs and reduce systemic toxic effects. However the presence of mucus, the mucociliary clearance actions and the high degree branching of the airways present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery. The delivery systems need to be designed carefully in order to maximize the siRNA deposition to the diseased area of the airways. In most of the pulmonary siRNA therapy studies in vivo, siRNA was delivered either intratracheally or intranasally. Very limited work was done on the formulation of siRNA for inhalation which is believed to be the direction for future development. This review focuses on the latest development of pulmonary delivery of siRNA for the treatment of various lung diseases.","Lam, Jenny Ka-Wing; Liang, Wanling; Chan, Hak-Kim",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,445,15

However, most of these studies were of low-to-moderate quality and many were based on convenience samples or used mental health measures with low validity, or both. Consequently, it has been difficult to draw conclusions. METHODS: Both the 2020 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (SCMH) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (2015-2019) used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults aged 18 or older. The prevalence of MDD was compared between the SCMH and the CCHS. Risk and protective factors for MDD in the SCMH were examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Based on SCMH data, 15.2% (95% CI: 14.2-16.2) of Canadians screened positive for MDD. The prevalence of MDD was more than two times higher in the SCMH (during COVID-19) than in the CCHS (predating COVID-19). In bivariate analysis, Canadians reporting five or more COVID-19-related risk factors were close to 30 times more likely to have MDD than those reporting no risk factors. Mastery and a sense of community belonging were protective factors for MDD. CONCLUSION: After remaining stable for two decades, the prevalence of depression among Canadians increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Ongoing monitoring of this common condition associated with major morbidity is vital to determine if elevated levels of MDD persist as we progress through and beyond future waves of COVID-19.","Shields, Margot; Tonmyr, Lil; Gonzalez, Andrea; Weeks, Murray; Park, Su-Bin; Robert, Anne-Marie; Blair, Dawn-Li; MacMillan, Harriet L",Health Promot.

Virus cell entry is mediated through a protein‐protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein and angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A series of stapled peptide ACE2 peptidomimetics based on the ACE2 interaction motif were designed to bind the coronavirus S‐protein RBD and inhibit binding to the human ACE2 receptor. The peptidomimetics were assessed for antiviral activity in an array of assays including a neutralization pseudovirus assay, immunofluorescence (IF) assay and in‐vitro fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. However, none of the peptidomimetics showed activity in these assays, suggesting that an enhanced binding interface is required to outcompete ACE2 for S‐protein RBD binding and prevent virus internalization.","Morgan, Danielle C.; Morris, Caroline; Mahindra, Amit; Blair, Connor M.; Tejeda, Gonzalo; Herbert, Imogen; Turnbull, Matthew L.; Lieber, Gauthier; Willett, Brian J.; Logan, Nicola; Smith, Brian; Tobin, Andrew B.; Bhella, David; Baillie, George; Jamieson, Andrew G.",Pept Sci (Hoboken),445,24

SARS-CoV-2 was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-CoV. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral entry, reproduction and transmission.

SARS-CoV-2 is novel to most parts of the world including USA and the effect on normally prevalent viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at BSWH, Temple TX. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time RT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. Results: More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED/inpatients were tested positive. Higher rate of infection (6.9%) were noted in the patients belonging to age group 25-34 years and least number of positive cases were noted in <25 years old (2%) group. The TX State county specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a sudden decrease in the occurrence of other infections due to seasonal viruses, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness, about SARS-CoV-2, among general public. Authors would also like to share a small study on SARS-CoV-2 serological assay for the detection of IgG antibodies. Conclusions: This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.","Mutnal, M. B.; Arroliga, A.

To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community. Here we describe a safe, affordable protocol for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. Our targeted sequencing approach revealed the presence of mutations associated with several Variants of Concern at appreciable frequencies. Our work demonstrates that wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing can inform surveillance efforts monitoring the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and detect the appearance of novel emerging variants more cheaply, safely, and efficiently than the sequencing of individual clinical samples.","Smyth, D.

We aimed to the discovery and classification of severity subgroups using symptoms and comorbidities. RESULTS: Cases from the 2 countries with the highest prevalence were divided into separate subgroups with distinct severity manifestations. This variability can reduce the representativeness of training data with respect the model target populations and increase model complexity at risk of overfitting.

The Abbott Global Surveillance program monitors severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and their impact on diagnostic test performance. Objectives: To evaluate the capacity of Abbott molecular, antigen, and serologic assays to detect the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and the P.1 variants. Study design: Virus variant culture stock dilutions (B.1.1.7, BEI NR-54011; B.1.351, BEI NR-54008 and 54009; P.1, BEI NR-54982) and clinical samples from patients with confirmed B.1.1.7 variant infection were run on the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19, m2000 RealTime SARS-CoV-2, Alinity m SARS-CoV-2, and Alinity m Resp-4-Plex molecular assays; the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card and Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device; and the ARCHITECT/Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and AdviseDx IgM assays, Panbio COVID-19 IgG assay, and ARCHITECT/Alinity i AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay. Results: Cultured virus stocks and B.1.1.7 clinical samples were detected with molecular, antigen, and serologic assays in the expected ranges, confirming in silico predictions. The ratio between genome equivalents (GE) and calculated median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) were 31- to 83-fold higher for B.1.1.7 cultures compared to B.1.351 and P.1 cultures, demonstrating that GE are more consistent units between cultures than TCID50. Conclusions: Abbott molecular and antigen assays effectively detect B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variant infections and Abbott serologic assays detect B.1.1.7 antibodies in patient sera.

The antivaccine movement uses Facebook to promote messages on the alleged dangers and consequences of vaccinating, leading to a reluctance to immunize against preventable communicable diseases. OBJECTIVE: We would like to know more about the messages these websites are sharing via social media that can influence readers and consumers. What messages is the public receiving on Facebook about immunization? What content (news articles, testimonials, videos, scientific studies) is being promoted? METHODS: We proposed using a social media audit tool and 3 categorical lists to capture information on websites and posts, respectively. The keywords “vaccine,” “vaccine truth,” and “anti-vax” were entered in the Facebook search bar. A Facebook page was examined if it had between 2500 and 150,000 likes. Data about beliefs, calls to action, and testimonials were recorded from posts and listed under the categories Myths, Truths, and Consequences. Website data were entered in a social media audit template. RESULTS: Users’ posts reflected fear and vaccine hesitancy resulting from the alleged dangers of immunization featured on the website links. Vaccines were blamed for afflictions such as autism, cancer, and infertility. Mothers shared testimonies on alleged consequences their children suffered due to immunization, which have influenced other parents to not vaccinate their children. Users denied the current measles outbreaks in the United States to be true, retaliating against the government in protests for fabricating news. CONCLUSIONS: Some Facebook messages encourage prevailing myths about the safety and consequences of vaccines and likely contribute to parents’ vaccine hesitancy. Deeply concerning is the mistrust social media has the potential to cast upon the relationship between health care providers and the public. A grasp of common misconceptions can help support health care provider practice.","Dhaliwal, Dhamanpreet; Mannion, Cynthia",JMIR Public Health Surveill,445,20

It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n = 6) and B (n = 4) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n = 83). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3 h and 6 h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was <20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway. We have developed a sensitive systems-level proteomic assay for the systematic quantification of naso-oro-pharyngeal proteins. The assay will advance mechanistic studies of respiratory pathology, by providing an untargeted and hypothesis-free approach of examining the airway proteome.","Sande, Charles J.; Mutunga, Martin; Muteti, Jacqueline; Berkley, James A.; Nokes, D.

AIM: To identify, review and evaluate international proning and skin care guidelines and make an inventory of commonly used equipment and training resources. DESIGN: A gap analysis methodology was applied. METHODS: 1) Comprehensive search and evaluation of proning and skin care guidelines, 2) extensive search and listing equipment and educational resources, and 3) international consultation with 11 experts (8 countries). DATA SOURCES: A variety of sources researched through July 2021 were used to identify relevant literature: (1) scientific literature databases and clinical trials registries, (2) intensive care and wound care associations, (3) healthcare organisations, (4) guideline development organisations, and (5) the Google search engine. Eleven international experts reviewed the literature and provided insights in two, 2-h online sessions. FINDINGS: The search yielded 24 guidelines.

In addition, as medical students were dismissed from clinical environments, their capacity to build community and promote professional identity formation was compromised. METHODS: A synchronous, online course entitled Life Cycle of a Pandemic was developed using a modified guided inquiry approach. Students met daily for 2 weeks in groups of 15 to 18 with a process facilitator. During the first week, students reported on lessons learned from past pandemics; in the second week, students discussed ethical concerns surrounding COVID-19 clinical trials, heard from physicians who provided patient care in the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics, and concluded with an opportunity for reflection. Following the course, students were asked to complete an anonymous, voluntary survey to assess their perceptions of the course. RESULTS: With a response rate of 69%, an overwhelming majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that learning about historical pandemics helped them understand COVID-19 (72, 99%). The course successfully helped students understand current and potential COVID-19 management strategies as 66 (90%) agreed or strongly agreed they developed a better understanding of nonpharmacological interventions and new pharmacological treatments. Students also gained insight into the experiences of healthcare providers who cared for patients with HIV and COVID-19. Qualitative analysis of the open-ended comments yielded 5 main themes: critical appraisal of resources, responsibility of the physician, humanism, knowledge related to pandemics, and learning from history. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of the COVID-19 crisis illustrated curricular gaps that could be remedied by introducing the history and biology of pandemics earlier in the curriculum. It was also apparent that learners need more practice in critically reviewing literature and comparing scientific literature with lay press. The flexible format of the course promotes the development of future iterations that could cover evolving topics related to COVID-19. The course could also be repurposed for a graduate or continuing medical education audience.","Willey, Joanne M; Olvet, Doreen M; Bird, Jeffrey B; Brenner, Judith M",J Med Educ Curric Dev,445,33

Here we compared trends in the quantity and variety of SCI literature relating to certain important pathogenic microorganisms published by scientists from United States and China from 1996 to 2010 by searching the Science Citation Index database. The pathogenic microorganisms in this study comprise two categories of pathogens: Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Ebola virus, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which belong to biodefense-associated pathogens (BDAPs) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS coronavirus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza virus, which belong to the commonly encountered health-threatening pathogens. Our results showed that the United States (US) published much more SCI literature on these pathogens than China. Furthermore, literature on BDAPs published by scientists from the US has increased sharply since 2002. However, the numbers of literature relating to CEHTPs from China has demonstrated a gradual increase from 1996 to 2010.

All the samples were analyzed by specialized microbiologists. A total of 117 out of 448 individuals (26%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 99 (85%) returned positive Antigen test results. There were 18 Antigen negative cases with positive RT-PCR results. Accordingly, concordance between RT-PCR and Antigen test results was acceptable (K index, 0.89; 95% IC 0.8455–0.9345). Overall sensitivity and specificity of Antigen test was 85% and 100%, respectively. When defining RT-PCR CT positivity on a cut-off value of 35, LFA sensitivity was 90%. In case a cut-off value of 30 was used, LFA would increase up to 99%. In this real-life evaluation of the PANBIO™ COVID-Ag rapid test, the assay reliably identified SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with low CT-values by RT-PCR. False negative results were observed only at high CT-values, meaning low viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples.","Escrivá, Begoña Fuster; Mochón, María Dolores Ocete; González, Rafael Medina; García, Carme Salvador; Pla, Ana Tornero; Ricart, Amparo Sahuquillo; García, Mercedes Melero; Aranda, Irene Tur; García, Fernando Grossón; Cardona, Concepción Gimeno",J Clin Virol,445,16

Ophthalmologists are at daily personal risk of acquiring and transmitting the virus. Implementation of official practical and protective guidelines can be challenging and is often absent. The purpose of this study was to describe the status of ophthalmology practice in Israel, at the early stages of the outbreak. METHODS: A 17-item questionnaire was distributed to ophthalmologists practicing in Israel. Data was obtained regarding demographics and clinical and surgical practice during the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven ophthalmologists completed the survey from all regions of Israel. The survey was distributed during the early stages of the outbreak. At this time, no official government guidelines were in place. Most respondents reported no reduction of elective clinic visits and surgeries and no utilization of triage questionnaires. COVID-19 guidelines were reportedly promulgated to hospital ophthalmologists but not to community and private physicians. Personal protective equipment (PPE) measures were reportedly utilized; however, many respondents often acquired them individually. A majority of respondents advocated that healthcare institutions limit clinic and surgery services to emergency services. CONCLUSION: During the critical early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, this study emphasizes the delay in development of emergency guidelines, necessary to protect patients and ophthalmologists from this highly transmissible disease.","Wasser, Lauren M.; Assayag, Elishai; Tsessler, Maria; Weill, Yishay; Becker-Cohen, Michal; Zadok, David",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,445,1

While the medical community understands the mode of viral transmission, less is known about how long viral shedding occurs once viral symptoms have resolved. Objective: To determine how long the SARS-CoV-2 remains detectable following self-reporting of viral symptom resolution. Design: A cohort of 86 previously SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were re-tested for proof of viral recovery by nasal swab and nucleic acid amplification less than 28 days after self-reported symptom resolution. Setting: A tertiary care center in a mid-size city utilizing a drive-through SAR-CoV-2 testing center. Participants: 86 previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals less than 28 days after self-reported resolution of symptoms evaluated as potential donors for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Intervention: Participants underwent nasopharyngeal sampling and subsequent nucleic acid amplification for SARS-CoV-2 genes. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretions detected by rtPCR. Results: 11/86 (13%) previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 subjects were still positive at a median of 19 days (range 12-24 days) after symptom resolution. Older patients were more likely to be test-positive, and older positive patients had lower rtPCR CT values. Test-positive patients were not significantly different from test-negative patients with respect to days since symptom recovery. Conclusions and Resolution: These results underscore the necessity of testing COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors less than 28 days after symptom resolution and suggests that COVID-19 positive patients may need to remain in quarantine beyond the recommended two weeks following ""recovery.""","Hartman, William R; Hess, Aaron S; Connor, Joseph",,445,1

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a pathogenic avian Gammacoronavirus of significant importance to the global poultry industry, has been shown to induce the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), zippered endoplasmic reticulum (zER) and tethered vesicles, known as spherules. These membrane rearrangements are virally induced; however, it remains unclear which viral proteins are responsible. In this study, membrane rearrangements induced when expressing viral non-structural proteins (nsps) from two different strains of IBV were compared. Three non-structural transmembrane proteins, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, were expressed in cells singularly or in combination and the effects on cellular membranes investigated using electron microscopy and electron tomography. In contrast to previously studied coronaviruses, IBV nsp4 alone is necessary and sufficient to induce membrane pairing; however, expression of the transmembrane proteins together was not sufficient to fully recapitulate DMVs. This indicates that although nsp4 is able to singularly induce membrane pairing, further viral or host factors are required in order to fully assemble IBV replicative structures. This study highlights further differences in the mechanism of membrane rearrangements between members of the coronavirus family.","Doyle, Nicole; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Simpson, Jennifer; Hawes, Philippa C.; Mantell, Judith; Verkade, Paul; Alrashedi, Hasan; Maier, Helena J.",Viruses,445,1

Confirmatory testing reduces overdiagnosis and nosocomial infection and enables real-world estimates of test specificity and positive predictive value. This study estimates these parameters to evaluate the impact of confirmatory testing, and to improve clinical diagnosis, epidemiological estimation and interpretation of vaccine trials. METHODS: Over one month, we took all respiratory samples from our laboratory with a patient’s first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay or in-house RT-PCR platform), and repeated testing using two platforms. Samples were categorised by source, and by whether clinical details suggested COVID-19 or corroborative testing from another laboratory. We estimated specificity and positive predictive value using maximum likelihood-based approaches. RESULTS: Of 19,597 samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 107. 52 corresponded to first-time detection (0.27% of tests on samples without previous detection); further testing detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA ≥1 time (“confirmed”) in 29 (56%), and failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA (“not confirmed”) in 23 (44%). Depending upon assumed parameters, point estimates for specificity and positive predictive value were 99.91%–99.98% and 61.8%–89.8% respectively using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay, and 97.4%–99.1% and 20.1%–73.8% respectively using an in-house assay. CONCLUSIONS: Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 is highly specific. Nevertheless, when prevalence is low a significant proportion of initially positive results fail to confirm and confirmatory testing substantially reduces false positive detections. Omitting additional testing in samples with higher prior detection probabilities focuses testing where clinically impactful and minimises delay.","Skittrall, Jordan P.; Wilson, Michael; Smielewska, Anna A.; Parmar, Surendra; Fortune, Mary D.; Sparkes, Dominic; Curran, Martin D.; Zhang, Hongyi; Jalal, Hamid",Clin Microbiol Infect,445,1

However, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment against the newly emerged coronavirus and identifying the available therapeutics as soon as possible is critical for the response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC), a well-known prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in China, has been widely used in treating upper respiratory tract infections and acute lung injury, owing to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite the definite evidence of effective use of SFJDC in the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, the underlying action mechanism remains unknown. Currently, a systematic study integrated with absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation, target prediction, network construction and functional bioinformatics analyses is proposed to illustrate the potential immune and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SFJDC against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, to further validate the reliability of the interactions and binding affinities between drugs and targets, docking, Molecular dynamics Simulations (MD) simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area approach (MM-PBSA) calculations were carried out. The results demonstrate that SFJDC regulates the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory related targets on multiple pathways through its active ingredients, showing the potential anti-novel coronavirus effect. Overall, the work can provide a better understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of SFJDC for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from multi-scale perspectives, and may also offer a valuable clue for developing novel pharmaceutical strategies to control the current coronavirus.","Tao, Zhengang; Zhang, Lei; Friedemann, Thomas; Yang, Guangshan; Li, Jinhu; Wen, Yaocai; Wang, Jinghui; Shen, Aizong",J Funct Foods,445,3

This paper aims to lay the groundwork for a more systematic discussion of the mitigation of inductive risk. In particular, I consider two approaches to the mitigation of inductive risk—the individualistic approach, which maintains that individual scientists are primarily responsible for the mitigation of inductive risk, and the socialized approach, according to which the responsibility for the mitigation of inductive risk should be more broadly distributed across the scientific community or, even more broadly, across society. I review some of the argument for and against the two approaches and introduce two new problems for the individualistic approach, which I call the problem of precautionary cascades and the problem of exogenous inductive risk, and I argue that a socialized approach might alleviate each of these problems.","Contessa, Gabriele",Eur J Philos Sci,445,6

Such a deterministic nature in ANNs causes the limitations of using ANNs for medical diagnosis, law problems, and portfolio management in which not only discovering the prediction but also the uncertainty of the prediction is essentially required. In order to address such a problem, we propose a predictive probabilistic neural network model, which corresponds to a different manner of using the generator in the conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that has been routinely used for conditional sample generation. By reversing the input and output of ordinary cGAN, the model can be successfully used as a predictive model; moreover, the model is robust against noises since adversarial training is employed. In addition, to measure the uncertainty of predictions, we introduce the entropy and relative entropy for regression problems and classification problems, respectively. The proposed framework is applied to stock market data and an image classification task. As a result, the proposed framework shows superior estimation performance, especially on noisy data; moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework can properly estimate the uncertainty of predictions.","Lee, Minhyeok; Seok, Junhee",Sensors (Basel),445,16

In fact, studies investigating the effects of the lockdown on problem gamblers (PGs) under treatment are missing. The aims of this study were to analyze patients’ gambling behavior and craving during the lockdown and to conduct a comparison between gambling disorder (GD) symptoms at the beginning of the treatment and during lockdown.

Data were collected through a semi-structured telephone interview conducted by healthcare professionals. Participants were 135 PGs under treatment (109 males, mean age = 50.07). Results showed that most PGs achieved a significant improvement in their quality of life, with less gambling behavior, GD symptoms, and lower craving. No shift toward online gambling and very limited shift towards other potential addictive and excessive behaviors occurred.

In a mixed-methods study, 15 problem-centred interviews and a web-based cross-sectional survey (N = 171) were conducted with outpatient caregivers working in Northern Germany. Interviewees reported partially poorer eating behaviour, higher coffee consumption, lower physical activity, skipping breaks more often and less sleep duration and quality during the pandemic. Some quantitative findings indicate the same tendencies. A majority of participants were smokers and reported higher stress perception due to the pandemic. Preventive behaviour, such as wearing PPE or hand hygiene, was increased among interviewees compared to the pre-pandemic period. Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect outpatient caregivers’ health behaviour, e.g., eating/drinking behaviour and physical activity. Therefore, employers in outpatient care should develop workplace health promotion measures to support their employees in conducting more health-promoting behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mojtahedzadeh, Natascha; Neumann, Felix Alexander; Rohwer, Elisabeth; Nienhaus, Albert; Augustin, Matthias; Harth, Volker; Zyriax, Birgit-Christiane; Mache, Stefanie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,445,16

The everyday activity of primary and hospital care was significantly altered by the introduction of telephone consultations, which reduce the number of visits to health centres or hospitals and are still relevant today in the face of successive waves of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To analyse whether population confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the dispensing of medications in community pharmacies and the associated spending during the period March-July 2020 in Andalusia (Spain). METHODS: A time series analysis applying econometric model analysis techniques to confirm or rule out whether the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the dispensing of medications by community pharmacies and the associated expenditures. The variables used were the number of medication containers dispensed by community pharmacies (charged to the public funds of the Spanish National Health System) and the expenditure on prescription drugs, both in relation to the population. The analysis was performed within the region of Andalusia, which has 8,464,441 inhabitants. RESULTS: The data obtained from the time series confirmed that there were no significant differences during the studied period between the number of medication containers actually dispensed and the number that would have been expected to be dispensed according to the trend in this variable for the sample period. The expenditure results followed the same pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The health crisis produced by the COVID-19 lockdown had no impact on medication consumption in Andalusia.","Florido Alba, Francisco; GarcíA-Agua, Nuria; MartíN Reyes, Ángel; Clavero Barranquero, Antonio; GarcíA Ruiz, Antonio J.",Pharm Pract (Granada),445,29

The application of methodologies based on lean principles in the organizational system of an educational institution, causes an impact on the demands of organizational efficiency, where innovation and continuous improvement mark the path to success. The Lean 6S methodology, based on the development of six phases, guarantees, thanks to the impact of all its phases and especially of three of them: cleaning, standardize and safety, the control of the health risk against SARS-CoV-2. This guarantee is achieved through the permanent review of safety in the workplace. The areas of selected implementation to verify the effect have been the essential spaces for the development of the teaching activity: center accesses, learning rooms and practical laboratories. The laboratories are adapted to the security and organization conditions that are required in the regulations required by the Occupational Risk Prevention Services against exposure to SARS-CoV-2, since the appropriate protective equipment for the risk level is reviewed, the ordering of the workstations, the class attendance through the shifts organization and the rearrangement of the common places where the maintenance of a minimum interpersonal safety distance between the teaching staff, auxiliary services and students is guaranteed. The effort of the teaching staff in terms of following the established rules is notably increased. To balance this dedication, it is necessary to increase and rely on auxiliary personnel who guarantee rules compliance control in different spaces than the classroom and the laboratory.","Jiménez, Mariano; Romero, Luis; Fernández, Jon; Espinosa, María del Mar; Domínguez, Manuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,445,20

Métodos: Estudio observacional sobre una cohorte de 418 pacientes ingresados en tres hospitales comarcales de Cataluña (España). Como resultados primarios se estudiaron la evolución de la SAFI en las primeras 48 horas de tratamiento y el tiempo hasta el alta. Los resultados se compararon entre pacientes tratados y no tratados con glucocorticoides (metilprednisolona 1mg/kg/día o dexametasona 20-40mg/día), mediante el análisis sub-cohortes emparejadas por múltiples factores clínicos y pronósticos, así como mediante modelos multivariantes de Cox, ajustados por diversos factores pronósticos. El uso simultáneo de diferentes tratamientos para la COVID-19 fue tenido en cuenta, tanto en el emparejamiento de sub-cohortes, como en la regresión de COX. Resultados: Hubo 187 pacientes con glucocorticoides; de ellos, 25 pacientes pudieron ser emparejados con un número equivalente de pacientes control. En las sub-cohortes emparejadas, no se apreció diferencia en el tiempo hasta el alta (logrank: p=0.291), ni en el cambio en la SAFI a las 48 horas desde la basal (glucocorticoides: -0.04; controles: +0.37 p=0.095).

Objective: To analyze whether there is an association between the use glucocorticoids at high doses, and the evolution of saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SAFI) or time to discharge, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: This was an observational study on a cohort of 418 patients admitted to three regional hospitals in Catalonia, Spain. As primary outcomes, we studied the evolution of SAFI in the first 48 hours of treatment and the time to discharge. The results were compared between patients treated and untreated with glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1mg/kg/day o dexamethasone 20-40mg/day) through sub-cohort analyses matched for multiple clinical and prognostic factors, as well as through Cox multivariate models adjusted for prognostic factors. The simultaneous use of different treatments for COVID-19 was taken into account, both in sub-cohorts matching and in COX regression. Results: There were 187 patients treated with glucocorticoids; of these, 25 patients could be matched with an equivalent number of control patients. In the analysis of these matched subcohorts, no significant difference was observed in time to discharge (logrank: p=0.291) or the increment in SAFI at 48 hours of treatment (glucocorticoides: -0.04; controls: +0.37 p=0.095). Multivariate models using Cox regression showed a significantly longer time to discharge in patients treated with corticosteroids (hazard ratio 7.26 IC95%: 3.30 - 15.95).

A few pilot studies have investigated COVID-19 infections in NMOSD, but few studies have addressed disease activity and immune status of these patients during the pandemic. We carried out a cross-sectional study to examine immune status, relapses, and COVID-19 infections in a cohort of NMOSD patients using an electronic patient registry (MSNMOBase) for multiple sclerosis and related disorders. An online questionnaire was administered to all NMOSD patients in the registry from January 1, 2011, to June 1, 2020. Clinical demographic characteristics, immune status, relapses, treatments, COVID-19 infections, and preventive measures were evaluated. Of the 752 registered patients, 535 (71.1%) with qualified data were included. A total of 486 used preventive therapies during the pandemic, including mycophenolate mofetil (71.2%), azathioprine (13.3%), and other immunosuppressants (6.4%). Neither median immune cell counts nor immunoglobulin levels (p > 0.05) were significantly different between patients with or without immunosuppression. During the pandemic, no patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, and the majority (>95%) took one or more effective protective measures (e.g., wearing a mask and social distancing). However, a significantly higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) was observed in the 33 patients with treatment interruptions due to the pandemic compared to before it (p < 0.05), whereas ARR changes were not found in patients with continuous treatments or those without treatments (p > 0.05). Interruption frequency was significantly higher in patients with relapses compared to those without (34.9 vs. 15.7%, p < 0.01). For stable NMOSD patients during the pandemic, the risk of relapse due to treatment interruption may be higher than the risk of COVID-19 infection when protective measures are used, and continuous relapse-prevention treatments may be necessary.","Yin, Hexiang; Zhang, Yao; Xu, Yan; Peng, Bin; Cui, Liying; Zhang, Shuyang",Front Neurol,445,20

Less is known about youths. METHODS: We surveyed a sample of Italian adolescents during the strictest quarantine period and assessed the effects of socio-demographic and psychological factors on current emotional symptoms. A convenient sample of 326 adolescents (age range 14–19 years) participated in a web-based survey. We collected data on several socio-demographic and psychological variables (summarized into three indexes: environmental context, changes in lifestyle, and worries about infection) and psychopathological symptoms (previous psychopathological status, current anxiety and depressive symptoms). RESULTS: Descriptive analysis showed that adolescents have experienced quarantine under very different conditions; they reported 47.5 and 14.1% of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Regression analyses indicated that previous psychopathological status and worries about infection are linked to anxiety and that female gender, previous psychopathological status (moderated by change in lifestyle), worse environmental context are linked to depression. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that, facing the COVID-19 pandemic and its related safety measures, adolescents show relevant emotional symptoms and therefore should be monitored, assessed and supported.

The pandemic situation has put these professionals against various ethical challenges. Therefore, this review aims to identify the main ethical challenges faced by nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. This integrative review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. All English version studies that reported ethical challenges of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, from November 9, 2019, to November 9, 2020, were eligible for the review. The electronic databases used were PubMed, Google Scholar, JURN, Cochrane Library E-Journals, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL. Accordingly, 8 articles were included for further analysis and synthesis. The ethical challenges of nurses were categorized into three thematic areas: nurses’ safety, role and moral distress, resource allocation, and client–nurse relationship. Thus, the lack of full protection of nurses across the health industry has raised ethical questions such as the extent of their duty, scarce resources, and the failure of personal protective equipment. In connection, a significant number of nurses were also facing moral distress because of prolonged pressure to maintain the resources needed to provide safe and high-quality nursing care. Furthermore, nurses were challenged to restrict many COVID-19 patients from having end-of-life communication with their families. Overall, nurses are still facing various ethical challenges across the globe. Therefore, it is important to mobilize resources and invest in nurses to bring long-lasting solutions.","Gebreheat, Gdiom; Teame, Hirut",J Multidiscip Healthc,445,16

Methods: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled. The baseline data, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) results evaluated by CT score on admission, and clinical outcomes were collected and compared. Logistic regression was used to assess the independent relationship between the baseline level of the four indicators (NLR, LDH, D-dimer, and CT score) and the severity of COVID-19. Results: Among the 432 patients, 125 (28.94%) and 307 (71.06%) were placed in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. As per the multivariate logistic regression, high levels of NLR and LDH were independent predictors of severe COVID-19 (OR=2.163; 95% CI=1.162-4.026; p=0.015 for NLR>3.82; OR=2.298; 95% CI=1.327-3.979; p=0.003 for LDH>246 U/L). Combined NLR>3.82 and LDH>246 U/L increased the sensitivity of diagnosis in patients with severe disease (NLR>3.82 [50.40%] vs. combined diagnosis [72.80%]; p=0.0007; LDH>246 [59.2%] vs. combined diagnosis [72.80%]; p<0.0001). Conclusions: High levels of serum NLR and LDH have potential value in the early identification of patients with severe COVID-19. Moreover, the combination of LDH and NLR can improve the sensitivity of diagnosis.","Cai, Yu-Qing; Zhang, Xiao-Bin; Zeng, Hui-Qing; Wei, Xiao-Jie; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhen-Yu; Ming, Quan; Peng, Qiu-Ping; Chen, Li-Da",Aging (Albany NY),445,16

COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread by symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. As such, determining the risk of infection within a community is difficult. To mitigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19, the government of Malaysia implemented seven phases of the movement control order (MCO) from 18 March to 31 December 2020. However, the socioeconomic cost was substantial despite the effectiveness of the MCO in bringing down cases of infection. As noted by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the final criterion that should be met is community empowerment. In other words, community-based mitigation measures through which communities unite to contain the pandemic are essential before the completion of the vaccination program. As a measure for controlling the pandemic, mitigation strategies in the new normal should be feasible, practical, and acceptable to communities. In this paper, we present a deliberation of a set of community-based monitoring criteria to ensure health and well-being in communities, such as efficacy, technicality, feedback, and sustainability. The proposed criteria will be instrumental in developing community-based monitoring initiatives to achieve the desired goals in coping with the pandemic as well as in empowering communities to be part of the governance process.","Muhamad Khair, Nur Khairlida; Lee, Khai Ern; Mokhtar, Mazlin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,445,1

Some pathogens (such as Hendra, Nipah and Marburg viruses) appear to use mainly fruit bats as reservoir. We describe designed immortalization of primary fetal cells from the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) to facilitate isolation and characterization of pathogens associated with these mammals. Three cell lines with different properties were recovered and successful immortalization was confirmed by continuous cultivation for over 18 months. Surprisingly, the cell lines are fully permissive for a highly attenuated poxvirus, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). MVA is a safe and well characterized vaccine vector that cannot replicate in most mammalian cells. High permissivity of Rousettus cell lines could justify testing bats for susceptibility to MVA as a replication competent vector with low zoonotic potential to induce herd immunity in bat colonies against viruses causing rabies or haemorrhagic fevers.","Jordan, Ingo; Horn, Deborah; Oehmke, Stefanie; Leendertz, Fabian H.; Sandig, Volker",Virus Research,445,1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and significance of CXCL14 in CRC progression. METHOD: 265 colorectal carcinoma specimens and 129 matched adjacent normal colorectal mucosa specimens were collected. Expression of CXCL14 in clinical samples was examined by immunostaining. The effect of CXCL14 on colorectal carcinoma cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, BrdU incorporation assay and colony formation assay. The impact of CXCL14 on migration and invasion of colorectal carcinoma cells was determined by transwell assay and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. RESULTS: CXCL14 expression was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous mucosa tissues (P < 0.001). Tumoral CXCL14 expression levels were significantly correlated with TNM (Tumor-node-metastasis) stage, histodifferentiation, and tumor size. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, high CXCL14 expression in tumor specimens (n = 91) from stage I/II patients was associated with increased risk for disease recurrence (risk ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.15-7.40; P = 0.024). Elevated CXCL14 expression in tumor specimens (n = 135) from stage III/IV patients correlated with worse overall survival (risk ratio, 3.087; 95% CI, 1.866-5.107; P < 0.001). Functional studies demonstrated that enforced expression of CXCL14 in SW620 colorectal carcinoma cells resulted in more aggressive phenotypes. In contrast, knockdown of CXCL14 expression could mitigate the proliferative, migratory and invasive potential of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, CXCL14 might be a potential novel prognostic factor to predict the disease recurrence and overall survival and could be a potential target of postoperative adjuvant therapy in CRC patients.","Zeng, Jun; Yang, Xudan; Cheng, Lin; Liu, Rui; Lei, Yunlong; Dong, Dandan; Li, Fanghua; Lau, Quek Choon; Deng, Longfei; Nice, Edouard C; Xie, Ke; Huang, Canhua",J Transl Med,445,27

METHODS: This study includes all patients with a BSI admitted to four Italian hospitals between January 1st and June 30th, 2020. Clinical, demographic, and microbiologic data were compared with those of patients hospitalized during the same period of 2019. RESULTS: Among 26,012 patients admitted in the first semester of 2020, 1,182 had COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19, we observed 107 BSIs, with an incidence rate of 8.19 episodes per 1000 patient-days. This incidence was significantly higher than in patients without COVID-19 (2.72/1000 patient-days) and in patients admitted in 2019 (2.76/1000 patient-days). In comparison with patients without COVID-19, BSIs onset in patients with COVID-19 was delayed during the course of hospitalization (16.0 vs 5 days). Thirty-day mortality among patients with COVID-19 was 40.2%, significantly higher than in patients without COVID-19 (23.7%).

There is still no approved and effective treatment for the disease. Several drugs are being administered empirically to patients, based on results from studies with limited methodologies. There is an urgent need for systematic reviews to support decision makers and the development of guidelines. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of drug studies carried out worldwide for COVID-19, verifying the effectiveness and methodological quality. METHOD: The search for relevant articles was performed in the Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, and Embase databases. The terms and combinations used for the search were ((coronavirus OR “2019-nCoV” OR 2019nCoV OR nCoV2019 OR “nCoV-2019” OR “COVID-19” OR COVID19 OR “HCoV-19” OR HCoV19 OR CoV OR “2019 novel*” OR Ncov OR “n-cov” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “SARSCoV-2” OR “SARSCoV2” OR “SARSCoV2” OR SARSCov19 OR “SARS-Cov19” OR “SARS-Cov-19”) OR “severe acute respiratory syndrome*” OR ((corona* OR corono*) AND (virus* OR viral* OR virinae*)) AND ((treatment) OR (medication) OR (symptoms)) AND (drugs)). The review process of the articles was carried out independently by four reviewers using the PRISMA-P method. RESULTS: As a result, a total of 30 articles were selected, which addressed the study of one or more medications for severe cases of COVID-19, which were hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine) and azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule, Combinations: remdesivir/lopinavir/homoharringtonine/emetine, remdesivir, interferon, lopinavir and ritonavir, thalidomide/methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite efforts and studies, research does not provide evidence for the use of any drug to treat COVID-19, as the effects, safety, and efficacy are still uncertain. Thus, there is a need for systematic reviews to monitor, synthesize, and update the literature data on the subject, generating reliable evidence for decision makers. COVID-19 should be monitored and the need to develop effective drugs and vaccines to prevent disease progression must be reinforced.","Milagre, Selma Terezinha; Pereira, Adriano Alves; de Oliveira Andrade, Adriano; de Andrade Palis, Angélica; Cabral, Ariana Moura; Barreto, Cassiana Gabriela Lima; de Souza, Daniel Baldoino; de Paula Silva, Fernanda; Santos, Fernando Pasquini; Silva, Gabriella Lelis; Guimarães, José Flávio Viana; de Araújo, Laureane Almeida Santiago; Nóbrega, Lígia Reis; Mendes, Luanne Cardoso; Brandão, Mariana Ribeiro; de Lima Gonçalves, Verônica; de Freitas Morales, Victor Hugo; da Conceição Lima, Viviane",Res,445,16

People with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may frequently require treatment with psychotropic medications, but are at the same time at higher risk for safety issues because of the complex underlying medical condition and the potential interaction with medical treatments. METHODS: In order to produce evidence-based practical recommendations on the optimal management of psychotropic medications in people with COVID-19, an international, multi-disciplinary working group was established. The methodology of the WHO Rapid Advice Guidelines in the context of a public health emergency and the principles of the AGREE statement were followed. Available evidence informing on the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, infective, hemostatic, and consciousness alterations related to the use of psychotropic medications, and drug–drug interactions between psychotropic and medical treatments used in people with COVID-19, was reviewed and discussed by the working group. RESULTS: All classes of psychotropic medications showed potentially relevant safety risks for people with COVID-19. A set of practical recommendations was drawn in order to inform frontline clinicians on the assessment of the anticipated risk of psychotropic-related unfavorable events, and the possible actions to take in order to effectively manage this risk, such as when it is appropriate to avoid, withdraw, switch, or adjust the dose of the medication. CONCLUSIONS: The present evidence-based recommendations will improve the quality of psychiatric care in people with COVID-19, allowing an appropriate management of the medical condition without worsening the psychiatric condition and vice versa.","Ostuzzi, Giovanni; Papola, Davide; Gastaldon, Chiara; Schoretsanitis, Georgios; Bertolini, Federico; Amaddeo, Francesco; Cuomo, Alessandro; Emsley, Robin; Fagiolini, Andrea; Imperadore, Giuseppe; Kishimoto, Taishiro; Michencigh, Giulia; Nosé, Michela; Purgato, Marianna; Serdar, Dursun; Stubbs, Brendon; Taylor, David; Thornicroft, Graham; Ward, Philip B.; Hiemke, Christoph; Correll, Christoph U.; Barbui, Corrado",BMC Med,445,30

However, the structures and relative abundance of the new O-glycans found on the S protein regional-binding domain (S-RBD) remain cryptic because of the challenges in intact glycoform analysis. Here, we report the complete structural characterization of intact O-glycan proteoforms using native top-down mass spectrometry (MS). By combining trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), which can separate the protein conformers of S-RBD and analyze their gas phase structural variants, with ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS analysis, the O-glycoforms of the S-RBD are comprehensively characterized, so that seven O-glycoforms and their relative molecular abundance are structurally elucidated for the first time. These findings demonstrate that native top-down MS can provide a high-resolution proteoform-resolved mapping of diverse O-glycoforms of the S glycoprotein, which lays a strong molecular foundation to uncover the functional roles of their O-glycans. This proteoform-resolved approach can be applied to reveal the structural O-glycoform heterogeneity of emergent SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD variants, as well as other O-glycoproteins in general.","Roberts, David S.; Mann, Morgan W.; Melby, Jake A.; Larson, Eli J.; Zhu, Yanlong; Brasier, Allan R.; Jin, Song; Ge, Ying",bioRxiv,445,16

Purposes and methods: Purposes of this questionnaire are to identify the psychological aspects of cancer patients under COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation of in-hospital countermeasures, and the points for improvement. We conducted a questionnaire to cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Objects: Two hundred and fifty-six patients who received chemotherapy at our outpatient chemotherapy center from August 14 to September 4, 2020. Results: Of the 256 patients, 253 agreed to fill out this questionnaire. One hundred and thirty-one patients (51.8%) were worried about visiting a medical institution. One hundred and fifty-six ones (61.7%) were worried about cancer treatment. On the other hand, two hundred and thirty-four ones (92.5%) had never wanted to quit their treatment. Two hundred and twenty-seven ones (89.7%) evaluated the countermeasures against COVID-19 taken by our hospital and did not consider options other than our hospital. The main answers to the question “What kind of information and consideration did you want to receive from the medical staff?” were as follows;(1) Patients are exposed to many information through media, so medical staff just answer individual questions. (2) No special information and consideration are required. (3) Countermeasures and prevention for COVID-19 are a matter of personal awareness. Others, there were several answers that it was difficult to understand how the in-hospital measures changed. Discussion: About half of the patients continued to receive the cancer treatment with anxiety. We confirmed that patients receiving chemotherapy were highly conscious of infection prevention. We will consider safer countermeasures based on these opinions.","Shibata, Takashi; Ishimabushi, Yuki; Suzuki, Masato; Uchida, Toshiki; Sakamoto, Eiji; Ogasawara, Tomohiko; Yamamuro, Osamu",Annals of Oncology,445,1

To analyze adherence to treatment during COVID-19 confinement as a secondary objective. METHODS: A multi-center cross-sectional observational study was conducted using a survey of 2500 women between January and June 2019. This was administered following a non-probability sampling procedure including women between 35 and 75 years. An extension study was conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, between March and June 2020. RESULTS: The responses of 2355 surveyed women were analyzed. Of this sample, 42% knew about menopause hormone therapy (MHT). The most frequently identified indication was the treatment of hot flashes (65.6%). The MHT risks most frequently perceived were weight gain (24.2%) and breast cancer (21.7%); the main reason for rejecting MHT was a lack of information (96.1%). Comparative analyses were conducted according to age, menopausal status, type of menopause, place of residence, type of health care and level of education. During the coronavirus confinement period, 85 women using MHT were located, of which 84.7% continued it. CONCLUSIONS: Women hold certain false beliefs about menopause, and their knowledge of the available treatments is somewhat limited.

Incorporating such features in vaccine antigens could initiate cross-reactive antibody responses that could sufficiently protect vaccinees from HIV-1 infection despite the uniqueness of each founder virus. To understand the relationship between Env determinants and the development of neutralization breadth, we focused on 197 individuals enrolled in two cohorts in Thailand and East Africa (RV144 and RV217) and followed since their diagnosis in acute or early HIV-1 infection. We analyzed the distribution of variable loop lengths and glycans, as well as the predicted density of the glycan shield, and compared these envelope features to the neutralization breadth data obtained 3 years after infection (n = 121). Our study revealed limited evidence for glycan shield features that associate with the development of neutralization breadth. While the glycan shield tended to be denser in participants who subsequently developed breadth, no significant relationship was found between the size of glycan holes and the development of neutralization breadth. The parallel analysis of 3,000 independent Env sequences showed no evidence of directional evolution of glycan shield features since the beginning of the epidemic. Together, our results highlight that glycan shield features in acute and early HIV-1 infection may not play a role determinant enough to dictate the development of neutralization breadth and instead suggest that the glycan shield’s reactive properties that are associated with immune evasion may have a greater impact. IMPORTANCE A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research is to design vaccine candidates that elicit potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Different viral features have been associated with the development of bNAbs, including the glycan shield on the surface of the HIV-1 Envelope (Env). Here, we analyzed data from two cohorts of individuals who were followed from early infection to several years after infection spanning multiple HIV-1 subtypes. We compared Env glycan features in HIV-1 sequences obtained in early infection to the potency and breadth of neutralizing antibodies measured 1 to 3 years after infection. We found limited evidence of glycan shield properties that associate with the development of neutralization breadth in these cohorts. These results may have important implications for antigen design in future vaccine strategies and emphasize that HIV-1 vaccines will need to rely on a complex set of properties to elicit neutralization breadth.","Li, Yifan; Bai, Hongjun; Sanders-Buell, Eric; Dussupt, Vincent; Townsley, Samantha; Donofrio, Gina; Bose, Meera; O’Sullivan, Anne Marie; Kibuuka, Hannah; Maganga, Lucas; Nitayaphan, Sorachai; Kosgei, Josphat; Pitisuttithum, Punnee; Rerks-Ngarm, Supachai; Eller, Leigh Anne; Michael, Nelson L.; Robb, Merlin L.; Ake, Julie; Vasan, Sandhya; Tovanabutra, Sodsai; Krebs, Shelly J.; Rolland, Morgane",Journal of virology,445,29

Since the onset of infections, several full-length sequences of viral genome have been made available which have been used to gain insights into viral dynamics. We utilised a meta-data driven comparative analysis tool for sequences (Meta-CATS) algorithm to identify mutations in 829 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from around the world. The algorithm predicted sixty-one mutations among SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We observed that most of the mutations were concentrated around three protein coding genes viz nsp3 (non-structural protein 3), RdRp (RNA-directed RNA polymerase) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We used various computational tools including normal mode analysis (NMA), C-α discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) to study the effect of mutations on functionality, stability and flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins including envelope (E), N and spike (S) proteins. PredictSNP predictor suggested that four mutations (L37H in E, R203K and P344S in N and D614G in S) out of seven were predicted to be neutral whilst the remaining ones (P13L, S197L and G204R in N) were predicted to be deleterious in nature thereby impacting protein functionality. NMA, C-α DMD and all-atom MD suggested some mutations to have stabilizing roles (P13L, S197L and R203K in N protein) where remaining ones were predicted to destabilize mutant protein. In summary, we identified significant mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as used computational approaches to further characterize the possible effect of highly significant mutations on SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins.

We find that—within 150 days after emergence of COVID-19 in a given county—the presence of a large beef packing facility increases per capita infection rates by 110%, relative to comparable counties without meatpacking plants. Large pork and chicken processing facilities increase transmission rates by 160% and 20%, respectively. While the presence of this type of industrial agricultural facility is shown to exacerbate initial disease transmission affecting large numbers of individuals in the community, over time daily case rates converge such that rates observed in meatpacking- and non-meatpacking counties become similar.

Furthermore, by utilizing fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP), deletion mutations or site-directed mutagenesis of PEDV N protein, coupled with live cell imaging and confocal microscopy, it was revealed that, a region spanning amino acids (aa), 71–90 in region 1 of the N protein was sufficient for nucleolar localization and R87 and R89 were critical for its function. We also identified two nuclear export signals (NES, aa221–236, and 325–364), however, only the nuclear export signal (aa325–364) was found to be functional in the context of the full-length N protein.

However, growing evidence suggests that susceptibility of the human placenta to infection may vary by gestational age and pathogen. For several viral infections, susceptibility appears to be greatest during early gestation. Infections of the peri-implantation placenta that result in pre-clinical pregnancy loss would typically go undetected. Little is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the peri-implantation human placenta since this time in pregnancy can only be modeled in vitro. METHODS: We used a human embryonic stem cell-derived model of peri-implantation placental development to assess patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcription and protein expression in primitive trophoblast. These molecules are involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infection. We then infected the same trophoblast cell model with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, and documented infection dynamics. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were transcribed and translated in stem-cell derived trophoblast, with preferential expression in syncytialized cells. These same syncytialized cells supported replicative and persistent infection by SARS-CoV-2, while non-syncytialized trophoblast cells in the same cultures did not. CONCLUSIONS: Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in early human embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblast and the robust and replicative infection limited to syncytiotrophoblast equivalents support the hypothesis that increased viral susceptibility may be a defining characteristic of primitive trophoblast. Potential implications of these findings for early pregnancy loss deserve further investigation.","Zhou, J; Choi, S; Liu, H; Zhang, J; Tian, Y; Edlow, A G; Ezashi, T; Roberts, R M; Ma, W; Schust, D J",J Infect Dis,445,16

Minoritized and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups have borne a disproportionate burden of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. Recently developed FDA-approved vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce severe COVID-19–related outcomes. Vaccination campaigns have the potential to advance health equity by prioritizing allocation to those at highest risk while striving for herd immunity. Large integrated health systems have been faced with the daunting task of meeting the rapidly evolving needs of diverse patient populations for the provision of population-based testing, treatment, education, and now vaccine distribution. We have designed a COVID-19 vaccine equity index (CVEI) to guide health system vaccination strategy. Methods: We considered proportion unvaccinated within a health care system. We then used real-time readily available electronic health record (EHR) COVID-19 testing positivity and proportion hospitalized to measure burden of illness by race/ethnicity. We used conditional probability and statistical theory to measure equity for unvaccinated individuals and to derive an index to highlight these inequities for specific subgroups. Results: We present an illustrative hypothetical example using simulated data for which we calculated the CVEI for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic patients. In the example, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients had inequitable outcomes. Conclusion: The index can be widely implemented to promote more equitable outcomes among racial/ethnic groups, reducing morbidity and mortality within the overall population as we pursue the collective goal of herd immunity through mass vaccination.","Pressman, Alice R.; Lockhart, Stephen H.; Shen, Zijun; Azar, Kristen M.J.",Health Equity,445,1

However, the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of favipiravir therapy and potential for resistance development is unclear. Methods We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens collected from patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of favipiravir at hospitals across Japan between March and May 2020. Paired genomes were sequenced from those who remained RT-PCR-positive 5-8 days into favipiravir therapy. Daily nasopharyngeal specimens from 69 patients who were RT-PCR-positive at randomization were examined for a cytopathic effect (CPE). Results Some strains early in the trial belonged to clade 19B, whereas the majority belonged to clade 20B. The median time from the disease onset to negative CPE was 9 days. CPE strongly correlated with the time from disease onset, viral load, age and male sex. Among 23 patients for whom paired genomes were available, all except one had identical genomes. Two mutations were observed in one patient who received favipiravir, neither in the RdRp gene. Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 genome distribution in this clinical trial conducted in Japan reflected the early influx of strains from China followed by replacement by strains from Europe. CPE was significantly associated with age, male sex and viral loads, but not with favipiravir therapy. There was no evidence of resistance development during favipiravir therapy.","Suzuki, Masahiro; Imai, Takumi; Sakurai, Aki; Komoto, Satoshi; Ide, Tomihiko; Lim, Chang Kweng; Shintani, Ayumi; Doi, Yohei; Murata, Takayuki",J Infect Chemother,445,16

These factors depend on the activities and facial features of the mask wearer so that the mask performance for real-world applications is difficult to predict. The present work shows how protection factor, a quantity often used to describe mask performance, can be estimated without involving human volunteers. By constraining these factors to known values, mask protection factors can be compared fairly and efficiently following a series of filtration efficiency measurements performed in the laboratory. Protection factors and mask emissions for exhalation and inhalation were evaluated for masks of seven types currently in use around the world and for a hypothetical mask with 99% efficiency on all particles. The performance of reusable masks made from cotton fabric was limited by the size of the native cotton fibers. Masks that utilized finer fibers, particularly electret fibers with relatively small diameters, showed excellent performance with moderate flow resistance. Results from this work, in addition to simple guidance for mask fit and usage, can facilitate risk communication and decision-making efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Leith, David; L’Orange, Christian; Volckens, John",Environ Sci Technol,445,17

Neutrophils are known to contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Changes in neutrophil function in COVID-19 may give insight into disease pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets. METHODS: Blood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for eleven days. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), oxidative burst, phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed. Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for immunostaining. Pubmed searches for neutrophils, lung and COVID-19 yielded ten peer-reviewed research articles in English. RESULTS: Elevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified both at first measurement and across hospitalization (p<0.0001). COVID neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst (p<0.0001), NETosis (p<0.0001) and phagocytosis (p<0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with leukocytosis and neutrophilia, and neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in lung parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs available for examination (2 out of 5). While elevations in IL-8 and ANC correlated with disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Literature to date demonstrates compelling evidence of increased neutrophils in the circulation and lungs of COVID-19 patients. importantly, neutrophil quantity and activation correlates with severity of disease. Similarly, our data shows that circulating neutrophils in COVID-19 exhibit an activated phenotype with enhanced NETosis and oxidative burst.","Masso-Silva, Jorge A; Moshensky, Alexander; Lam, Michael T Y; Odish, Mazen; Patel, Arjun; Xu, Le; Hansen, Emily; Trescott, Samantha; Nguyen, Celina; Kim, Roy; Perofsky, Katherine; Perera, Samantha; Ma, Lauren; Pham, Josephine; Rolfsen, Mark; Olay, Jarod; Shin, John; Dan, Jennifer M; Abbott, Robert; Ramirez, Sydney; Alexander, Thomas H; Lin, Grace Y; Fuentes, Ana Lucia; Advani, Ira; Gunge, Deepti; Pretorius, Victor; Malhotra, Atul; Sun, Xin; Duran, Jason; Hepokoski, Mark; Crotty, Shane; Coufal, Nicole G; Meier, Angela; Alexander, Laura E Crotty",Clin Infect Dis,445,21

During NET formation, cytotoxic extracellular histones are released, the presence of which is linked to the initiation and progression of several acute inflammatory diseases. Here we study the presence and evolution of extracellular histone H3 and several other neutrophil-related molecules and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the plasma of 117 COVID-19-positive ICU patients. We demonstrate that at ICU admission the levels of histone H3, MPO, and DNA-MPO complex were all significantly increased in COVID-19-positive patients compared to control samples. Furthermore, in a subset of 54 patients, the levels of each marker remained increased after 4+ days compared to admission. Histone H3 was found in 28% of the patients on admission to the ICU and in 50% of the patients during their stay at the ICU. Notably, in 47% of histone-positive patients, we observed proteolysis of histone in their plasma. The overall presence of histone H3 during ICU stay was associated with thromboembolic events and secondary infection, and non-cleaved histone H3 was associated with the need for vasoactive treatment, invasive ventilation, and the development of acute kidney injury. Our data support the validity of treatments that aim to reduce NET formation and additionally underscore that more targeted therapies focused on the neutralization of histones should be considered as treatment options for severe COVID-19 patients.","Huckriede, Joram; de Vries, Femke; Hultström, Michael; Wichapong, Kanin; Reutelingsperger, Chris; Lipcsey, Miklos; Garcia de Frutos, Pablo; Frithiof, Robert; Nicolaes, Gerry A.

Many studies have demonstrated that improved air quality and reduced carbon emissions have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, questions remain regarding changes in atmospheric CO(2) concentrations because of the complex cycles involving the interaction of CO(2) with the natural environment. In this study, we compared the changes in urban CO(2) enhancement (△CO(2)) reflecting the contribution of local CO(2) emissions to the atmospheric CO(2) in urban areas, according to the intensity of social distancing policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Seoul, South Korea. We used data from three CO(2) ground observation sites in the central area of Seoul and outside the urban area of Seoul. By comparing the urban CO(2) concentration in Seoul with that of the background area using two different methods, considering both vertical and horizontal differences in CO(2) concentration, we quantified the △CO(2) of the pre-COVID-19 period and two COVID-19 periods, during which intensive social distancing policies with different intensities were implemented (Level 1, Level 2.5). During the pre-COVID-19 period, the average △CO(2) calculated using the two methods was 24.82 ppm, and it decreased significantly to 16.42 and 14.36 ppm during the Level 1 and Level 2.5 periods, respectively. In addition, the urban contribution of Seoul to atmospheric CO(2) concentration decreased from 5.27% during the pre-COVID-19 period to 3.54% and 3.19% during the Level 1 and Level 2.5 periods, respectively. The results indicate that the social distancing policies implemented in Seoul resulted in reduced local CO(2) emissions, leading to a reduction in atmospheric CO(2) concentration. Interestingly, it also shows that the extent of atmospheric CO(2) concentration reduction can be greatly affected by the intensity of policies. Our study suggests that changes in human activity could reduce the urban direct contribution to the background CO(2) concentration helping to further mitigate climate change.","Park, Chaerin; Jeong, Sujong; Shin, Yong-seung; Cha, Yeong-seop; Lee, Ho-chan",Atmos Pollut Res,445,5

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ReIMAGINE Prostate Cancer Screening Study is a prospective single-centre feasibility study. Eligible men aged 50–75 years with no prior prostate cancer diagnosis or treatment will be identified through general practitioner practices and randomly selected for invitation. Those invited will be offered an MRI scan and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The screening MRI scan consists of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and research-specific sequences, without the use of intravenous contrast agents. Men who screen positive on either MRI or PSA density will be recommended to have standard of care (National Health Service) tests for prostate cancer assessment, which includes multiparametric MRI. The study will assess the acceptability of an MRI-based prostate screening assessment and the prevalence of cancer detected in MRI-screened men. Summary statistics will be used to explore baseline characteristics in relation to acceptance rates and prevalence of cancer. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: ReIMAGINE Prostate Cancer Screening is a single-site screening study to assess the feasibility of MRI as a screening tool for prostate cancer.

We also use Hs and Fs to rank the COVID-19 lethality in these countries based on the complexity hierarchy. Our results suggest that the most proactive countries implemented measures such as facemasks, social distancing, quarantine, massive population testing, and hygienic (sanitary) orientations to limit the impacts of COVID-19, which implied lower entropy (higher predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality. In contrast, the most reactive countries implementing these measures depicted higher entropy (lower predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality. Given this, our findings shed light that these preventive measures are efficient to combat the COVID-19 lethality.","Fernandes, Leonardo H.S.; Araujo, Fernando H.A.; Silva, Maria A.R.; Acioli-Santos, Bartolomeu",Results Phys,445,26

Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Denmark is currently opening up after a lockdown in mid-March.Methods We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries.Result Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark and in at least one case find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes is stable after lockdown.Conclusion Our work shows how genetic data can be used to identify routes of introduction of a virus into a region and provide alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission chains suggesting that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted; thus challenging the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality. Our methods can be applied to other countries, regions or even highly localised outbreaks.

In order to meet the demands of testing and reduce transmission, SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are being considered. These tests are fast, inexpensive, and simple to use, but whether they detect potentially infectious cases has not been well studied. We evaluated three lateral flow assays (RIDA(®)QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen (R-Biopharm), SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche)), and NADAL(®) COVID-19 Ag Test (Nal von Minden GmbH, Regensburg, Germany) and one microfluidic immunofluorescence assay (SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany)) using 100 clinical samples. Diagnostic rRT-PCR and cell culture testing as a marker for infectivity were performed in parallel. The overall Ag-RDT sensitivity for rRT-PCR-positive samples ranged from 24.3% to 50%. However, for samples with a viral load of more than 6 log(10) RNA copies/mL (22/100), typically seen in infectious individuals, Ag-RDT positivity was between 81.8% and 100%. Only 51.6% (33/64) of the rRT-PCR-positive samples were infectious in cell culture. In contrast, three Ag-RDTs demonstrated a more significant correlation with cell culture infectivity (61.8–82.4%). Our findings suggest that large-scale SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT-based testing can be considered for detecting potentially infective individuals and reducing the virus spread.","Kohmer, Niko; Toptan, Tuna; Pallas, Christiane; Karaca, Onur; Pfeiffer, Annika; Westhaus, Sandra; Widera, Marek; Berger, Annemarie; Hoehl, Sebastian; Kammel, Martin; Ciesek, Sandra; Rabenau, Holger F.",J Clin Med,445,20

The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has multiple potential pathophysiologic interconnections with endocrine systems, potentially causing disturbances in glucose metabolism, hypothalamic and pituitary function, adrenal function and mineral metabolism. A growing body of data is revealing both the effects of underlying endocrine disorders on COVID‐19 disease outcome and the effects of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus on endocrine systems. However, comprehensive assessment of the relationship to endocrine disorders in children has been lacking. CONTENT: In this review, we present the effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on endocrine systems and review the current literature on complications of COVID‐19 disease in underlying paediatric endocrine disorders. We provide recommendations on management of endocrinopathies related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in this population. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: With the surge in COVID‐19 cases worldwide, it is important for paediatric endocrinologists to be aware of the interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2 with the endocrine system and management considerations for patients with underlying disorders who develop COVID‐19 disease. While children and adults share some risk factors that influence risk of complications in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, it is becoming clear that responses in the paediatric population are distinct and outcomes from adult studies cannot be extrapolated. Evidence emerging from paediatric studies provides some guidance but highlights the need for more research in this area.","Miller, Ryan; Ashraf, Ambika P.; Gourgari, Evgenia; Gupta, Anshu; Kamboj, Manmohan K.; Kohn, Brenda; Lahoti, Amit; Mak, Daniel; Mehta, Shilpa; Mitchell, Deborah; Patel, Neha; Raman, Vandana; Reynolds, Danielle G.; Yu, Christine; Krishnan, Sowmya",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,445,16

These products were developed, trialled, manufactured, and authorised for use in several countries within a year of the pandemic's onset. Many gaps remain, however, that must be bridged to establish a truly efficient and effective end-to-end R&D preparedness and response ecosystem. Foremost among them is a global financing system. In addition, important changes are required for multiple aspects of enabling sciences and product development. For each of these elements we identify priorities for improved and faster functionality.

We wonder why surfactants are still not tried for prophylaxis or therapy against COVID-19. That too when many of them have proven antiviral properties. Moreover, lung surfactants have already shown benefits in respiratory viral infections. Therefore, we postulate that surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy would be promising. We believe that our hypothesis would stimulate debate or new research exploring the possibility of surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy against COVID-19.

Epidemiological studies conducted over the last three decades have indicated that viruses are responsible for the majority of these infections. The epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Saudi Arabia is proposed to be affected mainly by the presence and mobility of large numbers of foreign workers and the gathering of millions of Muslims in Mecca during the Hajj and Umrah seasons. Knowledge concerning the epidemiology, circulation pattern, and evolutionary kinetics of respiratory viruses in Saudi Arabia are scant, with the available literature being inconsistent. This review summarizes the available data on the epidemiology and evolution of respiratory viruses. The demographic features associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus infections are specifically analyzed for a better understanding of the epidemiology of this virus. The data support the view that continuous entry and exit of pilgrims and foreign workers with different ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds in Saudi Arabia is the most likely vehicle for global dissemination of respiratory viruses and for the emergence of new viruses (or virus variants) capable of greater dissemination.","Farrag, Mohamed A.; Hamed, Maaweya E.; Amer, Haitham M.; Almajhdi, Fahad N.",Arch Virol,445,1

Here I discuss endothelial‐epithelial co‐operative in vivo responses producing first‐line, humoral innate defence opportunities in human airways. The pseudostratified epithelium of human nasal and tracheobronchial airways are prime sites of exposure and infection by SARS‐CoV‐2. Just beneath the epithelium runs a profuse systemic microcirculation. Its post‐capillary venules respond conspicuously to mucosal challenges with autacoids, allergens and microbes, and to mere loss of epithelium. By active venular endothelial gap formation, followed by transient yielding of epithelial junctions, non‐sieved plasma macromolecules move from the microcirculation to the mucosal surface. Hence, plasma‐derived protein cascade systems and antimicrobial peptides would have opportunity to operate jointly on an unperturbed mucosal lining. Similarly, a plasma‐derived, dynamic gel protects sites of epithelial sloughing‐regeneration. Precision for this indiscriminate humoral molecular response lies in restricted location and well‐regulated duration of plasma exudation. Importantly, the endothelial responsiveness of the airway microcirculation differs distinctly from the relatively non‐responsive, low‐pressure pulmonary microcirculation that non‐specifically, almost irreversibly, leaks plasma in life‐threatening COVID‐19. Observations in humans of infections with rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E, and influenza A and B support a general but individually variable early occurrence of plasma exudation in human infected nasal and tracheobronchial airways. Investigations are warranted to elucidate roles of host‐ and drug‐induced airway plasma exudation in restriction of viral infection and, specifically, whether it contributes to variable disease responses following exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2.","Persson, Carl",Scand J Immunol,445,1

There is a likelihood of other domestic livestock serving as intermediate hosts for this virus. The presence of coronaviruses, closely related to MERS-CoV in Ghanaian bats, presented the opportunity to test the hypothesis of transmissibility of this virus through domestic livestock species. The possible interactions between livestock and bats in 31 household farms were accessed by observation and interviews with farmers. Rectal swabs and serum from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine from commercial and household farms were tested for MERS-CoV and a Nycteris sp. bat coronavirus, previously detected in Ghana. A pan-PCR assay to detect clade 2c viruses and recombinant immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-spike IgG antibodies against the target viruses were used. Likely contact between livestock and bats was determined for 13 farms (41.9%) that reported confining their livestock and also observing bats in their homes. Livestock were left unconfined on eight farms (25.8%) that also observed bats roosting in trees close to their homes. No viral RNA or antibodies against the two coronaviruses were detected in any of the livestock species tested.

Six of the PRCV-infected gilts had adequate levels of immunity to resist infection with TGEV following the challenge of their litters. These six completely immuned gilts also solidly protected their litters from TGEV as shown by a 96% piglet survival rate through weaning at 3 weeks of age.

However, some serology studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 may have been present in the United States prior to that, as early as December 2019. The extent of domestic COVID-19 detection prior to 2020 has not been well-characterized. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare users in the greater Seattle, Washington area from October 2019 through early April 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We tested residual samples from 766 Seattle-area adults for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies utilizing an ELISA against prefusion-stabilized Spike (S) protein. RESULTS: No antibody-positive samples were found between October 2, 2019 and March 13, 2020. Prevalence rose to 1.2% in late March and early April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples in October 2019 through mid-March, 2020, provides evidence against widespread circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare users in the Seattle area during that time. A small proportion of this metropolitan-area cohort had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by spring of 2020.","McCulloch, Denise J.; Jackson, Michael L.; Hughes, James P.; Lester, Sandra; Mills, Lisa; Freeman, Brandi; Rasheed, Mohammad Ata Ur; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Chu, Helen Y.",PLoS One,445,5

Les infections virales figurent parmi les causes les plus fréquentes des exacerbations mais les données épidémiologiques sont, dans leur grande majorité, issues de cohorte de pays tempérés. Peu de données sont disponibles dans les pays tropicaux malgré une augmentation de la prévalence de l’asthme dans ces régions ces dernières années. Méthodes Dans cette étude observationnelle réalisée sur l’année 2015, l’épidémiologie virale de patients adultes hospitalisés pour exacerbation d’asthme a été comparée entre la ville de Saint Pierre à la Réunion (climat tropical) et de Tours (climat tempéré). Un portage viral était recherché à l’entrée à l’hôpital par polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex sur aspiration nasopharyngée. Seize virus ont été analysés : VRS A et B, rhinovirus, métapneumovirus, myxovirus influenzae A, H1N1, H5N1, parainfluenzae de 1 à 4, coronavirus 229E, NL63 et OC43, adénovirus, entérovirus. À la Réunion, le panel de virus recherché comprenait en plus coronavirus HKU1, bocavirus et paréchovirus. Résultats Au total, 100 patients ont été inclus dont 62 à Saint Pierre et 38 à Tours. La présence d’au moins un virus est retrouvé dans les aspirations naso-pharyngées chez 53 % des patients à Tours et 31 % des patients à Saint Pierre (p <0,05). La répartition des virus diffère selon la géolocalisation. Le rhinovirus est l’espèce la plus fréquemment retrouvée dans les 2 groupes : soit 42 % des prélèvements à Saint Pierre et 30 % à Tours. On trouve de façon équivalente, entre les groupes, le virus influenza A dans 19 % des cas. Le classement diverge ensuite, l’entérovirus qui représente 19 % des aspirations naso-pharyngées à Tours n’est pas retrouvé à Saint Pierre. Inversement, le virus influenza H1N1 et le virus para-influenza identifiés dans 12 et 4 % des prélèvements à Saint Pierre sont absents à Tours. Les exacerbations semblent avoir une saisonnalité à Tours avec un pic en septembre et en hiver. Aucune saisonnalité n’est retrouvée sous le climat tropical de la Réunion. Conclusion La proportion de patients hospitalisés pour exacerbation d’asthme et ayant un prélèvement viral positif est plus faible en climat tropical qu’en climat tempéré. L’origine de ces exacerbations reste donc à déterminer. Il est nécessaire d’étudier spécifiquement en zone tropicale d’autres facteurs environnementaux comme les allergènes (moisissures…) ou les parasites.","Botto, G.; Verduyn, M.; Jaubert, J.; Lier, C.; Diot, P.; Marchand-Adam, S.; Guilleminault, L.",Revue des Maladies Respiratoires,445,1

Although, treatments exist to help symptomatic alleviation, patient compliance and monitoring is the basis of ensuring efficacy. With devices that allow for remote wireless PA pressure monitoring such as CardioMEMSTM, the inconsistency in patient reporting and factors such as symptoms and hospitalizations can be reduced. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis utilizing the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Scopus database was performed to identify randomized and non-randomized control trials evaluating baseline characteristics and hospitalizations. RESULTS: 5 trials for the systematic review and 2 trials for the meta-analysis meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. Baseline characteristics included an average age of 64.6 years, male predominance, mean BMI of 29.6, predominance of HFrEF, hypertension the most prevalent comorbidity, and a mean PA pressure of 27.2 mmHg. The follow-up periods ranged from 90 days to 12 months. There was a total of 64 adverse events, mostly non-serious. Patients who underwent remote PA monitoring were less likely to be hospitalized compared with patients who did not (Odds Ratio: 0.52; 95% Confidence Interval 0.39, 0.69). DISCUSSION: Remote PA pressure monitoring allows for reduced hospitalizations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 88 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized due to symptomatic pneumonia between April 15 and August 15, 2020. The patients were divided into two groups as survived patients and non-survived patients. Both groups were compared according to demographic features, comorbid conditions and measurement of the PTX-3 and other laboratory parameters of the patients. RESULTS: Of 88 patients with COVID-19, 59 (67%) were discharged with complete cure and 29 (33%) resulted in death. 46 (52.3%) of the patients were men. PTX-3 median value (IQR) was 3.66 ng/mL (0.9–27.9) in all patients, 3.3 ng/mL (0.9–27.9) in survivors and 3.91 ng/mL (1.9–23.2) in nonsurvivors which was significantly higher (P = 0.045). As a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis the cut-off value of PTX-3 for predicting mortality in patients was 3.73 with 65% sensitivity and 65% specificity (AUC: 0.646, 95% CI: 0.525–0.767, P = 0.045).

RESULTS: Nine reviews were included. We found that the current evidence is incomplete and has a number of important limitations. However, a body of moderate quality review evidence does exist giving a picture of multiple determinants of turnover in adult nursing, with - at the individual level - nurse stress and dissatisfaction being important factors and -at the organisational level - managerial style and supervisory support factors holding most weight. The consequences of turnover are only described in economic terms, but are considered significant. CONCLUSIONS: In making a quality assessment of the review as well as considering the quality of the included primary studies and specificity in the outcomes they measure, the overview found that the evidence is not as definitive as previously presented from individual reviews. Further research is required, of rigorous research design, whether quantitative or qualitative, particularly against the outcome of actual turnover as opposed to intention to leave.

In the search for therapeutic strategies, exercise has been found to play a relevant part in its treatment. However, the promotion of exercise entails adherence difficulties that arose out of the tendency towards sedentarism led by symptomatology. Personalised exercise plans on top of usual care have the potential to enhance behavioural changes and mental health. The present study aims at evaluating the changes in functioning deriving from a blended intervention merging a psychological intervention with a personalised exercise programme based on medical assessment. We will conduct a three-arm randomised controlled trial in which 172 participants suffering from mild–moderate depressive symptoms will be allocated to Intervention A (personalised exercise group programme + app with motivational messages), B (personalised exercise group programme + app with no motivational messages) or control group (app with no motivational messages). Data regarding global functioning, well-being, symptoms, physical activity, and exercise capacity will be collected at baseline, 4, 12, and 36 weeks.

We hypothesized that the sensitivity of D-dimer for PE at current institutional cut points would be similar to those without COVID-19. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective observational cohort study across five urban and suburban EDs in the same health care system. The electronic health record was queried for all computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) studies from December 1, 2019, to October 22, 2020. All ED patients who underwent CTPA had D-dimer and COVID-19 testing completed in a single encounter were included in the study. Baseline demographics were obtained. Test characteristics of D-dimer for PE were calculated for patients with and without COVID-19. Additionally, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for two different D-dimer assays. RESULTS: There were 1158 patient encounters that met criteria for analysis. Performance of D-dimer testing for PE was similar between COVID-19-positive and -negative patients. In COVID-19-positive patients, the sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87.6%-100%), specificity was 11.9% (95% CI = 7.9%-17.1%), and negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. In COVID-19-negative patients the sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI = 91.5%-99.7%), specificity was 14.4% (95% CI = 12.1%-17%), and NPV was 98.3% (95% CI = 93.8%-99.6%). For assay 1 the area under the curve (AUC) for COVID-19-positive patients was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.68-0.83), and for COVID-19-negative patients, 0.73 (95% CI = 0.69-0.77). For assay 2, AUC for COVID-19-positive patients was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.77-0.92), and for COVID-19-negative patients, 0.80 (95% CI = 0.77-0.84). Inspection of the ROC curve for assay 1 revealed that 100% sensitivity was maintained up to a threshold of 0.67 FEU (fibrinogen equivalent units; from 0.50 FEU) with an increase in specificity to 29% (from 18.7%), and for assay 2, 100% sensitivity was maintained up to a threshold of 662 D-dimer units (DDU; from 230 DDU) with an increased specificity to 59% (from 6.1%). CONCLUSION: Results from this multicenter retrospective study did not find a significant difference in sensitivity of D-dimer for PE due to concomitant COVID-19 infection. Further study is required to determine if PE can safely be excluded based on D-dimer results alone in patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 or if adjusted D-dimer levels could have a role in management.","Elberts, Samuel J; Bateman, Ryan; Koutsoubis, Alexandra; London, Kory S; White, Jennifer L; Fields, J Matthew",Acad. emerg. med,445,1

The present review will be focused on recent structural and protein-protein interaction information involving two viroporins found in enveloped viruses that target the respiratory tract; (i) the envelope protein in coronaviruses and (ii) the small hydrophobic protein in paramyxoviruses. Deletion of these two viroporins leads to viral attenuation in vivo, whereas data from cell culture shows involvement in the regulation of stress and inflammation. The channel activity and structure of some representative members of these viroporins have been recently characterized in some detail. In addition, searches for protein-protein interactions using yeast-two hybrid techniques have shed light on possible functional roles for their exposed cytoplasmic domains. A deeper analysis of these interactions should not only provide a more complete overview of the multiple functions of these viroporins, but also suggest novel strategies that target protein-protein interactions as much needed antivirals. These should complement current efforts to block viroporin channel activity.","Torres, Jaume; Surya, Wahyu; Li, Yan; Liu, Ding Xiang",Viruses,445,26

The well-defined duration of the SARS-CoV-2 endemic in Wuhan allowed a side-by-side comparison of antibody responses following symptomatic and asymptomatic infections without subsequent antigen re-exposure. IgM responses rapidly declined in both groups. However, both the prevalence and durability of IgG responses and neutralizing capacities correlated positively with symptoms. Regardless of sex, age, and body weight, asymptomatic individuals lost their SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies more often and rapidly than symptomatic patients.

This is even as the pandemic has reached its peak, plateaued or sliding downwards. It is presently slowly rising again in some countries though not as rapidly as before. This study is therefore, aimed at determining the predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate. This may help explain why Africa’s COVID-19 mortality rate is ironically lower than that of more advanced countries with better health systems. This will also assist various governments balance COVID-19 restrictive and socioeconomic measures. METHODOLOGY: This is an analytic review that used pre-COVID era population data and current COVID-19 mortality figures to determine predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. Pearson’s correlation was used to test the association between some population variables, and COVID-19 mortality rates. Then, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. RESULTS: Significant positive predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate included pre-COVID era ‘65 yr + mortality%’ (R square = 0.574, B = 2.86, p < 0.001), population mean age (R square = 0.570, B = 4.77, p = 0.001), and life expectancy (R square = 0.524, B = 1.67, p = 0.008). Pre-COVID era CVD deaths was a negative predictor of COVID-19 mortality rate (R square = 0.524, B = −0.584, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Africa’s COVID-19 lower mortality rate is due to the lower population mean age, lower life expectancy, lower pre-COVID era ‘65 yr + mortality rate’, and lower pool of persons surviving and living with cardiovascular diseases.","Lawal, Yakubu",Int J Infect Dis,445,1

Although some of these formulas are routinely employed in prevalence studies, the study design often contravenes the assumptions upon which these formulas vitally depend.

Due to the poverty rate in Africa, as well as poor access to quality health care, inadequate medical staff and poor technology, Africa has been predicted to be one of the most severely affected continents in the world by COVID-19. The objective of this study was to examine the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting approach. The source of the data used for this study was the secondary data obtained from the daily publication/report of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from 28(th) February 2020 to 30(th) June 2020. The mean daily survival rate of COVID-19 patients was found to be 27.5% with a median survival rate of 25.4% which is below 50%. Also, the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) was identified to be appropriate for predicting the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria within the observed period. Further findings showed that little variation exists between the predicted and actual survival rate of COVID19 for June 2020 which indicates that the obtained ARIMA model (0, 1, 1) was adequate for the estimation of the survival rate of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Based on the findings of the study, the need for the Nigerian government to explore effective treatment strategies both internationally and locally to improve the survival rate of patients with the disease was strongly recommended. Also, the need for the government to encourage local manufacturing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as garment, which is expected to help health workers effectively manage affected persons without being infected at the front line was recommended.","Aronu, Charles Okechukwu; Ekwueme, Godspower Onyekachukwu; Sol-Akubude, Vincent Ikemefuna; Okafor, Patrick Nnaemeka",Sci Afr,445,28

We find that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed so far, but has different implications for the future predictions in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures. Considering the role of modeling in important decisions such as easing lockdown measures and adjusting hospital capacity, we believe that it is critically important to consider a chronically infectious population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","Tepekule, B.; Hauser, A.; Kachalov, V.

If engaging in problem-focused coping, for example, they may seek information useful for eliminating the root cause of the threat. However, during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people tend to navigate complex information environments marked by high levels of uncertainty. In such contexts, individuals may adopt maladaptive behaviours—for instance, avoiding information or switching to pseudo-epistemic coping—in which they engage with non-scientific explanations. As a consequence, they may learn less from their information environment and become susceptible to conspiracy theories. Against that background, we investigated how threat perceptions relate to learning, believing in conspiracy claims and conspiracy thinking in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from two-wave panel data, we found that threat perceptions negatively related to learning and positively related to believing conspiracy claims. Taken together, our findings indicate that high levels of threat perceptions in uncertain information environments may impede societal learning and encourage conspiracy beliefs. Thus, although provoking general anxiety may support short-term political goals, including adherence to policy during crises, accumulated threat perceptions may adversely affect citizens motivation to cooperate in the long term.","Heiss, Raffael; Gell, Sascha; Röthlingshofer, Esther; Zoller, Claudia",Pers Individ Dif,445,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously reported engineered replication‐competent PR8 strain carrying luciferase reporter gene (IAV‐luc) and multiple pseudotyped IAV and SARS‐CoV‐2 virus was used. To specifically evaluate the pH change of vesicles containing IAV, we constructed an A549 cell line with endosomal and lysosomal expression of pHluorin2. RESULTS: Here, we identified azithromycin (AZ) as an effective inhibitor against multiple IAV and SARS‐CoV‐2 strains. We found that AZ treatment could potently inhibit IAV infection in vitro. Moreover, using pseudotyped virus model, AZ could also markedly block the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 in HEK293T‐ACE2 and Caco2 cells. Mechanistic studies further revealed that such effect was independent of interferon signalling. AZ treatment neither impaired the binding and internalization of IAV virions, nor the viral replication, but rather inhibited the fusion between viral and vacuolar membranes. Using a NPC1‐pHluorin2 reporter cell line, we confirmed that AZ treatment could alkalize the vesicles containing IAV virions, thereby preventing pH‐dependent membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings demonstrate that AZ can exert broad‐spectrum antiviral effects against IAV and SARS‐CoV‐2, and could be served as a potential clinical anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drug in emergency as well as a promising lead compound for the development of next‐generation anti‐IAV drugs.","Du, Xiaohong; Zuo, Xiangyang; Meng, Fang; Han, Chenfeng; Ouyang, Wei; Han, Yu; Gu, Yayun; Zhao, Xin; Xu, Feng; Qin, Frank Xiaofeng",Cell Prolif,445,8

METHODS: Computed tomography scans of 95 adult patients who underwent a polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed. Clinical data were obtained from patients’ records and telephone calls. Paranasal sinus opacification was graded and compared according to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity. RESULTS: Of the patients 28 (29.5%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age 52 [range 26-95] years) and 67 were negative (median age 50 [range 18-95] years). Mucosal thickening was present in 97.4% of maxillary sinuses, 80% of anterior ethmoid air cells, 75.3% of posterior ethmoid air cells, 74.7% of frontal sinuses, and 66.3% of sphenoid sinuses. Minimal or mild mucosal thickening (score 1)and normally aerated sinuses (score 0) corresponded to 71.4% and 21.3% of all paranasal sinuses, respectively. The mean score of each paranasal sinus among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and negative patients was 0.85±0.27 and 0.87±0.38, respectively (p=0.74). Median paranasal sinus opacification score among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients was 9 (interquartile range 8-10) compared to 9 (interquartile range 5-10) in negative patients (p=0.89). There was no difference in mean score adjusted for age and sex. Nasal congestion was more frequent in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive than negative patients (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was associated with patient recall of nasal congestion, but showed no correlation with opacification of paranasal sinuses.","Sumi, Daniel Vaccaro; Loureiro, Rafael Maffei; Collin, Simon Michael; Deps, Patrícia Duarte; Bezerra, Lorena Lima; Gomes, Regina Lúcia Elia; Daniel, Mauro Miguel",Einstein,445,26

SARS-CoV M(pro) is composed of a catalytic N-terminal domain and an α-helical C-terminal domain linked by a long loop. Even though the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV M(pro) adopts a similar chymotrypsin-like fold as that of piconavirus 3C protease, the extra C-terminal domain is required for SARS-CoV M(pro) to be enzymatically active. Here, we reported the NMR assignments of the SARS-CoV M(pro) N-terminal domain alone, which are essential for its solution structure determination.","Zhang, Shengnan; Zhong, Nan; Ren, Xiaobai; Jin, Changwen; Xia, Bin",Biomol NMR Assign,445,21

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate COVID-19 testing data in NYC relative to risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and demographic characteristics of NYC neighborhoods. METHODS: COVID-19 testing and the racial/ethnic composition of NYC Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) were obtained from the NYC Coronavirus data repository and the American Community Survey, respectively. The prevalence of neighborhood-level risk factors for COVID-19 severity according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for risk of severe illness and complications from COVID-19 were used to create a ZCTA-level risk index. Poisson regressions were performed to study the ratio of total tests relative to the total ZCTA population and the proportion of positive tests relative to the total tests performed over time. RESULTS: From March 2nd-April 6th, the total tests/population (%) was positively associated with the proportion of white residents (IRR(adj): 1.0003, 95% CI: 1.0003–1.0004) and the COVID risk index (IRR(adj): 1.038, 95% CI: 1.029–1.046). The risk index (IRR(adj): 1.017, 95% CI: 0.939–1.101) was not associated with total tests performed from April 6th-May 12th, and inversely associated from May 12th-July 6th (IRR(adj): 0.862, 95% CI: 0.814–0.913). From March 2nd-April 6th the COVID risk index was not statistically associated (IRR(adj): 1.010, 95% CI: 0.987–1.034) with positive tests/total tests. From April 6th-May 12th, the COVID risk index was positively associated (IRR(adj): 1.031, 95% CI: 1.002–1.060), while from May 12th-July 6th, the risk index was inversely associated (IRR(adj): 1.135, 95% CI: 1.042–1.237) with positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Testing in NYC has suffered from the lack of availability in high-risk populations, and was initially limited as a diagnostic tool for those with severe symptoms, which were mostly concentrated in areas where vulnerable residents live. Subsequent time periods of testing were not targeted in areas according to COVID-19 disease risk, as these areas still experience more positive tests.","Lieberman-Cribbin, Wil; Alpert, Naomi; Flores, Raja; Taioli, Emanuela",BMC Public Health,445,24
