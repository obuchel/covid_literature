71,The gene of an archaeal α-l-fucosidase is expressed by translational frameshifting,2006-08-18,"The standard rules of genetic translational decoding are altered in specific genes by different events that are globally termed recoding. In Archaea recoding has been unequivocally determined so far only for termination codon readthrough events. We study here the mechanism of expression of a gene encoding for a α-l-fucosidase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (fucA1), which is split in two open reading frames separated by a −1 frameshifting. The expression in Escherichia coli of the wild-type split gene led to the production by frameshifting of full-length polypeptides with an efficiency of 5%. Mutations in the regulatory site where the shift takes place demonstrate that the expression in vivo occurs in a programmed way. Further, we identify a full-length product of fucA1 in S.solfataricus extracts, which translate this gene in vitro by following programmed −1 frameshifting. This is the first experimental demonstration that this kind of recoding is present in Archaea.","Cobucci-Ponzano, Beatrice; Conte, Fiorella; Benelli, Dario; Londei, Paola; Flagiello, Angela; Monti, Maria; Pucci, Piero; Rossi, Mosè; Moracci, Marco",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1616953/,54
75,Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays,2006-09-29,"There is an increasing recognition that detailed nucleic acid sequence information will be useful and even required in the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of many significant pathogens. Because generating detailed information about pathogens leads to significantly larger amounts of data, it is necessary to develop automated analysis methods to reduce analysis time and to standardize identification criteria. This is especially important for multiple pathogen assays designed to reduce assay time and costs. In this paper, we present a successful algorithm for detecting pathogens and reporting the maximum level of detail possible using multi-pathogen resequencing microarrays. The algorithm filters the sequence of base calls from the microarray and finds entries in genetic databases that most closely match. Taxonomic databases are then used to relate these entries to each other so that the microorganism can be identified. Although developed using a resequencing microarray, the approach is applicable to any assay method that produces base call sequence information. The success and continued development of this approach means that a non-expert can now perform unassisted analysis of the results obtained from partial sequence data.","Malanoski, Anthony P.; Lin, Baochuan; Wang, Zheng; Schnur, Joel M.; Stenger, David A.",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1636417/,54
200,A sensitive array-based assay for identifying multiple TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene variants,2008-09-15,"Studies of gene fusions in solid tumors are not as extensive as in hematological malignancies due to several technical and analytical problems associated with tumor heterogeneity. Nevertheless, there is a growing interest in the role of fusion genes in common epithelial tumors after the discovery of recurrent TMPRSS2:ETS fusions in prostate cancer. Among all of the reported fusion partners in the ETS gene family, TMPRSS2:ERG is the most prevalent one. Here, we present a simple and sensitive microarray-based assay that is able to simultaneously determine multiple fusion variants with a single RT–PCR in impure RNA specimens. The assay detected TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts with a detection sensitivity of <10 cells in the presence of more than 3000 times excess normal RNA, and in primary prostate tumors having no >1% of cancer cells. The ability to detect multiple transcript variants in a single assay is critically dependent on both the primer and probe designs. The assay should facilitate clinical and basic studies for fusion gene screening in clinical specimens, as it can be readily adapted to include multiple gene loci.","Lu, Qing; Nunez, Esperanza; Lin, Chunrun; Christensen, Kimberly; Downs, Tracy; Carson, Dennis A.; Wang-Rodriguez, Jessica; Liu, Yu-Tsueng",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582611/,54
322,Interaction of the HIV-1 frameshift signal with the ribosome,2009-10-07,"Ribosomal frameshifting on viral RNAs relies on the mechanical properties of structural elements, often pseudoknots and more rarely stem-loops, that are unfolded by the ribosome during translation. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 type B a long hairpin containing a three-nucleotide bulge is responsible for efficient frameshifting. This three-nucleotide bulge separates the hairpin in two domains: an unstable lower stem followed by a GC-rich upper stem. Toeprinting and chemical probing assays suggest that a hairpin-like structure is retained when ribosomes, initially bound at the slippery sequence, were allowed multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles. However, while the upper stem remains intact the lower stem readily melts. After the first, and single step of translocation of deacylated tRNA to the 30 S P site, movement of the mRNA stem-loop in the 5′ direction is halted, which is consistent with the notion that the downstream secondary structure resists unfolding. Mechanical stretching of the hairpin using optical tweezers only allows clear identification of unfolding of the upper stem at a force of 12.8 ± 1.0 pN. This suggests that the lower stem is unstable and may indeed readily unfold in the presence of a translocating ribosome.","Mazauric, Marie-Hélène; Seol, Yeonee; Yoshizawa, Satoko; Visscher, Koen; Fourmy, Dominique",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2794165/,54
472,A flexible loop in yeast ribosomal protein L11 coordinates P-site tRNA binding,2010-08-12,"High-resolution structures reveal that yeast ribosomal protein L11 and its bacterial/archael homologs called L5 contain a highly conserved, basically charged internal loop that interacts with the peptidyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) T-loop. We call this the L11 ‘P-site loop’. Chemical protection of wild-type ribosome shows that that the P-site loop is inherently flexible, i.e. it is extended into the ribosomal P-site when this is unoccupied by tRNA, while it is retracted into the terminal loop of 25S rRNA Helix 84 when the P-site is occupied. To further analyze the function of this structure, a series of mutants within the P-site loop were created and analyzed. A mutant that favors interaction of the P-site loop with the terminal loop of Helix 84 promoted increased affinity for peptidyl-tRNA, while another that favors its extension into the ribosomal P-site had the opposite effect. The two mutants also had opposing effects on binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and downstream functional effects were observed on translational fidelity, drug resistance/hypersensitivity, virus maintenance and overall cell growth. These analyses suggest that the L11 P-site loop normally helps to optimize ribosome function by monitoring the occupancy status of the ribosomal P-site.","Rhodin, Michael H.

1014,"LoFreq: a sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller for uncovering cell-population heterogeneity from high-throughput sequencing datasets",2012-10-12,"The study of cell-population heterogeneity in a range of biological systems, from viruses to bacterial isolates to tumor samples, has been transformed by recent advances in sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing errors. We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to accurately call variants occurring in <0.05% of a population. Using simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer.

3335,Generating genomic platforms to study Candida albicans pathogenesis,2018-08-21,"The advent of the genomic era has made elucidating gene function on a large scale a pressing challenge. ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources toward this endeavor. Here we provide novel, genome-scale tools for the study of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that is also responsible for frequent superficial and disseminated infections in humans. We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5099 ORFs cloned in a Gateway™ donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein–protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway™-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment. These unique and valuable resources should greatly facilitate future functional studies in C. albicans and the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie its pathogenicity.","Legrand, Mélanie; Bachellier-Bassi, Sophie; Lee, Keunsook K; Chaudhari, Yogesh; Tournu, Hélène; Arbogast, Laurence; Boyer, Hélène; Chauvel, Murielle; Cabral, Vitor; Maufrais, Corinne; Nesseir, Audrey; Maslanka, Irena; Permal, Emmanuelle; Rossignol, Tristan; Walker, Louise A; Zeidler, Ute; Znaidi, Sadri; Schoeters, Floris; Majgier, Charlotte; Julien, Renaud A; Ma, Laurence; Tichit, Magali; Bouchier, Christiane; Van Dijck, Patrick; Munro, Carol A; d’Enfert, Christophe",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6101633/,54
3362,Incorporating uracil and 5-halouracils into short peptide nucleic acids for enhanced recognition of A–U pairs in dsRNAs,2018-09-06,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures form triplexes and RNA-protein complexes through binding to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) regions and proteins, respectively, for diverse biological functions. Hence, targeting dsRNAs through major-groove triplex formation is a promising strategy for the development of chemical probes and potential therapeutics. Short (e.g., 6–10 mer) chemically-modified Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs) have been developed that bind to dsRNAs sequence specifically at physiological conditions. For example, a PNA incorporating a modified base thio-pseudoisocytosine (L) has an enhanced recognition of a G–C pair in an RNA duplex through major-groove L·G–C base triple formation at physiological pH, with reduced pH dependence as observed for C(+)·G–C base triple formation. Currently, an unmodified T base is often incorporated into PNAs to recognize a Watson–Crick A–U pair through major-groove T·A–U base triple formation. A substitution of the 5-methyl group in T by hydrogen and halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, and I) causes a decrease of the pK(a) of N3 nitrogen atom, which may result in improved hydrogen bonding in addition to enhanced base stacking interactions. Here, we synthesized a series of PNAs incorporating uracil and halouracils, followed by binding studies by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, and thermal melting. Our results suggest that replacing T with uracil and halouracils may enhance the recognition of an A–U pair by PNA·RNA(2) triplex formation in a sequence-dependent manner, underscoring the importance of local stacking interactions. Incorporating bromouracils and chlorouracils into a PNA results in a significantly reduced pH dependence of triplex formation even for PNAs containing C bases, likely due to an upshift of the apparent pK(a) of N3 atoms of C bases. Thus, halogenation and other chemical modifications may be utilized to enhance hydrogen bonding of the adjacent base triples and thus triplex formation. Furthermore, our experimental and computational modelling data suggest that PNA·RNA(2) triplexes may be stabilized by incorporating a (Br)UL step but not an L(Br)U step, in dsRNA-binding PNAs.","Patil, Kiran M; Toh, Desiree-Faye Kaixin; Yuan, Zhen; Meng, Zhenyu; Shu, Zhiyu; Zhang, Haiping; Ong, Alan Ann Lerk; Krishna, Manchugondanahalli S; Lu, Lanyuan; Lu, Yunpeng; Chen, Gang",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125629/,54
3916,Transcription attenuation-derived small RNA rnTrpL regulates tryptophan biosynthesis gene expression in trans,2019-07-09,"Ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation is a basic posttranscriptional regulation mechanism in bacteria. Liberated attenuator RNAs arising in this process are generally considered nonfunctional. In Sinorhizobium meliloti, the tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes are organized into three operons, trpE(G), ppiD-trpDC-moaC-moeA, and trpFBA-accD-folC, of which only the first one, trpE(G), contains a short ORF (trpL) in the 5′-UTR and is regulated by transcription attenuation. Under conditions of Trp sufficiency, transcription is terminated between trpL and trpE(G), and a small attenuator RNA, rnTrpL, is produced. Here, we show that rnTrpL base-pairs with trpD and destabilizes the polycistronic trpDC mRNA, indicating rnTrpL-mediated downregulation of the trpDC operon in trans. Although all three trp operons are regulated in response to Trp availability, only in the two operons trpE(G) and trpDC the Trp-mediated regulation is controlled by rnTrpL. Together, our data show that the trp attenuator coordinates trpE(G) and trpDC expression posttranscriptionally by two fundamentally different mechanisms: ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation in cis and base-pairing in trans. Also, we present evidence that rnTrpL-mediated regulation of trpDC genes expression in trans is conserved in Agrobacterium and Bradyrhizobium, suggesting that the small attenuator RNAs may have additional conserved functions in the control of bacterial gene expression.","Melior, Hendrik; Li, Siqi; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Stötzel, Maximilian; Azarderakhsh, Saina; Barth-Weber, Susanne; Baumgardt, Kathrin; Ziebuhr, John; Evguenieva-Hackenberg, Elena",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6614838/,54

Viruses have been demonstrated to be associated with asthma epidemiologically in at least two ways (Fig. 1). First, during infancy, certain viruses have been implicated as potentially being responsible for the inception of the asthmatic phenotype. Second, in patients, particularly children, with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections play a significant role in producing acute exacerbations of airway obstruction that may result in frequent outpatient visits or hospitalizations. 24, 55, 56, 57 This article reviews these two areas by focusing first on mechanisms by which virus infections may lead to the development of asthma in infants and children and, second, on mechanisms by which virus infections may produce acute asthmatic symptoms in patients who already have established disease.","Tuffaha, Amjad; Gern, James E.; Lemanske, Robert F.",Clin Chest Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115729/,54
7623,Histopathological alterations of lymphatic tissues in cats without feline infectious peritonitis after long-term exposure to FIP virus,1999-09-01,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine. As PCV2 displays significant homology with PCV1 (a non-pathogenic virus) at the nucleotide and amino-acid level, a discriminative antigen is needed for specific serological diagnosis. The ORF2-encoded capsid protein from PCV2 was used to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). GST-fused capsid protein from PCV2 and GST alone (both expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected cells) were used as antigens for serodiagnosis. The specificity of the ELISA for detection of PCV2 antibodies was demonstrated in sera from pigs experimentally infected with PCV1, PCV2 and other swine viruses. The semi-quantitative nature of the test was evaluated versus an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). The ELISA was performed on 322 sera from pigs in eight Brittany herds and compared with IPMA. The sensitivity (98.2%) and specificity (94.5%) of this test were considered suitable for individual serological detection. High PCV2 seroprevalence was found in sows and pigs at the end of the growth phase (18–19 weeks) in all eight herds. The seroprevalence in piglets (11–17 weeks) was statistically correlated with clinical symptoms of PMWS (93% in affected versus 54%, in non-affected farms). A cohort study performed in PMWS-free farms showed that 57% of piglets exhibited active seroconversion after 13 weeks, indicating that PCV2 infection occurred earlier in PMWS-affected piglets.","Blanchard, Ph; Mahé, D; Cariolet, R; Truong, C; Le Dimna, M; Arnauld, C; Rose, N; Eveno, E; Albina, E; Madec, F; Jestin, A",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117173/,54

9005,Canine Parvovirus,2015-01-20,"Injection of silica did not brake the resistance against MHV3 conferred to C57BL/6 mice by injection of C. parvum. However, silica itself had a marked protective effect against MHV3 infection that was maximal when injecting 1 mg 2 hrs before virus infection. The protective effect of silica was observed in a number of inbred mouse strains that differ in their relative resistance to MHV3 infection. No viral titers were observed in the spleen and liver of mice which had received MHV3 plus silica, whereas high titers were observed in the virus-infected controls. Injection of silica caused a marked decrease in the number of esterase-positive macrophages in the peritoneal wash-out population, that may be compatible with the possibility that the cause of the protection is the depletion of target cells for the viral infection. This latter effect, however, was short-lived and 24–48 hrs after injection of silica, high numbers of esterase-positive cells were again observed. This may explain why only little protection was observed when silica was administered 2 days before virus infection.","Schindler, L.; Brücher, J.; Kirchner, H.",Immunobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134485/,54

10002,Initial Lung Lesions in Two Calves Experimentally Infected with Haemophilus somnus,2011-03-31,"We demonstrate a new method, using a universal array approach termed multiplex allele‐specific PCR‐based universal array (ASPUA), and applied it to the mutation detection of hereditary hearing loss. Mutations in many different genes may be the cause of hereditary hearing loss, a sensory defect disorder. Effective methods for genetic diagnosis are clearly needed to provide clinical management. Owing to the broad genetic basis of this condition, clinical assay of such a highly heterogeneous disorder is expensive and time consuming. In ASPUA, the allele discrimination reaction is carried out in solution by multiplex allele‐specific PCR and a universal solid phase array with different tag probes is used to display the PCR result. The purpose of developing the ASPUA platform was to utilize the rapidity and simplicity of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) with the detection power of microarray hybridization. This is the first report of the combination of these two technologies, which allow for the completion of allele‐specific detection of 11 of the most frequent mutations causing hereditary hearing loss in under 5 hr. The ASPUA platform was validated by accurately analyzing 141 patient samples that had been previously genotyped for GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and MTRNR1. In addition, we also developed a simplified assay by using streptavidin‐coated magnetic beads instead of fluorescence for signal display that can be assessed through a conventional light microscope. We demonstrate that the ASPUA platform is rapid, cost‐effective, and easily‐used, and is especially appropriate for mutation detection in clinical genetic diagnostics.

10327,The Immunology of Bovine Respiratory Disease: Recent Advancements,2020-04-21,"Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion into erythrocytes is an essential step of the blood-stage cycle, survival of parasites, and malaria pathogenesis. P. falciparum merozoite Rh5 interacting protein (PfRipr) forms a complex with Rh5 and CyRPA in sequential molecular events leading to erythrocyte invasion. Recently we described PfRipr as a conserved protein that induces strain-transcending growth inhibitory antibodies in in vitro assays. However, being a large and complex protein of 1086 amino acids (aa) with 87 cysteine residues, PfRipr is difficult to express in conventional expression systems towards vaccine development. In this study we sought to identify the most potent region of PfRipr that could be developed to overcome difficulties related to protein expression, as well as to elucidate the invasion inhibitory mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies. Using the wheat germ cell-free system, Ecto- PfRipr and truncates of approximately 200 aa were expressed as soluble proteins. We demonstrate that antibodies against PfRipr truncate 5 (PfRipr_5: C(720)-D(934)), a region within the PfRipr C-terminal EGF-like domains, potently inhibit merozoite invasion. Furthermore, the antibodies strongly block PfRipr/Rh5 interaction, as well as that between PfRipr and its erythrocyte-surface receptor, SEMA7A. Taken together, PfRipr_5 is a potential candidate for further development as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.","Nagaoka, Hikaru; Kanoi, Bernard N.; Ntege, Edward H.; Aoki, Masamitsu; Fukushima, Akihisa; Tsuboi, Takafumi; Takashima, Eizo",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171142/,54

The International SCI Data Sets were developed to enable more comparable data collection on the complex sequelae of SCI across studies. This should facilitate progress in mechanistic understanding and improving treatments of SCI. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational pilot study. OBJECTIVES: To collect data on pain symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in adults living with chronic SCI. SETTING: Academic medical center, New York, USA. METHODS: The International SCI Basic Pain and Qol Data Sets were used to collect data from participants with chronic SCI (N = 31) at 2 study visits held 6 months apart. The QoL Data Set was also used to collect data from able-bodied persons of similar age and gender distribution (N = 28). RESULTS: Most participants with SCI had multiple types and locations of pain problems at both study visits, despite reported being treated for pain. At both visits, the worst pain problem type was nociceptive, followed by neuropathic, which was typically rated of higher intensity. QoL scores were significantly lower across all domains of the data set in persons with SCI than able-bodied persons. Persons with pain tended to have lower QoL scores, although this trend was not significant.

12731,Intradural extramedullary metastasis: a review of literature and case report,2019-05-08,"INTRODUCTION: Shoulder pain is common in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), with a prevalence reported as high as 70%. Current treatment of shoulder pain includes conservative measures such as physical therapy, pain medications, patient education, injections, and assistive devices. When conservative treatments fail, shoulder surgery is often the next option. Unfortunately, outcomes after shoulder surgery in persons with SCI are limited and conflicting. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case of a 54-year-old right-handed male with T10 complete SCI (duration of injury = 10 years) who had a complaint of right-sided shoulder pain for 3 years. The individual used a manual wheelchair as his primary means of mobility and was an avid weight-lifter. Physical examination and MRI demonstrated a rotator cuff tear and degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint. He was previously managed conservatively with physical therapy and intermittent corticosteroid injections but failed to improve. He was enrolled in an IRB approved study and underwent an ultrasound-guided injection with autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) and ultimately received improvements in pain and function that were maintained a year after treatment. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of treatment of chronic refractory shoulder pain in a person with SCI using MFAT. Complete relief from pain was maintained at the 1-year follow-up. Injection of MFAT under ultrasound guidance is an effective and promising treatment for chronic refractory shoulder pain in upper limb-dependent persons with SCI and warrants further research.","Cherian, Chris; Malanga, Gerard A.; Hogaboom, Nathan; Pollack, Michael A.; Dyson-Hudson, Trevor A.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786308/,54

12760,Medullary involvement in neurosyphilis: a report of 12 cases and a review of the literature,2019-05-01,"The discrepancy of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) function in atherosclerosis has been noted. Compared to the protective effect of IDO1 against established atherogenesis, the role of IDO1 in the developmental process of atherosclerosis is still unclear. Here, the expression patterns and activities of IDO1 and its isoenzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in aortas and blood samples of patients with atherosclerosis were investigated. IDO1 and TDO were colocalized with CD3-positive lymphocytes and CD68-positive macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. The expression and activity of IDO1 and TDO increased with the grade of the histological classification in early atherosclerosis (grade I, II), but the increase did not continue in advanced atherosclerosis (grade III). Treatment of THP-1 macrophages (THP-M) with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induced the expression of IDO1 via the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, indicating the potential function of IDO1 in foam cells. Before and after treatment with oxLDL on THP-M, IFN-γ-induced IDO1 exhibited different degrees of promotion on foaming, inflammatory factor production and cell apoptosis. Finally, we found that the IDO1 inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan could elevate the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in serum and reduce the area of the aortic atherosclerotic lesions in high-fat diet-fed ApoE(−/−) mice. Our study indicated that IDO1 played a complicated and unfixed role in the entire process of atherogenesis, despite the atheroprotective role in established atherosclerosis. IDO1 also had proatherosclerotic functions in the developmental stages of atherosclerosis. Modulation of IDO1 could be a good method for alleviating atherosclerosis.","Liang, Heng; Chen, Mantian; Qi, Fangfei; Shi, Lei; Duan, Zhenzhen; Yang, Ruoyu; He, Jinchao; Lou, Bin; Li, Yigang; Yang, Qing",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6799842/,54

OBJECTIVES: To describe current practice methods for oedema management in people with tetraplegia. SETTING: Australia. METHODS: Online survey with open and closed questions regarding clinical practice trends in the assessment and treatment of oedema in the hands in people with tetraplegia. RESULTS: Seventeen occupational therapists working in spinal cord injury (SCI) in Australia completed the survey. Oedema was identified by visual inspection (n = 17, 100%) and recorded using circumferential tape measurement (n = 13, 76%). Elevation was used by all participants in conjunction with compression gloves (n = 13, 76%), retrograde massage (n = 13, 76%), compression bandaging (n = 12, 71%) and the boxing glove splint (n = 9, 53%). Participants stated that oedema presented challenges to patients with difficulty exercising (n = 11, 65%), changes to body image (n = 5, 29%) and pain (n = 4, 24%). CONCLUSION: Assessment and treatment practices were not consistent. Oedema in the hands in people with tetraplegia was perceived to have various impacts on a person’s rehabilitation and hand function.

13126,A descriptive survey of porcine epidemic diarrhea in pig populations in northern Vietnam,2020-10-04,"Dental calculus, the calcified form of the mammalian oral microbial plaque biofilm, is a rich source of oral microbiome, host, and dietary biomolecules and is well preserved in museum and archaeological specimens. Despite its wide presence in mammals, to date, dental calculus has primarily been used to study primate microbiome evolution. We establish dental calculus as a valuable tool for the study of nonhuman host microbiome evolution, by using shotgun metagenomics to characterize the taxonomic and functional composition of the oral microbiome in species as diverse as gorillas, bears, and reindeer. We detect oral pathogens in individuals with evidence of oral disease, assemble near-complete bacterial genomes from historical specimens, characterize antibiotic resistance genes, reconstruct components of the host diet, and recover host genetic profiles. Our work demonstrates that metagenomic analyses of dental calculus can be performed on a diverse range of mammalian species, which will allow the study of oral microbiome and pathogen evolution from a comparative perspective. As dental calculus is readily preserved through time, it can also facilitate the quantification of the impact of anthropogenic changes on wildlife and the environment.","Brealey, Jaelle C; Leitão, Henrique G; van der Valk, Tom; Xu, Wenbo; Bougiouri, Katia; Dalén, Love; Guschanski, Katerina",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7530607/,54
14644,Knowledge affecting foot-and-mouth disease vaccination behavior: traditional dairy farmers in the dry zone of Sri Lanka,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Sexual health is generally considered an integral part of medical and allied healthcare professional training. However, many medical schools do not offer this as a mandatory curriculum, or minimize it. Sexual health as an academic area was introduced in the 1970s, but there have been few cohort evaluations of its impact. This was limited by the availability of few psychometric scales for evaluation. We evaluated the full, mandatory, sexual health course in year 1 medicine at a large state university in the Midwest US, including the course with lectures; panels and tutorials; a video app to give students feedback on their sexual history taking skills; and a 3-station sexual history OSCE at the end of the course. RESULTS: Seventy-four medical students (43% of the course cohort) volunteered, for an incentive, to complete evaluation materials pre- and post-course. We used the Sexual Health Education for Professionals Scale (SHEPS), designed and with appropriate psychometric standardization for such evaluation. The SHEPS data covers 7-point Likert scale ratings of 37 patient situations, asking first how well the student could communicate with such a patient, and on the second part how much knowledge they have to care for such a patient. The third subscale examines personal sexual attitudes and beliefs. Data indicated that the matched pretest-posttest ratings for skills and knowledge were all statistically significant and with very large effect sizes. Few of the attitude subscale items were significant and if so, had small effect sizes. Sexual attitudes and beliefs may be well-formed before entry into medical school, and sexual health teaching and learning has minimal effect on sexual attitudes in this US sample. However, using the 3 sexuality OSCE cases scores as outcomes, two of the 26 attitude-belief items predicted > 24% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: The sexual health course produced major changes in Communications with patients sexual health skills and Knowledge of sexual health, but little change in personal Attitudes about sexuality. These data suggest that personal attitude change is not essential for teaching US medical students to learn about sexual health and sexual function and dysfunction, and comfortably take a comprehensive sexual history.","Ross, Michael W.; Bayer, Carey Roth; Shindel, Alan; Coleman, Eli",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7791146/,54

However, the exact regulatory mechanisms of microRNA (miR)-223 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells are still unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of miR-223 inhibiting FBXW7 on the proliferation and apoptosis of CRC cells. HCT116 cells were transfected with miR-223 mimics or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting FBXW7 (siFBXW7), and the effects of these treatments on cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined. The downstream Notch and Akt/mTOR pathways were also assessed. Following miR-223 overexpression, the mRNA and protein expression levels of FBXW7 were downregulated. Transfection with miR-223 mimics or siFBXW7 promoted the proliferation of HCT116 cells and inhibited apoptosis by promoting the Notch and Akt/mTOR signalling pathways. Conversely, miR-223 mimics transfection with FBXW7 overexpression inhibited cell viability and restored apoptosis. Thus, the present study demonstrated that miR-223 could bind to the FBXW7 gene and inhibit its expression, ultimately increasing the proliferation and preventing the apoptosis of CRC cells through the Notch and Akt/mTOR signalling pathways.","Liu, Zhixin; Ma, Teng; Duan, Jufeng; Liu, Xiaofei; Liu, Long",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7789109/,54

Data were collected from pre-examination checklists issued to patients with suspected influenza and electronic medical records. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using a rapid influenza diagnostic test as the reference standard, and 2 × 2 contingency tables were analysed at each cut-off point. We analysed data from 290 patients (72.8% males, median age: 38 years, interquartile range: 26–50 years). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for patients who were aware of other patients presumed to have influenza within close proximity was 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66–0.82). The AUCs for patients with a history of influenza, unvaccinated status, cough, or nasal discharge were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60–0.75), 0.66 (95% CI: 0.59–0.73), 0.67 (95% CI: 0.59–0.75), and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.62–0.78), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio at a 90% cut-off point was 19.5% (95% CI: 13.5–26.6%), 94.1% (95% CI: 88.7–97.4%) and 3.31 (95% CI: 1.57–6.98). The sensitivity, specificity and negative likelihood ratio at a 10% cut-off point was 95.5% (95% CI: 90.9–98.2%), 9.6% (95% CI: 5.2–15.8%) and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.20–1.16).

17550,Connection between Periodontitis-Induced Low-Grade Endotoxemia and Systemic Diseases: Neutrophils as Protagonists and Targets,2021-04-28,"Background: Ischemic stroke is the most common and severe arterial thrombotic event in Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), which provide a pro-coagulant state. The aPL included in the classification criteria are lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β2-glycoprotein-I antibodies (aB2GPI) of IgG and IgM isotypes. Extra-criteria aPL, especially IgA aB2GPI and IgG/IgM anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (aPS/PT), have been strongly associated with thrombosis. However, their role in the general population suffering from stroke is unknown. We aim (1) to evaluate the aPL prevalence in ischemic stroke patients, (2) to determine the role of aPL as a risk factor for stroke, and (3) to create an easy-to-use tool to stratify the risk of ischemic stroke occurrence considering the presence of aPL and other risk factors. Materials and Methods: A cohort of 245 consecutive ischemic stroke patients was evaluated in the first 24 h after the acute event for the presence of classic aPL, extra-criteria aPL (IgA aB2GPI, IgG, and IgM aPS/PT) and conventional cardiovascular risk factors. These patients were followed-up for 2-years. A group of 121 healthy volunteers of the same age range and representative of the general population was used as reference population. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (Reference numbers CEIC-14/354 and CEIC-18/182). Results: The overall aPL prevalence in stroke patients was 28% and IgA aB2GPI were the most prevalent (20%). In the multivariant analysis, the presence of IgA aB2GPI (OR 2.40, 95% CI: 1.03–5.53), dyslipidemia (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01–2.84), arterial hypertension (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03–3.22), atrial fibrillation (OR 4.31, 95% CI: 1.90–9.78), and active smoking (OR 3.47, 95% CI: 1.72–6.99) were identified as independent risk factors for ischemic stroke. A risk stratification tool for stroke was created based on these factors (AUC: 0.75). Conclusions: IgA aB2GPI are an important independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. Evaluation of aPL (including extra-criteria) in cardiovascular risk factor assessment for stroke can potentially increase the identification of patients at risk of thrombotic event, facilitating a decision on preventive treatments.","Naranjo, Laura; Ostos, Fernando; Gil-Etayo, Francisco Javier; Hernández-Gallego, Jesús; Cabrera-Marante, Óscar; Pleguezuelo, Daniel Enrique; Díaz-Simón, Raquel; Cerro, Mercedes; Lora, David; Martínez-Salio, Antonio; Serrano, Antonio",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8126615/,54

Consequently, the presence of conserved structure in multiple sequence alignments can be used to identify candidate functional non-coding RNAs. Here, we present a bioinformatics method that couples iterative homology search with covariation analysis to assess whether a genomic region has evidence of conserved RNA structure. We used this method to examine all unannotated regions of five well-studied fungal genomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe). We identified 17 novel structurally conserved non-coding RNA candidates, which include four H/ACA box small nucleolar RNAs, four intergenic RNAs and nine RNA structures located within the introns and untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. For the two structures in the 3′ UTRs of the metabolic genes GLY1 and MET13, we performed experiments that provide evidence against them being eukaryotic riboswitches.","Gao, William; Jones, Thomas A; Rivas, Elena",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216456/,54
18977,Mergeomics 2.0: a web server for multi-omics data integration to elucidate disease networks and predict therapeutics,2021-05-28,"OBJECTIVE: To approach the clinical value of MRI with vessel wall imaging (VWI) in patients with central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV), we analyzed patterns of VWI findings both at the time of initial presentation and during follow-up. METHODS: Stenoocclusive lesions, vessel-wall contrast enhancement (VW-CE) and diffusion-restricted lesions were analyzed in patients with a diagnosis of CNSV. On available VWI follow-up, progression, regression or stability of VW-CE were evaluated and correlated with the clinical status. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients included, 28 exhibited stenoses visible on MR angiography (MRA-positive) while 17 had no stenosis (MRA-negative). VW-CE was found in 2/17 MRA-negative and all MRA-positive patients (p < 0.05). 79.1% (53/67) of stenoses showed VW-CE. VW-CE was concentric in 88.3% and eccentric in 11.7% of cases. Diffusion-restricted lesions were found more frequently in relation to stenoses with VW-CE than without VW-CE (p < 0.05). 48 VW-CE lesions in 23 patients were followed over a median time of 239.5 days. 13 VW-CE lesions (27.1%) resolved completely, 14 (29.2%) showed partial regression, 17 (35.4%) remained stable and 4 (8.3%) progressed. 22/23 patients received immunosuppressive therapy for the duration of follow-up. Patients with stable or progressive VW-CE were more likely (p < 0.05) to have a relapse (14/30 cases) than patients with partial or complete regression of VW-CE (5/25 cases). CONCLUSION: Concentric VW-CE is a common finding in medium/large-sized vessel CNSV. VW-CE might represent active inflammation in certain situations. However, follow-up VWI findings proved ambiguous as persisting VW-CE despite immunosuppressive therapy and clinical remission was a frequent finding.

Little is known about factors associated with adherence to LCS in real-world practice, with data limited to case series from selected LCS programs. OBJECTIVE: To analyze adherence to follow-up based on standardized follow-up recommendations in a national cohort and to identify factors associated with delayed or absent follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities across the US. Veterans were screened for lung cancer between 2015 to 2019 with sufficient follow-up time to receive recommended evaluation. Patient- and facility-level logistic regression analyses were performed. Data were analyzed from November 26, 2019, to December 16, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receipt of the recommended next step after initial LCS according to Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System (Lung-RADS) category, as captured in VHA or Medicare claims. RESULTS: Of 28 294 veterans (26 835 [94.8%] men; 21 969 individuals [77.6%] were White; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [5.5] years) who had an initial LCS examination, 17 863 veterans (63.1%) underwent recommended follow-up within the expected timeframe, whereas 3696 veterans (13.1%) underwent late evaluation, and 4439 veterans (15.7%) had no apparent evaluation. Facility-level differences were associated with 9.2% of the observed variation in rates of late or absent evaluation. In multivariable-adjusted models, Black veterans (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.10-1.29]), veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.03-1.23]), veterans with substance use disorders (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.01-1.22]), veterans with lower income (OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.79-0.98]), and those living at a greater distance from a VHA facility (OR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.10]) were more likely to experience delayed or no follow-up; veterans with higher risk findings (Lung-RADS category 4 vs Lung-RADS category 1: OR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.28-0.43]) and those screened in high LCS volume facilities (OR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.21-0.67]) or academic facilities (OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80-0.92]) were less likely to experience delayed or no follow-up. In sensitivity analyses, varying how stringently adherence was defined, expected evaluation ranged from 14 486 veterans (49.7%) under stringent definitions to 20 578 veterans (78.8%) under liberal definitions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study that captured follow-up care from the integrated VHA health care system and Medicare, less than two-thirds of patients received timely recommended follow-up after initial LCS, with higher risk of delayed or absent follow-up among marginalized populations, such as Black individuals, individuals with mental health disorders, and individuals with low income, that have long experienced disparities in lung cancer outcomes. Future work should focus on identifying facilities that promote high adherence and disseminating successful strategies to promote equity in LCS among marginalized populations.","Núñez, Eduardo R.; Caverly, Tanner J.; Zhang, Sanqian; Glickman, Mark E.; Qian, Shirley X.; Boudreau, Jacqueline H.; Slatore, Christopher G.; Miller, Donald R.; Wiener, Renda Soylemez",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8267608/,54

We have developed a low-dimensional machine learning model capable of classifying compounds according to whether they can cross or not the placental barrier. To this aim, we compiled a database of 248 compounds with experimental information about their placental transfer, characterizing each compound with a set of ∼5.4 thousand descriptors, including physicochemical properties and structural features. We evaluated different machine learning classifiers and implemented a genetic algorithm, in a five cross validation scheme, to perform feature selection. The optimization was guided towards models displaying a low number of false positives (molecules that actually cross the placental barrier, but are predicted as not crossing it). A Linear Discriminant Analysis model trained with only four structural features resulted to be robust for this task, exhibiting only one false positive case across all testing folds. This model is expected to be useful in predicting placental drug transfer during pregnancy, and thus could be used as a filter for chemical libraries in virtual screening campaigns.","Di Filippo, Juan I.; Bollini, Mariela; Cavasotto, Claudio N.",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8329444/,54

Further, advanced pathogen discovery techniques (e.g., metagenomics) allow the identification of potential pathogens before their recognition as clinically relevant to transfusion medicine. In the aftermath of our experiences with HIV and posttransfusion hepatitis, our windows for response to such agents and infections have contracted rapidly. These characteristics pose difficult challenges for our development of surveillance and control regimes capable of timely, but appropriately nuanced, responses.

In particular, the author considers how the borders between nations, species, and individuals are thrown into relief and called into question by influenza outbreaks and their management. Methodology/approach – This work relies on literature review, media research, and critical and interpretative sociological methods. Findings – While panic surrounding new and potentially highly virulent influenza strains is reasonable, such panic is not sustainable and belies the fact that every year presents the danger of a pandemic. This chapter argues that, if public health systems only respond to immediate panic and fail to consider how quickly airborne diseases can cross all sorts of borders, they do not attend to the real need for far-seeing, long-term, internationally collaborative disease prevention and disaster preparedness. Contribution to the field – The author offers a critical and wellness- and prevention-oriented perspective on what priorities should be emphasized in the rapidly growing fields of disaster studies and disaster preparedness, which, by their nature, tend to be crisis oriented and focused on the micro-term, with planning done on a case-by-case basis. Such a narrow focus can render preventative health systems inflexible and unable to rise to the challenge of a disease that can spread easily through casual contact.","Mukherjea, Ananya",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162265/,54

30901,BSAVA Companion,2010-04-26,"Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine, was discovered to be a product of serotonin metabolism in the mammalian pineal gland where its synthesis is under control of the light:dark cycle. Besides its regulatory pathway involving ganglion cells in the retina, the neural connections between the eyes and the pineal gland include the master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since pineal melatonin is released into the blood and into the cerebrospinal fluid, it has access to every cell in an organism and it mediates system-wide effects. Subsequently, melatonin was found in several extrapineal organs and, more recently, perhaps in every cell of every organ. In contrast to the pinealocytes, non-pineal cells do not discharge melatonin into the blood; rather it is used locally in an intracrine, autocrine, or paracrine manner. Melatonin levels in non-pineal cells do not exhibit a circadian rhythm and do not depend on circulating melatonin concentrations although when animals are treated with exogenous melatonin it is taken up by presumably all cells. Mitochondria are the presumed site of melatonin synthesis in all cells; the enzymatic machinery for melatonin synthesis has been identified in mitochondria. The association of melatonin with mitochondria, because of its ability to inhibit oxidative stress, is very fortuitous since these organelles are a major site of damaging reactive oxygen species generation. In this review, some of the actions of non-pineal-derived melatonin are discussed in terms of cellular and subcellular physiology.","Reiter, Russel J.; Sharma, Ramaswamy; Rosales-Corral, Sergio A.; Coto-Montes, Ana; Boga, Jose Antonio; Vriend, Jerry",Approaching Complex Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164543/,54

It was originally defined around the year 25 A.D. by Aulus Cornelius Celsus [1] and described the body’s acute reaction following a traumatic event, such as a microscopic tear of a ligament or muscle. His original wording: “Notae vero inflammationis sunt quatour: rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore” (true signs of inflammation are four: redness and swelling with heat and pain) still holds. Disturbance of function (functio laesa) is the legendary fifth cardinal sign of inflammation and was added by Galen in the second century A.D. [2]. Recent articles [3] highlight the complicated role that inflammation plays in chronic illnesses, including metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to these difficult-to-treat diseases, more research and research tools are needed to illuminate therapeutic strategies in another difficulty-to-treat inflammatory malady, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","Batista Borges, J.; Hedenstierna, G.; Suarez-Sipmann, F.",Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2014,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176157/,54

38147,NSAIDs do not increase risk of death in adults hospitalised with influenza,2020-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal nematodes could release excretory-secretory (ES) proteins into the host environment to ensure their survival. These ES proteins act as immunomodulators to suppress or subvert the host immune response via the impairment of immune cell functions, especially in chronic infections. In our preliminary study, Haemonchus contortus adhesion-regulating molecule 1 (HcADRM1) was identified from H. contortus ES proteins (HcESPs) that interacted with host T cells via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. However, little is known about HcADRM1 as an ES protein which may play a pivotal role at the parasite-host interface. METHODS: Based on bioinformatics approaches, multiple amino acid sequence alignment was conducted and the evolutionary relationship of HcADRM1 with ADRM1 orthologues was extrapolated. Employing RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry assays, temporal transcriptional and spatial expression profiles of HcADRM1 were investigated. Using immunostaining approaches integrated with immunological bioassays, the immunomodulatory potentials of HcADRM1 on goat T cells were assessed. RESULTS: We hereby demonstrated that HcADRM1 with immunodiagnostic utility was a mammalian ADRM1 orthologue abundantly expressed at all developmental stages of H. contortus. Given the implications of ADRM1 proteins in cell growth, survival and development, we further investigated the immunomodulatory property of HcADRM1 as an individual ES protein acting at the parasite-host interface. The rHcADRM1 stimuli notably suppressed T cell viability, promoted intrinsic and extrinsic T cell apoptosis, inhibited T cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Simultaneously, rHcADRM1 stimuli exerted critical controls on T cell cytokine secretion profiles, predominantly by restraining the secretions of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and interferon-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: Importantly, HcADRM1 protein may have prophylactic potential for anti-H. contortus vaccine development. Together, these findings may contribute to the clarification of molecular and immunomodulatory traits of ES proteins, as well as improvement of our understanding of parasite immune evasion mechanism in H. contortus-host biology.

Second, how are Trump and Putin challenging the international order? And third, how are they challenging each other? The first two sections introduce the Trump Doctrine as laid out in the first chapter in this volume (Renshon 2020), and then compare/contrast it with the Putin Doctrine. Some key points include Putin’s opposition to US global dominance, his determination to reestablish Russia as a global great power, and his willingness to use any tools possible to achieve those goals.

So far, moral stigmatization of slaughterhouse workers has not been analyzed systematically. The article answers the following research questions: Which coping strategies regarding moral stigmatization can be found among slaughterhouse workers and how do these strategies relate to hegemonic narratives about their job? The article answers the research questions using concepts from sociological theories of culture, stigma and dirty work and is based on a qualitative content analysis of 13 problem-centered interviews with workers from six German slaughterhouses. The analysis showed that slaughterhouse workers are responding to moral stigmatization by questioning the cultural ideas on which stigmatization is based and by arguing for the validity of their own cultural ideas about “slaughter animals”. The interviewed slaughterhouse workers also use rigid group boundaries to delegitimize the authority of external actors to judge slaughterhouse work. The article is innovative because it systematically analyzes how slaughterhouse workers cope with moral stigmatization.","Sebastian, Marcel",OZS Osterr Z Soziol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8295974/,54

With up to 14% of unresectable colonic polyps harboring malignancy, the management of endoscopically unresectable cecal polyps remains an oncologic right hemicolectomy, which can be associated with substantial postoperative morbidity. OBJECTIVE This study compares the outcomes of patients with cecal polyps who underwent either endoscopic mucosal resection, a cecectomy, or a right hemicolectomy. DATA SOURCES Patients undergoing either endoscopic mucosal resection, partial cecectomy, or right hemicolectomy from 2008 to 2017 at a single tertiary care institution were selected. STUDY SELECTION This was a retrospective cohort study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were the rate of malignancy, complication rate, estimated blood loss, and hospital length of stay between surgical cohorts. RESULTS One hundred twenty-nine patients with cecal polyps were identified, of which 52 were referred for surgery. Nineteen underwent partial cecectomy and 33 (27.3%) underwent right hemicolectomy. Two patients undergoing cecectomy required conversion to hemicolectomy because the resected specimen did not contain the polyp. The 2 surgical cohorts did not differ significantly regarding age, sex, or ASA classification. Procedural complication rates were higher among those undergoing hemicolectomy compared with those undergoing cecectomy (37.1% versus 5.9%, p = 0.02). Estimated blood loss (50 vs 10 mL, p = 0.02), operative duration (98 vs 76 minutes, p = 0.009), and length of stay (4 vs 2 days, p < 0.001) were higher in patients undergoing hemicolectomy than in those undergoing cecectomy. No invasive malignancies were identified on final pathology within the cecectomy cohort. LIMITATIONS Single-institution data and retrospective design were limitations of this study. CONCLUSIONS In tertiary centers, the majority of large cecal polyps are benign and can be addressed by using endoscopic mucosal resection. When involvement of the appendiceal orifice or ileocecal valve precludes endoscopic treatment, surgical resection is the standard of care. In the subset of cases not involving the ileocecal valve and without preoperative evidence of malignancy, partial cecectomy spares the ileocecal valve and can offer reduced postoperative morbidity compared with a formal right hemicolectomy.

OBJECTIVE The objective was to compare laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) to an intensive medical diabetes and weight management (IMWM) program for T2D. DESIGN This was designed as a prospective, randomized clinical trial. SETTING The setting was two Harvard Medical School-affiliated academic institutions. INTERVENTIONS AND PARTICIPANTS: A 12-month randomized trial comparing LAGB (n = 23) vs IMWM (n = 22) in persons aged 21-65 years with body mass index of 30-45 kg/m(2), T2D diagnosed more than 1 year earlier, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) ≥ 6.5% on antihyperglycemic medication(s). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The proportion meeting the prespecified primary glycemic endpoint, defined as HbA(1c) < 6.5% and fasting glucose < 7.0 mmol/L at 12 months, on or off medication. RESULTS After randomization, five participants did not undergo the surgical intervention. Of the 40 initiating intervention (22 males/18 females; age, 51 ± 10 y; body mass index, 36.5 ± 3.7 kg/m(2); diabetes duration, 9 ± 5 y; HbA(1c), 8.2 ± 1.2%; 40% on insulin), the proportion meeting the primary glycemic endpoint was achieved in 33% of the LAGB patients and 23% of the IMWM patients (P = .457). HbA(1c) reduction was similar between groups at both 3 and 12 months (-1.2 ± 0.3 vs -1.0 ± 0.3%; P = .496). Weight loss was similar at 3 months but greater 12 months after LAGB (-13.5 ± 1.7 vs -8.5 ± 1.6 kg; P = .027). Systolic blood pressure reduction was greater after IMWM than LAGB, whereas changes in diastolic blood pressure, lipids, fitness, and cardiovascular risk scores were similar between groups. Patient-reported health status, assessed using the Short Form-36, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life, and Problem Areas in Diabetes, all improved similarly between groups. CONCLUSIONS LAGB and a multidisciplinary IMWM program have similar 1-year benefits on diabetes control, cardiometabolic risk, and patient satisfaction, which should be considered in the context of other factors, such as personal preference, when selecting treatment options with obese T2D patients. Longer duration studies are important to understand emergent differences.","Ding, Su-Ann; Simonson, Donald C; Wewalka, Marlene; Halperin, Florencia; Foster, Kathleen; Goebel-Fabbri, Ann; Hamdy, Osama; Clancy, Kerri; Lautz, David; Vernon, Ashley; Goldfine, Allison B",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2015-1443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25909333/,54

The goals of this study were to assess the reproducibility of measures from sEMG frequency content between sessions and to compare these frequency components between a ramp and a step incremental cycling test. Eighteen cyclists performed four incremental load cycling tests to exhaustion. Two tests were performed using a step increment (load started at 100 W for 3 min followed by increments of 30 W every 3 min) and two were performed using a ramp increment (load started at 100 W for 1 min followed by increments of 30 W·min-1). sEMG was monitored bilaterally for the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis throughout the tests and converted into overall activation (whole signal bandwidth), high- and low-frequency contents. The reproducibility of the frequency content ranged from none to strong (ICC = 0.07-0.90). Vastus lateralis activation was larger at the step compared to the ramp test (P < 0.01), without differences for rectus femoris (P = 0.22-0.91) and for the high-frequency (P = 0.28-0.95) and low-frequency contents (P = 0.13-0.94). sEMG from vastus lateralis and rectus femoris presented none to strong reproducibility.

64277,Autophagy in osteosarcoma.,2014,"Newly emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases cause significant economic losses in swine production. Efficacious vaccines have not yet been developed for several major swine infectious diseases, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). We used the PEDV-infected Vero cell model to screen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains with antiviral activity. Sixty LAB strains were isolated from the feces of nursing piglets. After the elimination of LAB strains with high cytotoxicity to Vero cells, the protective effects of the remaining 6 strains against PEDV infection were determined. Vero cells pretreated with the intracellular extracts or cell wall fractions of YM22 and YM33 strains for 24 h before infection with PEDV showed significantly higher cell viabilities and lower mRNA expression of PEDV nucleocapsid (PEDV-N) than the unpretreated cells, indicating that the intracellular extracts and cell wall fractions of YM22 and YM33 possessed prophylactic effects on Vero cells against PEDV infection. PEDV-infection significantly increased the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in Vero cells. However, pretreatment of Vero cells with the cell wall fractions of YM22 and YM33 decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-8, which could be a mechanism associated with the protective effects of YM22 and YM33 against PEDV. Based on the biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic analyses, YM22 and YM33 were identified as Ligilactobacillus agilis (basonym: Lactobacillus agilis) and Ligilactobacillus salivarius (basonym: Lactobacillus salivarius), respectively. These findings suggest that L. agilis YM22 and L. salivarius YM33 could provide some levels of protective effects against PEDV infections.","Chen, Yang-Ming; Limaye, Aniket; Chang, Hui-Wen; Liu, Je-Ruei",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12602-021-09829-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350565/,54

65233,Incommensurate crystal structure of PbHfO3.,2020-02-01,"Importance A succession of research has explored the linkage between carotid webs (CaWs) and ischemic strokes. Imaging and pathologic analysis have defined CaW as an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, which appears as a shelflike lesion on the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb, more specifically at the origin of internal carotid artery. Reported findings of carotid webs in young patients with recurrent ischemic strokes without an otherwise determined cause have raised questions about the mechanism, natural history, and need for intervention. This review addresses the current understanding of CaW and highlights findings that prompt further investigation into this unique vascular entity as a modifiable stroke risk factor. Observations Imaging analysis demonstrates hemodynamic disturbance in the presence of CaWs. The protuberant shelflike structure creates a pocket therein that may subsequently lead to local thrombosis and cerebral embolism. Computed tomographic angiography is an accurate and often used noninvasive diagnostic modality. Although treatment paradigms have not been systematically evaluated, antiplatelet monotherapy may not be sufficient to reduce recurrent ischemic events in the small series of patients with stroke and symptomatic CaWs. Conclusions and Relevance The limited clinical data on CaWs, although complicated by selection bias, suggest an increased prevalence of these vascular entities in cerebral ischemic events among patients younger than 60 years. Imaging suggests CaW to be a possible nidus for cerebral thromboembolism. Physicians should consider CaW as a cause of stroke in younger patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes of an otherwise undetermined cause. Treatment options in CaWs with ischemic strokes have not been extensively investigated. Multicenter observational studies evaluating the natural history of CaW are warranted.","Kim, Song J; Nogueira, Raul G; Haussen, Diogo C",JAMA neurology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.3366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30398546/,54

Despite recent reports of the modified delivery system, its safety is still unknown. OBJECTIVE To illustrate the intraprocedural and periprocedural complication rate with this new device in 30 consecutive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical, procedural, and angiographic data, including aneurysm size and location, device or devices used, angiographic and clinical data were analyzed. RESULTS 30 patients harboring 30 aneurysms were analyzed. 39 devices were placed properly. Multiple Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs) were used in 7 cases. In 28 devices the distal end opened fully from the beginning with a complete wall apposition. In the remaining 11 devices, distal-end opening of the devices was instant but partial, but fully opened easily after recapture. Among the 30 procedures, recapture and reposition of the Pipeline Flex was performed four times owing to proximal migration/malposition of the device during delivery. Four intraprocedural/periprocedural complications occurred, of which 2 resulted in major complications, with neurologic deficits persisting for longer than 7 days. The 30-day morbidity rate was 6.6%, with no deaths. No aneurysm rupture or parenchymal hemorrhage was seen. CONCLUSIONS The Pipeline Flex embolization device allows more precise and controlled deployment than the first-generation device. The number of devices and the complication rate during the learning curve are lower than reported with the first-generation PED. The new delivery system and the resheathing maneuvers do not seem to increase the intraprocedural complication rate in comparison with the first-generation PED.","Martínez-Galdámez, M; Pérez, S; Vega, A; Ruiz, P; Caniego, J L; Bárcena, E; Saura, P; Méndez, J C; Delgado, F; Ortega-Gutierrez, S; Romance, A; Diaz, T; Gonzalez, E; Gil, A; Murias, E; Vega, P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770120/,54

COVID-19 has a stronger transmission capacity by inhalation of infectious aerosols and after an incubation time of 3-14 days, it may be responsible for diseases ranging from the asymptomatic to fatal consequences. COVID-19 has emerged as a multifaceted, multisystem, multi-organ disorder, which produces its pathogenic effects through a quite ubiquitous target at the level of multiple organs and in which oxidative stress and inflammatory process play relevant roles. Thus, besides the development of a pharmacological therapy, in the field of alternative and coadjutant therapeutic, the use of dietary supplements or nutraceuticals for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful strategy. Herein, we specifically comment on some literature evidences, which link the food-derived antioxidants and metal-chelating agents with treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation that play a key role in the progression of COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Oxidative stress and inflammation are key factors increasing COVID-19 severity especially in the presence of chronic diseases associated with the antioxidant system fragility. These evidences support the recommendation of antioxidants supplementation as useful strategies against COVID-19.

This study aimed to summarize details and the results of long-term follow-up of PNP after cryoballoon ablation. A total of 511 consecutive AF patients who underwent cryoballoon ablation was included. During right-side PVI, the diaphragmatic compound motor action potential (CMAP) was reduced in 46 (9.0%) patients and PNP occurred in 29 (5.7%) patients (during right-superior PVI in 20 patients and right-inferior PVI in 9 patients). PNP occurred despite the absence of CMAP reduction in 0.6%. The PV anatomy, freezing parameters and the operator's proficiency were not predictors of PNP. While PNP during RSPVI persisted more than 4 years in 3 (0.6%) patients, all PNP occurred during RIPVI recovered until one year after the ablation. However, there was no significant difference in the recovery duration from PNP between PNP during RSPVI and RIPVI. PNP occurred during cryoballoon ablation in 5.7%. While most patients recovered from PNP within one year after the ablation, PNP during RSPVI persisted more than 4 years in 0.6% of patients.","Tokuda, Michifumi; Yamashita, Seigo; Sato, Hidenori; Oseto, Hirotsuna; Ikewaki, Hirotsugu; Yokoyama, Masaaki; Isogai, Ryota; Tokutake, Ken-Ichi; Yokoyama, Ken-Ichi; Kato, Mika; Narui, Ryohsuke; Tanigawa, Shin-Ichi; Matsuo, Seiichiro; Yoshimura, Michihiro; Yamane, Teiichi",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85618-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737633/,54

The aim of this study was to investigate the use of knotless barbed absorbable sutures in esophagogastrostomy closure using the hinged double ﬂap method. DESIGN & METHOD The subjects comprised patients with gastric cancer who were scheduled to undergo laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy. The V-Loc™ 180 wound closure device (V-Loc; Covidien, Mansﬁeld, MA, USA) was used for all laparoscopic esophagogastrostomy closures. Between January 2015 and November 2016, 13 patients were enrolled. RESULTS The mean suturing time was 109.6 min. Median hospital stay was 14 days. One anastomotic minor leakage occurred in an esophagogastrostomy and it was managed conservatively. Twelve of 13 patients did not exhibit any symptoms of reflux esophagitis. CONCLUSION These results suggest the use of the unidirectional barbed absorbable suture is safe and produce reproducible results for esophagogastrostomy closure using the hinged double ﬂap method.","Saeki, Yoshihiro; Tanabe, Kazuaki; Yamamoto, Yuji; Ohta, Hiroshi; Saito, Ryusuke; Ohdan, Hideki",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.08.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172056/,54

One way of doing this is through manipulation of the cell cycle, a process that describes the ordered growth and division of cells. Analysis of model cell lines, such as A549 cells and primary airway epithelial cells, infected with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) has shown alteration of the cell cycle during infection, although the signaling events were not clearly understood. In this study, targeted transcriptomic analysis of HRSV-infected primary airway epithelial cells revealed alterations in the abundances of many mRNAs encoding cell cycle-regulatory molecules, including decreases in the D-type cyclins and corresponding cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6 [CDK4/6]). These alterations were reflected in changes in protein abundance and/or relocalization in HRSV-infected cells; taken together, they were predicted to result in G(0)/G(1) phase arrest. In contrast, there was no change in the abundances of D-type cyclins in A549 cells infected with HRSV. However, the abundance of the G(1)/S phase progression inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) was increased over that in mock-treated cells, and this, again, was predicted to result in G(0)/G(1) phase arrest. The G(0)/G(1) phase arrest in both HRSV-infected primary cells and A549 cells was confirmed using dual-label flow cytometry that accurately measured the different stages of the cell cycle. Comparison of progeny virus production in primary and A549 cells enriched in G(0)/G(1) using a specific CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor with asynchronously replicating cells indicated that this phase of the cell cycle was more efficient for virus production.","Wu, Weining; Munday, Diane C; Howell, Gareth; Platt, Gareth; Barr, John N; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05164-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21795354/,54

Given the potential implications of depression on surgery outcomes, presurgery psychiatric assessment is recommended to assess suitability for bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in detecting depression in bariatric surgery candidates. METHODS Bariatric surgery candidates (n = 244) completed the PHQ-9 and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as part of their presurgery psychiatric assessment. The operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 were examined. The study was replicated in an independent sample of bariatric surgery candidates (n = 275). RESULTS Rates of current and lifetime major depressive episodes were 1.6% to 3.8% and 33.8% to 35.5%, respectively, as assessed by the MINI. According to the PHQ-9, 52.5% to 54.9% of patients exceeded the cutoff for moderate depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10), and 27.6% to 29.1% for moderate severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 15). The optimal dichotomization cutoff point on the PHQ-9 was ≥15 in both studies (sensitivity 75%, specificity 75% to 76%). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the PHQ-9 has adequate operating characteristics compared with a criterion standard measure. A PHQ-9 cutoff of 15 is recommended to identify bariatric surgery candidates who may require further assessment of depressive symptoms.","Cassin, Stephanie; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Hawa, Raed; Wnuk, Susan; Royal, Sarah; Taube-Schiff, Marlene; Okrainec, Allan",Psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2012.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23274006/,54

METHODS A single-center prospective cohort study was performed in LTx-outpatients between October 31, 2005 and April 30, 2006. Symptoms of respiratory tract infections were recorded and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained. Lower respiratory sampling was performed when indicated. Immunofluorescence testing, cultures, and polymerase chain reaction for 12 different CARV were applied. Patients were followed up until December 31, 2007. New onset and BOS-stage was recorded 1 year after presentation. RESULTS Three hundred eighty-eight LTx-recipients were screened. Fifty-one percent reported of symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Seven hundred seventy upper and 180 lower respiratory samples were obtained. Thirty-four CARV were detected in 30 patients (7.7%): 12 parainfluenza, 7 respiratory syncytial virus, 6 metapneumovirus, 5 coronavirus, 3 rhinovirus, and 1 influenza virus. At 1 year, 43 new cases of BOS developed. One-year incidence of BOS was 25.0% in CARV-positive versus 9.0% in CARV-negative patients (log-rank P=0.01). Symptomatic CARV-infection proved to be a significant covariate for 1-year BOS-free survival in multivariate analysis (P=0.002, adjusted hazard ratio 4.13). CARV-infection did not influence BOS progression in 88 patients with prior BOS (P 0.45). After paramyxovirus infection, 8 of 24 patients developed new-onset BOS, whereas no case was recorded after rhinovirus and coronavirus infection. DISCUSSION Surveillance detected CARV in LTx outpatients infrequently. Symptomatic CARV-infection increases the risk for new onset of BOS, but not progression. Risk to develop BOS was especially increased after paramyxovirus infection.","Gottlieb, Jens; Schulz, Thomas F; Welte, Tobias; Fuehner, Thomas; Dierich, Martin; Simon, Andre R; Engelmann, Ilka",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0b013e3181a4857d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19461490/,54

In this study, we aimed to show that the surgical treatment of COVID-19 (-) colorectal cancer patients can be performed in a hospital which was declared as a pandemic hospital. METHOD In our study, we included patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in the general surgery clinic between the dates 03.20.2020 and 05.20.2020, when the hospital was declared COVID-19 pandemic hospital. Emergency colorectal cancer surgeries such as ileus and perforation were excluded from the study. RESULTS While in the status of pandemic hospital, 80 COVID-19 (+) and 563 COVID-19 (+) suspicious patients were treated. Between 10 March 2020 and 15 May 2020, 12 colorectal cancer patients were operated in the General Surgery Clinic of BAIBU Faculty of Medicine, as well. CONCLUSION We think that with our study we have shown that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the surgical treatment can be performed for patients with colorectal cancer by eliminating COVID-19 suspicions (Tab. 1, Ref. 14).","Catal, O; Ozer, B; Sit, M",Bratislavske lekarske listy,https://doi.org/10.4149/bll_2021_049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729824/,54

This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of chronic feelings of emptiness in BPD, identify key findings, and clarify differences between chronic feelings of emptiness and related constructs like depression, hopelessness, and loneliness. METHOD A PRISMA guided systematic search of the literature identified empirical studies with a focus on BPD or BPD symptoms that discussed chronic feelings of emptiness or a related construct. RESULTS Ninety-nine studies met criteria for inclusion in the review. Key findings identified there were significant difficulties in defining and measuring chronic emptiness. However, based on the studies reviewed, chronic emptiness is a sense of disconnection from both self and others. When experienced at frequent and severe levels, it is associated with low remission for people with BPD. Emptiness as a construct can be separated from hopelessness, loneliness and intolerance of aloneness, however more research is needed to explicitly investigate these experiences. Chronic emptiness may be related to depressive experiences unique to people with BPD, and was associated with self-harm, suicidality, and lower social and vocational function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS We conclude that understanding chronic feelings of emptiness is central to the experience of people with BPD and treatment focusing on connecting with self and others may help alleviate a sense of emptiness. Further research is required to provide a better understanding of the nature of chronic emptiness in BPD in order to develop ways to quantify the experience and target treatment.

Factors associated with difficult and incomplete colonoscopy include a poor bowel preparation, severe diverticulosis, redundant colon, looping, adhesions, young and female patients, patient discomfort, and the expertise of the endoscopist. For difficult colonoscopy, focusing on bowel preparation techniques, appropriate sedation and adjunct techniques such as water immersion, abdominal pressure techniques, and patient positioning can overcome many of these challenges. Occasionally, these fail and other alternatives to incomplete colonoscopy have to be considered. If patients have low risk of polyps, then noninvasive imaging options such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) colonography can be considered. Novel applications such as Colon Capsule™ and Check-Cap are also emerging. In patients in whom a clinically significant lesion is noted on a noninvasive imaging test or if they are at a higher risk of having polyps, balloon-assisted colonoscopy can be performed with either a single- or double-balloon enteroscope or colonoscope. The application of these techniques enables complete colonoscopic examination in the vast majority of patients.","Villa, Nicolas A; Pannala, Rahul; Pasha, Shabana F; Leighton, Jonathan A",Current gastroenterology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11894-015-0468-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26374654/,54

Zinc deficiency impairs overall immune function and resultantly increases susceptibility to infection. Thus, zinc is considered as an immune-boosting supplement for populations with hypozincemia at high-risk for infection. Besides its role as a structural cofactor of many proteins, zinc also acts as an intracellular messenger in immune cell signaling. T-cell activation instructs zinc influx from extracellular and subcellular sources through the Zip6 and Zip8 zinc transporters, respectively. Increased cytoplasmic zinc participates in the regulation of T-cell responses by modifying activation signaling. However, the mechanism underlying the activation-dependent movement of zinc ions by Zip transporters in T cells remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Zip6, one of the most abundantly expressed Zip transporters in T cells, is mainly localized to lipid rafts in human T cells and is recruited into the immunological synapse in response to TCR stimulation. This was demonstrated through confocal imaging of the interaction between CD4+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Further, immunoprecipitation assays show that TCR triggering induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Zip6, which has at least three putative tyrosine motifs in its long cytoplasmic region, and this phosphorylation is coupled with its physical interaction with Zap70. Silencing Zip6 reduces zinc influx from extracellular sources and suppresses T-cell responses, suggesting an interaction between Zip6-mediated zinc influx and TCR activation. These results provide new insights into the mechanism through which Zip6-mediated zinc influx occurs in a TCR activation-dependent manner in human CD4+ T cells.","Kim, Bonah; Kim, Hee Young; Lee, Won-Woo",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.687367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394081/,54

METHOD This single-blinded randomized controlled trial at two hospital units in Norway included women with faecal incontinence following OASIS. Eligible women who had had a successful percutaneous nerve evaluation were randomly assigned to SNM or Permacol®. The primary outcome was the difference in the St Mark's incontinence score between baseline and 6 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in the disease-specific quality of life (FIQL) and urinary incontinence (ICIQ-UI-SF) scores. RESULTS Fifty-eight women were randomly assigned to SNM (n = 30) and Permacol® (n = 28). The reduction in the St Mark's score between baseline and 6 months was 11.2 (SD 5.3) in the SNM group vs 2.3 (SD 5.0) in the Permacol® group, resulting in a difference of 8.9 (95% CI: 6.1-11.7, P < 0.0001). The differences in the four scales of FIQL (lifestyle, coping, depression, embarrassment) were 0.90 (95% CI: 0.50-1.30, P < 0.001), 1.05 (0.62-1.47, P < 0.001), 0.52 (95% CI: 0.16-0.87, P = 0.005) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.50-1.40, P < 0.001), respectively, in favour of SNM. The difference in the ICIQ-UI-SF was 5.0 (95% CI: 1.97-8.02, P = 0.002) in favour of SNM. There were nine minor adverse events in the SNM group compared with seven in the Permacol® group (P = 0.77).

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed an analysis of the indications for bariatric surgery based on national clinical and commissioning guidelines, current utilization of surgery, characteristics of patients who underwent surgery, and reimbursement tariffs in Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. Data were obtained from national patient registries, administrative databases, and published literature for the year 2012. RESULTS Despite clear consensus outlined in clinical guidelines, significant differences were found in the eligibility criteria for surgery. Patients with no significant comorbidities were deemed eligible if they had a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or 50 kg/m(2) in Denmark. Irrespective of the country, patients with comorbidities were eligible if they had a BMI of 35 kg/m(2). The highest utilization of bariatric surgery (number of surgeries per 1 M population) was observed in Belgium (928), Sweden (761), and France (571) while Italy (128), England (117), and Germany (72) had the lowest utilization. There was a strong negative correlation between utilization and average BMI level of the patient population (r = -.909, p = 0.005). The annual per capita spending on surgery differed significantly between countries, ranging from 0.54 in Germany to 4.33 in Belgium.

In this study, the established fast-track respiratory 21 assay (FTD) (fast-track diagnostics, Junglinster Luxembourg) was compared to the new Seegene Allplex assay (Seegene) (Seegene Inc. Seoul, Korea) which offers greater multiplexing as multiple targets can be detected in each fluorescence channel. The Seegene Allplex assay is quicker to perform than previous Seegene respiratory multiplex assays. MATERIALS AND METHODS The assays were evaluated using 199 mostly upper respiratory tract samples. RESULTS A respiratory pathogen was found in 127/199 (63.8%) of samples by the FTD assay and 123/199 (61.8%) using the Seegene assay. Kappa agreement was between 0.87 and 1 for all targets except human bocavirus and adenovirus. CONCLUSION Although the performance of the assays were similar, the Seegene assay had the advantage of simultaneous detection of two gene targets for each of the common Influenza A subtypes, improved throughput of 30 samples per run and automated result analysis. The FTD assay could only test 17 samples per run but validation for use on several different real-time thermal cyclers made it easier to integrate into an existing laboratory system. Both assays were cost effective compared to in-house multiplex PCR respiratory virus screening.","Barratt, Kevin; Anderson, Trevor P; Fahey, Jennifer A; Jennings, Lance C; Werno, Anja M; Murdoch, David R",British journal of biomedical science,https://doi.org/10.1080/09674845.2017.1278885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28367738/,54
101983,Correction to 'SIRT3 consolidates heterochromatin and counteracts senescence'.,2021-08-09,"All sectors of livestock production are in the process of shifting from small populations on many farms to large populations on fewer farms. A concurrent shift has occurred in the number of livestock moved across political boundaries. The unintended consequence of these changes has been the appearance of multifactorial diseases that are resistant to traditional methods of prevention and control. The need to understand complex animal health conditions mandates a shift toward the collection of longitudinal animal health data. Historically, collection of such data has frustrated and challenged animal health specialists. A promising trend in the evolution toward more efficient and effective livestock disease surveillance is the increased use of aggregate samples, e.g. bulk tank milk and oral fluid specimens. These sample types provide the means to monitor disease, estimate herd prevalence, and evaluate spatiotemporal trends in disease distribution. Thus, this article provides an overview of the use of bulk tank milk and pen-based oral fluids in the surveillance of livestock populations for infectious diseases.","Rotolo, Marisa L; Main, Rodger G; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252318000038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29779505/,54
102896,The effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation on corticospinal excitability in chronic incomplete spinal cord injury.,2018,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Mathematical, statistical, and computational models provide insight into the transmission mechanisms and optimal control of healthcare-associated infections. To contextualize recent findings, we offer a summative review of recent literature focused on modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. RECENT FINDINGS The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in the modeling landscape as the healthcare community has raced to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective interventions. Inequities in COVID-19 outcomes have inspired new efforts to quantify how structural bias impacts both health outcomes and model parameterization. Meanwhile, developments in the modeling of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, and other nosocomial infections continue to advance. Machine learning continues to be applied in novel ways, and genomic data is being increasingly incorporated into modeling efforts. SUMMARY As the type and amount of data continues to grow, mathematical, statistical, and computational modeling will play an increasing role in healthcare epidemiology. Gaps remain in producing models that are generalizable to a variety of time periods, geographic locations, and populations. However, with effective communication of findings and interdisciplinary collaboration, opportunities for implementing models for clinical decision-making and public health decision-making are bound to increase.","Stachel, Anna; Keegan, Lindsay T; Blumberg, Seth",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039877/,54

NMDARs are heterotetramers composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, which bind glycine and glutamate, respectively, to activate their ion channels. Despite importance in brain physiology, the precise mechanisms by which activation and inhibition occur via subunit-specific binding of agonists and antagonists remain largely unknown. Here, we show the detailed patterns of conformational changes and inter-subunit and -domain reorientation leading to agonist-gating and subunit-dependent competitive inhibition by providing multiple structures in distinct ligand states at 4 Å or better. The structures reveal that activation and competitive inhibition by both GluN1 and GluN2 antagonists occur by controlling the tension of the linker between the ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane ion channel of the GluN2 subunit. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into NMDAR pharmacology, activation, and inhibition, which are fundamental to the brain physiology.","Chou, Tsung-Han; Tajima, Nami; Romero-Hernandez, Annabel; Furukawa, Hiro",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610085/,54

Postmitotic neurons require microtubules and dynein to move, but the mechanisms by which they contribute to migration are not fully characterized. Using tegmental hindbrain nuclei neurons in zebrafish embryos together with subcellular imaging, optogenetics, and photopharmacology, we show that, in vivo, the centrosome's position relative to the nucleus is not linked to greatest motility in this cell type. Nevertheless, microtubules, dynein, and kinesin-1 are essential for migration, and we find that interference with endosome formation or the Golgi apparatus impairs migration to a similar extent as disrupting microtubules. In addition, an imbalance in the traffic of the model cargo Cadherin-2 also reduces neuronal migration. These results lead us to propose that microtubules act as cargo carriers to control spatiotemporal protein distribution, which in turn controls motility. This adds crucial insights into the variety of ways that microtubules can support successful neuronal migration in vivo.","Theisen, Ulrike; Ernst, Alexander U; Heyne, Ronja L S; Ring, Tobias P; Thorn-Seshold, Oliver; Köster, Reinhard W",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201908040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668451/,54

We sought to ascertain the reach and effects of the advertisements on preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) opinions and decisions in a cohort of youth and young adults at-risk for HIV. DESIGN An online survey was administered to participants enrolled in Keeping it LITE, a prospective US cohort study of ethnically diverse, sexually active, cisgender and transgender persons ages 13-37. METHODS Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential analysis in SAS, and qualitative data via thematic analysis. RESULTS Survey response rate was 51.3% (n = 1485). Mean age at baseline was 24. Previous PrEP use was reported by 43% of respondents and 32.7% reported PrEP use in the past 6 months. Almost half (48.7%) were aware of the lawsuit. Most of these participants (81.3%) reported the advertisements did not impact their PrEP use, but 13.2% decided to not to begin a Truvada-based PrEP regimen and 5.5% decided to stop taking Truvada due to the advertisements claims. Predictors of changing PrEP behavior were lower education and no previous PrEP use. The qualitative analysis revealed the advertisements increased skepticism about safety and benefit of Truvada PrEP and led to greater distrust of the pharmaceutical industry. CONCLUSION The advertisements reached a large, diverse US audience. Disturbingly, 18.7% of PrEP candidates who were aware of the lawsuit attributed not initiating or cessation of a Truvada-based PrEP regimen to exposure to the Truvada lawsuit advertisements.","Serrano, Pedro A; Daubert, Elizabeth; Munoz, Alejandro; Hosek, Sybil G; French, Audrey L",AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000002728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031102/,54

METHODS Indigenous people (17-24 years) participated in face-to-face interviews or online Facebook conversations. Discussions were informed by the Integrated Model of Behaviour Change exploring perceptions of self, health and wellbeing, social media use, decision making around health and environmental influences on their health. Interviews and online conversations were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Eighteen young Indigenous Australians participated. Three themes were identified (1) Family and community connection in constructing health beliefs; (2) Individual health-seeking behaviours, mental health status and the importance of physical activity; and (3) peers and others were key influencers of health behaviour on social media. CONCLUSIONS Social connection and social media may provide platforms for young Indigenous people to facilitate exchange of culturally relevant information and encourage behaviour change alongside family, peer and community support.

126850,Blood transfusion in cats: ABCD guidelines for minimising risks of infectious iatrogenic complications.,2015,"OBJECTIVES To present the various techniques used in the management of pancreatitis-related pseudoaneurysms of visceral vessels. METHODS The retrospective clinical study was carried out at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology at Poznan University of Medical Sciences from 2011 to 2016. The fifteen patients included in the study were diagnosed with pseudoaneurysms of visceral arteries, as a complication of chronic pancreatitis. The diagnosis was made using contrast-enhanced computed tomography, followed by angiography. On admission, all patients were symptomatic, with varying degrees of abdominal pain. One patient was haemodynamically unstable. Treatments with endovascular techniques were analysed, along with their efficacy and outcomes. Coil embolisation was performed in 5 patients. Stent graft was used in 1 patient. Liquid embolic agents were used in 7 cases, of which 5 patients were treated with thrombin injection and 2 with Squid. A combination of techniques was used in 2 patients. RESULTS The most common artery affected by pseudoaneurysm formation was the splenic artery (7/15; 46.7%), and the size of the pseudoaneurysms ranged from 27 mm to 85 mm. Primary technical success was achieved in 14 out of 15 patients (93.3%). One patient required reintervention. Two patients required splenectomy after embolisation due to splenic ischemia. No recanalisation was present at the follow-up computed tomography performed after 1 to 3 weeks, and no mortality was observed within 30 days. CONCLUSION Vascular complications of pancreatitis require accurate diagnosis and immediate treatment. Endovascular intervention is highly effective and is the preferred treatment option. The technique used is determined based on vascular anatomy and the patient's haemodynamic status.","Zabicki, Bartosz; Limphaibool, Nattakarn; Holstad, Marte Johanne Veilemand; Juszkat, Robert",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29377944/,54

Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms include coughing, fever, myalgia, shortness of breath, and acute inflammatory lung injury (ALI). In contrast, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure occur in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. ARDS is mediated, at least in part, by a dysregulated inflammatory response due to excessive levels of circulating cytokines, a condition known as the ""cytokine-storm syndrome."" Currently, there are FDA-approved therapies that attenuate the dysregulated inflammation that occurs in COVID-19 patients, such as dexamethasone or other corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, including sarilumab, tocilizumab, and siltuximab. However, the efficacy of these treatments have been shown to be inconsistent. Compounds that activate the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuate ARDS/inflammatory lung injury by decreasing the extracellular levels of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the airways and the circulation. It is possible that HMGB1 may be an important mediator of the ""cytokine-storm syndrome."" Notably, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, and there is a significant negative correlation between HMGB1 plasma levels and clinical outcomes. Nicotine can activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, which attenuates the up-regulation and the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Therefore, we hypothesize that low molecular weight compounds that activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as nicotine or GTS-21, may represent a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the dysregulated inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19.","Gauthier, Alex G; Lin, Mosi; Wu, Jiaqi; Kennedy, Thomas P; Daley, Lee-Anne; Ashby, Charles R; Mantell, Lin L",Journal of immunotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1547691x.2021.1875085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860730/,54

Their involvement in various diseases like viral infections and cancer is of great interest for drug research. Due to their localization in the endo-lysosomal system and the lack of cell permeable activators, complex techniques were required for studying channel functions. Here we review the first published lipophilic small molecule activators of TPCs. In independent high-throughput screens, several new agonists were discovered, which now allow simple and fast investigation of TPCs in more detail in intact cells and in vivo. Zhang et al. identified tricyclic and phenothiazine anti-depressants as TPC1 and 2 activators by screening a library of approved drugs. In contrast, Gerndt et al. screened an extensive compound library with mostly new chemotypes and drug structures. The latter resulted in two structurally distinct high affinity agonists, which are able to selectively activate TPC2 in either an NAADP- or PI(3,5)P2 -like manner. Here, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the identified molecules and their structural features.

In case of failure of stent-retriever thrombectomy, rescue stent angioplasty might be the only treatment option to achieve permanent recanalization. This study aims at identifying predictors for poor outcome and complications in a large, multicenter cohort receiving rescue stent angioplasty. Methods and Results We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with large vessel occlusion who were treated with rescue stent angioplasty after stent-retriever thrombectomy between 2012 and 2018 in 7 neurovascular centers. We defined 2 binary outcomes: (1) functional clinical outcome (good modified Rankin Scale, 0-2; and poor modified Rankin Scale, 4-6) and (2) early symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Impacts of clinical, radiological, and interventional parameters on outcomewere assessed in uni- and multivariable logistic regression models. Two hundred ten patients were included with target vessels located within the anterior circulation (136 of 210; 64.8%) and posterior circulation (74 of 210; 35.2%). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occured in 22 patients, 86.4% (19 of 22) after anterior and 13.6% (3 of 22) after posterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Good functional outcome was observed in 44.8% (73 of 163). A higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission (adjusted odds ratio, 1.10; P=0.002), a higher premorbid modified Rankin Scale (adjusted odds ratio, 2.02; P=0.049), and a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 0 to 2a after stenting (adjusted odds ratio, 23.24; P<0.001) were independent predictors of poor functional outcome. Conclusions Use of rescue stent angioplasty can be considered for acute intracranial large vessel occlusion in cases after unsuccessful stent-retriever thrombectomy. Likelihood of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage is higher in anterior circulation stroke.","Stracke, Christian Paul; Fiehler, Jens; Meyer, Lukas; Thomalla, Götz; Krause, Lars Udo; Lowens, Stephan; Rothaupt, Jan; Kim, Byung Moon; Heo, Ji Hoe; Yeo, Leonard L L; Andersson, Tommy; Kabbasch, Christoph; Dorn, Franziska; Chapot, Rene; Hanning, Uta",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.012795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122218/,54

MATERIALS AND METHODS The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. From January 2007 to December 2013, 102 patients underwent RFA of metachronous CRLM were enrolled in this study with propensity score matching method. Recurrence rate (RR) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed between two patients cohorts with primary left-side colorectal cancer (LSCRC) or primary right-side colon cancer (RSCC). RESULTS The total RR was 59.8% in all patients. Patients in LSCRC cohort had lower RR and non-local recurrence (NLR) rate than those in RSCC patients' cohort (49.0 vs 70.6%, p = 0.026 and 21.6 vs 41.2%, p = 0.033). Five-year OS was 14 and 30% for RSCC and LSCRC, respectively. There was a significant difference between two cohorts in median OS (29.4 vs 40.3 months for RSCC and LSCRC, respectively, p = 0.042). Univariate analysis showed that primary tumor side, the number of liver metastases, tumor size, carcinoembryonic antigen level, differentiation, TNM stage, active chemotherapy and RFA boundary were significant in predicting OS. When these variables were subsequently entered in a multivariate model, RSCC (p < 0.001; hazard ratio [HR], 6.2) and tumor size (> 3 cm) (p = 0.006; HR, 3.9) were significant.

By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity.

The characteristics of this cohort of patients, including the risk of bleeding and the need for systemic anticoagulation, are generally considered as relative contraindications to ECMO treatment. However, recent evidence suggests that the use of ECMO should be taken in consideration even in this group of patients. RECENT FINDINGS The recent findings suggest that venous-venous ECMO can be feasible in the treatment of refractory respiratory failure and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome trauma-related. The improvement of ECMO techniques including the introduction of centrifugal pumps and heparin-coated circuits are progressively reducing the amount of heparin required; moreover, the application of heparin-free ECMO showed good outcomes and minimal complications. Venous-arterial ECMO has emerged as a salvage intervention in patients with cardiogenic shock and after cardiac arrest. Venous-arterial ECMO provides circulatory support allowing time for other treatments to promote recovery in presence of acute cardiopulmonary failure. Only poor-quality evidence is available, for venous-arterial ECMO in trauma patients. SUMMARY ECMO can be considered as a safe rescue therapy even in trauma patients, including neurological injury, chest trauma as well as burns. However, evidence is still poor; further studies are warranted focusing on trauma patients undergoing ECMO, to better clarify the effect on survival, the type and dose of anticoagulation to use, as well as the utility of dedicated multidisciplinary trauma-ECMO units.","Della Torre, Valentina; Robba, Chiara; Pelosi, Paolo; Bilotta, Federico",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30817400/,54

In recent years, more and more articles have been published demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Hence, for this reason, we present this randomized prospective study to compare the 2 techniques. METHODS Between September 2009 and December 2010, a total of 184 patients with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis and indicated for surgery were included in the study, of whom, 91 received an appendectomy via a single umbilical incision and 93 via conventional laparoscopy. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital (Murcia). The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with inscription number NCT0151529. All the operations were performed by the same team of surgeons. RESULTS As far as the demographical results of the study population are concerned, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups for age, weight, sex, body mass index, and removed appendix type. Operating time was longer with the single-port approach: 38.13 ± 13.49 versus 32.12 ± 12.44 minutes (P = 0.02). Significant differences were observed for postoperative pain, which was measured on the visual analog scale, with less pain reported in the single-incision group: 2.76 ± 1.64 versus 3.78 ± 1.76 (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for early and late complications and lengths of hospital stay measured in postoperative hours. CONCLUSIONS The transumbilical single-port approach is seen as a feasible technique for performing appendectomy. It does not increase the rate of complications and represents a possible alternative to conventional laparoscopic appendectomy.","Frutos, Ma Dolores; Abrisqueta, Jesus; Lujan, Juan; Abellan, Israel; Parrilla, Pascual",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e318278d225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23386239/,54

We interviewed 18 administrators and 43 staff working at 27 facilities about the relocation process for residents from two facilities that lost their Medicare and State Medicaid certification due to ongoing care deficiencies. Thematic analysis revealed three major themes throughout each aspect of the relocation process: (a) staff expectations were not met, (b) barriers/challenges were persistent, and (c) resident/family involvement was minimal. We offer proactive participant-derived recommendations for policy and practice to strengthen involuntary relocation processes to ensure a cooperative work environment and residents' well-being, regardless of the cause for involuntary closure.","Weaver, Raven H; Roberto, Karen A; Brossoie, Nancy; Teaster, Pamela B",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464820952253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844726/,54

Tuberculosis (TB) is already existing as unprecedented pandemic worldwide over several years. Both diseases have many overlapping features but there are striking differences too. There is usually chronicity of symptoms in TB as compared to acute or rapid progression in COVID-19. Little evidence exists regarding TB and COVID-19 coinfection. It is anticipated that person with TB either in active, previously treated or latent forms are more at risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19. The relationship between the two diseases is still unclear at present, and more studies are needed to enable analyses of interactions and determinants of outcomes in patients affected by both the diseases. Most of the countries across the world imposed nationwide lockdown to promote social distancing, which is one important preventive measure to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. However, it becomes quite challenging to ensure smooth functioning of programmatic services, leading to disruption of routine TB care, leading to transmission of infection. Health authorities should frame polices that can support TB patients by providing diagnostic, management and prevention services without any interruption during this era of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Effort should be made to control both the diseases simultaneously and avoid unfavourable outcome in near future.","Singh, Abhijeet; Prasad, Rajendra; Gupta, Ayush; Das, Kamanasish; Gupta, Nikhil",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697060/,54

Methods: Descriptive epidemiological methods were used to analyze the general characteristics of all the close contacts of COVID-19 cases in a city. Throat swabs were collected from the close contacts for real-time fluorescent RT-PCR. The confirmed cases were diagnosed according to diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (trial version 5). Results: Among the 1 665 close contacts of COVID-19 cases in a city, 10 were diagnosed as COVID-19 cases during the medical observation period, accounting for 30.30% of all the confirmed cases in a city, most of them were close relatives of the confirmed cases. The longest contact time with the confirmed cases was 8 days and the shortest was 0 days. Ten COVID-19 cases in close contacts constituted to six family clusters. Conclusions: In COVID-19 prevention and control in a city, the active tracking of the transmission chains of the confirmed cases and timely identification of the close contacts were conducted. The people who had close contacts with the confirmed COVID-19 cases within 14 days before onset were all placed under medical observation, which played a key role in the effective prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic in a city. Nearly one third of COVID-19 cases occurred during the medical observation period, so the infection sources were effectively controlled and transmission routes were effectively blocked, which greatly facilitated the prevention of the clusters of COVID-19 cases.","Ma, Q L; Li, P; Chen, X L; Wu, Z J; Liu, C P; Wang, X X; Wu, W J; Li, H Y",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200227-00197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378812/,54

Developed with the goal of helping translate the rapid advances in the field of microscopy and microscopy-enabled methods, including those powered by deep learning, we envision Squid will simplify roll-out of microscopy-based applications - including at point of care and in low resource settings, make adoption of new or otherwise advanced techniques easier, and significantly increase the available microscope-hours to labs.","Li, Hongquan; Krishnamurthy, Deepak; Li, Ethan; Vyas, Pranav; Akireddy, Nibha; Chai, Chew; Prakash, Manu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.424613,54
183445,Background paper. Advances in the study of MHV infection of mice.,1990,"Abstract Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a process in which a part is typically fabricated by depositing materials layer by layer. Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing Process (PBFAM) is one type of AM process which utilizes a high energy laser source to heat and fuse metal powders into a solid part. The constant cycle of heating and cooling in each layer causes thermal deformation associated with residual stresses that reduce the geometric accuracy of the build. To remedy this problem, a compensation algorithm is presented in this paper which modifies the native NURBS CAD geometry of the part to counteract the thermal distortion. An inherent strain-based fast distortion prediction model is used to predict the thermal distortion of the part. The resulting distorted FEA nodes are used to construct a NURBS based compensated geometry using nonlinear least square fitting approach using the original NURBS parameters. Compensating the native NURBS geometry of the model provides more accuracy for the part build rather than compensating STL models. Validation of the algorithm is performed using two case studies by comparing the thermal deformation of pre and post compensated NURBS geometries. The accuracy and robustness of the algorithm for achieving geometric tolerances are further assessed by comparing the flatness and cylindricity tolerances values of the part feature from the two case studies.","Zhang, Botao; Li, Lun; Anand, Sam",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315559; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315559,54

We drew upon the BCW approach, incorporating the theoretical domains framework (TDF) and the behaviour change technique taxonomy (BCTT) to systematically specify potential intervention components that may optimise the packs. Methods: A behaviour change wheel analysis built upon prior thematic analyses of qualitative data collected through focus groups and interviews with members of the public and people recruited from sexual health clinics in Glasgow and London (n=56). Salient barriers and facilitators to specific sequential behavioural domains associated with wider behavioural system of pack-use were subjected to further analyses, coding them in relation to the TDF, the BCWs intervention functions, and finally specifying potential optimisation in relation to behaviour change techniques (BCTs). Results: Our TDF analysis suggested that across the overall behavioural system of pack use the most important theoretical domains were beliefs about consequences and memory, attention and decision-making. BCW analysis on the overall pack suggested useful intervention functions should focus on environmental restructuring, persuasion, enablement, education and modelling. Ways of optimising the intervention were also specified in relation to potentially useful behaviour change techniques (BCTs). Conclusions: A detailed behavioural analysis building on earlier qualitative work using the TDF and the BCW provided a systematic approach to optimising an existing intervention. The approach enabled the specification of highly specific, evidence-based, and theoretically informed recommendations for intervention optimisation.","Flowers, P.; Vojt, G.; Pothoulaki, M.; Mapp, F.; Woode-Owusu, M.; Cassell, J.

Spreading of the COVID-19 epidemic highlighted a number of new challenges related to protecting the health of first-line emergency and specialized medical personnel, as the high incidence of COVID-19 among healthcare workers can lead to risks of health system collapse. At the same time, in the interests of personnel safety, robotic technologies can be applied for heavy and dangerous works of air disinfection in enclosed medical environments. Intention: To present current views on robotic air disinfection of enclosed medical environments based on the analysis of robot prototypes developed to counteract the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methodology. Analysis of tasks related to maintaining a safe working environment for healthcare professionals was based on the description of the functionality and specifications of robots designed to decontaminate the working environment of medical personnel deployment. When systematizing solutions for robot design, the main criteria used were the selection of control modes (Automatic, Supervisory, Manual and their combinations), hardware for disinfection in the external environment and in premises, and features of Human-Machine interaction for the safety of robotic support in enclosed medical premises. Results and Discussion. The features of using service (disinfection) robots are formulated based on epidemiological knowledge of the primary transmission routes and methods of disinfection of premises. It is shown that the tactical and technical characteristics of existing models of Autonomous mobile robots are mainly aimed at implementing unmanned technologies. Solving problems of massive processing of objects of the external environment, as well as vast areas of airports, stadiums, hypermarkets, warehouses, vehicles in a reasonable time involves automatic modes and/or Supervisory control of such robots by the operator in remote mode. The use of disinfection robots in enclosed medical premises requires additional consideration of the factor of introducing robots into the social environment. From these positions and on the basis of the selected prototypes, the prospects are considered for using a group of small mobile robots equipped with systems that enhance sensory and communication capabilities in the work environment. Conclusion. Using robots to reduce risks of the SARS-CoV-2 contamination opens the way to improving the working conditions of healthcare professionals who are at risk of COVID-19. The proposed methods of robotic disinfection of medical premises also help reduce the mental strain of being in a dangerous environment by expanding robotic support for decontamination of premises and flexible response to changes in the environment. © 2021 Nikiforov Russian Center of Emergency and Radiation Medicine, EMERCOM of Russia.

184162,Adverse effects of feline IL-12 during DNA vaccination against feline infectious peritonitis virus.,2002,"Humans differ in their capability to judge the accuracy of their own choices via confidence judgments. Signal detection theory has been used to quantify the extent to which confidence tracks accuracy via M-ratio, often referred to as metacognitive efficiency. This measure, however, is static in that it does not consider the dynamics of decision making. This could be problematic because humans may shift their level of response caution to alter the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Such shifts could induce unaccounted-for sources of variation in the assessment of metacognition. Instead, evidence accumulation frameworks consider decision making, including the computation of confidence, as a dynamic process unfolding over time. We draw on evidence accumulation frameworks to examine the influence of response caution on metacognition. Simulation results demonstrate that response caution has an influence on M-ratio. We then tested and confirmed that this was also the case in human participants who were explicitly instructed to either focus on speed or accuracy. We next demonstrated that this association between M-ratio and response caution was also present in an experiment without any reference towards speed. The latter finding was replicated in an independent dataset. In contrast, when data were analyzed with a novel dynamic measure of metacognition, which we refer to as v-ratio, in all of the three studies there was no effect of speed-accuracy tradeoff. These findings have important implications for research on metacognition, such as its measurement, domain-generality, individual differences, and neural correlates.","Desender, Kobe; Vermeylen, Luc; Verguts, Tom",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.29.360453,54

Design: Weighted prevalence estimates of students e-cigarette use using the 2014-2019 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS). For each year, t-tests for significance were used to compare estimates with those from the preceding year; t-tests were not performed on data for 2019 due to the change in survey format from paper to electronic. Setting: The NYTS is an annual school-based cross-sectional survey of US middle school (MS) and high school (HS) students. Participants: 117,472 students. Measurements: Self-report of past 30 day e-cigarette use based on students smoking status. Smoking status is assessed by asking if students have ever tried smoking, even one or two puffs, with never smokers responding no. Former smokers respond yes but have not smoked at all in the past 30 days. Current smokers used cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days. Frequent e-cigarette use is defined as use on 20 or more days in the past month. Findings: Past 30-day and frequent e-cigarette use increased among never, former, and current smoker youth from 2014-2019. In 2019, a greater proportion of current smokers used e-cigarettes frequently (HS = 46.1%, 95% CI: 39.1, 53.2; MS = 27.4%, 95% CI: 21.1, 33.6) compared to former smokers (HS = 23.2%, 95% CI: 18.1, 28.2; MS = 10.9%, 95% CI: 6.1, 15.7) and never smokers (HS = 3.7%, 95% CI: 3.0, 4.3; MS = 0.7%, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.9).

184802,Rapid diagnosis of TGEV-like coronavirus in fattened pigs by indirect immunofluorescence labelling in nasal cells.,1989,"Background: COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been suggested to induce autoimmune phenomena. Multiple studies have reported the presence of autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19. Also the presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and flaring of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after COVID-19 has been described.[1, 2] Furthermore, in rheumatology clinics patients may present with polyarthritis compatible with RA shortly after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is unclear how often ACPA occur after COVID-19 and whether preceding COVID-19 impacts on disease presentation of RA and phenotype of the ACPA response. Objectives: This study aims to determine the seroprevalence of ACPA after COVID-19 and to investigate the association between preceding COVID-19 infection and disease presentation of new-onset RA, including clinical phenotype and autoantibody response. Methods: To estimate the prevalence of ACPA after COVID-19 we measured ACPA IgG in samples from 61 patients visiting the specialized post-COVID outpatient clinic of the LUMC 5 weeks after hospitalization, using routine tests or in-house ELISA. Furthermore, we identified 5 patients presenting with polyarthritis compatible with RA after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study the impact of COVID-19 on disease presentation, we examined clinical phenotype, autoantibody isotype positivity and ACPA IgG variable domain (V-domain) glycosylation of these patients and compared these features to regular RA patients. Autoantibody isotypes, including rheumatoid factor (RF) IgM/IgA, anti-CCP2 IgG/ IgM/ IgA and anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarP) IgG were measured using in-house ELISA's. The percentage of V-domain glycosylation of purified ACPA IgG was measured with UHPLC. Results: None of the 61 post-COVID patients tested positive for ACPA 5 weeks after hospitalization, except two patients previously diagnosed with ACPA-positive RA. Thus, we could not observe an increase in ACPA-positivity shortly after COVID-19. Of the 5 patients who developed polyarthritis compatible with RA after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the average age was 63.6 years and 2/5 were female. 4/5 patients had been hospitalized due to severe COVID-19. On average, joint complaints started 6.6 weeks after infection, although two patients reported symptoms before infection. 4/5 patients fulfilled the ACR 2010 criteria for RA. Three patients (patient 1, 4, 5) were phenotypically very similar to regular new-onset RA patients. Patient 3 had a history of seronegative RA and had been in DMARD-free remission for 5 years. She flared 6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient 2 had a remarkably different presentation. He was admitted with a suspected septic polyarthritis or pneumonia with reactive polyarthritis 6 weeks after COVID-19. ACPA level was low positive. The patient died unexpectedly after two days and autopsy revealed dilating myocarditis of unclear underlying cause. No causative pathogen could be identified. Previous studies have shown that RA-patients are most often either seronegative or triple-positive for RF, ACPA and anti-CarP antibodies. Autoantibody measurements on sera of the post-COVID polyarthritis patients revealed a similar pattern (Figure 1A) with two patients being completely seronegative, and three patients positive for a range of autoantibodies. In all post-COVID samples, the percentage of ACPA IgG V-domain glycosylation was significantly increased compared to total IgG (Figure 1B), similar as in regular RA. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that the seroprevalence of ACPA is not increased post-COVID and that most patients presenting with polyarthritis after COVID-19 resemble regular RA patients, both regarding clinical phenotype and autoantibody characteristics. Although sample size and follow-up was limited, it appears that RA post-COVID may be coincidence rather than connected.","Derksen, V.; Kissel, T.; Lamers-Karnebeek, F.; Van Der Bijl, A.; Venhuizen, A.

184830,Coronaviruses use discontinuous extension for synthesis of subgenome-length negative strands.,1995,"Background Vaccines comprising recombinant subunit proteins are well-suited to low-cost and high-volume production for global use. The design of manufacturing processes to produce subunit vaccines depends, however, on the inherent biophysical traits presented by an individual antigen of interest. New candidate antigens typically require developing custom processes for each one and may require unique steps to ensure sufficient yields without product-related variants. Results We describe a holistic approach for the molecular design of recombinant protein antigens—considering both their manufacturability and antigenicity—informed by bioinformatic analyses such as RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and sequence-based prediction tools. We demonstrate this approach by engineering the product sequences of a trivalent non-replicating rotavirus vaccine (NRRV) candidate to improve titers and mitigate product variants caused by N-terminal truncation, hypermannosylation, and aggregation. The three engineered NRRV antigens retained their original antigenicity and immunogenicity, while their improved manufacturability enabled concomitant production and purification of all three serotypes in a single, end-to-end perfusion-based process using the biotechnical yeast Komagataella phaffii. Conclusions This study demonstrates that molecular engineering of subunit antigens using advanced genomic methods can facilitate their manufacturing in continuous production. Such capabilities have potential to lower the cost and volumetric requirements in manufacturing vaccines based on recombinant protein subunits.","Dalvie, Neil C.; Brady, Joseph R.; Crowell, Laura E.; Tracey, Mary Kate; Biedermann, Andrew M.; Kaur, Kawaljit; Hickey, John M.; Kristensen, D.

Despite the high burden caused by these viruses, the factors required for the establishment and ongoing transmission in humans are not well understood, hampering efforts for pandemic preparedness. To help understand those adaptations required to cross the species barrier, we serially passaged endemic human coronavirus 229E isolates in a newly established Rhinolophus (horseshoe bat) kidney cell line. Here we report extensive mutations, including deletions, in the virus genome that result in the loss of spike protein expression, while maintaining the capability to infect bat cells. While we observed a loss of infectivity of human cells for all viruses with spike deletions, one isolate (2613) with an insertion that results in an early stop codon, was recovered from human cells. Deep sequencing of isolate 2613 showed that the majority population had acquired additional nucleotide insertions in the spike resulting in an additional codon that restores spike function. Spike-independent replication of coronaviruses provides an alternative route for infection of host species that don’t share common cell-entry receptors.","Linster, Martin; Mah, Marcus G; Low, Dolyce HW; Yan, Zhuang; Jayakumar, Jayanthi; Samsudin, Firdaus; Wong, Foong Ying; Bond, Peter J; Mendenhall, Ian H; Su, Yvonne CF; Smith, Gavin JD",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.460924,54

In this regard, few studies have reported the post-discharge mental health status of COVID-19 survivors. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of COVID-19 survivors and determine the risk factors of adverse psychological outcomes. Methods: This cross-sectional study consisted of 188 COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospital. Data were recorded using social media applications. To evaluate the mental health status, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Depressive Anxiety and Stress Scale 42 (DASS-42) were used. Ordinal regression with a logit link was used to assess the simultaneous effect of variables. Results: The mean age of participants was 56.4 ± 9.6 years, and the majority of patients were male (62.2%). According to HADS, 81 (43.1%) and 24 (12.8%) patients suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively. Using DASS-42, we reported at least a mild degree of depression [23 (12.2%)], anxiety [20 (10.6%)], and stress [74 (39.4%)] among the discharged patients. Depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly associated with length of hospital stay (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, there was a direct association between stress and patients' number of children (β = 0.38, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Depression, anxiety, and stress are relatively high among COVID-19 survivors. Length of hospital stay and number of children were identified as the predisposing factors for adverse psychological outcomes.","Salimi, Z.; Najafi, R.; Khalesi, A.; Oskoei, R.; Moharreri, F.; Khaniki, S.

185268,Structure and encapsidation of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) defective interfering genomes.,1995,"The world has transitioned into a new phase of online learning in response to the recent Covid19 pandemic. Now more than ever, it has become paramount to push the limits of online learning in every manner to keep flourishing the education system. One crucial component of online learning is Knowledge Tracing (KT). The aim of KT is to model student's knowledge level based on their answers to a sequence of exercises referred as interactions. Students acquire their skills while solving exercises and each such interaction has a distinct impact on student ability to solve a future exercise. This \textit{impact} is characterized by 1) the relation between exercises involved in the interactions and 2) student forget behavior. Traditional studies on knowledge tracing do not explicitly model both the components jointly to estimate the impact of these interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware self-attention model for Knowledge Tracing (RKT). We introduce a relation-aware self-attention layer that incorporates the contextual information. This contextual information integrates both the exercise relation information through their textual content as well as student performance data and the forget behavior information through modeling an exponentially decaying kernel function. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, among which two new collections are released to the public, show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods. Furthermore, the interpretable attention weights help visualize the relation between interactions and temporal patterns in the human learning process.","Pandey, Shalini; Srivastava, Jaideep",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12736v1.pdf,54

For both obstetrical and gynaecological services, delivery of care and efficiencies have been affected to accommodate physical distancing principles and ensure staff and patient safety. This study aims to understand the practice impact of COVID-19 on OB/GYNs across Canada, including changes in income and expenses, as well as changes in the health care delivery model. Methods: This is an online survey-based observational study administered to 695 OB/GYNs across Canada. Results: Of the 129 respondents, 84% reported a decrease in monthly revenue, with 17% reporting a significant (>50%) decrease. OB/GYNs with the greatest reduction in revenue were those practicing primarily in gynecology. Reproductive Endocrinologists reported the largest reduction in revenue of all subspecialists. Maternal Fetal Medicine specialists reported to have a stable or increased revenue. Age and gender were not associated with revenue change or use of telemedicine. As well, 93% of OB/GYNs reported a drop in in-person visits and 67% stated that they would continue to provide care through telehealth in the future. Conclusions: The majority of OB/GYNs across the country had to alter their health care delivery model during COVID-19. Practices with a larger percentage of obstetrics had minimal financial impact during the pandemic. These findings suggest that the burden of finances due to COVID-19, changes to the health care delivery model and the way some OB/GYNs will provide care in the future will greatly vary depending on their subspecialty and scope of practice.","Kulshreshtha, A.; Chan, C.; Jones, C.",Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2021.02.057,54

Methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval, 205 anesthesiologists were invited to participate in this study through social media tools and by e-mail. Responses of the participants to survey questions were analysed. Results: Of those who participated in the study 32.7% (n=67) were research assistants and 51.2% (n=105) were specialists.

185890,Characterization of coronavirus DI RNA packaging.,1998,"Microglia, as brain-resident macrophages, play critical roles in brain development, homeostasis, and disease. Microglia in animal models cannot accurately model the properties of human microglia due to notable transcriptomic and functional differences between human and other animal microglia. Efficient generation of microglia from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides unprecedented opportunities to study the function and behavior of human microglia. Particularly, incorporating hPSCs-derived microglia into brain organoids facilitates their development in a 3-dimensional context, mimicking the brain environment. However, an optimized method that integrates an appropriate amount of microglia into brain organoids at a proper time point, resembling in vivo brain development, is still lacking. Here, we report the development of a new brain region-specific, microglia-containing organoid model by co-culturing hPSCs-derived primitive neural progenitor cells (pNPCs) and primitive macrophage progenitors (PMPs). In these organoids, hPSCs-derived pNPCs and PMPs interact with each other and develop into functional neurons, astroglia, and microglia, respectively. Importantly, the numbers of human microglia in the organoids can be controlled, resulting in a cell type ratio similar to that seen in the human brain. Using super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that these human microglia are able to phagocytize neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and apoptotic cells, as well as to prune synapses at different developmental stages of the organoids. Furthermore, these human microglia respond to Zika virus infection of the organoids, as indicated by amoeboid-like morphology, increased expression of gene transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines, and excessive pruning of synaptic materials. Together, our findings establish a new microglia-containing brain organoid model that will serve to study human microglial function in a variety of neurological disorders.","Xu, Ranjie; Boreland, Andrew J.; Li, Xiaoxi; Erickson, Caroline; Jin, Mengmeng; Atkins, Colm; Pang, Zhiping; Daniels, Brian P.; Jiang, Peng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.09.331710,54

This study reports the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during testing conducted at sites serving people experiencing homelessness in Toronto during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored the association between site characteristics and prevalence rates. Methods: The study included individuals who were staying at shelters, encampments, COVID-19 physical distancing sites, and drop-in and respite sites and completed outreach-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the period April 17 to July 31, 2020. We examined test positivity rates over time and compared them to rates in the general population of Toronto. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the relationship between each shelter-level characteristic and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. We also compared the rates across 3 time periods (T1: April 17-April 25; T2: April 26-May 23; T3: May 24-June 25). Results: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 8.5% (394/4657). Site-specific rates showed great heterogeneity with infection rates ranging from 0% to 70.6%. Compared to T1, positivity rates were 0.21 times lower (95% CI: 0.06, 0.75) during T2 and 0.14 times lower (95% CI: 0.043, 0.44) during T3.

185993,Interferon induction in rotavirus and coronavirus infections: a review of recent results.,1983,"The single transmembrane domains (TMDs) of the resident glycosylation enzymes of the Golgi apparatus are involved in preventing these proteins moving beyond the Golgi. It has been proposed that either the TMDs associate, resulting in the formation of large oligomers of Golgi enzymes, or that they mediate the lateral segregation of the enzymes between lipid microdomains. Evidence for either type of interaction has been sought by examining the retention of sialyltransferase (ST), an enzyme of the mammalian trans Golgi. No evidence could be obtained for specific interactions or 'kin recognition' between ST and other proteins of the trans Golgi. Moreover, it is shown that the previously described kin recognition between enzymes of the medial Golgi involves the lumenal portions of these proteins rather than their TMDs. To investigate further the role of the ST TMD, the effects on Golgi retention of various alterations in the TMD were examined. The addition or removal of residues showed that the efficiency of retention of ST is related to TMD length. Moreover, when a type I plasma membrane protein was expressed with a synthetic TMD of 23 leucines it appeared on the cell surface, but when the TMD was shortened to 17 leucines accumulation in the Golgi was observed. These observations are more consistent with lipid-based sorting of ST TMD, but they also allow for reconciliation with the kin recognition model which appears to act on sequences outside of the TMD.","Munro, S",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC394566/,54

Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic or present with mild self-limiting symptoms. While GI symptoms occur with less prevalence, they are increasingly being reported. A diagnosis of Covid-19 has increased dramatically in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting that GI symptoms should be taken into serious consideration with patient diagnosis. Case 1: A 65-year-old man presented to the hospital emergency room with abdominal pain, Murphy's sign and chills without fever, subsequently diagnosed as acute acalculous cholecystitis with a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. Case 2: A 78-year-old woman presented to the hospital emergency room complaining of severe positional epigastric pain precipitated by lying supine, chills with no fever, being later diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. It has become evident that the ACE2 receptor plays a significant role as the entry site into human cells for the virus. This receptor is generally expressed in respiratory cells, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, corresponding with extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Studies concluded that the origin of gastrointestinal symptoms could be caused by the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with cells through the ACE2 receptor. The findings of the present study support this theory, as both patients presented with symptoms regarding tissues with high ACE2 expression.","Hassani, Amir Hossein; Beheshti, Alireza; Almasi, Faezeh; Ketabi Moghaddam, Pardis; Azizi, Mohammadreza; Shahrokh, Shabnam",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244387/,54

The diversity of the variable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region has been analyzed phylogenetically among geographically isolated populations or within subdivisions of the same regional population. However, the genetic differences among several substructures originating from a common population have not yet been investigated. By sequencing fragments of the mtDNA D-loop region from two subpopulations from the Indochinese region (Cambodian-Chinese and Vietnamese) along with two native Indonesian and Filipino populations, we identified 87 mtDNA D-loop haplotypes, of which 67 are new. The phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Indochinese haplotypes are intermingled in comparison to the distinct divergence of the Indonesian and Filipino lineages. The subpopulations were shown by estimation of evolutionary divergence and Wright's F-statistic (Fst) to have little genetic differentiation. Altogether, the subpopulations may be used in biomedical research, even though a slight difference is observed in haplotype frequencies among them. Therefore, genetic diversity analyses will be necessary for the elucidation of genetic differences among the populations, as well as to obtain a better understanding of genetic diversity for biomedical research. This will involve the selection of macaques and the monitoring of genetic heterogeneity among and within breeding facilities.","Shiina, Takashi; Tanaka, Keiko; Katsuyama, Yoshihiko; Otabe, Kouji; Sakamoto, Kengo; Kurata, Masaaki; Nomura, Mamoru; Yamanaka, Hisashi; Nakagawa, Hiroshi; Inoko, Hidetoshi; Ota, Masao",Experimental animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21030784/,54

Seven successive patients were diagnosed by HAdV specific real-time polymerase chain reaction with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage. After the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs from healthcare workers, three nurses working night shifts tested positive for HAdV C including one that had exhibited respiratory signs while working one week before the outbreak. She was the most likely source of the outbreak. Our findings suggest that HAdV-1 could be considered as a possible cause of severe pneumonia even in immunocompetent patients with a potential to cause outbreaks in ICUs. HAdV rapid identification and typing is needed to curtail the spread of this pathogen. Reinforcing hand hygiene with antiseptics with demonstrated activity against non-enveloped viruses and ensuring that HCWs with febrile respiratory symptoms avoid direct patient contact are critical measures to prevent transmission of HAdV in healthcare settings.","Cassir, N; Hraiech, S; Nougairede, A; Zandotti, C; Fournier, P E; Papazian, L",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306980/,54

A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices formulated recommendations for its use in infants and children in February 2000. Vaccination coverage rapidly increased during the second half of 2000, in part through funding by CDC's Vaccines for Children program. Subsequently, active population- and laboratory-based surveillance demonstrated substantial reductions in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among children and adults. In addition, decreases in hospitalizations and ambulatory-care visits for all-cause pneumonia also were reported. To gauge whether the effects of PCV7 on reducing pneumonia continue, CDC is monitoring pneumonia hospitalizations by using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. This report provides an update for 2005 and 2006, the most recent years for which information is available. In 2005 and 2006, the incidence rates for all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations among children aged <2 years were 9.1 per 1,000 and 8.1 per 1,000, respectively. In 2006, the rate for all-cause pneumonia among children aged <2 years was approximately 35% lower than during 1997--1999. Most of this decrease occurred soon after the vaccine was licensed in 2000, and the rates have remained relatively stable since then. The rate for all-cause pneumonia among children aged 2--4 years did not change after PCV7 licensure and has remained stable.

The objective of this study was to determine whether similar appearances can be seen in infant ARDS. DESIGN Case report and retrospective review of infant lung biopsies 1995-2005. SETTING Paediatric and neonatal intensive care units in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS None. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A formerly premature infant with ARDS secondary to respiratory syncytial virus pneumonitis had histopathologic features of AFOP on open lung biopsy. Nine infants from 1995 to 2005 had definite histology of DAD or AFOP and fulfilled American-European Consensus Conference criteria for the diagnosis of ARDS. Of these, classic DAD findings were present in seven, whereas two had features of AFOP and DAD. Features suggesting viral infection were identified in five infants. CONCLUSIONS The histopathologic features of AFOP may be seen in some cases of infant ARDS. The variability in the histopathology of ARDS raises questions as to the pathogenesis and clinical correlates of these different patterns.","Cincotta, Domenic R; Sebire, Neil J; Lim, Emma; Peters, Mark J",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545929/,54

A clinical examination of infected peacocks identified birds with symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, yellowish droppings, airsacculitis, sinusitis, and conjunctivitis, whereas the infected farmers showed high fever and respiratory distress. Immunofluorescence tests detected chlamydial antigens in pharyngeal swabs (12 of 20) and lung tissue samples (four of five) from peacocks. One of four swabs taken from farmers was also positive by the same test. Specific anti-chlamydia immunoglobulin G was detected in 16 of 20 peacocks and four of four peacock farmers. The isolated pathogen was able to grow in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos and McCoy cell lines and was identified as Chlamydiae by immunofluorescence assay and PCR. Avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bronchitis virus were eliminated as potential causative agents after pharyngeal swabs inoculated onto the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonate eggs failed to recover viable virus. PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism indicated the ompA gene from the isolate was similar to that of avian C. psittaci type B. Three-week-old SPF chickens challenged with the peacock isolate via intraperitoneal injection showed a typical pneumonia, airsacculitis, and splenitis. Subsequently, the inoculating strain was recovered from the lungs of challenged birds. This is the first report of C. psittaci infection in peacocks and peacock farmers.","Yang, Junjing; Ling, Yong; Yuan, Jilei; Pang, Wanyong; He, Cheng",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21500640/,54

Infections were diagnosed in parallel by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining using type-specific monoclonal antibodies and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR targeting the gene M (nt 25-124). In addition, virus strains were isolated in MDCK cells. Overall, 37 influenza virus strains were type A, and one type B. Of these, 35 (80.4%) were detected and typed by real-time RT-PCR, 34 (80.1%) by DFA, and 27 (71.0%) by virus isolation. Subtyping of 37 influenza virus A strains by RT-PCR and DFA gave the following results: 4/6 H1 strains were correctly subtyped by both methods, while of the 29 H3 strains subtyped by RT-PCR 7 were missed by DFA. Thus, the overall concordance of the two subtyping methods was 28/37 (75.7%). Viral RNA quantification by real-time PCR showed that when respiratory secretion collection was done within 5 days after the onset of symptoms, viral load was greater than 1 x 10(6) RNA copies/ml. In conclusion, typing and subtyping of influenza virus type A strains may benefit from both MAbs and RT-PCR, while viral RNA quantification may provide an indication of symptom onset.","Percivalle, Elena; Rovida, Francesca; Piralla, Antonio; Rognoni, Vanina; Zavattoni, Maurizio; Baldanti, Fausto; Marchi, Antonietta; Gerna, Giuseppe",The new microbiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843885/,54

This approach is advantageous because high yields, stability and containment are conferred by the accumulation of recombinant proteins in specialized storage compartments such as protein bodies and protein storage vacuoles. Seeds are particularly suitable for the production of pharmaceutical proteins in developing country settings because they reduce the costs of production and distribution by avoiding the need for fermenter-based production capacity and a cold chain for storage and distribution, thus increasing access to critical medicines for the poor in rural areas. Seeds are also ideal for the production of oral vaccine antigens, because encapsulation within the seed provides protection that prolongs exposure to the gastric immune system and thus increases the potency of the immune response.

Recommendations are based on the phases of the disease, because optimal interventions for one phase may not be appropriate for a different phase. The four phases addressed are: Prevention, Infection, Inflammation and Recovery. Underlying this phased approach is recognition of emerging evidence for two different components of pathophysiology, early infection and late stage severe complications. These two aspects of the disease suggest two different patterns of clinical emphasis that seem on the surface to be not entirely concordant. We describe the application of therapeutic strategies and appropriate tactics that address four main stages of disease progression for COVID-19. Emerging evidence in COVID-19 suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may both evade the innate immune response and kill macrophages. Delayed innate immune response and a depleted population of macrophages can theoretically result in a blunted antigen presentation, delaying and diminishing activation of the adaptive immune response. Thus, one clinical strategy involves supporting patient innate and adaptive immune responses early in the time course of illness, with the goal of improving the timeliness, readiness, and robustness of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. At the other end of the disease pathology spectrum, risk of fatality in COVID-19 is driven by excessive and persistent upregulation of inflammatory mechanisms associated with cytokine storm. Thus, the second clinical strategy is to prevent or mitigate excessive inflammatory response to prevent the cytokine storm associated with high mortality risk. Clinical support for immune system pathogen clearance mechanisms involves obligate activation of immune response components that are inherently inflammatory. This puts the goals of the first clinical strategy (immune activation) potentially at odds with the goals of the second strategy(mitigation of proinflammatory effects). This creates a need for discernment about the time course of the illness and with that, understanding of which components of an overall strategy to apply at each phase of the time course of the illness. We review evidence from early observational studies and the existing literature on both outcomes and mechanisms of disease, to inform a phased approach to support the patient at risk for infection, with infection, with escalating inflammation during infection, and at risk of negative sequelae as they move into recovery.","Yanuck, S F; Pizzorno, J; Messier, H; Fitzgerald, K N",Integrative medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425712/,54

Clones were generated from a approximately 22 kb dsRNA purified from lymphoid organ total RNA of GAV-infected prawns. The region contains a single gene comprising two long overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, of 4060 and 2646 amino acids, respectively. The ORFs are structurally related to the ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins of coronaviruses and arteriviruses. The 99 nt overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b contains a putative AAAUUUU 'slippery' sequence associated with -1 ribosomal frameshifting. A 131 nt stem-loop with the potential to form a complex pseudoknot resides 3 nt downstream of this sequence. Although different to the G/UUUAAAC frameshift sites and 'H-type' pseudoknots of nidoviruses, in vitro transcription/translation analysis demonstrated that the GAV element also facilitates read-through of the ORF1a/1b junction. As in coronaviruses, GAV ORF1a encodes a 3C-like cysteine protease domain located between two hydrophobic regions. However, its sequence suggests some structural relationship to the chymotrypsin-like serine proteases of arteriviruses. ORF1b encodes homologues of the 'SDD' polymerase, which among (+)-RNA viruses is unique to nidoviruses, as well as metal-ion-binding and helicase domains. The presence of a dsRNA replicative intermediate and ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins translated by a-1 frameshift suggests that GAV represents the first invertebrate member of the Order NIDOVIRALES:","Cowley, J A; Dimmock, C M; Spann, K M; Walker, P J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10811931/,54

193212,Analysis of coronavirus transcription regulation.,1995,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant health and economic crisis around the world. The U.S. saw a rapid escalation in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths in March, 2020. The financial consequences of a virtual economic shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus are widespread and debilitating, with over 30 million Americans (about 20% of the labor force) filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March. During these unprecedented times, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress and overall fear associated with the virus. DATA To gain an understanding of the overall levels and predictors of psychological distress experienced in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., a survey was administered online to over 2,000 individuals residing in the country. The survey instrument was administered between March 22-26, 2020, during which time the country was suffering through a period of exponential growth in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It was administered via MTurk, a popular crowdsourcing platform increasingly used by social scientists to procure large samples over a brief period of time. A short, valid screening instrument to measure psychological distress in individuals, the Kessler 10 scale was developed in the U.S. in the 1990s as an easy-to-administer symptom assessment. The first dependent variable is the respondents' summated Kessler 10 score. The second dependent variable is a 7-category measure of how afraid the subject is about the novel coronavirus. The final dependent variable is also a 7-category scale, this time measuring self-reported likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. A variety of socio-demographic variables and health status were collected to analyze factors associated with psychological distress and mental health. METHODS Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression was employed to analyze these data. RESULTS We find that protective factors against psychological distress include age, gender (male), and physical health. Factors exacerbating psychological distress include Hispanic ethnicity and a previous mental illness diagnosis. Similar factors are significantly related to fear of the virus and self-assessed likelihood of contracting it. DISCUSSION The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with high levels of psychological distress in the U.S. The Kessler 10 mean value in our sample is 21.12, which falls in the likely to experience mild mental illness category, yet is considerably higher compared to one of the largest and earliest benchmark studies validating the scale. Psychological distress is one element of overall mental health status that could be influenced by the COVID-10 pandemic. Other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders could also be affected by the pandemic. We encourage researchers to examine these and other mental health disorders in future research on the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION The relatively high mean score (21.12) for psychological distress during early stages of the pandemic suggests government officials, policy-makers, and public health advocates should act quickly to address emerging mental health problems.","French, Michael T; Mortensen, Karoline; Timming, Andrew R",The journal of mental health policy and economics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853158/,54

193497,Selective tropism of MHV3 for CNS cells and consequences of MHV3 infection on CNS cells activities.,1987,"The genetic origin, structure, and biochemical properties of the delta antigen (HDAg) of a human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) were investigated. A cDNA fragment containing the open reading frame encoding the HDAg was transcribed into RNA and used for in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The HDAg open reading frame was also inserted into an expression vector containing a simian virus 40 T-antigen promoter and expressed into COS 7 cells. In both systems, a protein species of 26 kilodaltons was synthesized from this open reading frame and could be specifically immunoprecipitated with antisera obtained from patients with delta hepatitis. A similar protein was also synthesized from antigenomic-sense monomeric HDV RNA in both systems, although the efficiency of translation was lower than that of the isolated open reading frame. This protein was found to be phosphorylated at the serine residues. Immunoperoxidase studies with anti-HDV sera demonstrated that the HDAg was expressed mainly in the nuclei of the transfected COS 7 cells. Moreover, the HDAg was shown to bind the genomic RNA of HDV. These studies indicate that HDAg is encoded by the antigenomic-sense RNA of HDV and is a nuclear phosphoprotein associated with an RNA-binding activity.","Chang, M F; Baker, S C; Soe, L H; Kamahora, T; Keck, J G; Makino, S; Govindarajan, S; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3373572/,54
193533,Comparison of serologic assays for measurement of antibody response to coronavirus in cats.,1988,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious respiratory disease, to the best of our knowledge caused by a hitherto unknown corona virus. The virus has spread from South East Asia to many countries of the world. Three case reports of patients from the Prince of Wales Hospital of The Chinese University of Hong Kong demonstrate typical clinical courses. Fever, cough, in most cases non-productive, myalgia, chills, and rigor are the leading symptoms. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are the most prominent laboratory parameters, increased values for lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) reflect a more severe clinical course. Advanced age and coexisting conditions seem to influence the prognosis unfavourably. The chest roentgenogram may be normal initially but at a later stage progressive consolidations in the majority of peripheral parts of the lung are observed, which cannot be differentiated from pneumonias of other origin. Even young patients can enter a stage of respiratory compromise rather fast. A therapy against the cause of the disease is not known. Empirical therapy with ribavirin in combination with high dose corticosteroids have proved successful. The disease may progress into respiratory failure comparable with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mortality is around five to ten per cent. Stringent hygiene and quarantine measures are mandatory to prevent the further spread of this threatening disease.","Hoheisel, G; Wu, A; Lee, N; Chan, C H; Wong, K T; Ahuja, A; Joynt, G M; Chung, S C; Sung, J J Y; Hui, D S",Pneumologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12813666/,54
193619,Antiviral studies of feline infectious peritonitis virus in vitro.,1994,"The 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA regulates the replication of and transcription from the viral RNA. Several host cell proteins have previously been shown to interact with this regulatory region. By immunoprecipitation of UV-cross-linked cellular proteins and in vitro binding of the recombinant protein, we have identified the major RNA-binding protein species as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). A strong hnRNP A1-binding site was located 90 to 170 nucleotides from the 3' end of MHV RNA, and a weak binding site was mapped at nucleotides 260 to 350 from the 3' end. These binding sites are complementary to the sites on the negative-strand RNA that bind another cellular protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB). Mutations that affect PTB binding to the negative strand of the 3'-UTR also inhibited hnRNP A1 binding on the positive strand, indicating a possible relationship between these two proteins. Defective-interfering RNAs containing a mutated hnRNP A1-binding site have reduced RNA transcription and replication activities. Furthermore, hnRNP A1 and PTB, both of which also bind to the complementary strands at the 5' end of MHV RNA, together mediate the formation of an RNP complex involving the 5'- and 3'-end fragments of MHV RNA in vitro. These studies suggest that hnRNP A1-PTB interactions provide a molecular mechanism for potential 5'-3' cross talks in MHV RNA, which may be important for RNA replication and transcription.","Huang, P; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11333880/,54

193930,Susceptibility of murine CNS to OC43 infection.,2001,"BACKGROUND Biological scaffolds must support a complex balance of resisting enzymatic degradation while promoting tissue remodeling. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of in vitro enzymatic exposure on the mechanical properties of biological scaffolds. It was hypothesized that exposure to an enzyme solution would result in decreased tensile strength and that crosslinked scaffolds would resist enzymatic degradation more effectively than noncrosslinked scaffolds. METHODS Nine scaffolds were evaluated (four porcine dermis: Permacol™, CollaMend™, Strattice™, XenMatrix™; two human dermis: AlloMax™, FlexHD(®); two bovine pericardium: Veritas(®), PeriGuard(®); and one porcine small intestine submucosa: Surgisis™). Ten specimens (n = 10) were hydrated in saline at 37 °C and subjected to uniaxial testing to establish baseline properties. 50 specimens (n = 50) were incubated in collagenase solution at 37 °C for 2, 6, 12, 24, or 30 h (n = 10 each group) followed by uniaxial tensile testing. RESULTS Tensile strength was significantly reduced after 30 h for CollaMend™, AlloMax™, Veritas(®), Strattice™, XenMatrix™, Permacol™, and FlexHD(®) (p < 0.01), while PeriGuard(®) demonstrated a slight increase in tensile strength (p = 0.0188). Crosslinked bovine pericardium (PeriGuard(®)) maintained greater tensile strength than noncrosslinked bovine pericardium (Veritas(®)) throughout all exposure periods (p < 0.0001). Similarly, crosslinked porcine dermis (Permacol™) maintained greater tensile strength than noncrosslinked porcine dermis (Strattice™ and XenMatrix™) throughout all exposure periods (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Materials that deteriorate rapidly after in vitro enzymatic exposure may also deteriorate rapidly in vivo, particularly when exposed to a wound environment with elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases. Permacol™, CollaMend™, Strattice™, FlexHD(®), and PeriGuard(®) survived the longest incubation period (30 h) and withstood mechanical testing. XenMatrix™, AlloMax™, Veritas(®), and Surgisis™ degraded more quickly and did not survive the longer exposure periods. Scaffolds that maintain strength characteristics after in vitro collagenase exposure may be advantageous for long-term hernia repair scenarios where elevated enzyme levels are expected.","Annor, Afua H; Tang, Michael E; Pui, Chi Lun; Ebersole, Gregory C; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D; Deeken, Corey R",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22538685/,54

Wistar rats were intranasally inoculated with approximately 10(3) TCID50 of the coronavirus SDAV. Transverse sections of four regions of the nasal cavity from inoculated and control animals were examined by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 days postinoculation (PI). Lesions were observed in the following regions of the upper respiratory tract: respiratory epithelium, transitional epithelium, olfactory epithelium, nasolacrimal duct, vomeronasal organ, and the submucosal glands of the nasal passages. In general, in structures lined by ciliated epithelial cells, there was focal to segmental necrosis with exfoliation of affected cells and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration during the acute stages, progressing to squamous metaplasia during the reparative stages. Repair in these regions was essentially complete by 14 days PI. In the olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ, there was interstitial edema with necrosis and exfoliation of epithelial cells and minimal to moderate inflammatory cell response during the acute stages. Residual reparative lesions were still evident in the olfactory epithelium, the columnar epithelium and neuroepithelium of the vomeronasal organ, and the nasolacrimal duct at 14 days PI. Viral antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in all regions during the acute stages of the disease, with the exception of the vomeronasal organ. In view of these findings, infections of the respiratory tract with viruses such as SDAV could have significant effects on functions such as olfaction and chemoreception for > or = 2 weeks postexposure in this species.","Bihun, C G; Percy, D H",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7725592/,54

Our data analysis shows that direct survey-weighted estimates for small areas could be highly unreliable. In this paper we develop a synthetic estimation method to estimate proportions of mask effectiveness for small areas using a logistic model that combines information from multiple data sources. We select our working model using an extensive data analysis facilitated by a new variable selection criterion for survey data and benchmarking ratios. We propose a Jackknife method to estimate variance of our proposed estimator. From our data analysis. it is evident that our proposed synthetic method outperforms direct survey-weighted estimator with respect to commonly used evaluation measures.","Sen, Aditi; Lahiri, Partha",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012992/,54

This concept, however, went against years of enzyme-substrate binding theory. Hence, acyclic methodology in antiviral drug design did not take off until the discovery and subsequent FDA approval of such analogues as Acyclovir and Tenofovir. More recently, the observation that flexible nucleosides could overcome drug resistance spawned a renewed interest in the field of nucleoside drug design. The next generation of flexible nucleosides shifted the focus from the sugar moiety to the nucleobase. With analogues such as Seley-Radtke ""fleximers"", and Herdewijn's C5 substituted 2'-deoxyuridines, the area of base flexibility has seen great expansion. More recently, the marriage of these methodologies with acyclic sugars has resulted in a series of acyclic flex-base nucleosides with a wide range of antiviral properties, including some of the first to exhibit anti-coronavirus activity.

The hard tick Hyalomma dromedarii Koch, 1844 is a major ectoparasite of livestock in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), of which, the onehumped dromedaries Camelus dromedarius is the most economically and culturally important and a potential reservoir of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) disease. Here we report on the molecular phylogenetic diversity of H. dromedarii collected from camels in the Eastern Province of KSA based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences of the studied ticks identified 11 haplotypes. All H. dromedarii ticks from KSA belonged to eight haplotypes diverged into two distinguished genetic clades (A-B). These results indicate that H. dromedarii ticks from KSA are monophyletic species with two distinguished lineages with low intra-specific genetic divergence and sharply structured isolated populations with high level of genetic differentiation. This is a first report of DNA barcode of H. dromedarii ticks from KSA and the Arabian Peninsula, which is an important step towards broader phylogenetic studies on larger tick samples from the region.

When a trade-off does occur it is difficult to attribute its cause to antagonistic pleiotropy without dissecting the genetic basis of adaptation, and few previous experiments provide these genetic data. Here we investigate the evolution of expanded host range (generalism) in the RNA virus phi6, an experimental model system allowing adaptive mutations to be readily identified. We isolated 10 spontaneous host range mutants on each of three novel Pseudomonas hosts and determined whether these mutations imposed fitness costs on the standard laboratory host. Sequencing revealed that each mutant had one of nine nonsynonymous mutations in the phi6 gene P3, important in host attachment. Seven of these nine mutations were costly on the original host, confirming the existence of antagonistic pleiotropy. In addition to this genetically imposed cost, we identified an epigenetic cost of generalism that occurs when phage transition between host types. Our results confirm the existence in phi6 of two costs of generalism, genetic and environmental, but they also indicate that the cost is not always large. The possibility for cost-free niche expansion implies that varied ecological conditions may favor host shifts in RNA viruses.","Duffy, Siobain; Turner, Paul E; Burch, Christina L",Genetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16299384/,54

The aims of this study were to characterise the viral aetiology of CAP in adults by using an extensive array of viral diagnostic tests and to compare the characteristics of viral pneumonia with those of pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS Adults admitted to Christchurch Hospital over a 1-year period with CAP were included in the study. Microbiological testing methods included blood and sputum cultures, urinary antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, antibody detection in paired sera and detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs by immunofluorescence, culture and PCR. RESULTS Of 304 patients with CAP, a viral diagnosis was made in 88 (29%), with rhinoviruses and influenza A being the most common. Two or more pathogens were detected in 49 (16%) patients, 45 of whom had mixed viral and bacterial infections. There were no reliable clinical predictors of viral pneumonia, although several variables were independently associated with some aetiologies. The presence of myalgia was associated with pneumonia caused by any respiratory virus (OR 3.62, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.12) and influenza pneumonia (OR 190.72, 95% CI 3.68 to 9891.91).

195402,"Altered metabolism, acute shock, and therapeutic response in a calf with severe coronavirus-induced diarrhea.",1980,"Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) in rats and mice. Apoptotic oligodendrocytes have been detected in the vicinity of the CNS demyelinating lesions in these animals. However, whether MHV can directly induce oligodendrocyte apoptosis has not been documented. Here, we established a rat oligodendrocyte culture that is morphologically and phenotypically indistinguishable from the primary rat oligodendrocytes. Using this culture, we showed that mature rat oligodendrocytes were permissive to MHV infection but did not support productive virus replication. Significantly, oligodendrocytes infected with both live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses underwent apoptosis to a similar extent, which was readily detectable at 24 h postinfection as revealed by apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation, indicating that MHV-induced apoptosis is mediated during the early stages of the virus life cycle and does not require virus replication. Prior treatment of cells with the lysosomotropic agents NH(4)Cl and chloroquine as well as the vacuolar proton pump-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, all of which block the acidification of the endosome, prevented oligodendrocytes from succumbing to apoptosis induced by MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that fusion between the viral envelope and cell membranes triggers the apoptotic cascade. Treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk blocked MHV-induced apoptosis, suggesting an involvement of the caspase-dependent pathway. Our results, thus, for the first time provide unequivocal evidence that infection of oligodendrocytes with MHV directly results in apoptosis. This finding provides an explanation for the destruction of oligodendrocytes and the damage of myelin sheath in MHV-infected CNS and suggests that oligodendrocyte apoptosis may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the pathogenesis of MHV-induced demyelinating diseases in animals.","Liu, Yin; Cai, Yingyun; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14581532/,54

However, in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), priority should be given to an early endoscopy. OBJECTIVE The main objective was to compare the time since arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy between both groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study. Data contains information of patients who attended to the hospital with UGIB and underwent an endoscopy between October 19th, 2019 and June 6th, 2020. Patients were divided into 2 phases: pre-pandemic and pandemic. The time between arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy in both phases were compared as well as other indicators such hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS With information from 219 patients, the median age was 69 years. 154 and 65 endoscopies were performed in pre-pandemic and pandemic phase, respectively. The time between arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy was significantly longer during the pandemic (10.00 vs. 13.08 hours, p-value = 0.019). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in hospital stay or mortality. CONCLUSION The management of patients with UGIB during the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and requires the application of clinical judgment to decide the best timing to perform an endoscopy without affecting patient care.","Benites-Goñi, Harold; Pascacio-Fiori, Martín; Monge-Del Valle, Fiorella; Plácido-Damián, Zuly; Gonzales-Carazas, Evelyn; Padilla-Espinoza, Miguel; Prado-Bustamante, José; Llatas-Pérez, Juan; Dávalos-Moscol, Milagros",Revista de gastroenterologia del Peru : organo oficial de la Sociedad de Gastroenterologia del Peru,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181807/,54

For these reasons, antisense technologies are being pursued as treatments against biothreat agents such as Ebola virus, dengue virus and Bacillus anthracis. Several generations of modified oligonucleotides have been developed to maximize nuclease resistance, target affinity, potency, cell entry, and other pharmacokinetic properties. First-generation ASOs contain phosphorothioate modifications to increase stability through nuclease resistance. Further chemical modifications in second-generation ASOs include 2'-O-methyl and 2'-O-methoxy-ethyl oligos, which increase nuclease resistance and oligo:RNA binding affinities. Third-generation ASOs contain a variety of chemical modifications that enhance stability, affinity and bioavailability. A fourth class of oligonucleotide-based compounds consists of small interfering RNAs, which have recently become widely used for gene knockdown in vitro and in vivo. This review focuses on the third-generation phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, which are nonionic and contain a morpholine ring instead of a ribose, as well as phosphorodiamidate linkages in place of phosphorothioates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted. One hundred and seven patients who underwent pelvic embolization between January 2003 and December 2013 were included. Patient demographics, ISS, angiography techniques, and major complications including gluteal and skin necrosis, wound breakdown, and deep infection were compared. RESULTS Nine patients (8.4 %) developed major complications after undergoing TAE. This rate dropped to 5.1 % after exclusion of patients with Morel-Lavallee lesions. Nonselective embolization trended toward a higher complication rate compared to superselective embolization. Patients who developed complications were more likely to have undergone pelvic surgery. CONCLUSION The majority of patients who developed complications had nonselective TAE. Morel-Lavallee lesions are a confounding factor, but TAE may impose an additional risk. Pelvic surgery after TAE may further predispose patients to complications. We recommend superselective embolization as first-line treatment and caution the use of prophylactic embolization, especially in patients with substantial pelvic soft tissue injuries.","Shi, James; Gomes, Antoinette; Lee, Edward; Kee, Stephen; Moriarty, John; Cryer, Henry; McWilliams, Justin",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544681/,54

197048,Functional analysis of the coronavirus MHV-JHM surface glycoproteins in vaccinia virus recombinants.,1990,"Over the last few years, dramatic increases in our knowledge about diffusely adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) pathogenesis have taken place. The typical class of DAEC includes E. coli strains harboring AfaE-I, AfaE-II, AfaE-III, AfaE-V, Dr, Dr-II, F1845, and NFA-I adhesins (Afa/Dr DAEC); these strains (i) have an identical genetic organization and (ii) allow binding to human decay-accelerating factor (DAF) (Afa/Dr(DAF) subclass) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Afa/Dr(CEA) subclass). The atypical class of DAEC includes two subclasses of strains; the atypical subclass 1 includes E. coli strains that express AfaE-VII, AfaE-VIII, AAF-I, AAF-II, and AAF-III adhesins, which (i) have an identical genetic organization and (ii) do not bind to human DAF, and the atypical subclass 2 includes E. coli strains that harbor Afa/Dr adhesins or others adhesins promoting diffuse adhesion, together with pathogenicity islands such as the LEE pathogenicity island (DA-EPEC). In this review, the focus is on Afa/Dr DAEC strains that have been found to be associated with urinary tract infections and with enteric infection. The review aims to provide a broad overview and update of the virulence aspects of these intriguing pathogens. Epidemiological studies, diagnostic techniques, characteristic molecular features of Afa/Dr operons, and the respective role of Afa/Dr adhesins and invasins in pathogenesis are described. Following the recognition of membrane-bound receptors, including type IV collagen, DAF, CEACAM1, CEA, and CEACAM6, by Afa/Dr adhesins, activation of signal transduction pathways leads to structural and functional injuries at brush border and junctional domains and to proinflammatory responses in polarized intestinal cells. In addition, uropathogenic Afa/Dr DAEC strains, following recognition of beta(1) integrin as a receptor, enter epithelial cells by a zipper-like, raft- and microtubule-dependent mechanism. Finally, the presence of other, unknown virulence factors and the way that an Afa/Dr DAEC strain emerges from the human intestinal microbiota as a ""silent pathogen"" are discussed.","Servin, Alain L",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831825/,54
197355,Transcription strategy of coronaviruses: fusion of non-contiguous sequences during mRNA synthesis.,1984,"BACKGROUND Social distancing, implemented to decrease the spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), forced major changes in medical practices, including an abrupt transition from face-to-face to remote patient care. Pre-clinical medical studies were concomitantly switched to electronic distance learning. OBJECTIVES To explore potential implications of COVID-19 on future pre-clinical medical studies. METHODS We examined responses of pre-clinical medical students to the remote electronic learning in terms of quality of and satisfaction with teaching and technical support, attendance to classes, and the desire to continue electronic learning in the post-epidemic era. A survey of responses from first-year students at the Adelson School of Medicine was conducted. To optimize the reliability of the survey, a single research assistant conducted telephone interviews with each student, using a structured questionnaire concerning aspects of participation and satisfaction with teaching and with technical components of the remote electronic learning. RESULTS With 100% response rate, the students reported high satisfaction with the electronic learning regarding its quality, online interactions, instructions given, technical assistance, and availability of recording for future studies. Most of the students (68.6%) noted a preference to continue < 90% of the learning online in the post-outbreak era. A high level of overall satisfaction and a low rate of technical problems during electronic learning were significantly correlated with the desire to continue online learning (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The high satisfaction and the positive experience with the electronic distance learning imposed by the COVID-19 epidemic implied a successful transition and might induce future changes in pre-clinical medical studies.","Sandhaus, Yoram; Kushnir, Talma; Ashkenazi, Shai",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812716/,54

198071,Laboratory experiments on oral vaccination of calves against rotavirus or coronavirus induced diarrhoea.,1985,"The open reading frame (ORF) 1b-encoded part of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) replicase is expressed by ribosomal frameshifting during genome translation, which results in the production of an ORF1ab fusion protein (345 kDa). Four ORF1b-encoded processing products, nsp9 (p80), nsp10 (p50), nsp11 (p26), and nsp12 (p12), have previously been identified in EAV-infected cells (L. C. van Dinten, A. L. M. Wassenaar, A. E. Gorbalenya, W. J. M. Spaan, and E. J. Snijder, J. Virol. 70:6625-6633, 1996). In the present study, the generation of these four nonstructural proteins was shown to be mediated by the nsp4 serine protease, which is the main viral protease (E. J. Snijder, A. L. M. Wassenaar, L. C. van Dinten, W. J. M. Spaan, and A. E. Gorbalenya, J. Biol. Chem. 271:4864-4871, 1996). Mutagenesis of candidate cleavage sites revealed that Glu-2370/Ser, Gln-2837/Ser, and Glu-3056/Gly are the probable nsp9/10, nsp10/11, and nsp11/12 junctions, respectively. Mutations which abolished ORF1b protein processing were introduced into a recently developed infectious cDNA clone (L. C. van Dinten, J. A. den Boon, A. L. M. Wassenaar, W. J. M. Spaan, and E. J. Snijder, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:991-997, 1997). An analysis of these mutants showed that the selective blockage of ORF1b processing affected different stages of EAV reproduction. In particular, the mutant with the nsp10/11 cleavage site mutation Gln-2837-->Pro displayed an unusual phenotype, since it was still capable of RNA synthesis but was incapable of producing infectious virus.","van Dinten, L C; Rensen, S; Gorbalenya, A E; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9971783/,54

198303,Construction of a recombinant adenovirus for the expression of the glycoprotein S antigen of porcine respiratory coronavirus.,1993,"Periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) in orthopedic surgery are considered to be very serious and dangerous complications of total joint arthroplasty. PJI becomes a long-lasting medical problem and a heavy burden on patient and his family. Patients with such a complication are a significant financial burden for the health care system. Recognizing this issue, investing in scientific research and simultaneously developing technologies in medicine are efforts taken to increase successfulness in preventing and treating PJI. Each year the number of total joint arthroplasties increases which entails a rise in the number of complications among which infections are the leading ones. Sometimes, in the worst case scenarios, infections can endanger patients' lives. New procedural algorithms and new diagnostic possibilities help us make accurate and early diagnoses of postoperative PJI with a great degree of certainty. These diagnostic methods include laboratory tests, imaging, histopathology and microbiological analyses. Treatment options depend on many factors which include the onset of symptoms, patients'general physical condition and type of pathogen. The approach to treating PJI is complex and it requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to ensure the most successful treatment possible. For adequate and successful treatment we need to take into account antibiotic therapy, one-stage or two-stage revision, Girdlestone operation, athrodesis and amputation. In this review we will try to sum up all relevant findings and suggest further steps in management of PJI.","Vrgoc, Goran; Japjec, Mladen; Gulan, Gordan; Ravlić-Gulan, Jagoda; Marinović, Marin; Bandalović, Ante",Collegium antropologicum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25842772/,54

210521,HIV-1 infection activates endogenous retroviral promoters regulating antiviral gene expression,2020,"The proliferation of trading venues has resulted in a fragmented secondary markets landscape both in the US and Europe. Different factors drive the fragmentation of order flow during normal market conditions. This paper studies the composition of order flow during stressed market conditions based on the COVID-19 outbreak. We specifically investigate two related questions. Firstly, we assess whether stressed market conditions alter the level of fragmentation and, secondly, we study the choice of lit vs. dark trading when markets are under stress. As for the first question, we construct a measure to capture order flow fragmentation and find that fragmentation strongly decreases when markets are under stress (i.e., traders concentrate their order flow in fewer venues in times of market stress). This is especially the case for stocks experiencing a deeper shock in volatility. As for the second question, we find a migration of order flow from dark to lit venues when markets are under stress. Our interpretation of this finding is that traders tend to move to lit venues, where the probability of trading with an informed trader is less severe, during times of hyper-volatility. We call this evidence 'flight-to-transparency'.","Anselmi, Giulio Nimalendran Mahendrarajah Petrella Giovanni",Finance Research Letters,,54

This study conducted exploratory analyses of the relationship between COVID-19-related life changes and COVID-19-related perceived stress and associations between COVID-19-related perceived stress and dysregulated maternal eating behaviors, child feeding practices, and body mass index (BMI) in Los Angeles mothers. Mothers (Mage = 37.6 ± 6.9) of children aged 5-11 (N = 197, response rate 92.5%) completed an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19-related life changes, COVID-19-related perceived stress, mechanisms used to cope with COVID-19, child feeding practices, their own eating behavior, demographics, and height and weight. The highest proportion of participants reported changes to work, disruptions due to childcare challenges, and increased home responsibilities. Higher COVID-19-related perceived stress was experienced by those who reported loss of work hours (29%), loss of job (15.2%), reduced ability to afford childcare (18.8%), and reduced ability to afford rent/mortgage (19.8%) (ps < 0.05) than those who did not. The most common strategy that mothers indicated using to cope with COVID-19 related stress was eating comfort foods (e.g., candy and chips) (58.7%). COVID-19-related perceived stress was positively associated with mother's BMI and emotional eating (ps < 0.05). Rewarding their child's eating and behavior with food were both positively associated with the number of COVID-19 related life changes (ps < 0.05). This study yields new knowledge of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers' dysregulated eating behaviors and child feeding practices. The results highlight the importance of conducting further research to confirm these findings and understand the nature of associations between COVID-19-related perceived stress and health. This is crucial in order to explore ways in which lasting impacts of the pandemic on mental and physical health can be prevented.","Wang, Shirlene D; Devjani, Shivali; Chillakanti, Mahima; Dunton, Genevieve F; Mason, Tyler B",Appetite,,54

270697,WikiPathways: connecting communities,2021,"BACKGROUND: Heparin, a lifesaving blood thinner used in over 100 million surgical procedures worldwide annually, is currently isolated from over 700 million pigs andâ¯~â¯200 million cattle in slaughterhouses worldwide. Though animal-derived heparin has been in use over eight decades, it is a complex mixture that poses a risk for chemical adulteration, and its availability is highly vulnerable. Therefore, there is an urgent need in devising bioengineering approaches for the production of heparin polymers, especially low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and thus, relying less on animal sources. One of the main challenges, however, is the rapid, cost-effective production of low molecular weight heparosan, a precursor of LMWH and size-defined heparosan oligosaccharides. Another challenge is N-sulfation of N-acetyl heparosan oligosaccharides efficiently, an essential modification required for subsequent enzymatic modifications, though chemical and enzymatic N-sulfation is effectively performed at the polymer level. METHODS: To devise a strategy to produce low molecular weight heparosan and heparosan oligosaccharides, several non-pathogenic E. coli strains are engineered by transforming the essential heparosan biosynthetic genes with or without the eliminase gene (elmA) from pathogenic E. coli K5. RESULTS: The metabolically engineered non-pathogenic strains are shown to produce ~5â¯kDa heparosan, a precursor for low molecular weight heparin, for the first time. Additionally, heparosan oligosaccharides of specific sizes ranging from tetrasaccharides to dodecasaccharides are directly generated, in a single step, from the recombinant bacterial strains that carry both heparosan biosynthetic genes and an eliminase gene. Various modifications, such as chemical N-sulfation of N-acetyl heparosan hexasaccharide following the selective protection reducing end GlcNAc residue, enzymatic C5-epimerization of N-sulfo heparosan tetrasaccharide and complete 6-O sulfation of N-sulfo heparosan hexasaccharide, are shown to be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: We engineered non-pathogenic E. coli strains to produce low molecular weight heparosan and a range of size-specific heparosan oligosaccharides in a controlled manner through modulating culture conditions. We have also shown various chemical and enzymatic modifications of heparosan oligosaccharides. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Heparosan is a precursor of heparin and the methods to produce low molecular weight heparosan is widely awaited. The methods described herein are promising and will pave the way for potential large scale production of low molecular weight heparin anticoagulants in the coming decade.","Roy, Anindita; Miyai, Yuma; Rossi, Alessandro; Paraswar, Krishna; Desai, Umesh; Saijoh, Yukio; Kuberan, Balagurunathan",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,,54

To promote community-dwelling older individuals' well-being during this time, the aims of the current project are to develop effective strategies in order (a) to increase older individuals' digital literacy, and (b) to help them acquire behavioral and cognitive skills that will improve their coping abilities with the stressful situation created as a result of the pandemic, as well as reducing adverse mental health effects. The project comprises an intervention arm that includes digital group sessions for older individuals meant to improve their digital literacy, promote their effective coping, and relieve their mental distress and loneliness. Subjects receive a short-term (seven sessions), twice-weekly, digitally guided group intervention through Zoom (a video conferencing app), and WhatsApp (instant messaging app). The wait list control-group participants receive twice-weekly telephone calls from a research assistant during a parallel period. Web-based questionnaires are filled in pre- and post-participation. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed by comparing pre- and post-measures, between intervention and control groups. This protocol offers a model for helping to support vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is applicable regardless of the outbreak of a global health crisis or the imposition of lockdown rules; in fact, it has the potential to contribute to the social inclusion of vulnerable populations during routine times as well as during emergencies. Furthermore, ideas for future expansion include the integration of multilingual facilitators in order to reach seniors from underserved minority groups in various social contexts, even across borders.","Shapira, Stav; Yeshua-Katz, Daphna; Goren, Ganit; Aharonson-Daniel, Limor; Clarfield, A Mark; Sarid, Orly",Front Public Health,,54

To study the dynamic responses of capital flows to MPP shocks, we propose a novel regime-switching factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model. It allows to capture potential structural breaks in the policy regime and to control -- besides domestic macroeconomic quantities -- for the impact of global factors such as the global financial cycle. Feeding into this model a novel intensity-adjusted macroprudential policy index, we find that tighter MPPs may be effective in containing domestic private sector credit growth and the volumes of gross capital inflows in a majority of the countries analyzed. However, they do not seem to generally shield CESEE countries from capital flow volatility.","Eller, Markus; Hauzenberger, Niko; Huber, Florian; Schuberth, Helene; Vashold, Lukas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06391v1.pdf,54

Nevertheless, the attempts to counteract COVID-19 interference with this enzymatic cascade are frustrating, and the results have thus far been inconclusive. Let's start again by considering the involved factors in an alternative way: we could postulate that COVID-19 could be more aggressive/fatal due to a high level of ""basal"" inflammation with low Nitric Oxide (NO) levels in hypertensive, diabetic and obese patients. Interestingly, the ""protective"" effects of several factors (such as estrogens) may play a role by increasing the formation of endogenous NO. From a therapeutic point of view, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as oral Tadalafil, could be used in order to increase the basal NO levels. In this way, we don't fight the virus, but we may be able to mitigate its effects.","Dal Moro, Fabrizio; Vendramin, Igor; Livi, Ugolino",Med Hypotheses,,54
353370,"Concordance between Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR in the Diagnosis of Feline Infectious Peritonitis",2020,"This paper reflects on how cultural policies in South Korea, Japan and China respond to the Covid-19 crisis. It conceptualises the current period as a historically significant moment by exploring the notion of ‘critical juncture’. Then, it presents an empirical analysis of what has actually happened in cultural policies in the three countries by investigating key events, debates, actors and decisions made in 2020. In Korea, the pandemic functions as a force of ‘policy acceleration’ by legitimising and furthering the existing development in cultural policy. In Japan, it triggered ‘policy movement’, where artists emerged as institutional entrepreneurs who fundamentally contest Japan’s non-interventionist cultural policy and ask for policy reform. In China, cultural policy is ‘locked-in’ as the party-state appropriated the crisis in its ideological terms. Despite the lack of visible transformative changes (yet), the consequences of the pandemic are critical enough to determine the future direction of cultural policy.

Lockdown enforcement has emerged as one of the mitigating measures to reduce the community spread of the virus. With a reduction in major anthropogenic activities, a visible improvement in air quality has been recorded in urban centres. Hazardous air quality in countries like India and China leads to high mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases. The present article deals with 6 megacities in India and 6 cities in Hubei province, China, where strict lockdown measures were imposed. The real-time concentration of PM2.5 and NO2 were recorded at different monitoring stations in the cities for 3 months, i.e. January, February, and March for China and February, March, and April for India. The concentration data is converted into AQI according to US EPA parameters and the monthly and weekly averages are calculated for all the cities. Cities in China and India after 1 week of lockdown recorded an average drop in AQIPM2.5 and AQINO2 of 11.32% and 48.61% and 20.21% and 59.26%, respectively. The results indicate that the drop in AQINO2 was instantaneous as compared with the gradual drop in AQIPM2.5. The lockdown in China and India led to a final drop in AQIPM2.5 of 45.25% and 64.65% and in AQINO2 of 37.42% and 65.80%, respectively. This study will assist the policymakers in devising a pathway to curb down air pollutant concentration in various urban cities by utilising the benchmark levels of air pollution.","Agarwal, Aviral; Kaushik, Aman; Kumar, Sankalp; Mishra, Rajeev Kumar",Air Qual Atmos Health,,54

Of these 37 patients, 14 (~38%) had a positive rRT-PCR result after a negative result during convalescence, and 5 (~14%) had a positive rRT-PCR result after two consecutive negative results during convalescence. These results suggest that it may be necessary to require that patients have three consecutive negative results before discharge, to ensure that they do not spread infection among members of their household, or in the community. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it is not currently the standard of care to require patients to have three consecutive negative results before discharge. Our results suggest that a relatively high proportion of patients may continue to shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 after they have clinically recovered, and thus may transmit the infection to others.","Wang, Guan; Yu, Na; Xiao, Weimin; Zhao, Chen; Wang, Zhenning",J. med. virol,,54

We review the physiological functions of ACE2 in the cardiovascular system and the lungs, and how the activation of ACE2/MAS/G protein coupled receptor contributes in reducing acute injury and inhibiting fibrogenesis of the lungs and protecting the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, we predominantly focus on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on ACE2 and dysregulation of the protective effect of ACE2/MAS/G protein pathway vs. the deleterious effect of Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone. We discuss the potential effect of invasion of SARS-CoV-2 on the function of ACE2 and the loss of the protective effect of the ACE2/MAS pathway in alveolar epithelial cells and how this may amplify systemic deleterious effect of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAS) in the host. Furthermore, we speculate the potential of exploiting the modulation of ACE2/MAS pathway as a natural protection of lung injury by modulation of ACE2/MAS axis or by developing targeted drugs to inhibit proteases required for viral entry.","Samavati, Lobelia; Uhal, Bruce D",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,54

Multiple studies have attempted to characterize at-risk patients, using various data sources and methodologies. Most of these studies, however, explored condition-specific patient cohorts (eg, hospitalized patients) or had limited access to patients’ medical history, thus, investigating related questions and, potentially, obtaining biased results. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 complications from the complete medical records of a nationally representative cohort of patients, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: We studied a cohort of all SARS-CoV-2–positive individuals, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing of either nasopharyngeal or saliva samples, in a nationwide health organization (covering 2.3 million individuals) and identified those who suffered from serious complications (ie, experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, admitted to the intensive care unit, or died). We then compared the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, extracted from electronic health records, between complicated and noncomplicated COVID-19 patient cohorts to identify the conditions that significantly increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. RESULTS: Of the 4353 SARS-CoV-2–positive individuals, 173 (4%) patients suffered from COVID-19 complications (all age ≥18 years). Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications. It also indicates that depression (eg, males ≥65 years: odds ratio [OR] 2.94, 95% CI 1.55-5.58; P=.01) as well as cognitive and neurological disorders (eg, individuals ≥65 years old: OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.69-4.17; P<.001) are significant risk factors. Smoking and presence of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis agrees with previous studies on multiple risk factors, including hypertension and obesity. It also finds depression as well as cognitive and neurological disorders, but not smoking and respiratory diseases, to be significantly associated with COVID-19 complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment and recovery efforts.","Yanover, Chen; Mizrahi, Barak; Kalkstein, Nir; Marcus, Karni; Akiva, Pinchas; Barer, Yael; Shalev, Varda; Chodick, Gabriel",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/20872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32750009/,54

597341,What Not to Do with PPE: A Digital Application to Raise Awareness of Proper PPE Protocol.,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Five years have passed since the World Health Organization released its Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (GTS). In that time, progress against malaria has plateaued. This review focuses on the implications of antimalarial drug resistance for the GTS and how interim progress in parasite genomics and antimalarial pharmacology offer a bulwark against it. RECENT FINDINGS: For the first time, drug resistance–conferring genes have been identified and validated before their global expansion in malaria parasite populations. More efficient methods for their detection and elaboration have been developed, although low-density infections and polyclonality remain a nuisance to be solved. Clinical trials of alternative regimens for multidrug-resistant malaria have delivered promising results. New agents continue down the development pipeline, while a nascent infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa for conducting phase I trials and trials of transmission-blocking agents has come to fruition after years of preparation. SUMMARY: These and other developments can help inform the GTS as the world looks ahead to the next two decades of its implementation. To remain ahead of the threat that drug resistance poses, wider application of genomic-based surveillance and optimization of existing and forthcoming antimalarial drugs are essential.","Ippolito, Matthew M.; Moser, Kara A.; Kabuya, Jean-Bertin Bukasa; Cunningham, Clark; Juliano, Jonathan J.",Curr Epidemiol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40471-021-00266-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33747712/,54

Orf is usually transmitted to humans who are in contact with infected animals. The clinical manifestation of the disease and a personal history of contact with an infected animal are sufficient to diagnose orf virus infection. CASE REPORT: In this case report, we present a 42-year-old man with an unremarkable medical history who came into contact with an infected camel and developed a typical orf lesion. There were multiple erythematous, dome-shaped to round painless nodules on the right forearm of the patient. Some of them had coalesced, forming large plaques, and a few nodules had watery or yellowish discharge. The lesion was complicated by lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of orf was made based upon clinical suspicion. The patient was treated with fusidic acid cream and observed until the lesion resolved spontaneously, leaving some post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. We believe this is the first report of orf transmission from a camel to a human. CONCLUSIONS: All physicians should consider this disease as a differential diagnosis in any patient who has a history of contact with camels. Although orf is a self-limiting condition, its early clinical recognition is critical to avoid complications, unwarranted psychological stress, and unnecessary surgical intervention.","Alajlan, Abdulmajeed Mohammed; Alsubeeh, Najlaa Abdulrahman",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.927579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353926/,54

PED is not notifiable to the EU or World Organisation for Animal Health listed but it is notifiable at the national level in Finland, France, Ireland and Sweden. PED case reports from seven countries and PED surveillance and monitoring activities in thirteen countries were reported. This information was combined with an extensive literature review to provide an update on global PED occurrence, circulating strains and impact in 2014–2015. PED confirmed cases have been reported in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. PED virus (PEDV) sequences originating from EU pig herds indicate that the strains currently in circulation share nearly 100% sequence identity and have greater than 99% sequence identity with the reference INDEL (insertion/deletion) strain USA/OH851/2014. In 2014–2015, greater genetic variability has been reported in strains circulating in Asia compared with EU Member States and a non‐INDEL strain has been detected in the Ukraine in 2014. Data on impact confirms that mortality is higher in suckling piglets and diarrhoea is observed in all age groups. The reported impact is in agreement with that reported in EFSA AHAW Panel (2014) indicating that the impact of recently reported PED outbreaks in Asia and the USA seems to be more severe than that described in EU countries, although the impact of different PEDV strains is difficult to compare between one country and another, as impact is dependent not only on pathogenicity but also on factors such as biosecurity, herd size, farm management, sanitary status or herd immune status.",,EFSA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313572/; https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4375,54
598774,Coelenterazine-Dependent Luciferases as a Powerful Analytical Tool for Research and Biomedical Applications,2020-10-10,"Abstract A one-tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for absolute feline coronavirus (FCoV) quantitation was developed. The assay is based on the 5′ nuclease activity of the Thermus flavus (Tfl) polymerase and a fluorogenic probe which generates fluorescence when it is cleaved. The fluorogenic probe, also called TaqMan™ probe (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, USA), is an oligonucleotide designed to bind between the two PCR primers to the target cDNA and is labeled with a reporter and a quencher dye. In the intact probe, the quencher dye suppresses the fluorescence of the reporter dye by Förster-type energy transfer. During the polymerase extension steps the Tfl exonuclease activity cleaves the hybridised probe resulting in the generation of fluorescent emission of the reporter dye. The threshold cycle (C T value) indicates the increase of reporter fluorescence and is directly related to the initial amount of target cDNA or RNA, respectively. Fluorescence is monitored in real time after each cycle by a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism® 7700 Sequence Detector. After completion of amplification, the C T values of the samples are calculated back to a standard curve, generated by amplification of diluted standard molecules. The one-tube RT-PCR described below allows precise quantitation, is highly sensitive, rapid (no separate reverse transcription step and no post-amplification steps), easy to handle, allows for a high sample throughput, shows a very good reproducibility, and can be executed with a low risk of contamination. The design of the primers–probe combination enables the detection of all known FCoV strains and is also useful for the detection of canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus.","Gut, Marco; M.

We explore the ways in which we can engage in political world‐building during pandemic times through the work of Hannah Arendt. Following Arendt’s notion of the world as the space for human togetherness, we ask: how can we respond to COVID‐19’s interruptions to the familiarity of daily life and our relationship to public space? By extending relational accounts of public health and organizational ethics, we critique a narrow view of solidarity that focuses on individual compliance with public health directives. Instead, we argue that solidarity involves addressing structural inequities, both within public health and our wider community. Finally, we suggest possibilities for political world‐building by considering how new forms of human togetherness might emerge as we forge a collective “new normal.”","Gardiner, Rita A.; Fulfer, Katy",Gend Work Organ,https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837016/,54

Owing to its antibody spectrum, this egg powder was very suitable for this farm since mainly rotavirus was identified. Regardless of the dosage (2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder), the calves (n = 164) which received specific egg-yolk antibodies via the whole egg during the first 14 days of life showed significant improvements in risk and duration of diarrhea and in body weight gain compared with calves of the control group (n = 80) which had not received any egg powder. These significant differences in body weight still persisted after 3 months of life. The mortality risk in the control group amounted to 8.8%, while in all egg powder groups (n = 164) only one calf died as a result of diarrhea. Breed-dependent differences in the parameters were not observed.","Özpinar, H.; Erhard, M.

Negative symptomatology and the stigma have been negatively linked to the recovery process in psychosis. The aim of this investigation is to improve the understanding of how the recovery process is affected by negative symptomatology based on the analysis of the mediating effects of the internalized stigma. Method: The sample was composed of 114 people that had experienced, at some point in their life, at least one clinically relevant psychotic episode. CAPE-42, STORI and ISMI were used for the evaluation. The macro PROCESS for SPSS was used. The indirect effect was calculated using 10.000 samples of bootstrap for the bootstrap confidence intervals (IC) corrected for bias. Results: The results show that the influence of negative symptomatology predicts the stigmatization of the person regarding his disorder. This predicts a negative influence in the recovery process of the psychosis. Conclusions: These results back the importance of adding the reduction of the stigma as a specific strategy to improve the recovery process in psychotic disorders.","Ordóñez-Camblor, Nuria; Paino, Mercedes; Fonseca-Pedrero, Eduardo; Pizarro-Ruiz, Juan Pablo",Int J Clin Health Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33552164/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2021.100220,54

Focusing on COVID-19-attributable mortality, we expand upon a national comparative analysis of years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to COVID-19 by race/ethnicity (Bassett et al., 2020), estimating percentages of total YPLL for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Asians, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives, contrasting them with their respective percent population shares, as well as age-adjusted YPLL rate ratios—anchoring comparisons to non-Hispanic Whites—in each of 45 states and the District of Columbia using data from the National Center for Health Statistics as of 30 December 2020. Using a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to perform estimation, our results reveal substantial racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19-attributable YPLL across states, with a prevailing pattern of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing disproportionately high and non-Hispanic Whites experiencing disproportionately low COVID-19-attributable YPLL. Furthermore, estimated disparities are generally more pronounced when measuring mortality in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting the greater intensity of the disparities at younger ages. We also find substantial state-to-state variability in the magnitudes of the estimated racial/ethnic disparities, suggesting that they are driven in large part by social determinants of health whose degree of association with race/ethnicity varies by state.","Xu, Jay J.; Chen, Jarvis T.; Belin, Thomas R.; Brookmeyer, Ronald S.; Suchard, Marc A.; Ramirez, Christina M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809240/,54

We explored the impact of COVID-19 on smoking behaviors, risk perceptions, and reactions to text messages during a statewide stay-at-home advisory among primary care patients who were trying to quit. From May–June 2020, we interviewed smokers enrolled in a 12-week, pilot cessation trial providing text messaging and mailed nicotine replacement medication (NCT04020718). Twenty-two individuals (82% white, mean age 55 years), representing 88% of trial participants during the stay-at-home advisory, completed exit interviews; four (18%) of them reported abstinence. Interviews were thematically analyzed by two coders. COVID-19-induced environmental changes had mixed effects, facilitating quitting for some and impeding quitting for others. While stress increased for many, those who quit found ways to cope with stress. Generally, participants felt at risk for COVID-19 complications but not at increased risk of becoming infected. Reactions to COVID-19 and quitting behaviors differed across age groups, older participants reported difficulties coping with isolation (e.g., feeling disappointed when a text message came from the study and not a live person). Findings suggest that cessation interventions addressing stress and boredom are needed during COVID-19, while smokers experiencing isolation may benefit from live-person supports.","Joyce, Andrea A.; Styklunas, Grace M.; Rigotti, Nancy A.; Neil, Jordan M.; Park, Elyse R.; Kruse, Gina R.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498834/,54

Thus, we aimed to examine ED utilization among pediatric patients and the impact of COVID-19 in one large city affected by the outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study included data from six EDs in Daegu, Korea. We compared the demographic and clinical data of patients presenting to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1st–June 30th 2020) with those of patients who visited the ED in this period during 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Fewer patients, particularly children visited the EDs during the study period in 2020 than those in the previous (2018/2019) year period: the number of adult patient decreased by 46.4% and children by 76.9%. Although the number of patients increased from the lowest point of the decrease in March 2020, the number of pediatric patients visiting the ED remained less than half (45.2%) in June 2020 compared with that of previous years. The proportion of patients with severe conditions increased in adults, infants, and school-aged children, and consequently resulted in increased ambulance use and higher hospitalization rates. Fewer infants and young children but more school-aged children visited the ED with febrile illnesses in 2020 than in 2018/2019. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial decrease in pediatric ED utilization. These findings can help reallocate human and material resources in the EDs during infectious disease outbreaks.","Jang, Kyung Mi; Ahn, Ji Young; Choi, Hee Joung; Lee, Sukhee; Kim, Dongsub; Lee, Dong Won; Choe, Jae Young",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398945/,54

However, no articles could be found about the factors influencing sexual activity among Chinese men. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the factors that influence the coital frequency of Chinese men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures included self-reported monthly coital frequency, age, occupation, education level, andrology-related scales and dietary habits. METHODS: Data for 1,407 men aged 18–79 years were collected in the Health Management Center of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 2019 to May 2019. The respondents completed the questionnaires independently or with the help of an interviewer (who read or explained the questionnaires to them) to analyse the factors that influence coital frequency. RESULTS: In the previous 6 months, the sample had a mean monthly coital frequency (±SD) of 4.34 ± 3.18. Univariate logistic regression results indicated that the number of children (P = 0.004), IIEF-5 scores (P <0.001), EHSs (P <0.001) and frequency of milk consumption (P = 0.001) were associated with more frequent sexual activity. These statistical associations did not change after further adjustment for age, occupation, and reproductive history. We observed that the frequency of sexual activity showed an increasing trend with a greater number of children, higher IIEF-5 scores, higher EHSs and greater frequency of milk consumption (test for trend, P<0.05). Both univariate and multivariate analysis results indicated that the frequency of sexual activity decreased with increasing age (test for trend, P<0.001).

A 29-questions survey was sent to 95 Italian thoracic oncologists, with 77% of them declaring significant changes in the outpatients management and treatment. The results of this survey pointed out a significant delay of lung cancer diagnosis along with a relevant reduction of patients’ accrual within clinical trials, while telemedicine emerged as a valid support for patient-healthcare interactions. Therapeutic indications followed the guidelines for adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiation. Clinical indications to first-line therapies were largely confirmed, while major changes regarded the selection of second line treatment options as well as the management of elderly population.

622206,The effect of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) on ovarian function and reproductive performance after weaning in Berkshire sows,2017-03-10,"SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin and was transmitted to humans via an undetermined intermediate host, leading to infections in humans and other mammals. To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.","Lam, S. D.; Bordin, N.; Waman, V. P.; Scholes, H.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19–related GT data, particularly those related to ageusia and anosmia, were primarily related to media coverage or to epidemic trends. METHODS: We retrieved GT query data for searches on coronavirus, cough, anosmia, and ageusia and plotted them over a period of 5 years. In addition, we analyzed the trends of those queries for 17 countries throughout the year 2020 with a particular focus on the rises and peaks of the searches. For anosmia and ageusia, we assessed whether the respective GT data correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths both throughout 2020 and specifically before March 16, 2020 (ie, the date when the media started reporting that these symptoms can be associated with COVID-19). RESULTS: Over the last five years, peaks for coronavirus searches in GT were only observed during the winter of 2020. Rises and peaks in coronavirus searches appeared at similar times in the 17 different assessed countries irrespective of their epidemic situations. In 15 of these countries, rises in anosmia and ageusia searches occurred in the same week or 1 week after they were identified in the media as symptoms of COVID-19. When data prior to March 16, 2020 were analyzed, anosmia and ageusia GT data were found to have variable correlations with COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different countries.

633347,The Senior Ferret (Mustela Putorius Furo),2010-02-11,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of highly effective antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to counter the known pathophysiological causes of severe COVID-19. Evaluating the efficacy existing drugs may expedite the development of such therapeutics. Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, or “cytokine storm,” which is largely mediated by the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. METHODOLOGY: PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. Sixteen case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for quantitative synthesis. The systematic analysis was pre-approved through PROSPERO (CRD42020193479). RESULTS: Combined mortality for the TCZ-treated and SOC groups were 26.0% and 43.4% respectively. In all but one of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ vs the SOC. A combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.453 (95% CI [0.376–0.547], p < 0.001). Additionally, 18 uncontrolled trials were identified for qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 16.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Important caveats to this research include the lack of prospective randomized control trials and the absence of data from the large COVATA study from the published literature. However, results from this systematic analysis of published research provide positive evidence for the potential efficacy of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19, validating the ethical basis and merit of ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials.","Kaye, Avi Gurion; Siegel, Robert",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194450/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10322,54

638627,Shifts in circulating lymphocyte subsets in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP): pathogenic role and diagnostic relevance,2003-12-15,"BACKGROUND: Competent end-of-life care is an essential component of total health care provision, but evidence suggests that it is often deficient. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes about key end-of-life issues and principles of good death among doctors in clinical settings. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among allopathic medical doctors working in in-ward clinical settings of tertiary care hospitals in Sri Lanka using a self-administered questionnaire with open- and close-ended questions as well as hypothetical clinical scenarios. Univariate and logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent factors associated with knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: Of the responders who had not been a caregiver for a terminally ill relative (n = 390), 57.9% were men with a mean age of 36.5 years (SD = 8.2). Compared to undergraduate (65.6%; n = 256), only 27.4% (n = 107) had received end-of-life care training at postgraduate level. Only 65.9% of doctors favoured disclosing terminal prognosis to patients; 27.7% of doctors were aware of advance directives; 14.6% were aware of the correct time of death when certifying brain death; 70.3% felt more comfortable in withholding than withdrawing life-sustaining treatment; 61.3% were aware of do-not-attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions while 26.7% felt reluctant to administer it; 15.1% thought that all life-sustaining therapy should be withdrawn with a DNACPR decision; and only17.9% were able to name the four principles of medical ethics while 57.9% could not name a single. Participants scored a mean of 9.2 (SD = 3.9) of a maximum 14 points when tested on principles of a ‘good death’. Doctors who had pursued postgraduate studies were more likely to be aware of breaking bad news (adjusted-Odds-Ratio:1.99; 95%CI = 1.19–3.32), advance directives (adjusted-OR: 4.15; 95%CI = 2.49–6.94), aware of certifying the correct time of death (adjusted-OR:2.37; 95%CI = 1.33–4.2) and less reluctant to make DNACPR decisions (adjusted-OR:1.74; 95%CI = 1.13–2.68). Doctors who had worked in ICU were more comfortable withholding than withdrawing treatment (adjusted-OR:1.99; 95%CI = 1.2–3.31). CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge and attitudes about end-of-life care, good death and principles of medical ethics among doctors in Sri Lanka were suboptimal. Structured training of end-of-life care needs to be integrated within curricula and in-service training.

643074,Feline infectious peritonitis intra vitam diagnosis: Approach and methods,2015-08-20,"Outbreaks of emerging coronaviruses in the past two decades and the current pandemic of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China highlight the importance of this viral family as a zoonotic public health threat. To gain a better understanding of coronavirus presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples among field rats (34.0%, 239/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in guano farms (74.8%, 234/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in large markets (32.0%, 116/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 84/151). Coronaviruses were detected in the majority of wildlife farms (60.7%, 17/28) and in the Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6/96) that are farmed. We identified six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces in the trade. The mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover to people.","Huong, Nguyen Quynh; Thanh Nga, Nguyen Thi; Van Long, Nguyen; Luu, Bach Duc; Latinne, Alice; Pruvot, Mathieu; Phuong, Nguyen Thanh; Vinh Quang, Le Tin; Van Hung, Vo; Lan, Nguyen Thi; Hoa, Nguyen Thi; Minh, Phan Quang; Diep, Nguyen Thi; Tung, Nguyen; Ky, Van Dang; Roberton, Scott I.; Thuy, Hoang Bich; Van Long, Nguyen; Gilbert, Martin; Wicker, Leanne; Mazet, Jonna A.

645107,Molecular Diagnostic Assays for Infectious Diseases in Cats,2010-10-06,"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of the outbreak. Objective: To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32â¯583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification. Exposures: Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods. Results: Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (≥80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1. Conclusions and Relevance: A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.","Pan, An; Liu, Li; Wang, Chaolong; Guo, Huan; Hao, Xingjie; Wang, Qi; Huang, Jiao; He, Na; Yu, Hongjie; Lin, Xihong; Wei, Sheng; Wu, Tangchun",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275295/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.6130,54
645511,Canine Isosporosis – Epidemiology of Field and Experimental Infections,2006-11-21,"OBJECTIVE: Aim of the study is to assess the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: The study comprised 52 children with MIS-C admitted to University of Health Sciences Adana City Training and Research Hospital pediatric wards from September 2020 to April 2021. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were retrospectively collected from patient files. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 9 (5-13) years. Fever (92.3%), abdominal pain (76.9%), rash (48.1%) and vomiting (48.1%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Fever duration was 8 (4.25-10) days in overall. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 17.3% of patients. At admission, elevated levels of CRP, procalcitonine, ESR, D-dimer, ferritin were found in 98.1%, 96.2%, 75%, 84.6% and 69.2% of the patients, respectively. Lymphopenia, hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia were found in 76.9%, 59.6%, 42.3% of the patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 96.2%, corticosteroids in 71.2% and anakinra in 3.8% of the patients. 28.8% of the patients were admitted to pediatric intensive care (PICU) and 17.3% received vasopressor support. Median duration of hospital length of stay was 12.5 days. Comorbidities were present in 19.2% of the patients. No mortality was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: While being rare and treatable, MIS-C is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. The increasing number of MIS-C cases shows that this phenomenon is more common than thought. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly. LAY SUMMARY: While being rare and treatable, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. MIS-C is now thought to be a post-infectious (SARS-CoV2) hyperinflammatory disease secondary to an abnormal immune response, rather than a complete obscurity. The increasing number of MIS-C cases and new case series reports from all over the world show that MIS-C is more common than thought. Despite our increasing experience, we may encounter a new finding every day in MIS-C patients. Therefore, we want to contribute to literature by presenting the MIS-C cases we treated in our clinic in detail. We have experienced that MIS-C patients can apply with similar but also different and unique characteristics. In case of delayed diagnosis or treatment, morbidity and mortality rates may increase. Therefore, the level of awareness and knowledge of all physicians, especially those dealing with pediatric patients, about MIS-C should be increased. Although the early effects of MIS-C are known, we don’t have enough information about the long-term consequences yet. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly.","Tolunay, Orkun; Çelik, Ümit; Arslan, İlknur; Orgun, Ali; Demir, Hüsnü; Demir, Oğuzhan; Dağdelen, Erdi Çağrı",J Trop Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1093/tropej/fmab050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028528/,54

But it requires high uptake and continued participation across the population to be effective. To achieve sufficient uptake/participation, health authorities should address, and thus be aware of, user concerns. AIM: This work manually analyzes user reviews of the Irish Heath Service Executive’s (HSE) Contact Tracker app, to identify user concerns and to lay the foundations for subsequent, large-scale, automated analyses of reviews. While this might seem tightly scoped to the Irish context, the HSE app provides the basis for apps in many jurisdictions in the USA and Europe. METHODS: Manual analysis of (1287) user reviews from the Google/Apple playstores was performed, to identify the aspects of the app that users focused on, and the positive/negative sentiment expressed. RESULTS: The findings suggest a largely positive sentiment towards the app, and that users thought it handled data protection and transparency aspects well. But feedback suggests that users would appreciate more targeted feedback on the incidence of the virus, and facilities for more proactive engagement, like notifications that prompt users to submit their health status daily. Finally, the analysis suggests that the “android battery” issue and the backward-compatibility issue with iPhones seriously impacted retention/uptake of the app respectively. CONCLUSION: The HSE have responded to the public’s desire for targeted feedback in newer versions, but should consider increasing the app’s proactive engagement. The results suggest they should also raise the backward compatibility issue, regarding older iPhones, with Apple.","Rekanar, Kaavya; O’Keeffe, Ian R.; Buckley, Sarah; Abbas, Manzar; Beecham, Sarah; Chochlov, Muslim; Fitzgerald, Brian; Glynn, Liam; Johnson, Kevin; Laffey, John; McNicholas, Bairbre; Nuseibeh, Bashar; O’Connell, James; O’Keeffe, Derek; O’Callaghan, Mike; Razzaq, Abdul; Richardson, Ita; Simpkin, Andrew; Storni, Cristiano; Tsvyatkova, Damyanka; Walsh, Jane; Welsh, Thomas; Buckley, Jim",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02529-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604836/,54

In addition, 17 nose-throat (NT) swabs and 29 blood samples had been obtained. PCR was performed to detect parainfluenza viruses 1–3, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza viruses A and B, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses. Viral cultures or antigen testing of BAL samples revealed 9 respiratory viruses in 8 patients. By use of PCR, 8 more respiratory viruses were detected in another 7 patients, increasing the rate of identification from 19% to 35% (P < .0005). Available NT swabs yielded the same results with PCR as did BAL samples. We conclude that PCR is more sensitive than viral culture or antigen or serologic testing for detection of respiratory viruses in patients with hematological malignancies, and that it offers the possibility for early, more rapid diagnosis.","van Elden, Leontine J.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the current state of the evidence on health and healthcare utilization outcomes associated with NP-home visits. METHOD: Five Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and the Cochrane Library) were systematically searched to identify studies examining NP-home visits. The search focused on English language studies that were published before April 2019 and sought to describe the outcomes associated with NP-home visits. We included experimental and observational studies. Quality appraisal was performed with the Kmet, Lee & Cook tool, and results summarized qualitatively. The impact of NP-home visits on clinical (functional status, quality of life [QOL]), and healthcare utilization (hospitalization, Emergency department(ED) visits) outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: A total of 566 citations were identified; 7 met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The most commonly reported outcomes were emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions. Given the limited number of articles generated by our search and wide variation in intervention and outcomes measures. NP-home visits were associated with reductions in ED visits in 2 out of 3 studies and with reduction in readmissions in 2 out of 4 studies. CONCLUSION: Published studies evaluating the outcomes associated with NP-home visits are limited and of mixed quality. Limitations include small sample size, and variation in duration and frequency of NP-home visits. Future studies should investigate the independent effect of NP-home visits on the health outcomes of older adults using large and nationally representative data with more rigorous study design.","Osakwe, Zainab Toteh; Aliyu, Sainfer; Sosina, Olukayode Ayodeji; Poghosyan, Lusine",Geriatr Nurs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197457220302068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32718756/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197457220302068; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2020.07.001,54

This chapter describes the nature and modern treatment of waste water, land applications of waste water, and methods of land applications of biosolids and animal wastes. The amount of organic matter in domestic wastes determines the degree of required biological treatment. Various tests are used to assess the amount of organic matter: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). The complete sewage treatment comprises three major steps: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. Tertiary treatment processes involving physicochemical processes can be effective in reducing the concentration of pathogens. The treated domestic wastewater may be disposed of via land application for crop irrigation or as a means of additional treatment and disposal through the three basic methods that include low-rate irrigation, overland flow, and high-rate infiltration.","Gerba, Charles P.; Pepper, Ian L.",Environmental Microbiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123705198000249; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123705198000249,54

659760,Canine Distemper Spillover in Domestic Dogs from Urban Wildlife,2011-10-28,"Background: Pulmonary infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The pathogens spectrum of pulmonary infection that can affect patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is wide such as bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic organisms, and so on. The risk of multi-pathogenic pneumonia is higher in HIV-infected patients. However, the fast and accurate diagnosis of multi-pathogenic pneumonia is challenging because of the limitations of current conventional tests. Case Presentation: Here, we report a case of pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a 22-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV infection. Blood tests revealed a low CD4 count, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed extensive ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung with multiple cavity lesions in the left upper lung. Microscopic examination of stained sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) smear specimens did not find any pathogens. There was also no evidence of pathogens known to cause pneumonia in bacteria and fungi culture tests and virus antibodies such as EBV, CMV, and COVID-19. The nucleic acid of CMV in blood was reported by quantitative PCR. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of BALF specimens identified a large number of P. jirovecii and CMV reads, and confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia due to P. jirovecii and CMV. Following the patient's treatment with anti-PCP and anti-CMV, the patient was cured and discharged. Conclusions: This case highlights the combined application of NGS in the clinical diagnosis of multi-pathogenic pneumonia in an HIV-infected patient. NGS is proposed as an important adjunctive diagnostic approach for identifying pathogens of multi-pathogenic pneumonia in HIV-infected patients.","Xie, Yirui; Ruan, Bing; Jin, Lingxiao; Zhu, Biao",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.653294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855038/,54

Methods: This is a prospective cohort study that included patients hospitalised because of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, three months after their discharge. A clinical evaluation, analytical parameters, chest X-ray, six-minute walk test, spirometry and DL(CO)–DL(NO) analysis were performed. Demographic variables, comorbidities, and variables related to the severity of the admission were recorded. Results: Two hundred patients completed the study; 59.5% men, age 62 years, 15.5% admitted to the intensive care unit. The most frequent functional alteration, in 27% of patients, was in the DL(CO)–DL(NO) combination. This alteration was associated with age, male sex, degree of dyspnoea, poorer perception of health, and limited ability for physical effort. These patients also presented higher levels of D-Dimer and more residual radiological alterations. In 42% of the patients with diffusion alterations, only reduced DL(NO) was presented, along with lower D-Dimer levels and less capillary volume involvement. The severity of the process was associated with the reduction in DL(CO)–DL(NO). Conclusions: The most sensitive RFT for the detection of the sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia was the combined measurement of DL(CO)–DL(NO) and this factor was related to patient health status and their capacity for physical exertion. In 40% of these cases, there was only a reduction in DL(NO), a finding that may indicate less pulmonary vascular involvement.","Núñez-Fernández, Marta; Ramos-Hernández, Cristina; García-Río, Francisco; Torres-Durán, María; Nodar-Germiñas, Andrés; Tilve-Gómez, Amara; Rodríguez-Fernández, Paula; Valverde-Pérez, Diana; Ruano-Raviña, Alberto; Fernández-Villar, Alberto",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10102119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068867/,54
661333,Optimal fecal assessment,2004-02-25,"PURPOSE: To describe the incidence and patterns of the spinal injuries in the victims of physical IPV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board (IRB) approval, we retrospectively reviewed patients referred to our institution’s domestic violence intervention and prevention program with a diagnosis directly related to physical abuse between January 2013 and June 2018. Electronic health records and radiology reports were reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: A total of 21/688 (3%) IPV patients with 41 vertebral injuries were identified. The study population comprised of 19/21 (90%) females. Median age of the included patients was 43 years with a range of 21–72 years. All vertebral injuries were AO type A spinal injuries. Upper lumbar spine (L1 and L2) was the most common level of injury followed by upper to mid-thoracic spine. The reported mechanism of the injury was IPV in 8/21 (38.0%), fall in 8/21(38.0%), and incidental in 5/21 (24.0%). Ten out of 21 (48%) patients had concomitant injuries, most commonly to the craniofacial region 5/21 (23%). Psychiatry history was positive in 17/21 (81%), and substance abuse was positive in 15/21 (71%) of the patients. CONCLUSION: Incidence of spinal injuries is relatively low in IPV with morphologic AO type A injury being the most common type of injury and the upper lumbar spine being the most common level of injury.","Watane, Gaurav V.; Gosangi, Babina; Thomas, Richard; Gujrathi, Rahul; Park, Hyesun; Harris, Mitchel B.; Khurana, Bharti",Emerg Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000362/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-020-01853-7,54

Primary aim of the study was to investigate whether the administration of tocilizumab to critically ill patients with COVID-19, led to a different clinical presentation of infectious complications compared to patients who did not receive tocilizumab. Secondary aim was investigating differences in laboratory parameters between groups. Methods: Single-centre retrospective study, enrolling COVID-19 patients who developed a microbiologically confirmed infectious complication (ventilator associated pneumonia or bloodstream infection) after intensive care unit (ICU) admission and either treated with tocilizumab or not (controls). Results: A total of 58 patients were included, 25 treated with tocilizumab and 33 controls. Median time from tocilizumab administration to infection onset was 10 days (range 2-26). Patients were 78% male, with median age 65 years (range 45-79). At first clinical presentation of the infectious event, the frequency of hypotension (11/25, 44% vs. 11/33, 33%), fever (8/25, 32% vs. 10/33, 30%) or hypothermia (0/25,0%, vs. 2/33, 6%), and oxygen desaturation (6/25, 28% vs 4/33, 12%), as well as the frequency of SOFA score increase of ≥ 2 points (4/25, 16%,vs. 4/33, 12%) was similar in tocilizumab treated patients and controls (p>0.1 for all comparisons). Among laboratory parameters, C-Reactive Protein elevation was reduced in tocilizumab treated patients compared to controls (8/25, 32% vs. 22/33, 67%, p=0.009). Conclusion: The clinical features of infectious complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU were not affected by tocilizumab.","Taramasso, Lucia; Magnasco, Laura; Portunato, Federica; Briano, Federica; Vena, Antonio; Giacobbe, Daniele R.; Dentone, Chiara; Robba, Chiara; Ball, Lorenzo; Loconte, Maurizio; Patroniti, Nicolò; Frisoni, Paolo; D'Angelo, Raffaele; Dettori, Silvia; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",Eur J Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511338/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2021.08.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620521002934?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620521002934,54

If this has led to changes in public attitudes towards screening and reduced intention to participate, there is a risk of long-term adverse impact on cancer outcomes. In this study, we examined previous participation and future intentions to take part in cervical and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening following the first national lockdown in the UK. Overall, 7543 adults were recruited to a cross-sectional online survey in August–September 2020. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify correlates of strong screening intentions among 2319 participants eligible for cervical screening and 2502 eligible for home-based CRC screening. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of 30 participants. Verbatim transcripts were analysed thematically. Of those eligible, 74% of survey participants intended to attend cervical screening and 84% intended to complete home-based CRC screening when next invited. Thirty percent and 19% of the cervical and CRC samples respectively said they were less likely to attend a cancer screening appointment now than before the pandemic. Previous non-participation was the strongest predictor of low intentions for cervical (aOR 26.31, 95% CI: 17.61–39.30) and CRC (aOR 67.68, 95% CI: 33.91–135.06) screening. Interview participants expressed concerns about visiting healthcare settings but were keen to participate when screening programmes resumed. Intentions to participate in future screening were high and strongly associated with previous engagement in both programmes. As screening services recover, it will be important to monitor participation and to ensure people feel safe to attend.","Wilson, Rebecca; Quinn-Scoggins, Harriet; Moriarty, Yvonne; Hughes, Jacqueline; Goddard, Mark; Cannings-John, Rebecca; Whitelock, Victoria; Whitaker, Katriina L.; Grozeva, Detelina; Townson, Julia; Osborne, Kirstie; Smits, Stephanie; Robling, Michael; Hepburn, Julie; Moore, Graham; Gjini, Ardiana; Brain, Kate; Waller, Jo",Prev Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743521003959?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599921/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743521003959; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106826,54

The chest radiograph (CXR) showed bilateral peripheral parenchymal infiltrates. He required 4 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula for 72 hours and was discharged after 7 days with appropriate advice. Four weeks from initial hospital admission, he presented with worsening cough, left chest pain and breathlessness. CXR showed left pneumothorax, and CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) scan confirmed left pneumothorax with mediastinal shift and a subpleural bulla. Intercostal chest drain was inserted with good resolution of symptoms and lung re-expansion. Follow-up CT scan 2 months later showed complete resolution of the parenchymal abnormalities. Our case demonstrates the development of pneumothorax as a delayed complication in a patient with COVID-19 who did not require ventilatory support.

Such approaches integrate a variety of models from different disciplines and modeling paradigms to represent a socio-environmental (or social-ecological) system aiming to holistically inform policy and decision-making processes. Central to the system-of-systems approaches is the representation of systems in a multi-tier framework with nested scales. Current modeling paradigms, however, have disciplinary-specific lineage, leading to inconsistencies in the conceptualization and integration of socio-environmental systems. In this paper, a multidisciplinary team of researchers, from engineering, natural and social sciences, have come together to detail socio-technical practices and challenges that arise in the consideration of scale throughout the socio-environmental modeling process. We identify key paths forward, focused on explicit consideration of scale and uncertainty, strengthening interdisciplinary communication, and improvement of the documentation process. We call for a grand vision (and commensurate funding) for holistic system-of-systems research that engages researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers in a multi-tiered process for co-creation of knowledge and solutions to major socio-environmental problems.","Iwanaga, Takuya; Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan; Hamilton, Serena H.; Grimm, Volker; Koralewski, Tomasz E.; Salado, Alejandro; Elsawah, Sondoss; Razavi, Saman; Yang, Jing; Glynn, Pierre; Badham, Jennifer; Voinov, Alexey; Chen, Min; Grant, William E.; Peterson, Tarla Rai; Frank, Karin; Shenk, Gary; Barton, C.

668295,Attaching-effacing Escherichia coli Infections in Cattle,2010-01-05,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak presents a significant threat to global health. A better understanding of patient clinical profiles is essential to drive efficient and timely health service strategies. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for a higher susceptibility to symptomatic presentation with COVID-19 and a transition to severe disease. Methods: We analysed data on 2756 patients admitted to Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1st January and 23rd April 2020. We compared differences in characteristics between patients designated positive for COVID-19 and patients designated negative on hospitalisation and derived a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19, we used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with progression to severe disease defined by: 1) admission to the hospital AICU, 2) the need for mechanical ventilation, 3) in-hospital mortality, and 4) at least one measurement of elevated D-dimer (equal or superior to 1,000 ug/L) indicative of increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Results: The patient population consisted of 1148 COVID-19 positive and 1608 COVID-19 negative patients. Age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, respiratory rate, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure formed the most parsimonious model for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19 at hospital admission. Among 1148 patients with COVID-19, 116 (10.1%) were admitted to the AICU, 71 (6.2%) required mechanical ventilation, 368 (32.1%) had at least one record of D-dimer levels [≥]1,000 g/L, and 118 patients died. In the multivariable logistic regression, age (OR = 0.953 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.937-0.968) C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007), and white blood cell counts (OR = 1.059 per 109/L, 95% CI: 1.010-1.111) were found to be associated with admission to the AICU. Age (OR = 0.973 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.955-0.990), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.003 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006) and sodium (OR = 0.915 per 1 mmol/L, 0.868-0.962) were associated with mechanical ventilation. Age (OR = 1.023 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.004-1.043), CRP (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006), and body temperature (OR = 0.723 per 1oC, 95% CI: 0.541-0.958) were associated with elevated D-dimer. For mortality, we observed associations with age (OR = 1.060 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.040-1.082), female sex (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.442, 95% CI: 0.245-0.777), Asian ethnic background (OR = 2.237 vs White ethnic background, 95% CI: 1.111-4.510), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), sodium (OR = 1.038 per 1 mmol/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), and respiratory rate (OR = 1.054 per 1 breath/min, 95% CI: 1.024-1.087). Conclusion: Our analysis suggests there are several demographic, clinical and laboratory findings associated with a symptomatic presentation of COVID-19. Moreover, significant associations between patient deterioration were found with age, sex and specific blood markers, chiefly C-reactive protein, and could help early identification of patients at risk of poorer prognosis. Further work is required to clarify the extent to which our observations are relevant beyond current settings.","Fletcher, R.

This review aims to synthesise evidence on podcasting in nursing and midwifery education. PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and ERIC databases were searched using key terms. 242 articles were found and screened. Data extraction, quality assessment and data analysis, underpinned by a Social Media Learning Model, were conducted on relevant studies. Twenty-six studies were included in the review. Three themes emerged; 1) learning and other outcomes, 2) antecedents to learning, and 3) learning process. Students seemed to acquire new knowledge and skills by using podcasts and it also appeared to improve clinical confidence. The organisation of podcasting, digital literacy and e-Professionalism, the personal motivation of learners, and flexible access to the technology seemed to impact the delivery of this educational intervention. Mechanisms that appeared to affect the learning process were the speed of exchange, the type of social media user, the timeframe, quality of information, the functionality of podcasts and other learning activities.

669263,A Brief Review on Vitamin B(12) Deficiency Looking at Some Case Study Reports in Adults,2021-09-07,"Components of the complement system and atypical parameters of coagulation were reported in COVID-19 patients, as well as the exacerbation of the inflammation and coagulation activity. Mannose binding lectin (MBL)- associated serine proteases (MASPs) play an important role in viral recognition and subsequent activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system and blood coagulation, connecting both processes. Genetic variants of MASP1 and MASP2 genes are further associated with different levels and functional efficiency of their encoded proteins, modulating susceptibility and severity to diseases. Our review highlights the possible role of MASPs in SARS-COV-2 binding and activation of the lectin pathway and blood coagulation cascades, as well as their associations with comorbidities of COVID-19. MASP-1 and/or MASP-2 present an increased expression in patients with COVID-19 risk factors: diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Based also on the positive results of COVID-19 patients with anti-MASP-2 antibody, we propose the use of MASPs as a possible biomarker of the progression of COVID-19 and the investigation of new treatment strategies taking into consideration the dual role of MASPs, including MASP inhibitors as promising therapeutic targets against COVID-19.","Bumiller-Bini, Valéria; de Freitas Oliveira-Toré, Camila; Carvalho, Tamyres Mingorance; Kretzschmar, Gabriela Canalli; Gonçalves, Letícia Boslooper; Alencar, Nina de Moura; Gasparetto, Miguel Angelo; Beltrame, Marcia Holsbach; Winter Boldt, Angelica Beate",Genetics and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729332/; https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-4685-gmb-2020-0199,54
670013,Protecting adults at risk of pneumococcal infection and influenza from exposure to SARS-CoV-2.,2021-08-18,"Coronaviruses (CoVs), which are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses, may cause infections in mammals and birds. Apart from the respiratory manifestations, CoVs are also responsible for infections of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous systems. Their propensity to recombine allows them to easily transmit and adapt to new hosts. The emergence of a new CoV in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is attributed to a zoonotic origin, has provoked numerous studies to assess its pathogenicity for different animal species (pets, farm and wild animals). Available results indicate that numerous animal species are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. From April 2020, when the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks was reported in the Netherlands, to the end of January 2021, further outbreaks have been confirmed in Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Greece, France, Canada, Lithuania and Poland. It has also been established that human-to-minks and minks-to-human transmission may occur. The results obtained to date indicate that the virus was originally introduced into the minks population by humans, possibly at the start of the pandemic and had been circulating in the population for several weeks before detection. Recent data indicate that minks are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the route or routes of virus transmission between farms, other than by direct contact with infected humans, have not been identified. In minks, infection can occur in clinical and subclinical form, making it possibly difficult to detect. Therefore, minks could represent potentially dangerous, not always recognized, animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. The current data indicate that further studies on minks and other Mustelidae are needed to clarify whether they may be a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, and if so, how and whether this can be prevented.","Pomorska-Mól, M.; Włodarek, J.; Gogulski, M.; Rybska, M.",Animal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1751731121001142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126387/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.100272; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751731121001142,54
672076,GENCODE 2021,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of post-exertion oxygen saturation has been proposed to assess illness severity in suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to determine the accuracy of post-exertional oxygen saturation for predicting adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19. METHODS: We undertook a substudy of an observational cohort study across 70 emergency departments during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. We collected data prospectively, using a standardised assessment form, and retrospectively, using hospital records, from patients with suspected COVID-19, and reviewed hospital records at 30 days for adverse outcome (death or receiving organ support). Patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded were selected for this analysis. We constructed receiver-operating characteristic curves, calculated diagnostic parameters, and developed a multivariable model for predicting adverse outcome. RESULTS: We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% CI 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were, respectively, 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Post-exertion oxygen saturation provides modest prognostic information in the assessment of selected patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.

The median number of SLE-related medications was 5 (IQR: 3–7), including antimalarials (75%), oral glucocorticoids (52.4%), immunosuppressants (39.8%) and biologics (10.9%). Respondents reported significant impact over their studies, career and emotional/sexual life in 50.7%, 57.9% and 38.2%, respectively. Appropriate access to care was highly variable across countries and care component. CONCLUSION: This survey underlines the 2020 burden and strong heterogeneity in the care of SLE across Europe, from the patient’s perspective. Altogether, these data may prove crucial to physicians, patients and policy-makers to improve the diagnosis and management of this rare and complex disease.","Cornet, Alain; Andersen, Jeanette; Myllys, Kirsi; Edwards, Angela; Arnaud, Laurent",Lupus Sci Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849920/; https://doi.org/10.1136/lupus-2020-000469,54
682810,eVITTA: a web-based visualization and inference toolbox for transcriptome analysis,2021-05-21,"Social science inquiries of American agriculture have long recognized the inextricability of farm households and farm businesses. Efforts to train and support farmers, however, often privilege business realm indicators over social issues. Such framings implicitly position households as disconnected from farm stress or farm success. This article argues that systematically tracing the pathways between farm households and farm operations represents a potentially powerful inroad towards identifying effective support interventions. We argue childcare arrangements are an underrecognized challenge through which farm household dynamics directly influence agricultural production. We draw on interviews and focus group data with farmers in the Northeastern United States to understand how farmer–parents access and negotiate childcare. Farmer–parents value raising children on farms, but express reluctance to expect current or future labor from them. Years with young children thus represent an especially vulnerable phase during a farm’s trajectory. We identify and analyze social, economic, and cognitive pathways through which childcare impacts farm operations. Social pathways include relationship tensions and gendered on-farm divisions of labor; economic pathways include farm layout and structure; cognitive pathways include how farmers think about and plan for their operations. Explicitly acknowledging such issues can better equip farmer–parents to anticipate and plan for conflicting demands on their time.","Rissing, Andrea; Inwood, Shoshanah; Stengel, Emily",Agric Human Values,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-020-10162-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078043/,54

The clinical management has dramatically altered and it was necessary to change and/or adapt it to the new situation. Regarding relapses management, the use of intravenous corticosteroids and hospitalization during MS relapses increase the risk of viral exposure. Objective: To review the efficacy and safety of high dose oral corticosteroids in acute relapses treatment compared to intravenous corticosteroids. Methods: Descriptive review of the utility of high dose oral corticosteroids for MS relapses treatment was performed. We searched the literature available on PubMed and Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo). We focused on different trials comparing the use of high dose intravenous vs oral corticosteroids. Results: Five studies were selected. One hundred and eighty two patients receiving treatment with high dose oral corticosteroids were included. The most frequent schedule was oral methylprednisolone 1000 mg (over three days). There were no significant differences between both routes of corticosteroids administration. Conclusion: Neurologists should be aware of the current evidence on the similar efficacy of both oral and intravenous corticosteroids for MS relapses. Using oral steroids during the pandemic would be a safe option for patients.","Segamarchi, Constanza; Silva, Berenice; Saidon, Patricia; Garcea, Orlando; Alonso, Ricardo",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820305241?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102449; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820305241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853893/,54

This cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduates (n = 3621) of different programs and different levels of education associated with universities in north-central Ecuador. The form consisted of 32 questions covering demographics, symptoms, detection, treatment, transmission, prevention and knowledge of the virus. The rate of correct answers was 75.5% (21.1 ± 5 out of 28), with differences observed regarding program of study, educational level and location of institution (α = 0.05), although effect size analyses showed that these differences could not be considered large. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that lower scores were associated with initial stages of education, careers related to social sciences and location of institution. Participants possessed sufficient knowledge about detection, transmission and prevention, although they overestimated fatality rate and were less confident about the characteristics of the virus and the effectiveness of traditional medicine. Consequently, future educational programs must place emphasis on addressing deficient knowledge. Certainly, improving COVID-19 literacy will promote the appropriate application of protective measures aimed at preventing the virus’ spread.","Ortega-Paredes, David; Larrea-Álvarez, César Marcelo; Jijón, Santiago Isaac; Loaiza, Karen; Šefcová, Miroslava Anna; Molina-Cuasapaz, Gabriel; Barba, Pedro; Vinueza-Burgos, Christian; Fernandez-Moreira, Esteban; Ramírez, Hégira; Larrea-Álvarez, Marco",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444455/,54
