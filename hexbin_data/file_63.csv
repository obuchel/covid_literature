87,ProCAT: a data analysis approach for protein microarrays,2006-11-16,"Protein microarrays provide a versatile method for the analysis of many protein biochemical activities. Existing DNA microarray analytical methods do not translate to protein microarrays due to differences between the technologies. Here we report a new approach, ProCAT, which corrects for background bias and spatial artifacts, identifies significant signals, filters nonspecific spots, and normalizes the resulting signal to protein abundance. ProCAT provides a powerful and flexible new approach for analyzing many types of protein microarrays.","Zhu, Xiaowei; Gerstein, Mark; Snyder, Michael",Genome Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1794587/,63
209,Cost effective strategies for completing the Interactome,2008-12-14,"Comprehensive protein interaction mapping projects are underway for many model species and humans. A key step in these projects is estimating the time, cost, and personnel required for obtaining an accurate and complete map. Here, we model the cost of interaction map completion across a spectrum of experimental designs. We show that current efforts may require up to 20 independent tests covering each protein pair to approach completion. We explore designs for reducing this cost substantially, including prioritization of protein pairs, probability thresholding, and interaction prediction. The best designs lower cost by four-fold overall and >100-fold in early stages of mapping. We demonstrate the best strategy in an ongoing project in Drosophila, in which we map 450 high-confidence interactions using 47 microtiter plates, versus thousands of plates expected using current designs. This study provides a framework for assessing the feasibility of interaction mapping projects and for future efforts to increase their efficiency.","Schwartz, Ariel S.; Yu, Jingkai; Gardenour, Kyle R.; Finley, Russell L.; Ideker, Trey",Nat Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2613168/,63
1018,Phylodynamic Inference and Model Assessment with Approximate Bayesian Computation: Influenza as a Case Study,2012-12-27,"A key priority in infectious disease research is to understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers of viral diseases from data on disease incidence as well as viral genetic and antigenic variation. We propose using a simulation-based, Bayesian method known as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit and assess phylodynamic models that simulate pathogen evolution and ecology against summaries of these data. We illustrate the versatility of the method by analyzing two spatial models describing the phylodynamics of interpandemic human influenza virus subtype A(H3N2). The first model captures antigenic drift phenomenologically with continuously waning immunity, and the second epochal evolution model describes the replacement of major, relatively long-lived antigenic clusters. Combining features of long-term surveillance data from the Netherlands with features of influenza A (H3N2) hemagglutinin gene sequences sampled in northern Europe, key phylodynamic parameters can be estimated with ABC. Goodness-of-fit analyses reveal that the irregularity in interannual incidence and H3N2's ladder-like hemagglutinin phylogeny are quantitatively only reproduced under the epochal evolution model within a spatial context. However, the concomitant incidence dynamics result in a very large reproductive number and are not consistent with empirical estimates of H3N2's population level attack rate. These results demonstrate that the interactions between the evolutionary and ecological processes impose multiple quantitative constraints on the phylodynamic trajectories of influenza A(H3N2), so that sequence and surveillance data can be used synergistically. ABC, one of several data synthesis approaches, can easily interface a broad class of phylodynamic models with various types of data but requires careful calibration of the summaries and tolerance parameters.","Ratmann, Oliver; Donker, Gé; Meijer, Adam; Fraser, Christophe; Koelle, Katia",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531293/,63
1567,Serum Diamine Oxidase as a Hemorrhagic Shock Biomarker in a Rabbit Model,2014-08-21,"BACKGROUND: In prolonged hemorrhagic shock, reductions in intestinal mucosal blood perfusion lead to mucosal barrier damage and systemic inflammation. Gastrointestinal failure in critically ill patients has a poor prognosis, so early assessment of mucosal barrier injury in shock patients is clinically relevant. Unfortunately, there is no serum marker that can accurately assess intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess if serum diamine oxidase levels can reflect intestinal mucosal injury subsequent to prolonged hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: a control group, a medium blood pressure (BP) group (exsanguinated to a shock BP of 50 to 41 mm Hg), and a low BP group (exsanguinated to a shock blood pressure of 40 to 31 mm Hg), in which the shock BP was sustained for 180 min prior to fluid resuscitation. RESULTS: The severity of hemorrhagic shock in the low BP group was significantly greater than that of the medium BP group according to the post-resuscitation BP, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and arterial lactate. Intestinal damage was significantly more severe in the low BP group according to Chiu’s scoring, claudin-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and myeloperoxidase expression. Serum diamine oxidase was significantly increased in the low BP group compared to the medium BP and control groups and was negatively correlated with shock BP. CONCLUSION: Serum diamine oxidase can be used as a serological marker in evaluating intestinal injury and shows promise as an indicator of hemorrhagic shock severity.","Zhao, Liang; Luo, Lin; Jia, Weikun; Xiao, Juan; Huang, Gang; Tian, Geng; Li, Jingwei; Xiao, Yingbin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140717/,63
1659,Persistent viremia by a novel parvovirus in a slow loris (Nycticebus coucang) with diffuse histiocytic sarcoma,2014-12-01,"Cancer is one of the leading health concerns for human and animal health. Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we investigated a case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique. A novel parvovirus was discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a novel genus. The possible causative correlation between this virus and the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected animal were positive. The virus was present in all tested organs (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum samples collected up to 8 years before death. All attempts to identify a latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was consistent with absence of latency. Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma. It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.","Canuti, Marta; Williams, Cathy V.; Gadi, Sashi R.; Jebbink, Maarten F.; Oude Munnink, Bas B.; Jazaeri Farsani, Seyed Mohammad; Cullen, John M.; van der Hoek, Lia",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4249460/,63
2509,Spatiotemporal Analysis of the 2014 Ebola Epidemic in West Africa,2016-12-08,"In 2014–2016, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa experienced the largest and longest Ebola epidemic since the discovery of the virus in 1976. During the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. With good quality data on incidence, this data-driven method can help to effectively control emerging infections.","Backer, Jantien A.; Wallinga, Jacco",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145133/,63
2644,SheddomeDB: the ectodomain shedding database for membrane-bound shed markers,2017-03-14,"BACKGROUND: A number of membrane-anchored proteins are known to be released from cell surface via ectodomain shedding. The cleavage and release of membrane proteins has been shown to modulate various cellular processes and disease pathologies. Numerous studies revealed that cell membrane molecules of diverse functional groups are subjected to proteolytic cleavage, and the released soluble form of proteins may modulate various signaling processes. Therefore, in addition to the secreted protein markers that undergo secretion through the secretory pathway, the shed membrane proteins may comprise an additional resource of noninvasive and accessible biomarkers. In this context, identifying the membrane-bound proteins that will be shed has become important in the discovery of clinically noninvasive biomarkers. Nevertheless, a data repository for biological and clinical researchers to review the shedding information, which is experimentally validated, for membrane-bound protein shed markers is still lacking. RESULTS: In this study, the database SheddomeDB was developed to integrate publicly available data of the shed membrane proteins. A comprehensive literature survey was performed to collect the membrane proteins that were verified to be cleaved or released in the supernatant by immunological-based validation experiments. From 436 studies on shedding, 401 validated shed membrane proteins were included, among which 199 shed membrane proteins have not been annotated or validated yet by existing cleavage databases. SheddomeDB attempted to provide a comprehensive shedding report, including the regulation of shedding machinery and the related function or diseases involved in the shedding events. In addition, our published tool ShedP was embedded into SheddomeDB to support researchers for predicting the shedding event on unknown or unrecorded membrane proteins. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, SheddomeDB is the first database for the identification of experimentally validated shed membrane proteins and currently may provide the most number of membrane proteins for reviewing the shedding information. The database included membrane-bound shed markers associated with numerous cellular processes and diseases, and some of these markers are potential novel markers because they are not annotated or validated yet in other databases. SheddomeDB may provide a useful resource for discovering membrane-bound shed markers. The interactive web of SheddomeDB is publicly available at http://bal.ym.edu.tw/SheddomeDB/.

2947,Egr-1 regulates RTA transcription through a cooperative involvement of transcriptional regulators,2017-09-05,"Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) regulates the host cellular environment to establish life-long persistent infection by manipulating cellular signaling pathways, with approximately 1- 5% of cells undergoing lytic reactivation during the course of infection. Egr-1 (Early Growth Response Factor-1) is one such cellular transcription factor, which gets phosphorylated during the lytic phase of viral life cycle to perpetrate its function. This study demonstrates the mechanism of how Egr-1 mediates transcription of the immediate early gene, RTA (Replication and transcription activator), which is the lytic switch gene of KSHV. Egr-1 depleted KSHV infected cells exhibited reduced expression of RTA. Also, an increase in Egr-1 phosphorylation led to a higher virion production, which was suppressed in the presence of p38 and Raf inhibitors. Reporter assays showed that coexpression of Egr-1 and CBP (CREB-binding protein) enhances RTA promoter activity as compared to the expression of either Egr-1 or CBP alone. Binding of Egr-1 and CBP at RTA promoter was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP), which showed an enhanced accumulation during viral reactivation. Mutation in Egr-1 binding site of the RTA promoter eliminated Egr-1 response on promoter activation. Furthermore, de novo infection of THP-1 (monocytic) and HUVECs (endothelial) cells showed an upregulation of Egr-1 phosphorylation, whereas depletion of Egr-1 reduced the mRNA levels of RTA during primary infection. Together, these results demonstrate a cooperative role of Egr-1 and CBP in mediating RTA transcription, which significantly improves our understanding of the involvement of cellular factors controlling RTA transcription in KSHV pathogenesis.","Sarkar, Roni; Verma, Subhash C.",Oncotarget,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710935/,63
2986,Back to the future in a petri dish: Origin and impact of resurrected microbes in natural populations,2017-10-17,"Current natural populations face new interactions because of the re‐emergence of ancient microbes and viruses. These risks come from the re‐emergence of pathogens kept in laboratories or from pathogens that are retained in the permafrost, which become available upon thawing due to climate change. We here focus on the effects of such re‐emergence in natural host populations based on evolutionary theory of virulence and long‐term studies, which investigate host–pathogen adaptations. Pathogens tend to be locally and temporally adapted to their co‐occurring hosts, but when pathogens from a different environment or different time enter the host community, the degree to which a new host–pathogen interaction is a threat will depend on the specific genotypic associations, the time lag between the host and the pathogen, and the interactions with native or recent host and pathogen species. Some insights can be obtained from long‐term studies using a resurrection ecology approach. These long‐term studies based on time‐shift experiments are essential to obtain insight into the mechanisms underlying host–pathogen coevolution at several ecological and temporal scales. As past pathogens and their corresponding host(s) can differ in infectivity and susceptibility, strong reciprocal selective pressures can be induced by the pathogen. These strong selective pressures often result in an escalating arms race, but do not necessarily result in increased infectivity over time. Human health can also be impacted by these resurrected pathogens as the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, which are infectious diseases originating from animal populations naturally transmitted to humans. The sanitary risk associated with pathogen emergence from different environments (spatial or temporal) depends on a combination of socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors that affect the virulence or the pathogenic potential of microbes and their ability to infect susceptible host populations.","Houwenhuyse, Shira; Macke, Emilie; Reyserhove, Lien; Bulteel, Lore; Decaestecker, Ellen",Evol Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748525/,63
3774,Chloroplast DNA variation in a hyperdiverse tropical tree community,2019-03-26,"We investigate chloroplast DNA variation in a hyperdiverse community of tropical rainforest trees in French Guiana, focusing on patterns of intraspecific and interspecific variation. We test whether a species genetic diversity is higher when it has congeners in the community with which it can exchange genes and if shared haplotypes are more frequent in genetically diverse species, as expected in the presence of introgression. We sampled a total of 1,681 individual trees from 472 species corresponding to 198 genera and sequenced them at a noncoding chloroplast DNA fragment. Polymorphism was more frequent in species that have congeneric species in the study site than in those without congeners (30% vs. 12%). Moreover, more chloroplast haplotypes were shared with congeners in polymorphic species than in monomorphic ones (44% vs. 28%). Despite large heterogeneities caused by genus‐specific behaviors in patterns of hybridization, these results suggest that the higher polymorphism in the presence of congeners is caused by local introgression rather than by incomplete lineage sorting. Our findings suggest that introgression has the potential to drive intraspecific genetic diversity in species‐rich tropical forests.","Caron, Henri; Molino, Jean‐François; Sabatier, Daniel; Léger, Patrick; Chaumeil, Philippe; Scotti‐Saintagne, Caroline; Frigério, Jean‐Marc; Scotti, Ivan; Franc, Alain; Petit, Rémy J.",Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476754/,63
4570,Adaption of the ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assay for use with murine lung cells,2020-02-24,"Data on spontaneous pathology are substantially scarce for common marmosets, compared to other laboratory animals, but is essential for the interpretation of histological findings in the context of toxicological and experimental studies. Especially if common marmosets are used as experimental animals in respiratory research, detailed knowledge on the spectrum, occurrence, and incidence of spontaneous histopathological pulmonary lesions in this non-human primate species is required. In this study, lung tissue of 638 common marmosets from the marmoset colony of the German Primate Center was examined histologically. The analysis revealed a high incidence of predominantly mild and multifocal interstitial pneumonia (32.99 %) of unknown etiology in most cases. Only few marmosets exhibited lobar pneumonia (1.41 %) and bronchopneumonia (0.94), which were mainly caused by bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Lung immaturity and atelectasis were common histological findings in newborn marmosets. Typical background lesions included anthracosis (8.15 %), hemosiderosis (1.72 %), extramedullary hematopoiesis (11.6 %), mineralization (10.97 %), and inflammatory cell foci (10.34 %). In addition, three cases of pulmonary arteriopathy (0.47 %) and 1 case of foreign-body granuloma (0.16 %) were detected in the marmoset study cohort. The high prevalence of circulatory disturbances (congestion, edema, hemorrhage) and changes in air content (secondary atelectasis, alveolar emphysema) could partly be explained by euthanasia-related artifacts or agonal changes. The present study provides a comprehensive overview of the range and incidence of spontaneous pulmonary histopathology in common marmosets, serving as valuable reference data for the interpretation of lung lesions in toxicological and experimental marmoset studies.","Bleyer, Martina; Kunze, Marius; Gruber-Dujardin, Eva; Mätz-Rensing, Kerstin",Primate Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7041528/,63

5537,Evolutionary Trees from the Tabloids and Beyond,2010-10-08,"In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical analysis of a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of hepatitis C. The model is suitable for populations where two frequent modes of transmission of hepatitis C virus, namely unsafe blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, are dominant. The susceptible population is divided into two distinct compartments, the intravenous drug users and individuals undergoing unsafe blood transfusions. Individuals belonging to each compartment may develop acute and then possibly chronic infections. Chronically infected individuals may be quarantined. The analysis indicates that the eradication and persistence of the disease is completely determined by the magnitude of basic reproduction number R (c). It is shown that for the basic reproduction number R (c) < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. For R (c) > 1, an endemic equilibrium exists and the disease is uniformly persistent. In addition, we present the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of different important model parameters on the disease prevalence. When the infected population persists, we have designed a time-dependent optimal quarantine strategy to minimize it. The Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle is used to characterize the optimal control in terms of an optimality system which is solved numerically. Numerical results for the optimal control are compared against the constant controls and their efficiency is discussed.","Imran, Mudassar; Rafique, Hassan; Khan, Adnan; Malik, Tufail",Theory Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091180/,63
5580,Vampire bats go with the flow,2013-02-19,"Since 1999 we have developed two computational mutation approaches to analyze the protein primary structure whose methodology and implications were reviewed in 2002. Our first approach is the calculation of predictable and unpredictable portions of amino-acid pairs in a protein, and the second is the calculation of amino-acid distribution rank in a protein. Both approaches provide quantitative measures to present a protein, which we have used to study a number of proteins with numerous mutations such as p53 proteins. More recently, we focussed our efforts on analyzing the proteins mutating frequently over time such as hemagglutinins of influenza A viruses. In this review we summarise our findings and their implications for hemagglutinin mutations in combination with some newly available data. Our approaches throw light on the true nature of genetic heterogeneity of influenza virus hemagglutinins; that is, the protein variability is highly relevant to its amino-acid construction. Using these approaches, we can monitor new mutations from influenza virus hemagglutinins and may predict their mutations in the future.","Wu, Guang; Yan, Shao-min",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091618/,63

METHODS: This is a non-randomized short-term cross-over trial in which 12 pediatric patients with asynchrony (auto-triggering, double triggering or non-triggered breaths) were enrolled. Four sequential 10-min periods of data were recorded after 20 min of ventilatory stabilization (wash-out) at each of the following settings: baseline PS with the ventilator settings determined by the attending physician (1-PS(b)); PS after optimization (2-PS(opt)); NAVA level set so that maximum inspiratory pressure (P (max)) equaled P (max) in PS (3-NAVA); same settings as in 2-PS(opt) (4-PS(opt)). RESULTS: The median asynchrony index was significantly lower during NAVA (2.0 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (8.5 %, p = 0.017) and 4-PS(opt) (7.5 %, p = 0.008). In NAVA mode, the NAVA trigger accounted on average for 66 % of triggered breaths. The median trigger delay with respect to neural inspiratory time was significantly lower during NAVA (8.6 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (25.2 %, p = 0.003) and 4-PS(opt) (28.2 %, p = 0.0005). The median electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) change during trigger delay normalized to maximum inspiratory EAdi difference was significantly lower during NAVA (5.3 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (21.7 %, p = 0.0005) and 4-PS(opt) (24.6 %, p = 0.001). The coefficient of variation of tidal volume was significantly higher during NAVA (44.2 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (19.8 %, p = 0.0002) and 4-PS(opt) (23.0 %, p = 0.0005). The median COMFORT score during NAVA (15.0) was lower than that during 2-PS(opt) (18.0, p = 0.0125) and 4-PS(opt) (17.5, p = 0.039). No significant changes for any variable were observed between 1-PS(b) and 2-PS(opt).

5791,Guangzhou,2014-12-17,"OBJECTIVE: Influenza virus infections cause a high disease and economic burden during seasonal epidemics. However, there is still a need for reliable disease burden estimates to provide a more detailed picture of the impact of influenza. Therefore, the objectives of this study is to estimate the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza virus infection and associated hospitalisation costs in adult patients in the Netherlands during two consecutive influenza seasons. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection in three Dutch hospitals during respiratory seasons 2014–2015 and 2015–2016. Incidence was calculated as the weekly number of hospitalised influenza patients divided by the total population in the catchment populations of the three hospitals. Arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were estimated and included costs for emergency department consultation, diagnostics, general ward and/or intensive care unit admission, isolation, antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment. These hospitalisation costs were extrapolated to national level and expressed in 2017 euros. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 380 hospitalised adult influenza patients. The seasonal cumulative incidence was 3.5 cases per 10,000 persons in respiratory season 2014–2015, compared to 1.8 cases per 10,000 persons in 2015–2016. The arithmetic mean hospitalisation cost per influenza patient was €6128 (95% CI €4934–€7737) per patient in 2014–2015 and €8280 (95% CI €6254–€10,665) in 2015–2016, potentially reaching total hospitalisation costs of €28 million in 2014–2015 and €20 million in 2015–2016. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus infections lead to 1.8–3.5 hospitalised patients per 10,000 persons, with mean hospitalisation costs of €6100–€8300 per adult patient, resulting in 20–28 million euros annually in The Netherlands. The highest arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were found in the 45–64 year age group. These influenza burden estimates could be used for future influenza cost-effectiveness and impact studies.

7137,Review—Chemical and Biological Sensors for Viral Detection,2019-12-19,"BACKGROUND: Owing to the large amount of host DNA in clinical samples, generation of high-quality Plasmodium falciparum whole genome sequencing (WGS) data requires enrichment for parasite DNA. Enrichment is often achieved by leukocyte depletion of infected blood prior to storage. However, leukocyte depletion is difficult in low-resource settings and limits analysis to prospectively-collected samples. As a result, approaches such as selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) are being used to enrich for parasite DNA. However, sWGA has had limited success in generating reliable sequencing data from low parasitaemia samples. In this study, enzymatic digestion with MspJI prior to sWGA and whole genome sequencing was evaluated to determine whether this approach improved genome coverage compared to sWGA alone. The potential of sWGA to cause amplification bias in polyclonal infections was also examined. METHODS: DNA extracted from laboratory-created dried blood spots was treated with a modification-dependent restriction endonuclease, MspJI, and filtered via vacuum filtration. Samples were then selectively amplified using a previously reported sWGA protocol and subjected to WGS. Genome coverage statistics were compared between the optimized sWGA approach and the previously reported sWGA approach performed in parallel. Differential amplification by sWGA was assessed by comparing WGS data generated from lab-created mixtures of parasite isolates, from the same geographical region, generated with or without sWGA. RESULTS: MspJI digestion did not enrich for parasite DNA. Samples that underwent vacuum filtration (without MspJI digestion) prior to sWGA had the highest parasite DNA concentration and displayed greater genome coverage compared to MspJI + sWGA and sWGA alone, particularly for low parasitaemia samples. The optimized sWGA (filtration + sWGA) approach was successfully used to generate WGS data from 218 non-leukocyte depleted field samples from Malawi. Sequences from lab-created mixtures of parasites did not show evidence of differential amplification of parasite strains compared to directly sequenced samples. CONCLUSION: This optimized sWGA approach is a reliable method to obtain WGS data from non-leukocyte depleted, low parasitaemia samples. The absence of amplification bias in data generated from mixtures of isolates from the same geographic region suggests that this approach can be appropriately used for molecular epidemiological studies.","Shah, Zalak; Adams, Matthew; Moser, Kara A.; Shrestha, Biraj; Stucke, Emily M.; Laufer, Miriam K.; Serre, David; Silva, Joana C.; Takala-Harrison, Shannon",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106660/,63
7315,BOARD-INVITED REVIEW: Fate and transport of bioaerosols associated with livestock operations and manures,2010-11-11,"Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and 18 infection can lead to pre-malignant and malignant diseases of the lower genital tract. Several lines of evidence suggest that T cell responses can control HPV infection. However, relative to other human viruses, strong effector memory T cell responses against HPV have been difficult to detect. We used an in vitro stimulation step prior to enzyme-linked immunospot assays to identify IFN-γ-secreting T cells specific for HPV16 and 18 E6/E7 peptides. This allowed the detection of HPV-specific CD4(+) T cells that were not evident in direct ex vivo assays. T cell responses against HPV16 or 18 peptides were detected in healthy volunteers (7/9) and patients with lower genital tract neoplasia (10/20). Importantly, this assay allowed tracking of vaccine-induced T cell responses in nine patients, following inoculation with a live recombinant vaccinia virus (HPV16 and 18 E6/E7, TA-HPV). Novel vaccine-induced T cell responses were demonstrated in five patients, but no clinical responses (lesion regressions) were seen. For one vaccinated patient, the T cell response was mapped to a single dominant HPV18 E7 epitope and this response was sustained for >3 years. Our data suggest that systemic memory T cells against HPV16 and 18, induced naturally or by TA-HPV vaccination, are relatively rare. Nevertheless, the assay system developed allowed estimation of magnitude, epitope specificity, and longevity of vaccine-induced CD4(+) T cell responses. This will be useful for vaccine design and measurement of immunological endpoints in clinical trials.","Smith, Kelly L.; Tristram, Amanda; Gallagher, Kathleen M.; Fiander, Alison N.; Man, Stephen",Int Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109653/,63
7367,Predicting proteolytic sites in extracellular proteins: only halfway there,2008-04-15,"HPC-1/syntaxin 1A (HPC-1), which plays an important role in vesicular transport to the plasma membrane, possesses a hydrophobic sequence at its C terminus. When expressed from cDNA in COS cells, wild-type HPC-1 was localized in the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane. Truncation of the hydrophobic domain resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of the mutant, thus indicating that the domain indeed functions as a membrane anchor. A fusion protein with the C-terminal glycosylation sites was glycosylated in transfected cells, providing evidence that HPC-1 has a transmembrane structure, and that the protein is first inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the plasma membrane. A chimeric protein consisting of Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein with the last 24 amino acids of HPC-1 was inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum in a transmembrane topology and localized along the exocytic pathway of transfected cells similar to HPC-1. These results indicate that the portion is important for intracellular localization of HPC-1.","Masaki, Ryuichi; Yamamoto, Akitsugu; Akagawa, Kimio; Tashiro, Yutaka",J Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109847/,63

7615,Novel atmospheric pressure plasma device releasing atomic hydrogen: reduction of microbial-contaminants and OH radicals in the air,2007-01-21,"Previous work shows that the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for random walks to a given hub node (node with maximum degree) in uncorrelated random scale-free networks is closely related to the exponent [Formula: see text] of power-law degree distribution [Formula: see text] , which describes the extent of heterogeneity of scale-free network structure. However, extensive empirical research indicates that real networked systems also display ubiquitous degree correlations. In this paper, we address the trapping issue on the Koch networks, which is a special random walk with one trap fixed at a hub node. The Koch networks are power-law with the characteristic exponent [Formula: see text] in the range between 2 and 3, they are either assortative or disassortative. We calculate exactly the MFPT that is the average of first-passage time from all other nodes to the trap. The obtained explicit solution shows that in large networks the MFPT varies lineally with node number [Formula: see text] , which is obviously independent of [Formula: see text] and is sharp contrast to the scaling behavior of MFPT observed for uncorrelated random scale-free networks, where [Formula: see text] influences qualitatively the MFPT of trapping problem.","Zhang, Zhongzhi; Gao, Shuyang; Xie, Wenlei",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117061/,63

Here, we review current knowledge of influenza viruses, their life cycle, interspecies transmission, and past pandemics and discuss the molecular basis of pandemic acquisition, notably of hemagglutinin (lectin) acting as a key contributor to change in host specificity in viral infection.","Sriwilaijaroen, Nongluk; Suzuki, Yasuo",Lectins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121456/,63

A quantitative assessment of the structural changes in the cells was related to these in normal cells. Significant alterations were detected in the membrane structures and in the mitochondria. There was a reduction in surface area of the microvillus membrane, the basolateral membrane and the apical tubular membrane. There were alterations in the shape of mitochondrial profiles and a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria. Vesicular structures, which are a possible site of viral release, were observed in the lateral surface of cells. These changes in the functional components of the cells indicate impaired transport of ions and water. The results demonstrate the value of stereological methods for the study of viral-host cell interactions in the pathogenesis of viral disease.","Condron, R.J.; Marshall, A.T.",J Comp Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130396/,63

9676,Biology: Brain gene is tied to obesity,2009-07-02,"Aim To test whether species groups (i.e. assemblages of species co‐occurring in nature) that are statistically derived at one scale (broad, medium, or fine scale) can be transferred to another scale, and to identify the driving forces that determine species groups at the various scales. Location Northern Bohemia (Czech Republic, central Europe) in the Ještědský hřbet mountain range and its neighbourhood. Methods Three data sets were sampled: a floristic data set at the broad scale, another floristic data set at the intermediate scale, and a vegetation data set at the habitat scale. First, in each data set, species groups were produced by the COCKTAIL algorithm, which ensures maximized joint occurrence in the data set using a fidelity coefficient. Corresponding species groups were produced in the individual data sets by employing the same species for starting the algorithm. Second, the species groups formed in one data set, i.e. at a particular scale, were applied crosswise to the other data sets, i.e. to the other scales. Correspondence of a species group formed at a particular scale with a species group at another scale was determined. Third, to highlight the driving factors for the distribution of the plant species groups at each scale, canonical correspondence analysis was carried out. Results Twelve species groups were used to analyse the transferability of the groups across the three scales, but only six of them were found to be common to all scales. Correspondence of species groups derived from the finest scale with those derived at the broadest scale was, on average, higher than in the opposite direction. Forest (tree layer) cover, altitude and bedrock type explained most of the variability in canonical correspondence analysis across all scales. Main conclusions Transferability of species groups distinguished at a fine scale to broader scales is better than it is in the opposite direction. Therefore, a possible application of the results is to use species groups to predict the potential occurrence of missing species in broad‐scale floristic surveys from fine‐scale vegetation‐plot data.","Petřík, Petr; Bruelheide, Helge",J Biogeogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159123/,63

9926,Components and regulation of nuclear transport processes,2014-12-22,"1. Aquatic bryophytes were sampled from 108 streams spanning over 3000 m of altitude in four regions of Nepal. Richness, cover and community composition were related to physicochemistry using multiple regression, DECORANA ordination and TWINSPAN. The performance of a hierarchically scaled descriptive model, developed in New Zealand for predicting bryophyte distribution, was examined in this highly heterogeneous Himalayan region. 2. Community composition and cover varied highly significantly with altitude, streambed stability and alkalinity, with evidence of effects of riparian land use on bryophyte cover. Cover was greatest in streams at low to middle altitudes with steep slopes (> 15°), high stability and low conductivity (< 60 μS cm(–1)), where communities were dominated by two Isopterygium spp., two Philonotis spp., Mnium punctatum and Lejeuneaceae. 3. Richness, by contrast, increased significantly but weakly at high altitude and moderate stability, where streams were dominated by Eurynchium praelongum, Rhynchostegium spp., Fissidens grandifrons and Hygroamblystegium spp. Richness and cover were lowest in unstable streams at the lowest altitude, where no single taxon was consistently most abundant. 4. Although these results were similar to those in the descriptive model developed for bryophytes in New Zealand, subtle differences were apparent. Substrate size, although influencing the presence of bryophytes in New Zealand streams, appeared to be unimportant in Nepal. By contrast, streambed stability was more important in Nepal than New Zealand, perhaps reflecting pronounced monsoonal floods, and subsequent increased frequency of bed movement in the former. A suggested habitat template indicates that large plant size and vegetative reproduction may be responsible for the widespread distribution of some species, even into unstable Himalayan streams.","Suren, A.

10001,"Plant species richness of nature reserves: the interplay of area, climate and habitat in a central European landscape",2002-07-04,"Abstract Two main types of safety procedures must be applied to biological products, including plasma derivatives: (i) preventive procedures and (ii) elimination procedures.Prevention includes epidemiological control of donor populations; checks on each donor’s health condition; analysis of each donation for the main pathogens using serological methods; additional analysis of all plasma for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the B19 virus, using nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT). A 60 days or longer inventory hold of all plasma donations is applied, to allow additional time to discard previous donations from potential seroconverting or otherwise rejectable donors.Elimination procedures minimize the low residual risk of transmitting pathogens, including unknown or previously undetected ones. Since the introduction 20 years ago of solvent‐detergent treatment, very effective against enveloped viruses (HIV, HBV, HCV, West Nile virus, SARS, avian influenza virus etc), there have been no known cases of transmission of this type of pathogens by products manufactured according to this procedure. Other inactivation procedures such as pasteurization, dry‐heat or nanofiltration may prove equally effective. In addition, dry‐heat treatment and nanofiltration are capable of effectively eliminating non‐enveloped viruses (HAV, B19 virus). Recent studies show that the B19 virus is much more sensitive to heat (in lyophilized state or by pasteurization) and acid pH than previously thought.Although there is no evidence for the transmission of classic transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) through blood or blood‐products transfusion, four possible cases have been reported in the United Kingdom involving transmission by non‐leukoreduced blood components of the agent that causes variant Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Disease (vCJD), a disease linked to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which took place in that country. However, there are no cases of human TSE (classic or variant) transmission by plasma‐derived products. Analytical methods capable of detecting the vCJD agent in patients’ brains (where high titres are found) and other tissues (such as the spleen, appendix and lymph nodes, where much lower concentrations are found) are unable to detect the agent in blood or plasma from patients with vCJD, even in the clinical phase of the disease. Experiments by Grifols and other groups show that the capacity of the production processes to eliminate vCJD agent models is many orders of magnitude greater than the maximum expected load of the agent. In this regard, the efficacy of precipitation, affinity chromatography, depth filtration and nanofiltration are particularly notable.","JORQUERA, J.

10234,Australia was indeed the “lucky country” in the recent worldwide SARS epidemic,2004-08-16,"Thymidine phosphorylase (TP), also known as “platelet‐derived endothelial cell growth factor” (PD‐ECGF), is an enzyme, which is upregulated in a wide variety of solid tumors including breast and colorectal cancers. TP promotes tumor growth and metastasis by preventing apoptosis and inducing angiogenesis. Elevated levels of TP are associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Therefore, TP inhibitors are synthesized in an attempt to prevent tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. TP is also indispensable for the activation of the extensively used 5‐fluorouracil prodrug capecitabine, which is clinically used for the treatment of colon and breast cancer. Clinical trials that combine capecitabine with TP‐inducing therapies (such as taxanes or radiotherapy) suggest that increasing TP expression is an adequate strategy to enhance the antitumoral efficacy of capecitabine. Thus, TP plays a dual role in cancer development and therapy: on the one hand, TP inhibitors can abrogate the tumorigenic and metastatic properties of TP; on the other, TP activity is necessary for the activation of several chemotherapeutic drugs. This duality illustrates the complexity of the role of TP in tumor progression and in the clinical response to fluoropyrimidine‐based chemotherapy. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

10793,Reversion of vegetation following the cessation of fertilizer application,2009-02-24,"Abstract In the present study, we modified an existing surface wipe sampling method for lead and other heavy metals to create a protocol to collect fungi in floor dust followed by real‐time quantitative PCR (qPCR)‐based detection. We desired minimal inconvenience for participants in residential indoor environmental quality and health studies. Accuracy, precision, and method detection limits (MDLs) were investigated. Overall, MDLs ranged from 0.6 to 25 cell/cm(2) on sampled floors. Overall measurement precisions expressed as the coefficient of variation because of sample processing and qPCR ranged 6–63%. Median and maximum fungal concentrations in house dust in study homes in Visalia, Tulare County, California, were 110 and 2500 cell/cm(2), respectively, with universal fungal primers (allergenic and nonallergenic species). The field study indicated samplings in multiple seasons were necessary to characterize representative whole‐year fungal concentrations in residential microenvironments. This was because significant temporal variations were observed within study homes. Combined field and laboratory results suggested this modified new wipe sampling method, in conjunction with growth‐independent qPCR, shows potential to improve human exposure and health studies for fungal pathogens and allergens in dust in homes of susceptible, vulnerable population subgroups. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Fungi are ubiquitous in indoor and outdoor environments, and many fungi are known to cause allergic reactions and exacerbate asthma attacks. This study established—by modifying an existing—a wipe sampling method to collect fungi in floor dust followed by real‐time quantitative PCR (qPCR)‐based detection methodologies. Results from this combined laboratory and field assessment suggested the methodology’s potential to inform larger human exposure studies for fungal pathogens and allergens in house dust as well as epidemiologic studies of children with asthma and older adults with chronic respiratory diseases.","Yamamoto, N.; Shendell, D.

The statistical methods used to test vaccine safety hypotheses are described and the merits of different study designs evaluated; these include the cohort, case-control, case-coverage and the self-controlled case-series methods. For multiple sclerosis, the evidence does not support the hypothesized relationship with hepatitis B vaccine. For Guillain−Barré syndrome, the evidence suggests a small elevated risk after influenza vaccines, though considerably lower than after natural influenza infection, with no elevated risk after human papilloma virus vaccine. For narcolepsy, there is strong evidence of a causal association with one adjuvanted vaccine used in the 2009/10 influenza pandemic.

12535,Global reference mapping of human transcription factor footprints,2020-07-29,"The type I interferon (IFN) response is a principal component of our immune system that allows to counter a viral attack immediately upon viral entry into host cells. Upon engagement of aberrantly localised nucleic acids, germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors convey their find via a signalling cascade to prompt kinase-mediated activation of a specific set of five transcription factors. Within the nucleus, the coordinated interaction of these dimeric transcription factors with coactivators and the basal RNA transcription machinery is required to access the gene encoding the type I IFN IFNβ (IFNB1). Virus-induced release of IFNβ then induces the antiviral state of the system and mediates further mechanisms for defence. Due to its key role during the induction of the initial IFN response, the activity of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is tightly regulated by the host and fiercely targeted by viral proteins at all conceivable levels. In this review, we will revisit the steps enabling the trans-activating potential of IRF3 after its activation and the subsequent assembly of the multi-protein complex at the IFNβ enhancer that controls gene expression. Further, we will inspect the regulatory mechanisms of these steps imposed by the host cell and present the manifold strategies viruses have evolved to intervene with IFNβ transcription downstream of IRF3 activation in order to secure establishment of a productive infection.","Schwanke, Hella; Stempel, Markus; Brinkmann, Melanie M.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7411613/,63

Given the patient’s inability to remain in good posture in his wheelchair he underwent a multilevel vertebrectomy and thoracolumbar fusion. Due to multiple co-morbidities, surgical recovery was complex, ultimately requiring revision circumferential fixation. DISCUSSION: CAS is an uncommon, long-term complication of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Surgical management is often complex and associated with significant complications. Currently, a consensus on CAS prevention, specific surgical fixation techniques and post-surgical nursing care management is lacking. In this case report we provide our experience in the management of a complex case of CAS to aid in decision making for future neurosurgeons who encounter this sequela of traumatic SCI.","Vora, Darshan; Schlaff, Cody D.; Rosner, Michael K.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786288/,63

The symptoms of these diseases take time to manifest, which can prevent workers from noticing that they have been exposed until symptoms appear. The current paper sought to assess the occupational safety and preventative measures taken in laboratories in Spain, and to compare these measures with those reported by other studies worldwide. A cross-sectional study of workers (35–50 years old) was conducted using a web survey (N = 30), and a bibliometric analysis was carried out in the Scopus database (92 documents were selected). The occupational safety and health measures were inadequate, according to the opinions of the workers. The training (p < 0.01), the amount of work (p < 0.05), and how the workers followed their protocols (p < 0.001) were linked to incidents and exposure to airborne pathogens. The most significant previous publication was a report (848 citations) stating that the previous variables linked to exposure are vital for prevention. Most works focused on countries like the U.S.A. (p = 0.009) were reviews, with a limited number of studies focused on occupational safety.","Vaquero-Álvarez, Esther; Cubero-Atienza, Antonio; Ruiz-Martínez, Pilar; Vaquero-Abellán, Manuel; Redel-Macías, María Dolores; Aparicio-Martínez, Pilar",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579467/,63

Surgery combined with chemotherapy has been recommended as a curative regimen for HCC. Nevertheless, the anticancer mechanisms of chemicals in hepatocellular carcinoma remain unclear. Pyroptosis is a type of programmed necrosis, and its mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma is poorly understood. The efficacy and mechanism of arsenic trioxide nanoparticles in the treatment of HCC were explored in this research. Arsenic trioxide alone and arsenic trioxide nanoparticles were conveniently administered to mice intratumorally using a needle. Compared with As(2)O(3), As(2)O(3) nanoparticles (As(2)O(3)-NPs) showed better inhibition, promoted greater LDH release, and induced cell morphology indicative of pyroptosis in vitro. Compared with the free drug, As(2)O(3)-NPs increased GSDME-N expression and decreased Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt1 expression in Huh7 cells. In vivo, As(2)O(3)-NPs induced a significant decrease in the expression of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and Dnmt1, but significantly upregulated the expression of GSDME-N (gasdermin E (GSDME) was originally found to be related to deafness; recently, it has been defined as a gasdermin family member associated with pyroptosis). As(2)O(3)-NPs inhibited tumor growth more strongly than As(2)O(3) or control, a finding likely attributed to the downregulation of PCNA and DNMT-related proteins and the upregulation of GSDME-N.","Hu, Jian; Dong, Yi; Ding, Li; Dong, Yang; Wu, Zhihua; Wang, Wenping; Shen, Ming; Duan, Yourong",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6799825/,63

14010,Kardiale Magnetresonanztomographie: Trends und Entwicklungen,2020-11-05,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas are a pediatric disease, which still needs treatment improvement. Crizotinib was the first ALK-targeted inhibitor used in clinics, but relapses are now known to occur. Current research efforts indicate that combined therapies could represent a superior strategy to eradicate malignant cells and prevent tumor recurrence. Autophagy is a self-digestion cellular process, known to be induced upon diverse cancer therapies. Our present work demonstrates that the potentiation of the crizotinib-induced autophagy flux, through the serine/threonine kinase RAF1 downregulation, drives ALK+ ALCL cells to death. These results should encourage further investigations on the therapeutic modulation of autophagy in this particular cancer settings and other ALK-related malignancies. ABSTRACT: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALK+ ALCL) are an aggressive pediatric disease. The therapeutic options comprise chemotherapy, which is efficient in approximately 70% of patients, and targeted therapies, such as crizotinib (an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)), used in refractory/relapsed cases. Research efforts have also converged toward the development of combined therapies to improve treatment. In this context, we studied whether autophagy could be modulated to improve crizotinib therapy. Autophagy is a vesicular recycling pathway, known to be associated with either cell survival or cell death depending on the cancer and therapy. We previously demonstrated that crizotinib induced cytoprotective autophagy in ALK+ lymphoma cells and that its further intensification was associated with cell death. In line with these results, we show here that combined ALK and Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma 1 (RAF1) inhibition, using pharmacological (vemurafenib) or molecular (small interfering RNA targeting RAF1 (siRAF1) or microRNA-7-5p (miR-7-5p) mimics) strategies, also triggered autophagy and potentiated the toxicity of TKI. Mechanistically, we found that this combined therapy resulted in the decrease of the inhibitory phosphorylation on Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) (a key protein in autophagy initiation), which may account for the enforced autophagy and cytokilling effect. Altogether, our results support the development of ALK and RAF1 combined inhibition as a new therapeutic approach in ALK+ ALCL.","Sorrentino, Domenico; Frentzel, Julie; Mitou, Géraldine; Blasco, Rafael B.; Torossian, Avédis; Hoareau-Aveilla, Coralie; Pighi, Chiara; Farcé, Manon; Meggetto, Fabienne; Manenti, Stéphane; Espinos, Estelle; Chiarle, Roberto; Giuriato, Sylvie",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650725/,63

The aim of the present study was to reveal that mechanism and explore non-antibiotic treatment. 16s rRNA sequencing and metabonomics were performed in the intestinal contents of chickens infected with H9N2 AIV or H9N2 AIV and fed with ageratum-liquid (AL) to reveal the metabolite that promote intestinal Escherichia coli (E. coli) proliferation caused by H9N2 AIV, as well as to determine the regulatory effect of AL. It was found that H9N2 AIV infection led E. coli to become the dominant gut microbe and promoted E. coli translocation from the intestinal tract to the visceral tissue through the damaged intestinal barrier. H9N2 AIV infection induces inflammation in the intestinal mucosa and promotes the secretion and release of nitrate from the host intestinal epithelium. In addition, nitrate promoted E. coli proliferation in the inflamed intestinal tract following H9N2 AIV infection. Furthermore, Chinese herbal medicine AL can restore intestinal homeostasis, inhibit the production of nitrate in the intestinal epithelium and effectively prevent the proliferation and translocation of E. coli in the intestines. This is the first report on the mechanism of E. coli secondary infection induced by H9N2 AIV, where herbal medicine AL was shown to have a good preventive effect on the secondary infection.","Zhang, Xinheng; Zhao, Qiqi; Wu, Che; Xie, Zi; Ci, Xiaotong; Li, Hongxin; Lin, Wencheng; Zhang, Huanmin; Xie, Qingmei",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7662154/,63

This study focused on the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) algorithm to predict the bearing capacity of driven pile. For this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) was developed to select the most significant features in the raw dataset. After that, a GA-DLNN hybrid model was developed to select optimal parameters for the DLNN model, including: network algorithm, activation function for hidden neurons, number of hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each hidden layer. A database containing 472 driven pile static load test reports was used. The dataset was divided into three parts, namely the training set (60%), validation (20%) and testing set (20%) for the construction, validation and testing phases of the proposed model, respectively. Various quality assessment criteria, namely the coefficient of determination (R(2)), Index of Agreement (IA), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), were used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning (ML) algorithms. The GA-DLNN hybrid model was shown to exhibit the ability to find the most optimal set of parameters for the prediction process.The results showed that the performance of the hybrid model using only the most critical features gave the highest accuracy, compared with those obtained by the hybrid model using all input variables.","Pham, Tuan Anh; Tran, Van Quan; Vu, Huong-Lan Thi; Ly, Hai-Bang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746167/,63

However, role of exosomal miR-125b-5p in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) remains further explored. We focused on the effect of exosomal miR-125b-5p on ALI progression via targeting topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A). METHODS: The ALI mouse models were established by cecal ligation and perforation, which were then treated with miR-125b-5p agomir or overexpressed TOP2A. Next, the pathological structure of ALI mouse lung tissues were observed, miR-125b-5p, TOP2A and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was determined, and the lung water content, inflammatory response, protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and cell apoptosis in ALI mouse lung tissues were assessed. Exosomes were extracted from endothelial cells (ECs) and identified, which were then injected into the modeled mice to observe their roles in ALI. The targeting relationship between miR-125b-5p and TOP2A was confirmed. RESULTS: MiR-125b-5p was downregulated while TOP2A was upregulated in ALI mice. MiR-125b-5p elevation or ECs-derived exosomes promoted VEGF expression, improved pathological changes and restrained lung water content, inflammatory response, protein content in BALF and cell apoptosis in lung tissues ALI mice. TOP2A overexpression reversed the repressive role of miR-125b-5p upregulation in ALI, while downregulated miR-125b-5p abrogated the effect of ECs-derived exosomes on ALI. TOP2A was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-125b-5p. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that ECs-derived exosomes overexpressed miR-125b-5p to protect from sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting TOP2A, which may contribute to ALI therapeutic strategies.","Jiang, Lijing; Ni, Jindi; Shen, Guofeng; Xia, Zhuye; Zhang, Lu; Xia, Shihong; Pan, Shengfu; Qu, Hongping; Li, Xiang",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7776283/,63

Because gnotobiotic pigs can be infected with human norovirus (HuNoV) GII, they are frequently used to analyze the associated pathogenic mechanisms and immune responses, which remain poorly understood. Recently, mRNA sequencing analysis (RNA-Seq) has been used to identify cellular responses to viruses. In this study, we investigated the host immune response and possible mechanisms involved in virus evasion in the ileum of gnotobiotic pigs infected with HuNoV by RNA-Seq. HuNoV was detected in the feces, blood, and tissues of the jejunum, ileum, colon, mesenteric lymph node, and spleen of pigs infected with HuNoV. In analysis of mRNA sequencing, expression of anti-viral protein genes such as OAS1, MX1, and MX2 were largely decreased, whereas type I IFN was increased in pigs infected with HuNoV. In addition, expression of TNF and associated anti-inflammatory cytokine genes such as IL10 was increased in HuNoV-infected pigs. Expression of genes related to natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and CD8(+) T cell exhaustion was increased, whereas that of MHC class I genes was decreased. Expression profiles of selected genes were further confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. These results suggest that infection with HuNoV induces NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity but suppresses type I IFN- and CD8(+) T cell-mediated antiviral responses.","Park, Byung-Joo; Ahn, Hee-Seop; Han, Sang-Hoon; Go, Hyeon-Jeong; Kim, Dong-Hwi; Choi, Changsun; Jung, Soontag; Myoung, Jinjong; Lee, Joong-Bok; Park, Seung-Yong; Song, Chang-Seon; Lee, Sang-Won; Lee, Hoon-Taek; Choi, In-Soo",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7826840/,63

15567,Scaling of contact networks for epidemic spreading in urban transit systems,2021-02-23,"BACKGROUND: Epidemics of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are occurring more frequently and spreading faster and farther than before in many areas of the world. The present study aimed to assess a long-lasting emerging epidemic (2005–2019) of 5532 cases with anthroponotic CL (ACL) in peri-urban areas of Kerman city in southeastern Iran. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study was carried out for 15 years in Kerman province, southeastern Iran. The data were passively obtained through the health surveillance system and the Kerman Leishmaniasis Research Center. Every subject was diagnosed using direct smear microscopy. The representative causative agent was further examined by ITS1-PCR, PCR-RFLP, 7SL RNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. For each subject, a case report form designating demographic and clinical data was recorded. RESULTS: A different pattern of ACL incidence was found in peri-urban areas compared to that in the city of Kerman. The incidence rate of ACL cases has significantly increased (P < 0.001) from 2005 to 2016 in new settlements with a gradual decline after that. The overall average risk of contracting the disease was 7.6 times higher in peri-urban areas compared to Kerman city, an old endemic focus. All isolates consisting of six variants were confirmed to be Leishmania tropica. The overall pattern of the ACL infection indicates that the etiological agent of ACL is propagated and transmitted by the bite of female Phlebotomus sergenti sandflies from person to person from dissimilar clones as reflected by the complexity of the migrants’ backgrounds in the province. CONCLUSIONS: The movement of populations and establishment of new settlements in peri-urban areas close to endemic areas are major risk factors for and are directly linked to CL. The underlying factors of this emerging ACL epidemic caused by L. tropica were disasters and droughts, among others. A robust commitment to a multilateral approach is crucial to make improvements in this area. This will require decisive coordinated actions through all governmental factions and non-governmental organizations. Furthermore, active and passive case detection strategies, early diagnosis, and effective treatment could help control the disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study between September 2019 and March 2020. Cohort of adults presenting to the ED requiring rapid sequence induction (RSI) were recruited to determine the prevalence and risk factors for the development of aspiration pneumonia(AP) in patients intubated in the ED. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 154 patients with a mean age of 44.5 years required RSI in the ED. Male (61%) predominance was noted among the study cohorts. We did not find any association between RSI performed in the ED and the risk of developing AP. The first attempt success rate of RSI was 76.7%, and 33(21.4%) patients had immediate adverse events following RSI. Rescue intubation was required for 11(7.1%) patients. The prevalence of AP following RSI in the ED was 13.4%. Endotracheal tube (ET) aspirate pepsin was positive in 45(29.2%) samples collected. The ET aspirate pepsin assay had low sensitivity (44.44%), specificity (73.53%), positive predictive value (18%), and negative predictive value (91%) in predicting the occurrence of AP. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, male gender (AOR: 7.29, 95%CI: 1.51−35.03, p = 0.013) and diabetes mellitus (AOR: 3.75, 95%CI: 1.23-11.51, p = 0.02) were found to be independent risk factors for developing AP.

16079,Measurement and Comparison of Melt-Blowing Airflow Fields: Nozzle Modifications to Reduce Turbulence and Fibre Whipping,2021-02-26,"Uveal melanoma (UM) represents the most prominent primary eye cancer in adults. With an incidence of approximately 5 cases per million individuals annually in the United States, UM could be considered a relatively rare cancer. The 90-95% of UM cases arise from the choroid. Diagnosis is based mainly on a clinical examination and ancillary tests, with ocular ultrasonography being of greatest value. Differential diagnosis can prove challenging in the case of indeterminate choroidal lesions and, sometimes, monitoring for documented growth may be the proper approach. Fine needle aspiration biopsy tends to be performed with a prognostic purpose, often in combination with radiotherapy. Gene expression profiling has allowed for the grading of UMs into two classes, which feature different metastatic risks. Patients with UM require a specialized multidisciplinary management. Primary tumor treatment can be either enucleation or globe preserving. Usually, enucleation is reserved for larger tumors, while radiotherapy is preferred for small/medium melanomas. The prognosis is unfavorable due to the high mortality rate and high tendency to metastasize. Following the development of metastatic disease, the mortality rate increases to 80% within one year, due to both the absence of an effective treatment and the aggressiveness of the condition. Novel molecular studies have allowed for a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in UM biological activity, which differs compared to skin melanomas. The most commonly mutated genes are GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1. Research in this field could help to identify effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic targets.","Fallico, Matteo; Raciti, Giuseppina; Longo, Antonio; Reibaldi, Michele; Bonfiglio, Vincenza; Russo, Andrea; Caltabiano, Rosario; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Falzone, Luca; Avitabile, Teresio",Int J Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910016/,63

Early detection using salivary small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) biomarkers may facilitate timely prevention. sEVs derived from different species (i.e., humans, bacteria) are expected to circulate in saliva. This pilot study recruited 22 participants (seven periodontal healthy, seven gingivitis and eight periodontitis) and salivary sEVs were isolated using the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method. The healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis groups were compared in terms of salivary sEVs in the CD9+ sEV subpopulation, Gram-negative bacteria-enriched lipopolysaccharide (LPS+) outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and global DNA methylation pattern of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and N6-Methyladenosine (m6dA). It was found that LPS+ OMVs, global 5mC methylation and four periodontal pathogens (T. denticola, E. corrodens, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum) that secreted OMVs were significantly increased in periodontitis sEVs compared to those from healthy groups. These differences were more pronounced in sEVs than the whole saliva and were more superior in distinguishing periodontitis than gingivitis, in comparison to healthy patients. Of note, global 5mC hypermethylation in salivary sEVs can distinguish periodontitis patients from both healthy controls and gingivitis patients with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 1). The research findings suggest that assessing global sEV methylation may be a useful biomarker for periodontitis.","Han, Pingping; Bartold, Peter Mark; Salomon, Carlos; Ivanovski, Sašo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957785/,63

In this study, we explored the utility of diverse HIV-1 envelope (Env) immunogens in a sequential immunization scheme as a solution to this task. This exploration stemmed from the rationale that gp145, a membrane-bound truncation form of HIV Env, may facilitate the focusing of induced antibody response on neutralizing epitopes when sequentially combined with the soluble gp140 form as immunogens in a prime-boost mode. We first showed that gp140 DNA prime-gp145 Tiantan vaccinia (TV) boost likely represents a general format for inducing potent nAb response in mice. However, when examined in rhesus macaque, this modality showed little effectiveness. To improve the efficacy, we extended the original modality by adding a strong protein boost, namely native-like SOSIP.664 trimer displayed on ferritin-based nanoparticle (NP), which was generated by a newly developed click approach. The resulting three-immunization regimen succeeded in eliciting tier-2 nAb response with substantial breadth when implemented in rhesus macaque over a short 8-week schedule. Importantly, the elicited nAb response was able to effectively contain viremia upon a heterologous SHIV challenge. Collectively, our studies highlighted that diversification of Env immunogens, in both types and formulations, under the framework of a sequential immunization scheme might open new opportunity toward HIV vaccine development.

A comprehensive study of a processed cotton fibres isolation technique and their applications are highlighted in this review. Surface modification of cotton wastes fibre increases the adsorption of dyes and heavy metals removal from wastewater. Cotton wastes fibres have demonstrated high adsorption capacity for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater. Cotton wastes fibres have found remarkable application in slope amendments, reinforcement of expansive soils and building materials, and a proven source for isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Several research work on the use of cotton waste for functional application rather than disposal has been done. However, no review study has discussed the potentials of cotton wastes from source (Micro-Nano) to application. This review critically analyses novel isolation techniques of CNC from cotton wastes with an in-depth study of a parameter variation effect on their yield. Different pretreatment techniques and efficiency were discussed. From the analysis, chemical pretreatment is considered the most efficient extraction of CNCs from cotton wastes. The pretreatment strategies can suffer variation in process conditions, resulting in distortion in the extracted cellulose’s crystallinity. Acid hydrolysis using sulfuric acid is the most used extraction process for cotton wastes-based CNC. A combined pretreatment process, such as sonication and hydrolysis, increases the crystallinity of cotton-based CNCs. The improvement of the reinforced matrix interface of textile fibres is required for improved packaging and biomedical applications for the sustainability of cotton-based CNCs.","Rizal, Samsul; H. P.

16942,Fast estimation of time-varying infectious disease transmission rates,2020-09-21,"Previous research suggests that hepatocytes catabolize chemical toxins but do not remove microbial agents, which are filtered out by other liver cells (Kupffer cells and endothelial cells). Here we show that, contrary to current understanding, hepatocytes trap and rapidly silence type B coxsackieviruses (CVBs). In genetically wildtype mice, this activity causes hepatocyte damage, which is alleviated in mice carrying a hepatocyte-specific deletion of the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor. However, in these mutant mice, there is a dramatic early rise in blood-borne virus, followed by accelerated systemic disease and increased mortality. Thus, wild type hepatocytes act similarly to a sponge for CVBs, protecting against systemic illness at the expense of their own survival. We speculate that hepatocytes may play a similar role in other viral infections as well, thereby explaining why hepatocytes have evolved their remarkable regenerative capacity. Our data also suggest that, in addition to their many other functions, hepatocytes might be considered an integral part of the innate immune system.","Kimura, Taishi; Flynn, Claudia T.; Whitton, J.

At the same time, the American default lifestyle has steadily displaced household food production with industrial food production, despite increased cultural interest in cooking. An important focus of cooking research to date has been on cooking’s association with nutrition and dietary quality. Less focus has been placed on how cooking might foster the qualities that allow for mitigation of psychosocial distress and promote well-being. Rooted in its evolutionary role in the human experience, cooking requires skills and knowledge that have the capacity to encourage aspects of well-being as described by Seligman as flourishing. Evidence for a beneficial role of cooking in psychosocial health exists, but the exploration is limited, potentially due to lack of a theoretical context to explain these benefits. From this perspective, we review the current literature showing the application of Seligman’s prominent well-being model, Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment (PERMA), to cooking, defined as the activity related to the preparation of food or a meal. We propose that the PERMA model as applied to cooking may function as a theoretical framework to explore psychosocial outcomes associated with cooking. Broader application of this approach may also help to further the application of positive psychology in the developing literature around psychosocial health and nutrition-related chronic diseases.","Farmer, Nicole; Cotter, Elizabeth W.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8071848/,63

SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to pressure‐redistributing beds, overlays or mattresses. Comparators were any beds, overlays or mattresses that were applied for treating pressure ulcers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies (972 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 72 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 64.0 to 86.5 years (median: 82.7 years) and all studies recruited people with existing pressure ulcers (the baseline ulcer area size ranging from 4.2 to 18.6 cm(2),median 6.6 cm(2)). Participants were recruited from acute care settings (six studies) and community and long‐term care settings (seven studies). Of the 13 studies, three (224 participants) involved surfaces that were not well described and therefore could not be classified. Additionally, six (46.2%) of the 13 studies presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. We synthesised data for four comparisons in the review: alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus foam surfaces; reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces; reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces, and a comparison between two types of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces. We summarise key findings for these four comparisons below. (1) Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus foam surfaces: we are uncertain if there is a difference between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and foam surfaces in the proportion of participants whose pressure ulcers completely healed (two studies with 132 participants; the reported risk ratio (RR) in one study was 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 3.58). There is also uncertainty for the outcomes of patient comfort (one study with 83 participants) and adverse events (one study with 49 participants). These outcomes have very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (2) Reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference in the proportion of participants with completely healed pressure ulcers between reactive air surfaces and foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80; I(2) = 0%; 2 studies, 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence). When time to complete pressure ulcer healing is considered using a hazard ratio, data from one small study (84 participants) suggests a greater hazard for complete ulcer healing on reactive air surfaces (hazard ratio 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low‐certainty evidence). These results are sensitive to the choice of outcome measure so should be interpreted as uncertain. We are also uncertain whether there is any difference between these surfaces in patient comfort responses (1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and in adverse events (2 studies, 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There is low‐certainty evidence that reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer‐free day in the first year of use (1 study, 87 participants). Included studies did not report health‐related quality of life. (3) Reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference between reactive water surfaces and foam surfaces in the proportion of participants with healed pressure ulcers (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.63; 1 study, 101 participants) and in adverse events (1 study, 120 participants). All these have very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, patient comfort, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (4) Comparison between two types of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference between Nimbus and Pegasus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces in the proportion of participants with healed pressure ulcers, in patient comfort responses and in adverse events: each of these outcomes had four studies (256 participants) but very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain about the relative effects of most different pressure‐redistributing surfaces for pressure ulcer healing (types directly compared are alternating pressure air surfaces versus foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces, reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces, and Nimbus versus Pegasus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces). There is also uncertainty regarding the effects of these different surfaces on the outcomes of comfort and adverse events. However, people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have pressure ulcers completely healed than those using foam surfaces over 37.5 days' follow‐up, and reactive air surfaces may cost more for each ulcer‐free day than foam surfaces. Future research in this area could consider the evaluation of alternating pressure air surfaces versus foam surfaces as a high priority. Time‐to‐event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial‐level cost‐effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Further review using network meta‐analysis will add to the findings reported here.","Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Rhodes, Sarah; Jammali-Blasi, Asmara; Ramsden, Victoria; McInnes, Elizabeth",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8108042/,63
18206,Optical and Thermal Investigations of New Schiff Base/Ester Systems in Pure and Mixed States,2021-05-22,"Body concerns and stress-related disorders are increasing in the younger population in a wide range of nations. Studies find links between both self-worth, exercise dependence, and self-esteem in relation to stress, but few have considered all three variables in relation to one another. The present study explored whether the co-appearance of high levels of psychological distress, and low levels of self-esteem may be a vulnerability factor for developing exercise dependence by studying the links between self-esteem, psychological stress, and exercise dependence. A standardized cross-sectional questionnaire was completed by 203 regular exercisers attending two gyms (mean age: 35.9 years). The variables self-esteem, psychological distress, and exercise dependence were all significantly correlated with each other, even after weekly exercise amount, age, and gender had been accounted for. Those who exercised for more than 9 h per week had a significantly higher score on stress and exercise dependence symptoms, and a lower score on self-esteem compared with the remaining groups. One could hypothesize that low self-esteem is a vulnerability factor and high psychological stress a maintenance factor for an exercise-dependent person. It is argued that more focus should be directed toward the negative consequences of excessive exercise.","Wågan, Frida Austmo; Darvik, Monica Dahle; Pedersen, Arve Vorland",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8197145/,63

DESIGN: Feasibility randomised controlled trial with embedded qualitative study to inform recruiter training to optimise recruitment and the design of a future definitive trial. SETTING: Three specialist paediatric surgery centres in the UK. PATIENTS: Children (aged 4–15 years) with a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. INTERVENTIONS: Appendicectomy or a non-operative treatment pathway (comprising broad-spectrum antibiotics and active observation). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was the proportion of eligible patients recruited. Secondary outcomes evaluated adherence to interventions, data collection during follow-up, safety of treatment pathways and clinical course. RESULTS: Fifty per cent of eligible participants (95% CI 40 to 59) approached about the trial agreed to participate and were randomised. Repeated bespoke recruiter training was associated with an increase in recruitment rate over the course of the trial from 38% to 72%. There was high acceptance of randomisation, good patient and surgeon adherence to trial procedures and satisfactory completion of follow-up. Although more participants had perforated appendicitis than had been anticipated, treatment pathways were found to be safe and adverse event profiles acceptable. CONCLUSION: Recruitment to a randomised controlled trial examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a non-operative treatment pathway compared with appendicectomy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children is feasible.

20502,"The Balance between Energy, Environmental Security, and Technical Performance: The Regulatory Challenge of Nanofluids",2021-07-21,"Due to their simplicity of synthesis, stability, and functionalization, low toxicity, and ease of detection, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are a natural choice for biomedical applications. AuNPs’ unique optoelectronic features have subsequently been investigated and used in high-tech applications such as organic photovoltaics, sensory probes, therapeutic agents, the administration of drugs in biological and medical applications, electronic devices, catalysis, etc. Researchers have demonstrated the biosynthesis of AuNPs using plants. The present study evaluates 109 plant species used in the traditional medicine of Middle East countries as new sources of AuNPs in a wide variety of laboratory environments. In this study, dried samples of bark, bulb, flower, fruit, gum, leaf, petiole, rhizome, root, seed, stamen, and above-ground parts were evaluated in water extracts. About 117 plant parts were screened from 109 species in 54 plant families, with 102 extracts demonstrating a bioreduction of Au(3+) to Au(0), revealing 37 new plant species in this regard. The color change of biosynthesized AuNPs to gray, violet, or red was confirmed by UV-Visible spectroscopy, TEM, FSEM, DLS, and EDAX of six plants. In this study, AuNPs of various sizes were measured from 27 to 107 nm. This study also includes an evaluation of the potency of traditional East Asian medicinal plants used in this biosynthesis of AuNPs. An environmentally safe procedure such as this could act as a foundation for cosmetic industries whose quality assessment systems give a high priority to non-chemically synthesized products. It is crucial that future optimizations are adequately documented to scale up the described process.","Hassanisaadi, Mohadeseh; Bonjar, Gholam Hosein Shahidi; Rahdar, Abbas; Pandey, Sadanand; Hosseinipour, Akbar; Abdolshahi, Roohollah",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400837/,63

There is now broad recognition that health informatics tools must account for the diverse needs, characteristics, and abilities of end users, as well as their context of use. The objective of this review is to synthesize the current nature and scope of HF/E integration into the health informatics community. Methods: Because the focus of this synthesis is on understanding the current integration of the HF/E and health informatics research communities, we manually reviewed all manuscripts published in primary HF/E and health informatics journals during 2020. Results: HF/E-focused health informatics studies included in this synthesis focused heavily on EHR customizations, specifically clinical decision support customizations and customized data displays, and on mobile health innovations. While HF/E methods aimed to jointly improve end user safety, performance, and satisfaction, most HF/E-focused health informatics studies measured only end user satisfaction. Conclusion: HF/E-focused health informatics researchers need to identify and communicate methodological standards specific to health informatics, to better synthesize findings across resource intensive HF/E-focused health informatics studies. Important gaps in the HF/E design and evaluation process should be addressed in future work, including support for technology development platforms and training programs so that health informatics designers are as diverse as end users.","Marquard, Jenna",Yearb Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8416208/,63
21004,Clays as Inhibitors of Polyurethane Foams’ Flammability,2021-08-25,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that ranks among the leading causes of disability worldwide. However, many cases of schizophrenia remain untreated due to failure to diagnose, self-denial, and social stigma. With the advent of social media, individuals suffering from schizophrenia share their mental health problems and seek support and treatment options. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used for detecting schizophrenia from social media posts. This study aims to determine whether machine learning could be effectively used to detect signs of schizophrenia in social media users by analyzing their social media texts. To this end, we collected posts from the social media platform Reddit focusing on schizophrenia, along with non-mental health related posts (fitness, jokes, meditation, parenting, relationships, and teaching) for the control group. We extracted linguistic features and content topics from the posts. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts belonging to schizophrenia and interpreted important features to identify linguistic markers of schizophrenia. We applied unsupervised clustering to the features to uncover a coherent semantic representation of words in schizophrenia. We identified significant differences in linguistic features and topics including increased use of third person plural pronouns and negative emotion words and symptom-related topics. We distinguished schizophrenic from control posts with an accuracy of 96%. Finally, we found that coherent semantic groups of words were the key to detecting schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches could help us understand the linguistic characteristics of schizophrenia and identify schizophrenia or otherwise at-risk individuals using social media texts.","Bae, Yi Ji; Shim, Midan; Lee, Won Hee",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8434514/,63

After decades of effort, 17% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure(1). Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold(2), at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.","Tunyasuvunakool, Kathryn; Adler, Jonas; Wu, Zachary; Green, Tim; Zielinski, Michal; Žídek, Augustin; Bridgland, Alex; Cowie, Andrew; Meyer, Clemens; Laydon, Agata; Velankar, Sameer; Kleywegt, Gerard J.; Bateman, Alex; Evans, Richard; Pritzel, Alexander; Figurnov, Michael; Ronneberger, Olaf; Bates, Russ; Kohl, Simon A.

21012,Effect of Phosphine on Coke Formation during Steam Cracking of Propane,2021-09-04,"OBJECTIVES: Parent carers of children with special educational needs or disability are at risk of poorer mental and physical health. In response to these needs, we codeveloped the ‘Healthy Parent Carers’ (HPC) programme. This study examined the views and experiences of participants in the HPC feasibility trial to inform programme refinement. INTERVENTION, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: HPC is a peer-led group-based intervention (supported by online materials) for primary carers of disabled children, encouraging behaviours linked with health and well-being. It was delivered by two lead and six assistant peer facilitators in six community sites (one lead and one assistant per group) in South West England over six or 12 sessions. Control participants had online materials only. The trial involved 47 intervention and 45 control parent carers (97% female and 97% white) and eight facilitators (one male). DESIGN: A preplanned mixed methods process evaluation using questionnaires and checklists (during and after the intervention), qualitative interviews with participants after intervention (n=18) and a focus group with facilitators after trial. RESULTS: HPC was highly acceptable to participants and facilitators and experiences were very positive. Participants reported that the programme increased awareness of what parent carers could and could not change and their self-efficacy to engage in health-promoting behaviours. The intended mechanisms of action (social identification and peer support) matched participants’ expectations and experiences. Control participants found the online-only programme flexible but isolating, as there were no opportunities to share ideas and problem solve with peers, the key function of the programme. Areas for improvement were identified for programme content, facilitator training and delivery. CONCLUSION: HPC was acceptable, well received and offers considerable potential to improve the health of parent carers. Under the pandemic, the challenge going forward is how best to maintain reach and fidelity to function while delivering a more virtual programme.

21644,Delignification Effects on Indonesian Momala (Homalium foetidum) and Korean Red Toon (Toona sinensis) Hardwood Pore Structure and Sound Absorption Capabilities,2021-09-10,"Microalgal biotechnology is gaining importance. However, key issues in the pipeline from species selection towards large biomass production still require improvements to maximize the yield and lower the microalgal production costs. This study explores a co-cultivation strategy to improve the bioactive compounds richness of the harvested microalgal biomass. Based on their biotechnological potential, two diatoms (Skeletonema marinoi, Cyclotella cryptica) and one eustigmatophyte (Nannochloropsis oceanica) were grown alone or in combination. Concentrations of ten vitamins (A, B(1), B(2), B(6), B(12), C, D(2), D(3), E and H), carotenoids and polyphenols, together with total flavonoids, sterols, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, were compared. Moreover, antioxidant capacity and chemopreventive potential in terms inhibiting four human tumor-derived and normal cell lines proliferation were evaluated. Co-cultivation can engender biomass with emergent properties regarding bioactivity or bioactive chemical profile, depending on the combined species. The high vitamin content of C. cryptica or N. oceanica further enhanced (until 10% more) when co-cultivated, explaining the two-fold increase of the antioxidant capacity of the combined C. cryptica and N. oceanica biomass. Differently, the chemopreventive activity was valuably enhanced when coupling the two diatoms C. cryptica and S. marinoi. The results obtained in this pilot study promote microalgal co-cultivation as a valuable strategy aiming to boost their application in eco-sustainable biotechnology.","Pistelli, Luigi; Mondo, Angelo Del; Smerilli, Arianna; Corato, Federico; Piscitelli, Concetta; Pellone, Paola; Carbone, Dora Allegra; Sansone, Clementina; Brunet, Christophe",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468856/,63

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate various cellular processes including macrophage polarization and play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. In present study, we aimed to screen miRNA profiling involved in macrophage polarization and investigate its possible functions and mechanisms. Methods: An OVA-sensitized mouse model was established and 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA) was used to interfere with macrophages. The airway inflammation and remodeling were assessed. The identification and function of M2 alveolar macrophages were assessed by flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, arginase activity and co-culture experiment. Microarray screening was used to select miRNAs which were related to macrophage polarization and RNA interference (RNAi) technique was performed to confirm the function of the selected miRNA and its target gene. Results: Alveolar macrophages of asthmatic mice showed significant M2 polarization. 2-CA alleviated airway inflammation and remodeling as well as M2 polarization. In vitro, IL-4-induced M2 macrophages promoted the proliferation of α-SMA-positive cells. And miRNA profiling showed a remarkable increased expression of miR-378a-3p in IL-4 induced M2 macrophages. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (GRB2) was a target gene of miR-378a-3p. A miR-378a-3p inhibitor and knockdown of GRB2 repolarized alveolar macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that miR-378a-3p/GRB2 pathway regulates the polarization of alveolar macrophages which acts as a potential therapeutic target for airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma.","Wang, Qiujie; Hong, Luna; Chen, Ming; Shi, Jiangting; Lin, Xiaoling; Huang, Linjie; Tang, Tiantian; Guo, Yimin; Yuan, Xiaoqing; Jiang, Shanping",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473897/,63
22031,Welcome to the second year of JVS-Vascular Science!,2021-01-18,"Liver fibrosis is a chronic pathological process that various pathogenic factors lead to abnormal hyperplasia of hepatic connective tissue, and its main feature is the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. However, there are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Phillygenin (PHI), a lignan isolated from Forsythiae Fructus, showed potential anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects but the mechanisms remain unknown. In view of the vital role of gut microbiota in the development of liver fibrosis, this study aimed to explore whether PHI could protect intestinal epithelial barrier and attenuate liver fibrosis by maintaining the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota. Therefore, the liver fibrosis model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of olive oil containing 10% carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) for 4 weeks in C57BL/6J mice. Histological analysis including Hematoxylin-Eosin, Masson, Sirius red, and immunohistochemistry staining were carried out to detect the histopathology and collagen deposition of mice liver tissues. The biochemical indexes related to liver function (ALT, AST, AKP, γ-GT), fibrosis (HYP, HAase, LN, PC III, IV-C) and inflammation (TNF-α, MIP-1, LPS) were determined by specific commercial assay kits. In vivo experimental results showed that PHI could improve liver histopathological injury, abnormal liver function, collagen deposition, inflammation and fibrosis caused by CCl(4). Moreover, PHI restored the intestinal epithelial barrier by promoting the expression of intestinal barrier markers, including ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1. More importantly, the corrective effect of PHI on the imbalance of gut microbiota was confirmed by sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. In particular, PHI treatment enriches the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, which is reported to alleviate inflammation and fibrosis of damaged liver. Collectively, PHI attenuates CCl(4)-induced liver fibrosis partly via modulating inflammation and gut microbiota.","Wang, Cheng; Ma, Cheng; Fu, Ke; Gong, Li-Hong; Zhang, Ya-Fang; Zhou, Hong-Lin; Li, Yun-Xia",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490881/,63

During ICPIC 2015, held in Geneva in June 2015, a full one-day session focused on the 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. This article is a non-exhaustive compilation of these discussions. It concentrates on lessons learned and imagining a way forward for the communities most affected by the epidemic. The reader can access video recordings of all lectures delivered during this one-day session, as referenced. Topics include the timeline of the international response, linkages between the dynamics of the epidemic and infection prevention and control, the importance of community engagement, and updates on virology, diagnosis, treatment and vaccination issues. The paper also includes discussions from public health, infectious diseases, critical care and infection control experts who cared for patients with EVD in Africa, in Europe, and in the United Sates and were involved in Ebola preparedness in both high- and low-resource settings and countries. This review concludes that too little is known about the pathogenesis and treatment of EVD, therefore basic and applied research in this area are urgently required. Furthermore, it is clear that epidemic preparedness needs to improve globally, in particular through the strengthening of health systems at local and national levels. There is a strong need for culturally sensitive approaches to public health which could be designed and delivered by social scientists and medical professionals working together. As of December 2015, this epidemic killed more than 11,000 people and infected more than 28,000; it has also generated more than 17,000 survivors and orphans, many of whom face somatic and psychological complications.

22792,Timely tale of avian flu,2009-12-23,"Transfer of membranes between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the unicellular green alga,Micrasterias americana, is facilitated by 50–70 nm vesicles that form from part-rough. part-smooth transitional regions of the endoplasmic reticulum. In growing cells, the vesicles are present at the normal growth temperature of 23°C. However, at 16°C, vesicle accumulations occur. Golgi apparatus of non-growing cells exhibited both larger numbers of vesicles and larger dictyosomes at all temperatures. In non-growing cells, vesicle numbers also were increased at 16°C. The 16°C block was reconstituted in a cell-free system using Golgi apparatus-and endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions prepared from suspension cultures. When incubated in the presence of ATP and cytosol, transitional endoplasmic reticulum fragments ofMicrasterias responded by formation of membrane blebs and vesicles resembling those seen in situ. When prepared from cells metabolically labeled with [(3)H]leucine, the isolated transition elements supported the transfer of radioactivity of Golgi apparatus preparations immobilized on nitrocellulose strips. The transfer was time-and temperaturedependent and stimulated by ATP. The ATP-dependent component of transfer expressed at 23°C was reduced or absent at temperatures of 16°C or below. This suggested that membrane transfer mediated by transition vesicles was the same rate-limiting step in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus membrane trafficking both in situ and in the cell-free system. Growth, as evidenced by a progressively alteredMicrasterias morphology, was slowed at low temperatures but showed no abrupt temperature transition as seen with the vesicular traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi appatus.","Noguchi, Tetsuko; Morré, D.

22826,Russia's secret weapons,2005-08-03,"A great number of people and non-equalizing medical resources, in developing countries, have become a serious contradiction. Not only does it affects the person’s life, but also causes serious epidemic contagious, because patients can not get help with hospital on time. With the development of wireless communication network, patient may get medical information by wireless network device. It can alleviate contradictions between patients and medical resources. But in developing countries, population quantity is a big data. How to solve data packets in wireless communication network is a big problem when researchers face huge population. In order to solve some problems in big data communication, this paper founds availability data transmission routing algorithm. This algorithm can reduce energy consumption and overhead, then improve deliver ratio in big data communication. Compare with Spray and Wait algorithm, Binary spray and wait algorithm in opportunistic networks, this algorithm acquires good results by reduce energy consumption, overhead and deliver ratio.","Wu, Jia; Chen, Zhigang",Wirel Pers Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088852/,63

The changes of the cases with normal level (≥95%) or abnormal level (<95%) SaO(2) were observed dynamically.Results: In the 3rd-14th day of the therapeutic course, the percentage of patients with normal SaO(2 ) in the ICWM group was higher than that in the WM group (OR = 0. 5178,P = 0.0038), and this tendency was more evident in patients of the severe type (OR = 0.18,P = 0.0001). However, the statistical significance of difference was only shown in patients for whom the ICWM treatment started in the early period after the onset (<-7 days after it, OR = 0.3803,P = 0.006), but not shown in those who received ICWM treatment later in the mid-late period of SARS (P>0.05).Conclusion: ICWM treatment, particularly when it is used for intervention in the early stage, is beneficial for maintaining normal SaO(2) in SARS patients.","Bao-yan, Liu; Jing-qing, Hu; Yan-ming, Xie; Wei-liang, Weng; Rong-bing, Wang; Yan-ping, Zhang; Xiu-hui, Li; Ke, Zhang; Ai-ming, Ren; Jun, Li; Bao-guo, Wang; Xu-dong, Tang; Wei-dong, Wang; Qing, Ni; Jin-ping, Zhang; Hong-jin, Wu; Wei, Zhou; Zhi, Geng; Yang-bo, He; Zhi-wei, Liang; Li-yun, He; Fan-zhu, Gao; Jin, Peng",Chin J Integr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089333/,63
22871,Bird flu spreads to China,2004-01-28,"Supramolecular medicinal chemistry field has been a quite rapidly developing, increasingly active and newly rising interdiscipline which is the new expansion of supramolecular chemistry in pharmaceutical sciences, and is gradually becoming a relatively independent scientific area. Supramolecular drugs could be defined as medicinal supermolecules formed by two or more molecules through non-covalent bonds. So far a lot of supermolecules as chemical drugs have been widely used in clinics. Supermolecules as chemical drugs, i.e. supramolecular chemical drugs or supramolecular drugs, which might have the excellences of lower cost, shorter period, higher potential as clinical drugs for their successful research and development, may possess higher bioavailability, better biocompatibility and drug-targeting, fewer multidrug-resistances, lower toxicity, less adverse effect, and better curative effects as well as safety, and therefore exhibit wide potential application. These overwhelming advantages have drawn enormous special attention. This paper gives the definition of supramolecular drugs, proposes the concept of supramolecular chemical drugs, and systematically reviews the recent advances in the research and development of supermolecules, including organic and inorganic complex ones as chemical drugs in the area of antitumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimalarial, antibacterial, antifungal, antivirus, anti-epileptic, cardiovascular agents and magnetic resonance imaging agents and so on. The perspectives of the foreseeable future and potential application of supramolecules as chemical drugs are also presented.","Zhou, ChengHe; Gan, LinLing; Zhang, YiYi; Zhang, FeiFei; Wang, GuangZhou; Jin, Lei; Geng, RongXia",Sci China B Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089408/,63

It has been established that the S protein in this pathogen plays an important rule in the adsorption and penetration of SARS-CoV into the host cell by interaction with the ACE2 receptor. To determinant which functional motif of the S protein was involved in the interaction with ACE2, seven truncated S proteins deleted from the N or C terminal were obtained by an E.coli expression system and purified by column chromatography to homogeneity. Each truncated S protein was fixed on to the well of an ELISA plate and an interaction was initiated with the ACE2 protein. The adsorption were quantified by ELISA, and the results indicated that amino acids from 388 to 496 of the S protein was responsible for the interaction with the ACE2 receptor, and the interaction could be completely disrupted by an antibody specific to these amino acids. Deletions adjacent to this domain did not appear to have a significant impact on the interaction with ACE2, suggesting that the S protein of SARS-CoV could be developed as a vaccine to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV.","Zhang, Yi; Wang, Wei; Gao, Jin-rong; Ye, Li; Fang, Xiao-nan; Zeng, Ying-chun; Wu, Zheng-hui; She, Ying-long; Ye, Lin-bai",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090955/,63

METHODS: We performed a review of a subset of patients entered into a randomized, controlled, AS trial that began 7.1.2015. Patients with UTI and 3 other ID syndromes were evaluated by ID MDs within 12–24 hours of receiving empirical antimicrobials. The ID MD designated patients as having NI when a patient lacked compatible symptoms, signs, and laboratory evidence to support a diagnosis of UTI. Patients with NI were tracked but not included in the study intervention to identify AS opportunities. RESULTS: Over 21 months 6,402 antimicrobial starts were entered into the AS study; 2,196 (34.3%) were UTI. Of these 564 (25.7%) were designated NI. The initial admission of 104 patients designated NI are the subject of this report. Four had possibly clinically significant UTI and were excluded. Of the remaining 100 the average age was 83.6 years, 80% were female and 50% were admitted with acute or chronic altered mental status (dementia, seizure, or stroke); Sixty-five % of urine cultures were positive. The mean Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score was 0.6; the mean quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (qSOFA) score was 0.9. A mean 3.7 days of antimicrobials were prescribed during the admission; 3.2 additional days at discharge. Of the 100 NI patients followed (up to 21 months following study entry) 34% have died (all-cause), 49% had a subsequent episode of bacteriuria; the mean number of re-admissions per patient was 2.4(range 0–14) and 9% developed C. difficile infection (CDI). CONCLUSION: AS identified a subset of patients treated for UTI but determined by ID MDs as NI, as an elderly, predominantly female cohort, with a high incidence of new or pre-existing neurological conditions, subsequent bacteriuria, re-admission, and short -term mortality. Low SIRS and qSOFA scores in these patients supported a lack of clinically significant infection. AS programs should focus on early efforts to identify ASBU. Preservation of antimicrobial resources, antibiotic cost savings (estimated over 3 years to be $ 450,000), and avoidance of CDI are among the likely benefits.

24023,New Human Astroviruses,2012-09-07,"Microorganisms that affect human health are found in all indoor environments, including cabins of commercial aircraft. Those that arise from human sources can be transmitted by direct contact, droplets, or the airborne route. Infections from human sources include Influenza, Rhinovirus, SARS and tuberculosis. Transmission by the airborne route can be reduced by sterilizing the air with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, or by diluting the contaminated air with outdoor air through ventilation. Microbes arising from environmental sources include bacteria, fungi and other organisms such as protozoa. These usually have very simple requirements for growth – water and a simple substrate such as dust. They cause health effects through direct infection rarely (one example is Legionnella), but more commonly cause immune reactions resulting in hypersensitivity or allergy mediated diseases. Environmental sources of microbial contamination are best prevented, but can be remediated through cleaning, germicidal chemicals, or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. Airborne microbial substances including toxins, antigens and viable organisms can be removed by outdoor air ventilation or filtration. In aircraft cabins transmission of pathogens from human sources is difficult to control, but airborne transmission can be reduced through increased outdoor air ventilation or filtration. Environmental microbial contamination can, and does occur in aircraft cabins. These microbial sources are best prevented but, if detected, can be removed through cleaning or disinfection. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is an under-utilized technology that may be useful for sterilizing air as well as potential environmental sources.","Menzies, Dick",Air Quality in Airplane Cabins and Similar Enclosed Spaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120199/,63
24213,Production of Recombinant Pharmaceutical Proteins,2016-10-23,"The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased dramatically over the past two decades, mostly due to an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients.1–4 Patients who undergo chemotherapy for a variety of diseases, patients with organ transplants, and patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome have contributed most to the increase in fungal infections.5 The actual incidence of invasive fungal infections in transplant patients ranges from 15% to 25% in bone marrow transplant recipients to 5% to 42% in solid organ transplant recipients.6,7 The most frequently encountered are Aspergillus species, followed by Cryptococcus and Candida species. Fungal infections are also associated with a higher mortality than either bacterial or viral infections in these patient populations. This is because of the limited number of available therapies, dose-limiting toxicities of the antifungal drugs, fewer symptoms due to lack of inflammatory response, and the lack of sensitive tests to aid in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.1 A study of patients with fungal infections admitted to a university-affiliated hospital indicated that community-acquired infections are becoming a serious problem; 67% of the 140 patients had community-acquired fungal pneumonia.8","Haque, Abida K.; McGinnis, Michael R.",Dail and Hammar&#x02019;s Pulmonary Pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120463/,63
24489,Nanomicrobiology,2017-03-21,"The term interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises a diverse group of diseases that lead to inflammation and fibrosis of the alveoli, distal airways, and septal interstitium of the lungs. The ILDs consist of disorders of known cause (e.g., collagen vascular diseases, drug-related diseases) as well as disorders of unknown etiology. The latter include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), sarcoidosis and a group of miscellaneous, rare, but nonetheless interesting, diseases. In patients with ILD, MDCT enriches the diagnostic armamentarium by allowing volumetric high resolution scanning, i.e., continuous data acquisition with thin collimation and a high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm. CT is a key method in the identification and management of patients with ILD. It not only improves the detection and characterization of parenchymal abnormalities, but also increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes a reticular pattern (with or without traction bronchiectasis), thickening of interlobular septa, honeycombing, nodules, and ground-glass opacities. In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis. However, due to an overlap of the CT morphology between the various entities, complementary lung biopsy is recommended in virtually all cases of ILDs.","Mueller-Mang, Christina; Plank, Christina; Ringl, Helmut; Dirisamer, Albert; Herold, Christian J.",Multislice CT,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120813/,63

The majority of episodes is due to infections by Shiga toxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC). This chapter reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of STEC-HUS, including bacterial-derived factors and host responses. STEC disease is characterized by hematological (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), renal (acute kidney injury) and extrarenal organ involvement. Clinicians should always strive for an etiological diagnosis through the microbiological or molecular identification of Stx-producing bacteria and Stx or, if negative, serological assays. Treatment of STEC-HUS is supportive; more investigations are needed to evaluate the efficacy of putative preventive and therapeutic measures, such as non-phage-inducing antibiotics, volume expansion and anti-complement agents. The outcome of STEC-HUS is generally favorable, but chronic kidney disease, permanent extrarenal, mainly cerebral complication and death (in less than 5 %) occur and long-term follow-up is recommended. The remainder of this chapter highlights rarer forms of (post-infectious) HUS due to S. dysenteriae, S. pneumoniae, influenza A and HIV and discusses potential interactions between these pathogens and the complement system.","Bitzan, Martin; Lapeyraque, Anne-Laure",Pediatric Kidney Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121170/,63

Such models are sometimes grouped together as “within-host models.” Most recently, new models have been developed that consider host–pathogen interactions at two levels simultaneously: both within-host dynamics and between-host transmissions. Infectious disease models vary widely in their complexity, in their attempts to refer to data from real-life infections and in their focus on problems of an applied or more fundamental nature.

25336,Microfluidic Applications in Biodefense,2008-08-23,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication of mechanical ventilation, resulting in substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. Early upper airway colonization by pathogenic bacteria and microaspiration are the primary pathogenic events leading to VAP. Patients at risk for VAP have defects in structural/mechanical defenses of the respiratory tract. In addition, critical illness, including sepsis, trauma, and postoperative states, is associated with profound defects in both innate and acquired antibacterial immunity, influencing antimicrobial effector functions of both leukocytes and structural/parenchymal cells. Factors present within the lung microenvironment, including alveolar stretch, cyclical atelectasis, changes in oxygen tension, and respiratory tract microbiota, substantially impact antibacterial host responses. Mechanisms accounting for dysregulated immune homeostasis are incompletely understood, but likely involve: (1) alterations in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; (2) changes in pathogen recognition receptor and G-protein coupled receptor expression and downstream signaling cascades; and (3) dysregulated cell death responses. Antibiotics and preventive strategies are the mainstay of therapy in patients with VAP. However, novel approaches are needed to reverse immunological reprogramming that occurs during critical illness and/or mechanical ventilation, and to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from immunomodulatory therapy.","Ballinger, Megan N.; Standiford, Theodore J.",Mucosal Immunology of Acute Bacterial Pneumonia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121904/,63

Most notable among the outbreaks are those caused by NoV and HAV. Lessons learned from outbreak investigations indicate that most outbreaks are preventable. Anthropogenic sources of contamination will continue to invade shellfish growing waters. Shellfish, by their very nature, will continue to bioconcentrate these contaminants, including enteric viruses. There is no quick fix for enteric virus contamination of shellfish; however, vigilance on behalf of the industry, regulatory agencies, and the consumer could substantially reduce the incidence of illness. Enhanced monitoring in all areas of shellfish production, harvesting, distribution, and processing would help to reduce viral illnesses. Pollution abatement and improved hygienic practices on behalf of the industry and consumers are needed. Improved analytical techniques for the detection of enteric viruses in shellfish will lead to enhanced shellfish safety and better protection for the consumer and the industry. Better reporting and epidemiological follow-up of outbreaks are keys to reducing the transmission of foodborne viral infections. It is anticipated that recent advances in analytical techniques, particularly for NoV, will lead to better monitoring capabilities for food and water and a reduction in the incidence of enteric virus illness among shellfish consumers.","Richards, Gary P.",Viruses in Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122155/,63

Analysis of protein–protein interaction (PPI) has contributed numerous insights to the understanding of the regulation of signal pathways.

In addition to conventional PPI methods, such as yeast two-hybrid (YTH), affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is emerging as an important and popular tool to unravel protein complex and elucidate protein function through the interaction partners. With the AP-MS method, protein complexes are prepared first by affinity purification directly from cell lysates, followed by characterization of their components by mass spectrometry. In contrast to most PPI methods, AP-MS reflects PPI under near physiological conditions in the relevant organism and cell type. AP-MS is also able to probe dynamic PPI dependent on protein posttranslational modifications, which is common for signal transduction. AP-MS mapping protein interaction network of various signal pathways has dramatically increased in recent years.

27432,Vaccine against Schistosoma mansoni containing soluble antigen from larvae or adults,2002-11-13,"The genome of bacteriophage Φ6 is composed of three unique segments of double-stranded RNA packaged within a procapsid. One segment can recombine with another in regions that share little sequence similarity. Although the recombination is therefore heterologous, the crossover points usually consist of two to six identical nucleotides. The frequency of recombinants is enhanced by conditions that prevent or hinder the minus strand synthesis of a single plus strand segment. Recombination serves as a repair system as well as a means of changing the genetic structure of the virus. The reaction can be studied in an in-vitro packaging and replication system involving purified procapsids and ssRNA. Although there are striking differences in the mechanisms of recombination in RNA viruses, there are also strong similarities. All seem to use a copy-choice template switching action for recombination. The Φ6 system is a useful model for the recombination of other segmented double-stranded RNA viruses such as the Reoviridae.","Mindich, Leonard",Semin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129777/,63

The key component is self-learning in the sense that the targeted population learns digital operational skills without the need of a teacher. This is achieved through the adaptation of the training material to the trained group. As training groups are diverse, e.g., including both populations in developing and developed countries, and varying in age aspects, gender, languages, literacy levels and technological literacy levels, materials and the speed which training takes place has to be adapted to take into account these differences. The methodology involves use of training videos, and use a dual screen approach where training material is shown on one screen and training takes place on a second screen (computer). The approach has been evaluated in both developing countries and developed countries, with training groups of different capabilities and backgrounds (in Kenya, El Salvador, Spain, France and The Netherlands), with promising results.","Hernández, Susana Muñoz; Earle, Clara Benac; Fredlund, Lars-Åke","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134299/,63

Most biomedical relation extraction systems do not resort to external sources of knowledge, such as domain-specific ontologies. However, using deep learning methods, along with biomedical ontologies, has been recently shown to effectively advance the biomedical relation extraction field. To perform relation extraction, our deep learning system, BiOnt, employs four types of biomedical ontologies, namely, the Gene Ontology, the Human Phenotype Ontology, the Human Disease Ontology, and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, regarding gene-products, phenotypes, diseases, and chemical compounds, respectively. We tested our system with three data sets that represent three different types of relations of biomedical entities. BiOnt achieved, in F-score, an improvement of 4.93% points for drug-drug interactions (DDI corpus), 4.99% points for phenotype-gene relations (PGR corpus), and 2.21% points for chemical-induced disease relations (BC5CDR corpus), relatively to the state-of-the-art.

In fact, even for humans, it requires a subtle analysis and comprehensive knowledge of algorithms to predict time complexity with high fidelity, given any code. As per Turing’s Halting problem proof, estimating code complexity is mathematically impossible. Nevertheless, an approximate solution to such a task can help developers to get real-time feedback for the efficiency of their code. In this work, we model this problem as a machine learning task and check its feasibility with thorough analysis. Due to the lack of any open source dataset for this task, we propose our own annotated dataset, (The complete dataset is available for use at https://github.com/midas-research/corcod-dataset/blob/master/README.md) CoRCoD: Code Runtime Complexity Dataset, extracted from online coding platforms.

A commonly cited example of resurgent or recurrent disease is the yearly appearance of new antigenically different influenza viruses. These new variants are able to evoke disease in their host while causing the centuries-old symptoms of influenza. However, conventional virological techniques have failed to identify the agent, even though evidence suggested non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) is caused by a blood-borne, small enveloped virus, readily transmissible to chimpanzees. Modern molecular biology techniques are used to identify completely new viruses. These viruses can be associated with a new disease or associated with a well-characterized disease present in humans for many years. In identifying an emerging virus, one is often presented with epidemiological data and clinical specimens that have no reactivity with diagnostic reagents available for known pathogens. The primary aim therefore is to identify any new infectious agent and build a body of data to support the existence of a causal link between organism and disease.","Kellam, Paul",HIV and the New Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155652/,63

Approach – The chapter begins with a rhetorical analysis of one particularly influential account of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Therein, we learn that the race to discover the outbreak's aetiology was tainted by scientific malpractice; that an esteemed Chinese microbiologist, Dr. Hong, apparently promoted his own, patently false, aetiological discovery, stifled debate on the matter and, in doing so, held the international response to the outbreak back by a number of weeks. But how was this account rhetorically constructed? And how did it engage with Dr. Hong's own research work? Findings – Does Hong deserve to be remembered as an inept scientist? Subsequent accounts have been quick to repeat this one, founding text's account, suggesting that ‘yes, he does’. This chapter, however, returns to the primary data, examines the ways in which the original account troped those data and moves to suggest that ‘no, he does not’. Contributions to the field – Teasing out the more general implications of this particular case study, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the analytical gains that might accrue if other popular scientific histories of emerging epidemics were approached as ‘topics’ rather than ‘resources’.","Attenborough, Frederick",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161675/,63

30994,Authors' Reply,2006-11-28,"The taxonomic relationship between heterotrophic and parasitic dinoflagellates has not been studied extensively at the molecular level. In order to investigate these taxonomic relationships, we sequenced the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene of Pfiesteria piscicida (Steidinger et Burkholder), a Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate, Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., and Amyloodinium ocellatum (Brown) and submitted those sequences to GenBank. Pfiesteria piscicida and Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp. are heterotrophic dinoflagellates, purportedly pathogenic to fish, and A. ocellatum, a major fish pathogen, has caused extensive economic losses in both the aquarium and aquaculture industries. The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P. piscicda. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full‐length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., P. piscicida, and the Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate are closely related and group into the class Blastodiniphyceae, as does A. ocellatum. None of the species examined were closely related to the apicomplexans or to Perkinsus marinus, the parasite that causes “Dermo disease” in oysters. The overall phylogenetic analyses largely supported the current class and subclass groupings within the dinoflagellates.","Litaker, R.

31057,COPD SIG 2,2009-03-11,"1. Previous studies investigating community‐level relationships between plant functional trait characteristics and stream environmental characteristics remain scarce. Here, we used community‐weighted means to identify how plant traits link to lowland stream typology and how agricultural intensity in the catchment affects trait composition. 2. We analysed plant trait characteristics in 772 European lowland streams to test the following two hypotheses: (i) trait characteristics differ between plant communities in small and medium‐sized streams, reflecting adaptations to different habitat characteristics, and (ii) trait characteristics vary with the intensity of agricultural land use in the stream catchment, mediated either directly by an increase in productive species or indirectly by an increase in species that efficiently intercept and utilize light. 3. We found that the communities in small streams were characterized by a higher abundance of light‐demanding species growing from single apical meristems, reproducing by seeds and rooted to the bottom with floating and/or heterophyllous leaves, whereas the community in medium‐sized streams was characterized by a higher abundance of productive species growing from multi‐apical and basal growth meristems forming large canopies. 4. We also found indications that community trait characteristics were affected by eutrophication. We did not find enhanced abundance of productive species with an increasing proportion of agriculture in the catchments. Instead, we found an increase in the abundance of species growing from apical and multi‐apical growth meristems as well as in the abundance of species tolerant of low light availability. The increase in the abundance of species possessing these traits likely reflects different strategies to obtain greater efficiency in light interception and utilization in nutrient‐enriched environments. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings challenge the general assumption of the EU Water Framework Directive compliant assessment systems that plant community patterns in streams reflect the nutrient preference of the community. Instead, light availability and the ability to improve interception and utilization appeared to be of key importance for community composition in agricultural lowland streams. We therefore suggest moving from existing approaches building on species‐specific preference values for nutrients to determine the level of nutrient impairment to trait‐based approaches that provide insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the changes. We recommend that existing systems are critically appraised in the context of the findings of this study.","Baattrup‐Pedersen, Annette; Göthe, Emma; Larsen, Søren E.; O'Hare, Matthew; Birk, Sebastian; Riis, Tenna; Friberg, Nikolai",J Appl Ecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166906/,63

31623,Biologische Bedrohung,2015-08-17,"This chapter discusses ear, nose, throat, and eye infections. Many different bacterial species normally colonize the mouth. Host defense mechanisms, including those associated with the ciliated epithelium in the nose and sinuses, lysozyme in saliva, and IgA and other immunoglobulins in mucous secretions or serum, may help reduce the incidence of infections because of respiratory pathogens. The normal mouth flora probably contributes to the prevention of attachment of exogenous pathogens to the mucosa. Nevertheless, certain respiratory pathogens are sometimes carried asymptomatically in the mouth or nose of healthy individuals. Upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in infants and young school children. An average preschool child is said to have about six upper respiratory tract infections a year. Most of the infections are of viral etiology and occur in winter. Bacterial infections are also very common in young children. The eustachian tubes in infants are relatively wider and more horizontal than in adults; this might partly explain the greater incidence of acute otitis media in infants as the causative organisms may spread directly from the throat to the middle ear via the eustachian tube. Older children and adults usually have good immunity to a wide range of respiratory pathogens, but the common cold continues to be prevalent in these age groups. Sinusitis frequently occurs in adults and children.","Shanson, D.C.",Microbiology in Clinical Practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173452/,63

However, few centers have started using these approaches with standard equipment because of the limited resources. We sought to report intra- and postoperative clinical outcomes and address health resource utilization after MIAVR. RESULTS: A total of 102 eligible patients who had aortic valve replacement were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter cohort study conducted from June 2015 to December 2017. Fifty patients underwent aortic valve surgery via upper inverted T-shaped hemi-sternotomy (MS), and 52 patients were operated using full sternotomy (FS) in two centers in a developing country. Central cannulation was performed in all cases. Major adverse cardiac events, pain, and wound complications were compared. A cost analysis was performed, and exposure and feasibility for cannulation were assessed. The mean length of MS skin incision was 5.82 ± 0.67 cm. Cumulative cross-clamp time was insignificant between both groups (91.87 ± 34.41 versus 94.91 ± 33.96 min; p = 0.66). MS exhibited shorter ventilation time (6.18 ± 1.86 versus 10.68 ± 12.78 h; p = 0.029) and intensive care stays (33.27 ± 19.75 versus 49.42 ± 47.1 h; p = 0.037). Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were compared, and MS group exhibited fewer transfusions (1.18 ± 0.89 versus 1.7 ± 0.97 units; p = 0.002), fewer pulmonary complications (1 (2%) versus 2 (3.8%); p < 0.001), and less sternotomy wound infection (1 (2%) versus 5 (9.6%); p = 0.048). Total operative mortality of 4.46% was recorded (n = 5). Significant cost reduction was recorded favoring MS; central cannulation saved $907.16 and carried a total cost reduction of $580 (9.3%) when compared with the FS approach (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: With a lack of logistics in developing countries, MIAVR not only has a cosmetic advantage but carries a significant reduction in blood use, respiratory complications, pain, and cost. MIAVR can be feasible, with a rapid learning curve in developing centers.","Sanad, Mohammed; Beshir, Hatem",Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222165/,63

The decision to pivot to remote learning was made swiftly, particularly by those institutions operating a shared leadership model, benefitting from a greater degree of agility, innovation, and collaboration. The current article highlights three of the leadership best practices for navigating unpredictable adaptive challenges such as that posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Firstly, by utilizing a type of servant leadership, that emphasizes empowerment, involvement, and collaboration, academic leaders with emotional intelligence and emotional stability should place the interests of others above their own. Secondly, academic leaders should distribute leadership responsibilities to a network of teams throughout the organization to improve the quality of the decisions made in crisis resolution and thirdly, leaders should communicate clearly and frequently to all stakeholders through a variety of communication channels. Looking forward, the rise of the flexible “allostatic leader” with the adaptive capacity to learn and evolve in crisis, to emerge better able to address future crises, is described.","Fernandez, Antonio Arturo; Shaw, Graham Paul",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7228314/,63
33381,In Case You Haven't Heard…,2020-04-17,"Recent attempts at Super-Resolution for medical images used deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve perceptually realistic single image Super-Resolution. Yet, they are constrained by their inability to generalise to different scale factors. This involves high storage and energy costs as every integer scale factor involves a separate neural network. A recent paper has proposed a novel meta-learning technique that uses a Weight Prediction Network to enable Super-Resolution on arbitrary scale factors using only a single neural network. In this paper, we propose a new network that combines that technique with SRGAN, a state-of-the-art GAN-based architecture, to achieve arbitrary scale, high fidelity Super-Resolution for medical images. By using this network to perform arbitrary scale magnifications on images from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) dataset, we demonstrate that it is able to outperform traditional interpolation methods by up to 20[Formula: see text] on SSIM scores whilst retaining generalisability on brain MRI images. We show that performance across scales is not compromised, and that it is able to achieve competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods such as EDSR whilst being fifty times smaller than them. Combining efficiency, performance, and generalisability, this can hopefully become a new foundation for tackling Super-Resolution on medical images.","Tan, Chuan; Zhu, Jin; Lio’, Pietro",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256400/,63

However, the individual responsiveness of intracranial pressure (ICP) to PEEP varies. Thus, identifying an indicator detecting ICP responsiveness to PEEP is of great significance. As central venous pressure (CVP) could act as an intermediary to transduce pressure from PEEP to ICP, we developed a new indicator, P(IC)Gap, representing the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between P(IC)Gap and ICP responsiveness to PEEP. METHODS: A total of 112 patients with sTBI undergoing MV were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. ICP, CVP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), static compliance of the respiratory system (Cst), and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PetCO(2)) were recorded at the initial (3 cmH(2)O) and adjusted (15 cmH(2)O) levels of PEEP. P(IC)Gap was assessed as baseline ICP - baseline CVP (when PEEP = 3 cmH(2)O). The patients were classified into the ICP responder and non-responder groups based on whether ICP increment with PEEP adjusted from 3 cmH(2)O to 15 cmH(2)O was greater than 20% of baseline ICP. The above parameters were compared between the two groups, and prediction of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the non-responder group, the responder group had lower P(IC)Gap (1.63 ± 1.33 versus 6.56 ± 2.46 mmHg; p < 0.001), lower baseline ICP, and higher baseline CVP. ROC curve analysis suggested that P(IC)Gap was a stronger predictive indicator of ICP responsiveness to PEEP (AUC = 0.957, 95%CI 0.918–0.996; p < 0.001) compared with baseline ICP and baseline CVP, with favorable sensitivity (95.24, 95%CI 86.91–98.70%) and specificity (87.6, 95%CI 75.76–94.27%), at a cut off value of 2.5 mmHg. CONCLUSION: The impact of PEEP on ICP depends on the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP, i.e. P(IC)Gap. In addition, P(IC)Gap is a potential predictor of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment in patients with sTBI.","Li, Hong Peng; Lin, Ying Ni; Cheng, Zhi Hui; Qu, Wei; Zhang, Liu; Li, Qing Yun",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7276961/,63

39122,Times are changing and so is Surgery,2020-09-14,"Computers store numbers in two mutually incompatible ways: little-endian or big-endian. They differ in the order of bytes within representation of numbers. This ordering is called endianness. When two computer systems, programs or devices communicate, they must agree on which endianness to use, in order to avoid misinterpretation of numeric data values. We present Endicheck, a dynamic analysis tool for detecting endianness bugs, which is based on the popular Valgrind framework. It helps developers to find those code locations in their program where they forgot to swap bytes properly. Endicheck requires less source code annotations than existing tools, such as Sparse used by Linux kernel developers, and it can also detect potential bugs that would only manifest if the given program was run on computer with an opposite endianness. Our approach has been evaluated and validated on the Radeon SI Linux OpenGL driver, which is known to contain endianness-related bugs, and on several open-source programs. Results of experiments show that Endicheck can successfully identify many endianness-related bugs and provide useful diagnostic messages together with the source code locations of respective bugs.","Kápl, Roman; Parízek, Pavel",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480700/,63

Business should respond to the changing preferences of customers, employees and societies by identifying value propositions that justify the provision of risk capital by institutional investors. Critical to this is the determination and implementation of corporate purposes by owners and board directors that focus on inter-generational horizons. Family owners are particularly well placed to do this, but institutional investors need to make it part of their stewardship function as well. Measurement is key and significant reforms are required in the areas of accounting, valuation and reporting. Consistent with these observations, companies that had strong environmental, social and governance records performed better during the initial stages of the crisis, as did family owned firms and those that avoided high levels of leverage prior to the crisis.","Johnstone-Louis, Mary; Kustin, Bridget; Mayer, Colin; Stroehle, Judith; Wang, Boya",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499764/,63
39810,"When mycologists describe new species, not all relevant information is provided (clearly enough)",2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous hypertonic saline is utilized commonly in critical care for treatment of acute or refractory elevations of intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Though there is a clear understanding of the general physiological effects of a hypertonic saline solution over long periods of time, smaller epoch effects of hypertonic saline (HTS) have not been thoroughly analyzed. The aim of this study was to perform a direct evaluation of the high-frequency response of HTS on the cerebrovascular physiological responses in TBI. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively maintained adult TBI database for those with archived high-frequency cerebral physiology and available HTS treatment information. We evaluated different epochs of physiology around HTS bolus dosing, comparing pre- with post-HTS. We assessed for changes in slow fluctuations in ICP, pulse amplitude of ICP (AMP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebrovascular reactivity (as measured through pressure reactivity index (PRx)), and cerebral compensatory reserve (correlation (R) between AMP (A) and ICP (P)). Comparisons of mean measures and percentage time above clinically relevant thresholds for the physiological parameters were compared pre- and post-HTS using descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U testing. We assessed for subgroups of physiological responses using latent profile analysis (LPA). RESULTS: Fifteen patients underwent 69 distinct bolus infusions of hypertonic saline. Apart from the well-documented decrease in ICP, there was also a reduction in AMP. The analysis of cerebrovascular reactivity response to HTS solution had two main effects. For patients with grossly impaired cerebrovascular reactivity pre-HTS (PRx > + 0.30), HTS bolus led to improved reactivity. However, for those with intact cerebrovascular reactivity pre-HTS (PRx < 0), HTS bolus demonstrated a trend towards more impaired reactivity. This indicates that HTS has different impacts, dependent on pre-bolus cerebrovascular status. There was no significant change in metrics of cerebral compensatory reserve. LPA failed to demonstrate any subgroups of physiological responses to HTS administration. CONCLUSIONS: The direct decrease in ICP and AMP confirms that a bolus dose of a HTS solution is an effective therapeutic agent for intracranial hypertension. However, in patients with intact autoregulation, hypertonic saline may impair cerebral hemodynamics. These findings regarding cerebrovascular reactivity remain preliminary and require further investigation.

39879,Schüler leiten eine Station,2020-10-05,"The modern slavery literature engages with history in an extremely limited fashion. Our paper demonstrates to the utility of historical research to modern slavery researchers by explaining the rise and fall of the ethics-driven market category of “free-grown sugar” in nineteenth-century Britain. In the first decades of the century, the market category of “free-grown sugar” enabled consumers who were opposed to slavery to pay a premium for a more ethical product. After circa 1840, this market category disappeared, even though considerable quantities of slave-grown sugar continued to arrive into the UK. We explain the disappearance of the market category. Our paper contributes to the on-going debates about slavery in management by historicizing and thus problematizing the concept of “slavery”. The paper challenges those modern slavery scholars who argue that lack of consumer knowledge about product provenance is the main barrier to the elimination of slavery from today’s international supply chains. The historical research presented in this paper suggests that consumer indifference, rather than simply ignorance, may be the more fundamental problem. The paper challenges the optimistic historical metanarrative that pervades much of the research on ethical consumption. It highlights the fragility of ethics-driven market categories, offering lessons for researchers and practitioners seeking to tackle modern slavery.","Smith, Andrew; Johns, Jennifer",J Bus Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7510010/,63
40670,Evaluation and Characterization of a Durable Composite Phase Thermal Barrier Coating in Solid Particle Erosion and Burner Rig Tests,2020-10-09,"It is a study of Financial Impact Analysis, where the financial consequences arising from the possibility of inclusion of the dentist in the Intensive Care Units (ICU), within the reality of the Unified Health System (SUS), were evaluated in Brazil. It was based on a quick review of the literature and economic evaluation with reference to the year 2018. Information on costs and hospitalizations were collected from the official databases of the Ministry of Health, the Federal Council of Medicine and the Union of Dentists of the State of São Paulo. Only the direct medical costs related to the hospitalizations were calculated. Scenarios were simulated for a time horizon of 1 year (2018) and a sensitivity analysis was made for a more optimistic scenario (values 20% lower) and another less optimistic (values 20% higher). On average, the presence of a dentist in the ICU reduces the development of pneumonia cases by 56% and 8.18 days, which represents a savings of 34.92% in hospitalization costs in the evaluated scenario. In Brazil, when hiring dentists in all ICUs, each avoided case would contribute to savings of R$ 7,949.45 (1US$ = R$ 4,02 in 30/10/2019), ranging from R$ 6,359.56 to R$ 9,539.35 in the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, respectively, where each case avoided is higher than the dentist's monthly salary. It would be necessary to spend R$ 142,060,140.00 on hiring the dentist to cover the ICUs, making the final savings more than 865 million reais. It is concluded that the inclusion of the Dental Surgeon (DS) in ICU teams would have a positive economic impact, with savings in hospitalization costs from the perspective of SUS. The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, depending on the State's action in containment strategies, could require 2.17 times more in the bests of scenarios where the action of total suppression would be used. Such a situation requires emergency measures, and the role of the dentist is a strategy that can support the health system. KEY MESSAGES: Dental care in the ICU is an important and cost-effectiveness strategy for the control of microorganisms that act in the evolution of the pneumonia nosocomial. Such a situation requires emergency measures, and the role of the dentist is a strategy that can support the health system.","Simoes, A; Greche, N; Merchan, L; Raimundo, A; Cezario, L; Cavalcante, D; Meneghin, M; Pereira, A",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543476/,63

When the pandemic reached Germany in March, we halted data collection on a project assessing ageism in children ages 4 to 8. In July, the situation had improved and testing resumed following hygiene protocols. We report findings from a simulated-behavioral measure where 45 children were asked to plan a party. One task involved asking the children to place pictures of ten party guests, plus themselves, around two party tables. We then assessed how many seats away the younger and older adult guests were placed, on average, from the child (i.e., social distance). Although, we anticipated that the pandemic might lead children to further distance themselves from older adults, our results, thus far, indicate similarity between pre- and post-pandemic preferences. At both occasions older adult guests were seated, on average, one seat further away from the child then younger adult guests. The guest chosen to sit closest to the child was younger on 88% of occasions, whereas the guest chosen to sit farthest away from the child was older on 64% of occasions. Preference for younger adults was confirmed in a second task where children selected teammates for a game. On average, children’s teams consisted of 70% younger guests versus 30% older guests. Findings indicate a social preference for younger, versus older, adults in children irrespective of the pandemic.","Lapp, Juliana; Bauer, Jenny; Scholz, Lea; Steltmann, Sonja; Lange, Marit; Schenker, Lena-Emilia; Bellingtier, Jennifer",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742047/,63

They cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hemorrhagic cardiopulmonary syndrome. Recently, hantaviruses have been detected in other small mammals such as Soricomorpha (shrews, moles) and Chiroptera (bats), suggested as reservoirs for potential pandemic viruses and to play a role in the evolution of hantaviruses. It is important to study the global virome in different reservoirs, therefore our aim was to investigate whether shrews in Sweden carried any hantaviruses. Moreover, to accurately determine the host species, we developed a molecular method for identification of shrews. METHOD: Shrews (n = 198), caught during 1998 in Sweden, were screened with a pan-hantavirus PCR using primers from a conserved region of the large genome segment. In addition to morphological typing of shrews, we developed a molecular based typing method using sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome B (CytB) genes. PCR amplified hantavirus and shrew fragments were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. RESULTS: Hantavirus RNA was detected in three shrews. Sequencing identified the virus as Seewis hantavirus (SWSV), most closely related to previous isolates from Finland and Russia. All three SWSV sequences were retrieved from common shrews (Sorex araneus) sampled in Västerbotten County, Sweden. The genetic assay for shrew identification was able to identify native Swedish shrew species, and the genetic typing of the Swedish common shrews revealed that they were most similar to common shrews from Russia. CONCLUSION: We detected SWSV RNA in Swedish common shrew samples and developed a genetic assay for shrew identification based on the COI and CytB genes. This was the first report of presence of hantavirus in Swedish shrews.","Lwande, Olivia Wesula; Mohamed, Nahla; Bucht, Göran; Ahlm, Clas; Olsson, Gert; Evander, Magnus",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7770741/,63
44685,Becoming Visible: Why We Should be Better Communicators Now,2021-01-19,"Nowadays, due to the continuous developments in economies, various dilemmas are emerging, including energy demand, waste management, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHE). A promising approach to address these issues is a transition toward a circular economy (CE), and one of its successful approaches is the waste-to-energy (WTE). By exploiting WTE, there will be less demand for raw materials and resources. In this study, two developed countries, including France and Singapore, are evaluated based on their CE transition using the WTE method. Both countries are developing rapidly in terms of a successful CE. Reducing landfills as the major problem in Singapore is one of the most vital plans in their CE project. The planned target in Singapore is reducing landfill by 30% by 2030. Furthermore, Singapore aims for reaching a 70% recycling rate by 2050. On the other hand, the CE in France includes more comprehensive laws in four different sectors, such as production, consumption, waste management, and mobilizing actors. It is planned that by 2025, the recycling rate in France will reach 100%. A roadmap toward building a CE cannot be succeeded unless some practical strategies are developed for overcoming the encountered obstacles. The roadmap of both countries shows a specific milestone to reach a better CE, cleaner environment, and less use of natural resources. Most of the Singapore sustainable plans are planned to be caught by 2030, while France is trying to complete them by 2025. It should be noted that due to the current pandemic situation caused by COVID-19, there are some issues in implementing the obligations and plans thoroughly.","Rezvani Ghomi, Erfan; Khosravi, Fatemeh; Tahavori, Mohammad Amin; Ramakrishna, Seeram",Mater Circ Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799405/,63

To help readers visualize a circular economy of the future, it provides a scenario of a circular economy in a community where both biological and technical cycles are closed; renewable energy drives transportation, production, and consumption. The community take care of the health of themselves and their environment and practice 6 Rs (re-use, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, recycle and recover) along the life cycle of a product at personal and professional levels. Circular supply chain is mapped. The chapter further summarizes circular economy transition enabling factors such as life cycle thinking, materials passports, and ubiquitous digitization to become integral of industries and services. In addition, it addresses the challenges ahead and concludes on the importance of education for providing circular economy workforce.","Liu, Lerwen; Ramakrishna, Seeram",An Introduction to Circular Economy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988266/,63

Not all visualization methods are equal however, the methods utilized by educators can covertly and significantly impact student learning and stratify the class based on learner abilities that are not directly related to anatomical comprehension. Often, the proposed mechanism for good, bad, or ugly visualizations is on aesthetics, rather than the cognitive load imparted on the learner. The appropriate use of multimedia principles that include using pictures, images, and visualizations in general will positively influence student attention and learning. This chapter outlines components of multimedia learning as it pertains to the use of visualizations in lectures and in online scenarios. Illustrations and research demonstrating how cognitive load can be manipulated to a pedagogic advantage are presented. Approaches and suggestions on how educators might modify their current materials and practice using visualizations are proposed that will positively affect learning through cognitive load reduction.","Wilson, Timothy D.",Teaching Anatomy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991349/,63
51053,Biophysical Reviews: slowly getting back to ‘normal’?,2021-03-31,"INTRODUCTION: The risk of severe morbidity after COVID-19 infection is high in older adults (Lithander et al, 2020). Subsequent responsive UK Government guidance for older adults included self-isolation during the pandemic. It is therefore hypothesised that during the pandemic older adults are inadvertently deconditioned due to iatrogenic factors such as inactivity, social isolation, hospital-avoidance and malnutrition, and present with reduced resilience to illness and lower levels of function. The OPU continued to admit COVID-negative, or recently termed “COVID-protected”, patients throughout the pandemic. Data captured prior to, and during the COVID-19 pandemic has been compared to explore the implications on older adults, and elicit whether they are protected from the consequences of the pandemic? METHOD: Demographic and physical function data (average 6 m gait-speed, Elderly Mobility Scale) were captured pre- and through-pandemic for all patients admitted to a COVID-negative OPU ward over a one month period. Ethical review was provided through local Trust governance process. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic 2019 (n = 67, mean(±SD) age 82.7(±8.2) years, 61%, hospital length-of-stay (LOS) 7.9(±7.3) days, hospital mortality-rate 7.2%) and through-pandemic 2020 (n = 73, 83.1(±8.3) years, 59%♀, LOS 9.0(±9.1) days, hospital mortality-rate 7.5%) data were captured during July 2019 and May 2020 respectively. There were no between-group differences in age [t(−.313) = 138, p = 0.755], gender [X(2), 1 df, p = 0.782], LOS [t(0.78) = 134, p = 0.44], or hospital mortality-rate [X(2) 1 df, p = 0.96]. Through-pandemic patients had a significantly slower 6 m gait-speed (0.11(±0.05) m.s-1) than pre-pandemic (0.16(±0.24) m.s-1); [t(2.74) = 93, p = 0.007] and lower median (IQR) Elderly Mobility Scale (4(6 IQR) vs 9 (12 IQR) [u = 866, p = 0.015]). CONCLUSION: Our data indicates this relatively short period of self-isolation might have significant implications on the physical function of older adults. The likely mechanism is iatrogenic deconditioning. Critical Public Health and policy responses are required to mitigate these unforeseen risks by deploying prehabilitative counter-measures and accurately targeted hospital and community rehabilitation.","Ritchie, S; Snape, C; Triteos, N; Vamadevan, R; Olesk, L; Wood, C A; Jones, G D; Jones, J",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989662/,63

Drawing a comparison between the reactions of Neo-Pentecostal churches and Afro-Brazilian religions, we will describe how the pandemic outbreak and the social distancing measures allowed Afro-religious practitioners to occupy new online spaces. In doing so, these religions found new modalities of practising rituals and transmitting sacred knowledge in the digital world. Despite the fundamental importance of bodily engagement in these religious expressions, Candomblé and Umbanda practitioners are increasing their presence online through producing different types of pedagogical, educational and ritual contents. While on the one hand, this new content aims at promoting social distancing and sanitary precautionary measures, on the other hand, it involves a restructuring of the dynamics of legitimation and power that are present in Afro-religious social structures. We will analyze these changing dynamics as consequences of the “crisis of the body” that resulted from the lockdown measures.","Capponi, Giovanna; Carneiro Araújo, Patrício",Int J Lat Am Relig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7524026/,63
52525,"The 90th Anniversary of the Borissiak Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences: from the “Golden Age” of Paleontology to New Perspectives",2021-05-06,"Introduction: Several studies have linked obesity to more severe illness and higher mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, the relationship between being underweight and COVID-19 mortality remains inconclusive. Previous dose-response meta-analyses did not enroll or specifically analyze the underweight population. Herein, we conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in both obese and underweight patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until August 12, 2020 using the keywords “COVID-19,” “body mass index,” “obesity,” “overweight”, and “underweight.” Three reviewers independently assessed the relevant articles, including the title, abstract, and full text, to identify eligible studies. We performed a two-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis, including only studies with at least three quantitative classifications for BMI. The nonlinear trend was evaluated using a restricted cubic splines model with three-knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by pooling only those studies which specifically evaluated underweight patients (BMI<18.5 kg/m(2)). Results: Thirteen studies comprising 25,828 patients were included in the analysis. In the linear model, the mortality of patients with COVID-19 increased by 1.5% for each 1-kg/m(2) increase in BMI (pooled relative risk [RR] =1.015, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.004−1.027). However, a significant non-linear relationship between BMI and mortality was observed (Wald test: P(non-linearity)<0.001). We demonstrated a J-shaped curve, indicating that both underweight and obese patients had a higher mortality than those with normal weight. Interestingly, overweight patients (BMI, 25−30 kg/m(2)) seemed to have the lowest mortality risk. Using a BMI of 15 kg/m(2) as the reference, the RRs of mortality decreased with BMI, and this trend continued until BMI of approximately 28 kg/m(2) (RR=0.743, 95% CI=0.576−0.959). The relationship between BMI and mortality was then reversed, and an upward trend was observed when BMI exceeded 30 kg/m(2); the RRs (95% CI) at BMIs 30, 35, 40, and 45 kg/m(2) were 0.745 (0.570−0.974), 0.841 (0.643−1.100), 1.082 (0.850−1.377), and 1.457 (1.129−1.879), respectively. Conclusion: This study is the first dose-response meta-analysis that showed both underweight and obese COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of increased mortality. A J-curve relationship was demonstrated between BMI and COVID-19 mortality.","Bukhari, Khulood; Huang, Huei-Kai; Hung, Duan-Pei; Peng, Carol Chiung-Hui; Shih, Ming-Chieh; Chang, Rachel Huai-En; Tu, Yu-Kang; Munir, Kashif M",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089811/,63

To provide a comprehensive workflow to identify top influential health misinformation about Zika on Twitter in 2016, reconstruct information dissemination networks of retweeting, contrast mis- from real information on various metrics, and investigate how Zika misinformation proliferated on social media during the Zika epidemic. METHODS. We systematically reviewed the top 5000 English-language Zika tweets, established an evidence-based definition of “misinformation,” identified misinformation tweets, and matched a comparable group of real-information tweets. We developed an algorithm to reconstruct retweeting networks for 266 misinformation and 458 comparable real-information tweets. We computed and compared 9 network metrics characterizing network structure across various levels between the 2 groups. RESULTS. There were statistically significant differences in all 9 network metrics between real and misinformation groups. Misinformation network structures were generally more sophisticated than those in the real-information group. There was substantial within-group variability, too. CONCLUSIONS. Dissemination networks of Zika misinformation differed substantially from real information on Twitter, indicating that misinformation utilized distinct dissemination mechanisms from real information. Our study will lead to a more holistic understanding of health misinformation challenges on social media.","Safarnejad, Lida; Xu, Qian; Ge, Yaorong; Krishnan, Siddharth; Bagarvathi, Arunkumar; Chen, Shi",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8110855/,63

In eukaryotes, this code is mediated by hundreds of membrane readers that recognize unique phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), which demark organelles to initiate localized trafficking and signaling events. The only superfamily which specifically detects all seven PIPs are the Phox homology (PX) domains. Here, we reveal that throughout evolution, these readers are universally regulated by the phosphorylation of their PIP binding surfaces based on our analysis of existing and modelled protein structures and phosphoproteomic databases. These PIP-stops control the selective targeting of proteins to organelles and are shown to be key determinants of high-fidelity PIP recognition.

54381,Se protéger pour mieux soigner,2021-06-14,"OBJECTIVE: Lung CT scans are early diagnostic tests in evaluation of COVID-19 patients. Data are usually analyzed visually and the extent of infiltrations can only roughly be estimated. The aim of the present study was to create a software to spatially visualize and quantify infiltrated and collapsed areas in lung CT scans and set these volumes into relation with non-affected lung areas. METHODS: A new software ""Lung CT Analyzer"" (LCTA, 1) was created from scratch in an international team-effort within the 3D medical imaging software 3D Slicer (2). LCTA consists of two components: ""Lung CT Segmenter"" implements an intuitive and semiautomatic workflow for the generation of lung masks. LCTA then uses masked thresholds of Hounsfield units to detect non-affected versus affected (emphysematous, infiltrated, and collapsed) areas of the lung. Intrapulmonary vessels are subtracted from the other volumes. Segment volumes are expressed in milliliters and displayed in 3D. COVID-Q was defined as affected divided by non-affected volume and can be calculated separately for both lungs. 3D Slicer and LCTA are open source, freely available and maintained on Github. RESULTS: CT data of twelve patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (9 m, 3 f) were selected for the present retrospective study. All scans were performed shortly after admission. Thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) for areas of interest were defined prior to the study and processing was identical for all patients. The median time effort for 3D reconstruction was 8 minutes per patient. For more detailed results please see the enclosed table. A 3D Slicer demo data set (Control) has been included for comparison. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic promoted fast-paced innovations such as LCTA in our hospital. LCTA was feasible, reproducible and easy to perform. COVID-Q correlated with COVID-19 lung involvement in all cases. All fatal cases showed COVID-Q values of > 2.0. LCTA enabled the serial 3D reconstruction of infiltrated and collapsed lung areas in lung CT scans. The procedure may be of great help in the future analysis of pulmonary infiltrates of any cause. In COVID-19 disease, volumetric lung CT reconstruction could result in the definition of new prognostic factors, identify patients “at-risk” in the ICU, and be useful for follow-up.

The objective of this study is to investigate empirically the relationship between gold prices and implied volatility in the futures markets of gold, re-examine the leverage hypothesis and attempt to make inferences about gold’s safe haven properties. In doing so, it utilizes the recently developed econometric tool of non-parametric quantile regressions. This is the first work to apply the flexible non-parametric quantile regressions on the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of gold. The data used are daily returns of options of gold shares and implied volatility changes from June of 2008 to December of 2018. The empirical findings indicate that, for the total sample period as well as for almost all of the five sub-periods examined, changes in the implied volatility of gold are insensitive, and not statistically significant, to changes in the price returns of gold. The leverage hypothesis holds for a wide range in the third sub-period. Accordingly, investors in other ETFs (currency or oil) may choose to use gold as shelter during (extreme) economic downturns.

Understanding and responding to the unmet and complex needs of Alzheimer's patients can affect the quality of care. Therefore, the present study aimed to explain the perception of formal and informal caregivers of the unmet needs of Iranian Alzheimer's patients. Methods: The present qualitative study employed a Directed Content Analysis approach and was conducted in Iran in 2020. This research was done through in-depth and semi-structured interviews with 19 qualified caregivers enrolled (11 informal caregivers and 8 formal caregivers) with the mean age of 46.05 ± 10.98 years in a purposive sampling method. Interviews continued until data saturation. Data analysis was performed simultaneously with data collection. After recording and transcribing, the data were analyzed using the Elo and Kyngas method based on the National Consensus Project framework (NCP). Data management was done with MAXQDA software. In order to achieve the accuracy and validity of the study, the criteria presented by Lincoln and Guba Credibility, Dependability, Confirmability, and Transformability were considered and used. Results: The mean age of participants was 46.05 ± 10.98. Participants in this study acknowledged that Alzheimer's patients need comprehensive needs management with a holistic approach to increase quality of life. This theme based on the NCP framework consists of seven main categories including “Structure and processes of care,” “Physical aspects of care,” “Psychological and psychiatric aspects of care,” “Social aspects of care,” “Cultural aspects of care,” “Care of the patient nearing the end of life,” and “Ethical and legal aspects of care” with 16 subcategories. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide a deep understanding of the unmet needs of Alzheimer's patients in Iran.

In addition to significant contribution to neonatal mortality, impact of prematurity among survivors may continue through life impairing long-term physical life through neuro-disability and increased risk of cerebral palsy. Maternal administration of magnesium sulfate prior to impending preterm birth is an effective strategy to reduce neuromorbidity. AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of antenatal magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection in preterm infants between 26 and 34 weeks in preventing early neonatal morbidity and mortality. Secondary objective was to assess any adverse events with the use of magnesium sulfate on the mother and neonate. METHOD: This was a prospective observational comparative study for 2 years at our tertiary care hospital of 100 pregnant women who gave preterm births. Fifty infants each were born to mothers who were either not given MgSO(4) (Group 1) or given 4gm intravenous loading dose MgSO(4) (Group 2), preferably 4 h prior to preterm birth. RESULTS: Among all the preterm in our study, 81% delivered between 30 and 34 weeks. There was no significant difference in terms of maternal mortality or serious morbidity including postpartum hemorrhage, caesarian section rates or length of hospital stay among women receiving MgSO(4) versus no MgSO(4). Mild maternal side effects secondary to magnesium sulfate were experienced in 8% cases. There were no significant differences between both groups for low 5 min APGAR, need for NICU admission, neonatal convulsions, hyperbilirubinemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia and septicemia. There was a trend toward reduced risk in the magnesium sulfate group for need for mechanical ventilation and ongoing respiratory support, intraventricular hemorrhage, neonatal hypotension, hypothermia, length of NICU stay. IVH was less frequent and less severe in babies exposed to antenatal MgSO(4) (8%) as compared to non-MgSO(4) group (16%). Neonatal morbidities were more when antenatal MgSO(4) was given less than 4 h from delivery. CONCLUSION: MgSO(4) is a safe drug to use in antenatal women at risk for impending preterm. Antenatal magnesium sulfate given to women in established preterm labor conferred significant neuroprotective advantage to the neonate. MgSO(4) also has protective effect on the need of invasive ventilatory support in preterm infants. Given the breadth of evidence in its favor, it is time for us to start using MgSO(4) in clinical practice for neuroprotective intent in all our extreme preterm births.","Bansal, Vandana; Desai, Avinash",J Obstet Gynaecol India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349599/,63

59460,Influence of bronchoalveolar lavage on thoracic radiography in the horse.,2018,"BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common genitourinary cancer type with a high mortality rate. Due to a diverse range of biochemical alterations and a high level of tumor heterogeneity, it is crucial to select highly validated prognostic biomarkers to be able to identify subtypes of ccRCC early and apply precision medicine approaches. METHODS: Transcriptome data of ccRCC and clinical traits of patients were obtained from the GSE126964 dataset of Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) screening were applied to detect common differentially co-expressed genes. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, survival analysis, prognostic model establishment, and gene set enrichment analysis were also performed. Immunohistochemical analysis results of the expression levels of prognostic genes were obtained from The Human Protein Atlas. Single-gene RNA sequencing data were obtained from the GSE131685 and GSE171306 datasets. RESULTS: In the present study, a total of 2,492 DEGs identified between ccRCC and healthy controls were filtered, revealing 1,300 upregulated genes and 1,192 downregulated genes. Using WGCNA, the turquoise module was identified to be closely associated with ccRCC. Hub genes were identified using the maximal clique centrality algorithm. After having intersected the hub genes and the DEGs in GSE126964 and TCGA-KIRC dataset, and after performing univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and multivariate Cox regression analyses, ALDOB, EFHD1, and ESRRG were identified as significant prognostic factors in patients diagnosed with ccRCC. Single-gene RNA sequencing analysis revealed the expression profile of ALDOB, EFHD1, and ESRRG in different cell types of ccRCC. CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrated that ALDOB, EFHD1, and ESRRG may act as potential targets for medical therapy and could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for ccRCC.","Huang, Hao; Zhu, Ling; Huang, Chao; Dong, Yi; Fan, Liangliang; Tao, Lijian; Peng, Zhangzhe; Xiang, Rong",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516333/,63

59593,Annual aboveground carbon uptake enhancements from assisted gene flow in boreal black spruce forests are not long-lasting.,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND Healthcare workers (HCWs) have increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection via contacts in hospitals, as well as via transmission in the community. Serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair, and the incubation period are key parameters in determining the control strategies for COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate surveillance of HCWs and estimate the serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS A total of 149 HCWs and 36 certain infector-infectee pairs between 19th March 2020 and 1st November 2020 in a university hospital were included in the study. Epidemiological characteristics were recorded. Serial interval and incubation period were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models. RESULTS Forty HCWs (26.8%) were detected via contact-based surveillance. Of 100 HCWs epidemiologically linked with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 36 (36%) had contact with a colleague. The median serial interval was 3.93 days (95% CI: 3.17-4.83). Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% had developed symptoms 13.71 (95% CI: 9.39-18.73) days after symptom onset of the primary case. The median incubation period was 3.99 (95% CI: 3.25-4.84) days. Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% developed symptoms within 9.49 (95% CI: 6.75-12.20) days after infection. CONCLUSIONS The serial interval and the incubation period of COVID-19 in HCWs were shorter than in the general population. Rigorous contact tracing and isolation of infected HCWs could have resulted in shorter serial intervals. Implementation of more stringent in-hospital control measures focussed on transmission between HCWs should be considered.","Emecen, Ahmet Naci; Basoglu Sensoy, Ecem; Sezgin, Edanur; Yildirim Ustuner, Buket; Keskin, Salih; Siyve, Neslisah; Celik, Saadet Goksu; Bayrak, Gamze; Senturk Durukan, Nurcan; Coskun Beyan, Ayse; Ergor, Alp; Unal, Belgin; Ergor, Gul",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1900599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729905/,63

This study aimed to determine whether the large-diameter great saphenous vein (GSV) affected closure rate, complications, and clinical and quality of life (QoL) improvement. Methods From January 2012 to September 2016, a total of 722 limbs were treated with ClosureFAST RFA in a single center. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the vein diameter measured 3 cm below the saphenofemoral junction (group A ≤ 12 mm, group B > 12 mm). Vein closure was evaluated with duplex scan at 3-5 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The incidence of complications, improvements in symptoms (measured by the Venous Clinical Severity Score [VCSS]) and QoL (measured by the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score [AVSS]) were evaluated. Results Groups consisted of 663 GSVs in group A (mean diameter, 6.00 ± 1.74 mm) and 59 in group B (mean diameter, 13.17 ± 1.28 mm). Vein closure rates at 12 months were 98.9% in group A and 100% in group B (P = 0.428). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications. Both groups showed marked improvements in the VCSS and the AVSS with no significant differences. Conclusion For large-diameter veins, RFA showed comparable outcomes in terms of closure rate, complications, clinical and QoL improvements.","Woo, Hye Young; Kim, Suh Min; Kim, Daehwan; Chung, Jung Kee; Jung, In Mok",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2019.96.6.313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183336/,63
60023,"Comparison of dosimetric parameters of small-field electron beams between Advanced Markus, Semiflex 3D, and Diode E responses.",2020-07-20,"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a growing health issue globally, which until recently has been considered to be one that is both chronic and progressive. Treatments, although having lifestyle and dietary change as core components, have been focused on optimising glycaemic control using pharmaceutical agents. With data from bariatric surgery and, more recently, total diet replacement (TDR) studies which have set out to achieve remission; remission of T2DM has emerged as treatment goal. A group of specialist dietitians, medical practitioners was convened, supported by the British Dietetic Association and Diabetes UK, to discuss dietary approaches to T2DM, and undertook a review of the available clinical trial and practice audit data regarding dietary approaches to remission of T2DM. Current available evidence suggests a range of dietary approaches, including low energy diets (mostly using TDR) and low carbohydrate diets, can be used to support the achievement of euglycaemia and potentially remission. The most significant predictor of remission is weight loss, and although euglycaemia may occur on a low carbohydrate diet without weight loss, which does not meet some definitions of remission, but may rather constitute a 'state of mitigation' of T2DM. This technical point may not be considered important for people living with T2DM, aside from that it may only last as long as the carbohydrate restriction is maintained. The possibility of actively treating T2DM along with the possibility of achieving remission should be discussed by healthcare professionals with people living with T2DM, along with a range of different dietary approaches which can help to achieve it.

In this study, we found that feline calicivirus (FCV) infection promotes the degradation of endogenous and exogenous mRNAs and induces host gene shutoff, which results in global inhibition of host protein synthesis. Screening assay revealed that proteinase-polymerase (PP) is a most effective factor in reducing mRNA expression. Moreover, differently virulent strains of FCV PP could induce mRNA degradation. Further, we found that the key sites of the PP protein required for its proteinase activity are also essential for its shutoff activity, but also required for viral replication. The mechanism analysis showed that PP mainly targets Pol II-transcribed RNA in a ribosome-, 5'cap- and 3' poly(A) tail-independent manner. Moreover, the purified GST-PP fusion protein exhibits ribonuclease activity in vitro in assays using GFP RNA transcribed in vitro as substrates in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. Finally, PP-induced shutoff requires host Xrn1 to complete further RNA degradation. This study provides a newly discovered strategy in which FCV PP protein induces host gene shutoff by promoting the degradation of host mRNAs.ImportanceVirus infection-induced shutoff is the result of targeted or global manipulation of cellular gene expression and leads to efficient viral replication and immune evasion. FCV is a highly contagious pathogen that persistently infects cats. It is unknown how FCV blocks the host immune response and persistently exists in cats. In this study, we found that FCV infection promotes the degradation of host mRNAs and induces host gene shutoff via a common strategy. Further, PP protein for different FCV strains is a key factor that enhances mRNA degradation. An in vitro assay showed that the GST-PP fusion protein possess ribonuclease activity in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. This study demonstrates that FCV induces host gene shutoff by promoting the degradation of host mRNAs, thereby introducing a potential mechanism by which FCV infection inhibits the immune response.","Wu, Hongxia; Huang, Jiapei; Liu, Yongxiang; Pan, Yudi; Li, Yin; Miao, Qian; Qu, Liandong; Tian, Jin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00336-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853967/,63

It is characterized by reduced chest wall compliance and impaired respiratory mechanisms leading to progressive hypo-ventilation. We evaluated the effectiveness and the safety of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients after an episode of acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS Eighteen patients with severe kyphoscoliosis who had been hospitalized for an episode of ARF were followed for 4 years. NIV was applied via mouthpiece (MPV) during the daytime and via mask during the night. The primary outcomes were changes in physiological and functional parameters as well as quality of life. Secondary outcomes were considered re-hospitalization and mortality rate after discharge. A set of control subjects was used for comparison. RESULTS All patients showed a significant improvement in several clinical, physiological, functional and quality of life parameters. Four of them (22.2%) died during the four year follow-up period. In the uni-variate analysis patients who died had higher cardiac co-morbidity, lower MIP and SNIP, higher paCO2, and oxygen desaturation index at initial admission. CONCLUSIONS Diurnal MPV associated with nocturnal NIV had significantly improved lung function, clinical outcomes and quality of life. It should be considered as a safe alternative to traditional administering of NIV.","Nicolini, A; Barlascini, C; Piroddi, I M G; Garuti, G; Banfi, P I",Revista portuguesa de pneumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rppnen.2015.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748589/,63

Concomitant RCCs in a native and transplant kidneys are very rare. Conventional surgical approach requires a long incision. METHODS A 50-year-old man 14 years after renal transplant was found incidentally to have concomitant RCCs in his native right kidney and transplant kidney. A right lower abdomen Gibson incision, along his transplant wound, was used initially for LESS right radical nephrectomy and lymphadenectomy, and that same wound was used for a nonischemic open partial nephrectomy in the transplant kidney. RESULTS The LESS right radical nephrectomy took 3.25 hours with estimated blood loss (EBL) of 80 mL and the partial nephrectomy for the transplant kidney took 3 hours with EBL of 220 mL. No transfusion was required. Pathologic examination revealed both tumors to be RCC, clear cell type, and 6.5 cm in the right native kidney and 2.8 cm in the transplant kidney. The final wound measured 9 cm. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with inpatient narcotic requirement of 37 mg morphine sulfate equivalent, and oral intake of food resumed in 2.5 days. His allograft function was well preserved with a serum creatinine unchanged (1.4 mg/dL) at discharge. CONCLUSION In a patient with concomitant tumors in a native kidney and a transplant kidney, this unique approach provides exceptional benefits of minimally invasive tumor excision for both tumors, and good preservation of renal function.","Sankari, Bashir R; Chueh, Shih-Chieh Jeff",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2011.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22055688/,63

We hypothesised that this program would streamline care and would lead to improved weight loss following bariatric surgery. METHODS The program incorporates a structured general practitioners (GP) review, a patient information evening and an on-line learning package. It was introduced in September 2012. Patient flow through the program was recorded. Outcomes of the new program were compared with contemporaneously treated patients who did not undertake the pre-hospital program. RESULTS All 636 patients on the waiting list for first appointment at the Alfred Health bariatric surgery clinic were invited to participate. There were 400 patients ultimately removed from the waiting list for first appointment. Of the remaining 236 patients, 229 consented to participate in the new program. The mean BMI was 47.8 ± 9.2. The fail to attend first appointment rate dropped from 12 to 2.1 %. At 12 months post-bariatric surgery, patients who undertook the new program (n = 82) had a mean excess weight loss (EWL) of 41.1 ± 20.3 % where as those treated on the standard pathway (n = 61) had a mean EWL 32 ± 18.0 % (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS The introduction of a pre-hospital education program has led to an improvement in attendance rates and early weight loss post-bariatric surgery.","Brown, Wendy A; Burton, Paul R; Shaw, Kalai; Smith, Brittany; Maffescioni, Shelley; Comitti, Bernadette; Cowley, Michael A; Laurie, Cheryl; Way, Andrew; Nottle, Peter",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2075-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26852397/,63

However, there is no consensus on the optimal timing of diagnostic capsule endoscopy (CE). We investigated the clinical utility of emergency CE for detecting the source of ongoing overt OGIB. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 146 consecutive patients who, between February 2009 and July 2018, underwent emergency CE at Hiroshima University Hospital to detect the source of ongoing overt OGIB. Patients with a bleeding source located outside the small bowel were excluded. The remaining 127 patients were stratified according to the timing of CE relative to the onset of bleeding: patients in group A (n = 15, 12 men; mean age: 75 years; age range: 62-83 years) underwent CE within 48 hours of bleeding onset, whereas patients in group B (n = 112, 73 men; mean age: 65 years; age range: 17-88 years) underwent CE at >48 hours after bleeding onset. All patients underwent double-balloon endoscopy, and the final diagnosis was compared against the CE findings. Results The CE lesion detection rate was significantly higher in group A (12/15 patients, 80%) than in group B (53/112 patients, 47%) (p = 0.0174). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the patients' background characteristics. Vascular lesions were the most frequent finding in both groups. The diagnostic concordance rate between emergency CE and double-balloon endoscopy was 100% in group A and 92.9% in group B. Rebleeding after endoscopic treatment was confirmed in only one patient in group B. Conclusions Emergency CE represents a useful diagnostic modality in patients with ongoing overt OGIB, potentially improving detection rates and reducing rebleeding risk.","Iio, Sumio; Oka, Shiro; Tanaka, Shinji; Tsuboi, Akiyoshi; Otani, Ichiro; Kunihara, Sayoko; Chayama, Kazuaki",Gastroenterology research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5496242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31885542/,63
63266,Has Twitter just had its saddest fortnight ever?,2020-06-15,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred new interest in interferon signaling in response to viral pathogens. Much of what we know about the signaling molecules and associated signal transduction induced during the host cellular response to viral pathogens has been gained from research conducted from the 1990's to the present day, but certain intricacies of the mechanisms involved, still remain unclear. In a recent study by Vaughn et al. the authors examine one of the main mechanisms regulating interferon induction following viral infection, the RIG-I/MAVS/IRF3 pathway, and find that similar to PKR both DICER interacting proteins, PACT and TRBP, regulate RIG-I signaling in an opposing manner. More specifically, the reported findings demonstrate, like others, that PACT stimulates RIG-I-mediated signaling in a manner independent of PACT dsRNA-binding ability or phosphorylation at sites known to be important for PACT-dependent PKR activation. In contrast, they show for the first time that TRBP inhibits RIG-I-mediated signaling. RIG-I inhibition by TRBP did not require phosphorylation of sites shown to be important for inhibiting PKR, nor did it involve PACT or PKR, but it did require the dsRNA-binding ability of TRBP. These findings open the door to a complex co-regulation of RIG-I, PKR, MDA5, miRNA processing, and interferon induction.","Blalock, William L",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20210110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003254/,63

63718,NKG7 makes a better killer.,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The biologic mechanisms leading to aneurysm healing or rare complications such as delayed aneurysm ruptures after flow-diverter placement remain poorly understood. We used RNA sequencing following implantation of coils or flow diverters in elastase aneurysms in rabbits to identify genes and pathways of potential interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms were treated with coils (n = 5) or flow diverters (n = 4) or were left untreated for controls (n = 6). Messenger RNA was isolated from the aneurysms at 4 weeks following treatment. RNA samples were processed by using RNA-sequencing technology and were analyzed by using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. RESULTS With RNA sequencing for coiled versus untreated aneurysms, 464/9990 genes (4.6%) were differentially expressed (58 down-regulated, 406 up-regulated). When we compared flow-diverter versus untreated aneurysms, 177/10,041 (1.8%) genes were differentially expressed (8 down-regulated, 169 up-regulated). When we compared flow-diverter versus coiled aneurysms, 13/9982 (0.13%) genes were differentially expressed (8 down-regulated, 5 up-regulated). Keratin 8 was overexpressed in flow diverters versus coils. This molecule may potentially play a critical role in delayed ruptures due to plasmin production. We identified overregulation of apelin in flow diverters, supporting the preponderance of endothelialization, whereas we found overexpression of molecules implicated in wound healing (dectin 1 and hedgehog interacting protein) for coiled aneurysms. Furthermore, we identified metallopeptidases 1, 12, and 13 as overexpressed in coiled versus untreated aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS We observed different physiopathologic responses after endovascular treatment with various devices. Flow diverters promote endothelialization but express molecules that could potentially explain the rare delayed ruptures. Coils promote wound healing and express genes potentially implicated in the recurrence of coiled aneurysms.","Rouchaud, A; Johnson, C; Thielen, E; Schroeder, D; Ding, Y-H; Dai, D; Brinjikji, W; Cebral, J; Kallmes, D F; Kadirvel, R",AJNR.

Antivirals that have shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV2 or the closely related SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV, are compared on the enzymatic level and by potency in cells. For treatment of the CSS we discuss medications that reduce the effects, or expression of cytokines involved in the CSS with an emphasis on those that reduce IL-6 because of its central role in the development of the CSS. We show that some of the medications covered influence the activity or expression of enzymes involved in epigenetic processes and specifically those that add or remove modifications to histones or DNA. Where available, the latest clinical data showing the efficacy of the medications is presented. With respect to their mechanisms, we explain why some medications are successful, why others have failed, and why some untested medications may yet prove useful.","Luo, Wenxia; Ige, Olufola O; Beacon, Tasnim H; Su, Ruey-Chyi; Huang, Shujun; Davie, James R; Lakowski, Ted M",Genome,https://doi.org/10.1139/gen-2020-0130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197212/,63

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the initial outcomes of CardioClick, a telehealth primary CVD prevention program. METHODS In 2017, the Stanford South Asian Translational Heart Initiative (a preventive cardiology clinic focused on high-risk South Asian patients) introduced CardioClick, which is a clinical pathway replacing in-person follow-up visits with video visits. We assessed patient engagement and changes in CVD risk factors in CardioClick patients and in a historical in-person cohort from the same clinic. RESULTS In this study, 118 CardioClick patients and 441 patients who received in-person care were included. CardioClick patients were more likely to complete the clinic's CVD prevention program (76/118, 64.4% vs 173/441, 39.2%, respectively; P<.001) and they did so in lesser time (mean, 250 days vs 307 days, respectively; P<.001) than the patients in the historical in-person cohort. Patients who completed the CardioClick program achieved reductions in CVD risk factors, including blood pressure, lipid concentrations, and BMI, which matched or exceeded those observed in the historical in-person cohort.

For unilateral first-time hernias, either laparoscopic or open repair with mesh can offer excellent results. The major drawback of laparoscopy is that the technique requires a significant number of cases to master. For surgeons in group practice, it makes sense to have one surgeon in the group perform laparoscopic repairs so that experience can be concentrated. For others, the best technique remains the approach that the surgeon is most comfortable and experienced performing.","Carter, Jonathan; Duh, Quan-Yang",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1030-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21400014/,63

We determined if the degree of patient satisfaction with aesthetic outcomes progressed with the equivalent treatment outcomes after the introduction of a single-incision approach to laparoscopic Heller-Dor surgery. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 20 consecutive esophageal achalasia patients (multiport approach, n = 10; single-incision approach, n = 10) and assessed the treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction with the aesthetic outcomes. RESULTS In the single-incision approach, thin supportive devices were routinely used to gain exposure to the esophageal hiatus. No statistically significant differences in the operating time (210.2 ± 28.8 vs 223.5 ± 46.3 min; P = 0.4503) or blood loss (14.0 ± 31.7 vs 16.0 ± 17.8 mL; P = 0.8637) were detected between the multiport and single-incision approaches. We experienced no intraoperative complications. Mild dysphagia, which resolved spontaneously, was noted postoperatively in one patient treated with the multiport approach. The reduction rate of the maximum lower esophageal sphincter pressure was 25.1 ± 34.4% for the multiport approach and 21.8 ± 19.2% for the single-incision approach (P = 0.8266). Patient satisfaction with aesthetic outcomes was greater for the single-incision approach than for the multiport approach. CONCLUSION When single-incision laparoscopic Heller-Dor surgery was performed adequately and combined with the use of thin supportive devices, patient satisfaction with the aesthetic outcomes was higher and treatment outcomes were equivalent to those of the multiport approach.","Fukuda, Shuichi; Nakajima, Kiyokazu; Miyazaki, Yasuhiro; Takahashi, Tsuyoshi; Makino, Tomoki; Kurokawa, Yukinori; Yamasaki, Makoto; Miyata, Hiroshi; Takiguchi, Shuji; Mori, Masaki; Doki, Yuichiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315292/,63

There is no proven cure for the common cold and symptomatic relief is the mainstay of treatment. The use of intranasal ipratropium bromide (IB) has been addressed in several studies and might prove an effective treatment for the common cold. OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of IB versus placebo or no treatment on severity of rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion in children and adults with the common cold. Subjective overall improvement was another primary outcome and side effects (for example, dry mucous membranes, epistaxis and systemic anticholinergic effects) were reported as a secondary outcome. SEARCH METHODS In this updated review we searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 3, MEDLINE (1950 to March week 4, 2013), MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations (8 April 2013), EMBASE (1974 to April 2013), AMED (1985 to April 2013), Biosis (1974 to February 2011) and LILACS (1985 to April 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IB to placebo or no treatment in children and adults with the common cold. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We used a standardised form to extract relevant data and we contacted trial authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS Seven trials with a total of 2144 participants were included. Four studies (1959 participants) addressed subjective change in severity of rhinorrhoea. All studies were consistent in reporting statistically significant changes in favour of IB. Nasal congestion was reported in four studies and was found to have no significant change between the two groups. Two studies found a positive response in the IB group for the global assessment of overall improvement. Side effects were more frequent in the IB group, odds ratio (OR) 2.09 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 3.11). Commonly encountered side effects included nasal dryness, blood tinged mucus and epistaxis. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was moderate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS For people with the common cold, the existing evidence, which has some limitations, suggests that IB is likely to be effective in ameliorating rhinorrhoea. IB had no effect on nasal congestion and its use was associated with more side effects compared to placebo or no treatment although these appeared to be well tolerated and self limiting. There is a need for larger, high-quality trials to determine the effectiveness of IB in relieving common cold symptoms.","AlBalawi, Zaina H; Othman, Sahar S; Alfaleh, Khalid",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd008231.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23784858/,63
67190,Safety considerations for performing robotic surgery in the presence of a permanent pacemaker.,2018,"Several viruses were proved to inhibit the formation of RNA processing bodies (P-bodies); however, knowledge regarding whether enterovirus blocks P-body formation remains unclear, and the detailed molecular mechanisms and functions of picornavirus regulation of P-bodies are limited. Here we show the crucial role of 2A protease in inhibiting P-bodies to promote viral replication during enterovirus 71 infection. Moreover, we found that the activity of 2A protease is essential to inhibit P-body formation, which was proved by the result that infection of EV71-2AC110S, the 2A protease activity-inactivated recombinant virus, failed to block the formation of P-bodies. Furthermore, we showed DDX6, a scaffolding protein of P-bodies, interacted with viral RNA to facilitate viral replication rather than viral translation, by using a Renilla luciferase mRNA reporter system and capturing the nascent RNA assay. Altogether, our data firstly demonstrate that the 2A protease of enterovirus inhibits P-body formation to facilitate viral RNA synthesis by recruiting the P-body components to viral RNA. IMPORTANCE Processing bodies (P-bodies) are constitutively present in eukaryotic cells and play an important role in the mRNA cycle, including regulating gene expression and mRNA degradation. P-bodies are the structure that viruses to manipulate to facilitate their survival. Here, we show that the 2A protease alone was efficient to block P-body formation during enterovirus 71 infection and its activity was essential. When the assembly of P-bodies was blocked by 2A, DDX6 and 4E-T which were required for P-body formation bound to viral RNA to facilitate viral RNA synthesis. We propose a model revealing that EV71 manipulates P-body formation to generate an environment that is conducive to viral replication by facilitating viral RNA synthesis: 2A protease blocked P-body assembly to make it possible for virus to take advantage of P-body components.","Fan, Shanshan; Xu, Zihang; Liu, Pengfei; Qin, Yali; Chen, Mingzhou",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00922-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287048/,63

Knowledge of local variation in levels of HIV infection is important for prioritization of areas for intervention. We apply two spatial analytical techniques to investigate the micro-geographical patterns and clustering of HIV infections in a high prevalence, rural population in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS All 12,221 participants who consented to an HIV test in a population under continuous demographical surveillance were linked to their homesteads and geo-located in a geographical information system (accuracy of <2 m). We then used a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel of radius 3 km to produce robust estimates of HIV prevalence that vary across continuous geographical space. We also applied a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic (Bernoulli model) to formally identify clusters of infections (P < 0.05). RESULTS The results reveal considerable geographical variation in local HIV prevalence (range = 6-36%) within this relatively homogenous population and provide clear empirical evidence for the localized clustering of HIV infections. Three high-risk, overlapping spatial clusters [Relative Risk (RR) = 1.34-1.62] were identified by the Kulldorff statistic along the National Road (P < or = 0.01), whereas three low risk clusters (RR = 0.2-0.38) were identified elsewhere in the study area (P < or = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS The findings show the existence of several localized HIV epidemics of varying intensity that are partly contained within geographically defined communities. Despite the overall high prevalence of HIV in many rural South African settings, the results support the need for interventions that target socio-geographic spaces (communities) at greatest risk to supplement measures aimed at the general population.","Tanser, Frank; Bärnighausen, Till; Cooke, Graham S; Newell, Marie-Louise",International journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyp148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19261659/,63

The four tocotrienol homologues were well separated within 30 minutes. A large interindividual variation between subjects was observed as the absorption of tocotrienols is dependent on food matrix and gut lipolysis. The accuracies of lower and upper limit of quantification ranged between 92% and 109% for intraday assays and 90% and 112% for interday assays.

The purpose of this study was to describe outcomes and risk factors of applying VA-ECMO in the surgical pediatric population. We retrospectively analyzed 85 consecutive pediatric patients (aged <18 years) who received post-cardiotomy VA-ECMO from January 2010 to December 2018. Median (IQR) age at ECMO implantation in this cohort was 12.7 (6.4, 43.2) months, median weight was 8.5 (6.0, 12.8) kg, mean ECMO duration was 143.2 ± 81.6 h and mean hospital length of stay was 48.4 ± 32.4 days. 75 patients (88.2%) were indicated for post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock. The successful ECMO weaning rate was 70.6% and in-hospital mortality was 52.9%. The most common diagnosis was transposition of great arteries (n = 18, 21.2%), while acute kidney injury occurred most often (n = 64, 75.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that thrombocytopenia, hemolysis and nosocomial infection were positively correlated with in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis presented that thrombocytopenia significantly increased the 180-day mortality in patients with successful weaning. Therefore, multiple factors had adverse effects on prognosis. Patient selection and procedures from ECMO implantation to weaning need to be closely monitored and performed in a timely manner to improve outcome.","Jin, Yu; Feng, Zhengyi; Zhao, Ju; Hu, Jinxiao; Tong, Yuanyuan; Guo, Shengwen; Zhang, Peiyao; Bai, Liting; Li, Yixuan; Liu, Jinping",Artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.1111/aor.13773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645759/,63

METHODS A literature search was carried out in PubMed, using search terms defined by the authors. Questions important for the management of patients with COVID-19 were identified and discussed, and recommendations or statements on these topics were formulated in a structured consensus process. RESULTS Determination of the indication for the admission of COVID-19 patients to the hospital should involve consideration of age, comorbidities, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Every patient admitted without a recent PCR test should be tested immediately. It is recommended that any COVID-19 patient with hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%) despite being given oxygen, dyspnea, or a high respiratory rate be admitted to intensive care. In the case of hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, an attempt at treatment with high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation is suggested, while patients with severe hypoxemia/high respiratory rate should undergo intubation and invasive ventilation. In the presence of additional risk factors (such as obesity, known thrombophilia, intensive care treatment, or elevated D-dimers), intensified prophylaxis against thromboembolism may be indicated. Treatment with dexamethasone decreases the mortality among patients with severe or critical COVID-19. The important personal protection measures are attention to hygiene and the correct wearing of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION The principal treatment measures are maintenance of adequate oxygenation, pharmacological prevention of thrombosis, and, in severe cases, administration of dexamethasone.","Kluge, Stefan; Janssens, Uwe; Spinner, Christoph D; Pfeifer, Michael; Marx, Gernot; Karagiannidis, Christian MiddleName",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2021.0110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531113/,63

AIM To demonstrate how Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been applied to two recent oral health initiatives to evaluate their ability to reduce costs and improve the quality of life. METHODS CBA was applied to the Mouth Care Matters project in Kent, Surrey and Sussex, and the Senior Smiles project - improving oral health in residential homes in Australia. RESULTS Over a five-year period, the Mouth Care Matters project would generate £2.66 in cost savings, within the healthcare system, for every £1 spent. Over a three year period the Senior Smiles project would generate a cost saving for the healthcare system of $3.14 for every $1 spent. These evaluations were instrumental to enable a national rollout for Mouth Care Matters and a public endorsement of the programme for Senior Smiles.

METHODS One hundred patients were randomly assigned to RYGB (n = 45) and SG (n = 55). Fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), triglycerides, and serum cholesterol (total, HDL, and LDL) were evaluated at inclusion and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and β cell function (HOMA-B) were assessed. RESULTS Mean postoperative 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month excess weight loss was 25.39, 43.47, 63.75, and 80.38 % after RYGB and 25.25, 51.32, 64.67, and 82.97 % after SG, respectively. Mean fasting glucose and fasting serum insulin were similarly and statistically significantly reduced in both RYGB and SG. Mean HOMA-IR improved in both groups, particularly in case of high preoperative values, and mean HOMA-B improved at 1 year after RYGB. HbA1c% dropped from 5.66 % (SD = 0.61) to 5.57 % (SD = 0.32) after RYGB and from 5.64 % (SD = 0.43) to 5.44 % (SD = 0.43) after SG. Total cholesterol was significantly higher at 1 month (p = 0.04), 3 months (p = 0.03), and 1 year (p = 0.005) after SG as compared to RYGB. LDL cholesterol decreased significantly after RYGB at 1 month (p = 0.03), 3 months (p = 0.0001), and 1 year (p = 0.0004) as compared to SG. HDL cholesterol was increased at 1 year in the RYGB group but not in the SG group. Triglycerides decreased similarly in both groups.

In 394 cases of suspected pneumonia, 265 (67%) had radiographs consistent with pneumonia; 34/265 had proof of bacterial etiology. Of the cases, 86.5% had received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In suspected pneumonia, positive chest radiography was significantly associated with increasing C-reactive protein (CRP) values, higher age, and SpO2 ≤92% in multivariate logistic regression, OR 1.06 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.09), OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.00 to1.18), and OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.42 to 5.18), respectively. In proven pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia was significantly differentiated from viral/atypical pneumonia by increasing CRP values and SpO2 >92% in multivariate logistic regression, OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.14) and OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.82), respectively. Combining high CRP values (>80 mg/L) and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count provided specificity >85%, positive likelihood ratios >3, but sensitivity <46% for both radiographic proven and bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSION With relatively high specificity and likelihood ratio CRP, WBC count and hypoxemia may be beneficial in ruling in a positive chest radiograph in suspected pneumonia and bacterial etiology in proven pneumonia, but with low sensitivity, the clinical utility is limited. What is Known: • Pneumonia is recommended to be a clinical diagnosis, and neither clinical features nor inflammatory markers can reliably distinguish etiology. • The etiology of pneumonia has changed after routine pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. What is New: • High CRP and WBC counts were associated with infiltrates in children with suspected pneumonia and with bacterial infection in proven pneumonia. • In the post-pneumococcal vaccination era, viral etiology is expected, and in cases of pneumonia with low CRP and WBC counts, a watch-and-wait strategy for antibiotic treatment may be applied.","Berg, Are Stuwitz; Inchley, Christopher Stephen; Fjaerli, Hans Olav; Leegaard, Truls Michael; Lindbaek, Morten; Nakstad, Britt",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-017-2887-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281094/,63

72159,Abstract.,2013-04-01,"BACKGROUND Despite increasing use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy, the large number of patients ineligible for treatment or for whom treatment is ineffective has become problematic. SUMMARY The number of endovascular treatments for acute ischemic stroke is increasing each year. This treatment provides higher recanalization rates for occluded vessels but may lead to hemorrhagic complications such as subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results were announced for three randomized controlled trials in 2013, with all failing to show the superiority of endovascular treatment. These results have had a major negative impact, but a new randomized controlled trial, the Multicenter Randomized CLinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), showed that acute endovascular treatment was superior to standard medical treatment in terms of clinical outcomes. With this positive result, interim analyses from other randomized trials appear likely to show the effectiveness of endovascular treatment. KEY MESSAGE Clinical evidence of acute stroke intervention using mechanical devices might be established in the near future.","Shirakawa, Manabu; Yoshimura, Shinichi; Yamada, Kiyofumi; Uchida, Kazutaka; Shindou, Seigo",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000375540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279657/,63
72212,Dynamic allometric scaling of tree biomass and size.,2021-01-04,"BACKGROUND Ligands of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) show promising results in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of prostate cancer (PCa). OBJECTIVE To compare the diagnostic performance of simultaneous gallium 68 (68Ga)-PSMA HBED-CC PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for localization of primary PCa with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and PET alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI in 66 men with biopsy-proven PCa. INTERVENTION PET, mpMRI, and combined 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI were independently evaluated using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria or a 5-point Likert scale. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The prostate was divided into sextants for histopathology and coregistered with imaging. Diagnostic performance for localization of malignancy was calculated based on receiver operating characteristics analysis for each modality. Regional quantitative PET tracer uptake was recorded; uptake ratio was defined as the ratio of malignant to nonmalignant prostate tissue. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS A total of 53 of 66 patients were eligible for analysis. mpMRI, PET, and PET/MRI detected cancer in 66% (35 of 53), 92% (49 of 53), and 98% (52 of 53) of the patients, respectively. Overall, 202 of 318 sextants (63.5%) contained cancer at pathologic examination. Simultaneous PET/MRI statistically outperformed mpMRI (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.88 vs 0.73; p<0.001) and PET imaging (AUC: 0.88 vs 0.83; p=0.002) for localization of PCa. Compared with mpMRI, PET imaging was more accurate (AUC: 0.83 vs 0.73; p=0.003). PET provided a high uptake ratio between malignant versus nonmalignant tissue (5.02 [range: 0.89-29.8]), but no significant correlation was observed between quantitative PET parameters and Gleason score or prostate-specific antigen value. CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI improves diagnostic accuracy for PCa localization both compared with mpMRI and with PET imaging alone. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate its potential (eg, for biopsy guidance). PATIENT SUMMARY We examined gallium 68 (68Ga)-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) HBED-CC positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) for primary prostate cancer (PCa) and compared it with multiparametric MRI and PET alone. Our results indicate a higher diagnostic accuracy for 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI that may help localize PCa.","Eiber, Matthias; Weirich, Gregor; Holzapfel, Konstantin; Souvatzoglou, Michael; Haller, Bernhard; Rauscher, Isabel; Beer, Ambros J; Wester, Hans-Jürgen; Gschwend, Juergen; Schwaiger, Markus; Maurer, Tobias",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2015.12.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26795686/,63

During the epidemic period of corona virus disease, appropriate oral health management and disease prevention of children is very important for children's oral and general health. In order to prevent the occurrence of cross-infection and epidemic spreading of COVID-19 during dental practice, the recommendations to parents include: not only training children to maintain hand hygiene at home, exercise appropriately, strengthen physical resistance, but also helping children develop good oral and diet habit such as effective brushing and flossing to avoid oral diseases and emergency. If non-emergency oral situation occur, parents could assist their child to take home based care such as rinsing to relieve the symptoms. When oral emergencies such as acute pulpitis, periapical periodontitis, dental trauma, oral and maxillofacial infections happen, parents and children should visit dental clinic in time with correct personal protection. During the epidemic period, children's oral emergencies should be treated in accordance with current guidelines and control of COVID-19.","Wang, Yan; Zhou, Chen-Chen; Shu, Rui; Zou, Jing",Sichuan da xue xue bao.

Population-based analysis of the age distribution among confirmed cases was conducted and their crude case fatality ratio in each c RESULTS: The age distributions among COVID-19 cases were relatively similar between China and Italy with primarily elderly populations infected, which were considerably different from that in South Korea with primarily younger individuals infected. Most deaths occurred among elderly individuals who were older than 60 years in both Italy (98.0%) and South Korea (87.9%), consistent with the previous data from China (81.0%). CONCLUSIONS Most deaths occurred among elderly individuals who were over 60 in China, Italy, and South Korea. South Korea's data suggest that younger individuals might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be fully under detected in China and Italy.","Liu, J-Q; Xu, J-W; Sun, C-Y; Wang, J-N; Wang, X-T; Chen, X; Gao, S L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336777/,63
73354,Bacillus subtilis modulates its usage of biofilm-bound iron in response to environmental iron availability.,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A frequently reported drawback of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer-based liquid embolic agents is the production of artifacts in diagnostic imaging. New embolic agents, such as Precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid (PHIL; MicroVention, Tustin, CA, USA), are supposed to induce significantly fewer artifacts. The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of artifacts induced by the liquid embolic agents Onyx (Medtronic Neurovascular, Irvine, CA, USA) and PHIL in conventional computed tomography (CT), cone-beam CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an experimental in vivo model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 10 pigs the rete mirabile was embolized with Onyx ( n = 5) or PHIL ( n = 5). After embolization, conventional CT, cone-beam CT and MRI were performed. The degree of artifacts was graded qualitatively (five-point scale; for CT and MRI) and quantitatively (HUs of well-defined regions of interest (ROIs); for CT only). RESULTS Artifacts were significantly more severe for Onyx both in the qualitative (e.g. conventional CT: 2 versus 5 (medians); p = 0.008) and in the quantitative image analysis (e.g. cone-beam CT: standard deviation of a ROI near to the embolic agent cast, 94 HU versus 38 HU (medians); p = 0.008). Neither Onyx nor PHIL produced any apparent artifacts in MRI. CONCLUSION PHIL produces fewer artifacts than Onyx in conventional CT and cone-beam CT in an experimental in vivo model.","Vollherbst, Dominik F; Otto, Ruth; Do, Thuy; Kauczor, Hans U; Bendszus, Martin; Sommer, Christof M; Möhlenbruch, Markus A","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019918782692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29973083/,63

METHODS Adult outpatients with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) and response or remission following 6-month continuation treatment with venlafaxine extended release (ER) were randomized to receive venlafaxine ER or placebo for 1 year. Patients without recurrence on venlafaxine ER during year 1 were randomized to venlafaxine ER or placebo for year 2. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q), Life Enjoyment Scale-Short Version (LES-S), Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report (SAS-SR) total and individual factors, Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) (vitality, social functioning, and role function-emotional items), and Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE). RESULTS At year 1 end, better overall psychosocial functioning was seen among patients randomly assigned to venlafaxine ER (n=129) vs placebo (n=129), with significant differences at end point on SF-36 role function-emotional, Q-LES-Q, and SAS-SR total, and work, house work, social/leisure, and extended-family factor scores (p≤0.05). At year 2 end, significant differences favored venlafaxine ER (n=43) vs placebo (n=40) on SF-36 vitality and role function-emotional, Q-LES-Q, LES-S, LIFE, and SAS-SR total, social/leisure, and extended-family factor scores (p≤0.05). LIMITATIONS Patients with chronic MDD or treatment resistance were excluded and long-term specialist care was a financial incentive for treatment compliance. Discontinuation-related adverse events may have compromised the integrity of the treatment blind. CONCLUSIONS For patients with recurrent MDD, 2 years' maintenance therapy with venlafaxine ER may improve psychosocial functioning vs placebo.","Trivedi, Madhukar H; Dunner, David L; Kornstein, Susan G; Thase, Michael E; Zajecka, John M; Rothschild, Anthony J; Friedman, Edward S; Shelton, Richard C; Keller, Martin B; Kocsis, James H; Gelenberg, Alan",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2010.04.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20510459/,63
73694,How microbes in permafrost could trigger a massive carbon bomb.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rate for girls/women has not changed in over 20 years, and they remain 3-6 times more likely to experience injury compared with boys/men. To date, ACL injury prevention and management has been approached from a sex-based biological point of view which has furthered our understanding of injury risk factors, mechanisms, and prevention and rehabilitation programmes. However, the traditional sex-based approach does not take into account the growing recognition of how sex and gender (a social construct) are 'entangled' and influence each other. OBJECTIVE This paper discusses the curious absence of gender as an influencer in the dialogue surrounding ACL injuries. We propose adding gender as a pervasive developmental environment as a new theoretical overlay to an established injury model to illustrate how gender can operate as an extrinsic determinant from the presport, training and competition environments through to ACL injury and the treatment environment. APPROACH We draw on social epidemiological theories of the embodiment of gender and health to provide plausible examples of how gender may influence ACL injury, and demonstrate the opportunity for new, interdisciplinary research in the field. CONCLUSION Over 20 years of research has failed to decrease the ACL injury rate disparity between girls/women and boys/men. Embedding gender in the study of ACL injury will heighten awareness of possible influences outside the traditional biological elements, challenge us to think about the inextricable 'entanglement' of sex and gender, and inform more effective approaches to ACL injury prevention and treatment.","Parsons, Joanne L; Coen, Stephanie E; Bekker, Sheree",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692033/,63

As for other innovative nanopharmaceuticals (NPhs), the advancement of robust methods to assess quality and safety profiles-in line with regulatory needs-is critical for facilitating their development and clinical translation. Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multiple online optical detectors (MD-AF4) is considered a very versatile and robust approach for physical characterisation of nanocarriers, and has been used successfully for measuring particle size, polydispersity and physical stability of lipid-based systems, including liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles. However, the unique core structure of LNP-RNA, composed of ionizable lipids electrostatically complexed with RNA, and the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating, is more prone to destabilization during focusing in MD-AF4 than previously characterised nanoparticles, resulting in particle aggregation and sample loss. Hence characterisation of LNP-RNA by MD-AF4 needs significant adaptation of the methods developed for liposomes. To improve the performance of MD-AF4 applied to LNP-RNA in a systematic and comprehensive manner, we have explored the use of the frit-inlet channel where, differently from the standard AF4 channel, the particles are relaxed hydrodynamically as they are injected. The absence of a focusing step minimizes contact between the particle and the membrane, reducing artefacts (e.g. sample loss, particle aggregation). Separation in a frit-inlet channel enables satisfactory reproducibility and acceptable sample recovery in the commercially available MD-AF4 instruments. In addition to slice-by-slice measurements of particle size, MD-AF4 also determined particle concentration and the particle size distribution, demonstrating enhanced versatility beyond standard sizing measurements.","Mildner, R; Hak, S; Parot, J; Hyldbakk, A; Borgos, S E; Some, D; Johann, C; Caputo, F",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2021.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745980/,63

Besides, infant age, mother education and occupation, information availability, and CF knowledge may also affect the practice. Therefore, we aimed to explore the CF practice and its related factors during the COVID-19 outbreak through an online cross-sectional study of the mothers of children aged 6 to 24 months in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta. The results showed that a child's age (P = .019), household food security (P = .006), and mother's CF knowledge (P = .002) had an association with CF practices.

76019,Kinetics of the formation of a protein corona around nanoparticles.,2016,"Background MedsCheck is an in-pharmacy medication review program funded by the Australian Government. It is intended to improve patient understanding of medicines and resolve adherence issues. Objective To explore MedsCheck from the community pharmacists' perspective, focusing on the perceived effectiveness of the program, barriers to its optimal delivery, and the integration with other services. Setting Individual interviews in one territory and a national online survey of Australian community pharmacists. Method Using a mixed-method triangulation design, the interviews and the survey were conducted concurrently. The interviews were semi-structured, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. The survey, comprising closed and open-ended questions, was quantitatively and thematically analysed. The findings were first analysed separately and finally integrated by searching for convergence, complementarity, and discrepancy. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' perceptions of the effectiveness and barriers of MedsCheck. Results Eight interviews were conducted, and 232 survey responses collected. In the interviews, themes related to perceived benefits (appreciation, reduced confusion, and strengthening relationships), barriers (lack of controls, lack of staff, lack of awareness, and lack of understanding of scope of services), and the integration with other services (strong link with dose administration aids) emerged, which mostly correlated with the survey's results. Ten percent of surveyed respondents did not provide the MedsCheck service; their main reason being insufficient staffing. Of the pharmacists offering the service, 76% strongly agreed that patients were benefitting. MedsCheck reviews were usually initiated by pharmacy staff. Fifty-three percent of respondent pharmacists never or only sometimes reported the review outcomes to the patient's general practitioner. Conclusion The pharmacists believed that MedsCheck is useful to improve patients' understanding and management of their medicines. However, there are currently barriers to the effective delivery of the service, including workload issues, lack of patient awareness, and the service's integration with the broader care of the patient. If these were appropriately addressed, the in-pharmacy medication review program could help pharmacists to better engage with patients and general practitioners and enhance understanding of medication and adherence.","Buss, Vera H; Shield, Alison; Kosari, Sam; Peterson, Gregory M; Naunton, Mark",International journal of clinical pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-020-01102-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803556/,63

Better understanding of these approaches, particularly efforts to create a single point of entry to comprehensive, evidence-based services through youth service hubs, is needed to help guide future implementation and evaluation. This scoping review identifies the key principles and characteristics of these models of care, as well as the state of the literature, particularly with regard to implementation and replicability. Method Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched for material from 2001 to 2019, with diverse search terms capturing the concept of ""integrated"" or ""one-stop shop"" youth mental health services. Title/abstract and full text review were conducted, as well as additional focused searching. After screening 4891 texts at the title/abstract level and 496 at the full-text level, 110 documents were included for data extraction. Results Several integrated care hub models for youth mental health services and related frameworks were identified internationally, largely in high-income countries. Common principles included an emphasis on rapid access to care and early intervention, youth and family engagement, youth-friendly settings and services, evidence-informed approaches, and partnerships and collaboration. Program characteristics also revealed similarities (e.g., providing evidence-informed or evidence-based services in youth-friendly spaces), with some differences (e.g., care coordination methods, types of service providers), potentially attributable to lack of available information about key ingredients. Outcome research was limited, with few rigorous evaluations of youth outcomes. Moreover, sufficient information for replication, community evaluation of feasibility or actual implementation was rarely provided. Conclusion Internationally, integrated youth service hubs were found to share common key principles, while providing comprehensive services to youth with mental health difficulties. There is a great need for common language and measurement framework to facilitate replication, rigorous evaluation of outcomes, knowledge exchange, and dissemination of findings.","Settipani, Cara A; Hawke, Lisa D; Cleverley, Kristin; Chaim, Gloria; Cheung, Amy; Mehra, Kamna; Rice, Maureen; Szatmari, Peter; Henderson, Joanna",International journal of mental health systems,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-019-0306-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367230/,63

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective chart review was performed on LESS urologic procedures from November 2009 through March 2013. A total of 44 patients underwent 54 procedures including: nephrectomy (23), orchiopexy (14), varicocelectomy (9), orchiectomy (2), urachal cyst excision (3), and antegrade continence enema (3) (ACE). RESULTS Median patient age was 6.9 years old. Estimated blood loss (EBL), ranged from less than 5cc to 47cc for a bilateral nephrectomy. Operative time varied from 56 mins for varicocelectomy to a median of 360 minutes for a bilateral nephroureterectomy. Incision length ranged between 2 and 2.5cm. In our initial experience we used a commercial port. However, as we progressed, we were able to perform the majority of our procedures via adjacent fascial punctures for instrumentation at the single incision site. One patient did require conversion to an open procedure as a result of bleeding. Three complications were noted (6.8%), with two Clavien Grade 3b complications. Two patients required additional procedures at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The use of LESS applies to many pediatric urologic procedures, ideally for ablative procedures or simple reconstructive efforts.

The guideline panel consisted of 24 international experts in the use of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and automated insulin dosing (AID) systems representing adult endocrinology, pediatric endocrinology, obstetrics and gynecology, advanced practice nursing, diabetes care and education, clinical chemistry, bioengineering, and product liability law. The panelists reviewed the medical literature pertaining to five topics: (1) continuation of home CGMs after hospitalization, (2) initiation of CGMs in the hospital, (3) continuation of AID systems in the hospital, (4) logistics and hands-on care of hospitalized patients using CGMs and AID systems, and (5) data management of CGMs and AID systems in the hospital. The panelists then developed three types of recommendations for each topic, including clinical practice (to use the technology optimally), research (to improve the safety and effectiveness of the technology), and hospital policies (to build an environment for facilitating use of these devices) for each of the five topics. The panelists voted on 78 proposed recommendations. Based on the panel vote, 77 recommendations were classified as either strong or mild. One recommendation failed to reach consensus. Additional research is needed on CGMs and AID systems in the hospital setting regarding device accuracy, practices for deployment, data management, and achievable outcomes. This guideline is intended to support these technologies for the management of hospitalized patients with diabetes.","Galindo, Rodolfo J; Umpierrez, Guillermo E; Rushakoff, Robert J; Basu, Ananda; Lohnes, Suzanne; Nichols, James H; Spanakis, Elias K; Espinoza, Juan; Palermo, Nadine E; Awadjie, Dessa Garnett; Bak, Leigh; Buckingham, Bruce; Cook, Curtiss B; Freckmann, Guido; Heinemann, Lutz; Hovorka, Roman; Mathioudakis, Nestoras; Newman, Tonya; O'Neal, David N; Rickert, Michaela; Sacks, David B; Seley, Jane Jeffrie; Wallia, Amisha; Shang, Trisha; Zhang, Jennifer Y; Han, Julia; Klonoff, David C",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296820954163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985262/,63

This study evaluated a new surveillance pathway entailing multimodal imaging reviewed by trained ophthalmic graders and compared it with the current standard care (face-to-face evaluation by an ophthalmologist). METHODS Cost analysis of the new ophthalmic grader pathway, compared with the standard of care, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, based on evidence from the Effectiveness of Multimodal imaging for the Evaluation of Retinal oedema And new vesseLs in Diabetic retinopathy study. Resource use data were prospectively obtained including times to undertake each procedure. Effectiveness was assessed in terms of sensitivity and specificity of referral decisions in the grader pathway. Costs (SDs) were analysed per 100 patients separately for DMO and PDR at 2018/2019 costs. RESULTS For DMO, where sensitivity was very high (97%), the cost difference (savings) for the grader's pathway would be £1390 per 100 patients. For PDR, the cost would be reduced by £461 for seven-field Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) images and by £1889 for ultrawide field images, per 100 patients. Ultrawide images required less time to be obtained and read than seven-field ETDRS. The real savings would be in ophthalmologist time, which could be then redirected to the evaluation of people at high risk of visual loss. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance of people with previously successfully treated DMO and PDR by trained ophthalmic graders can achieve satisfactory results and release ophthalmologist time.

78709,Anterior versus posterolateral approach for total laparoscopic splenectomy: a comparative study.,2013,"BACKGROUND With the development of prosthetic mesh and tension free techniques, the recurrence rate following inguinal hernia repair has been reduced, and hernia outcomes research should focus on post-operative quality of life and potential complications. STUDY DESIGN A novel hernia quality of life assessment instrument, HERQL, was developed. The HERQL questionnaire comprises a 4-item summative pain score measuring pain and discomfort resulting from various strenuous activities. Symptomatic and functional domains, as well as post-operative satisfaction are evaluated as well. RESULTS A total of 386 HERQL surveys were completed by 183 patients with inguinal hernias. Internal consistency reliability of the summative pain score was satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85. Criterion validity was examined by concomitant assessment of the pain/discomfort and health impact subscales of the EQ-5D questionnaire, with substantial to moderate correlations. Pre-operative patients reported more severe hernia protrusion, more pain during mild to heavy exercise, and worse activity restriction and health impairment than the follow-up patients, indicating clinical validity. The conceptual structure of the HERQL demostrated the causal relationship between the formative symptomatic subscales and the reflective functional status indicators. Repeated measurement of the summative pain scores revealed an estimated time effect of -1.63, which was the rate of change in the summative pain score across the pre-operative, immediately post-operative, and follow-up 3-month periods suggesting the clinical responsiveness of the HERQL. CONCLUSIONS This study will facilitate inguinal hernia outcomes research and enhance the quality of care for this common disease by providing a validated HERQL instrument with enhanced sensitivity.","Huang, Chi-Cheng; Tai, Feng-Chuan; Chou, Tzung-Hsin; Lien, Heng-Hui; Jeng, Jaan-Yeh; Ho, Thien-Fiew; Huang, Ching-Shui",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28817703/,63
79309,"Evolutionary biology in biodiversity science, conservation, and policy: a call to action.",2010,"Extinction learning and recovery effects are known to be essential learning mechanisms. We investigated whether spontaneous recovery effects transfer to skill acquisition and play a role in the context of widely used but also criticized German orthography instruction methods that implement a prolonged phase of phonological spelling without correction. To test our hypothesis in a controlled manner, in the current experimental study, adult participants learned how to spell an artificial vocabulary with the help of a phonological spelling instruction method that emulates the criticized German orthography instruction methods. We compared participants (148 University students) who did not receive correction in the initial learning phase (delayed correction) with participants who received correction from the beginning (immediate correction). Although the incorrect spellings which were practiced in the initial learning phase (acquisition phase) were extinguished in the subsequent learning phase (extinction phase), the erroneous spellings recovered after a break of 24 hr in the delayed correction condition. The results indicate that learning with methods that emphasize phonological spelling, without correction in the initial learning phase, can lead to spontaneous recovery of initially learned incorrect spellings after the incorrect spellings have seemingly been extinguished.

We examined the association between acute and chronic kidney disease with clinical outcomes in 372 patients with coronavirus disease-19 admitted to four regional intensive care units between 10 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. A total of 216 (58%) patients presented with COVID-19 and renal impairment. Acute kidney injury and/or chronic kidney disease was associated with greater in-hospital mortality compared with patients with preserved renal function (107/216 patients (50%) (95%CI 44-57) vs. 32/156 (21%) (95%CI 15-28), respectively; p < 0.001, relative risk 2.4 (95%CI 1.7-3.4)). Mortality was greatest in patients with renal transplants (6/7 patients (86%) (95%CI 47-100)). Mortality rates increased in patients with worsening renal injury according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes classification: stage 0 mortality 33/157 patients (21%) (95%CI 15-28) vs. stages 1-3 mortality 91/186 patients (49%) (95%CI 42-56); p < 0.001, relative risk 2.3 (95%CI 1.7-3.3).

One-fifth of survivors who required renal replacement therapy acutely in intensive care continued to require renal support following discharge. Our data demonstrate that renal impairment in patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 is common and is associated with a high mortality and requirement for on-going renal support after discharge from critical care.

Objective To determine the susceptibility of the skin to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the expression of viral entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in this organ. Method A comprehensive analysis of human tissue gene expression databases was carried out looking for the presence of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes in the skin. mRNA expression of these genes in skin-derived human cell lines was also assessed. Results The analyses showed high co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney, but not in the skin. Only the human immortalized keratinocyte HaCaT cell line expressed detectable levels of ACE2, and no cell line originating in the skin expressed TMPRSS2. Conclusions Our results suggest that cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 cannot be directly attributed to the virus. It is possible that cutaneous blood vessels endothelial damage, as well as the effect of circulating inflammatory mediators produced in response to the virus, are the cause of skin involvement.","Garduño-Soto, Myriam; Choreño-Parra, José A",Gaceta medica de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/gmm.20000308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831324/,63

The objective of this study is to assess the anxiety, depression levels, and psychological resilience of physicians working during the Covid-19 outbreak and to evaluate the related factors that are associated with their psychological resilience. METHODS The sample of this descriptive study was composed of medical doctors and dentists. The data was obtained online between April 13-23, 2020 through a survey prepared by the researchers. In addition, a questionnaire about the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, the Psychological Resilience Scale and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD-A/HAD-D) was given. RESULTS The average age of the 671 participants was 44.0±9.0 years. Psychological resilience scores were significantly higher in those who had children, who had worked for 15 years or more, and who had received training about COVID-19 (p<0.05). Depression scores were higher among women and in those who reported having a chronic disease, whose workload increased after the outbreak, and who had physical contact with COVID-positive patients. The anxiety scores were also higher among women and in those whose workload had increased and who had contact with COVID-positive patients (p<0.05). The physicians with scores below the cut-off point on the HAD-D/HAD-A had significantly higher scores on the Psychological Resilience Scale (p<0.05). DISCUSSION Depression and anxiety levels were found to be significantly lower in physicians with greater psychological resilience. Psychological and social support of all health care workers, especially physicians, is important in the struggle with the pandemic. It is thought that determining the variables related to psychological resilience in health care workers will be a guide for psychosocial services.","Arslan, Hatice Nilden; Karabekiroglu, Aytul; Terzi, Ozlem; Dundar, Cihad",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1874166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412973/,63

81096,Constitutively active glutaminase variants provide insights into the activation mechanism of anthranilate synthase.,2012,"OBJECTIVES T1 mapping (T1-map) and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) techniques have been introduced for the early detection of interstitial myocardial fibrosis and deformation abnormalities. We sought to demonstrate that T1-map and CMR-FT may identify the presence of subclinical myocardial structural changes in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). METHODS Consecutive MVP patients with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and comparative matched healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled and underwent CMR-FT analysis to calculate 2D global and segmental circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) and T1-map to determine global and segmental native T1 (nT1) values. RESULTS Seventy-three MVP patients (mean age, 57 ± 13 years old; male, 76%; regurgitant volume, 57 ± 21 mL) and 42 matched control subjects (mean age, 56 ± 18 years; male, 74%) were included. MVP patients showed a lower global CS (- 16.3 ± 3.4% vs. - 17.8 ± 1.9%, p = 0.020) and longer global nT1 (1124.9 ± 97.7 ms vs. 1007.4 ± 26.1 ms, p < 0.001) as compared to controls. Moreover, MVP patients showed lower RS and CS in basal (21.6 ± 12.3% vs. 27.6 ± 8.9%, p = 0.008, and - 13.0 ± 6.7% vs. - 14.9 ± 4.1%, p = 0.013) and mid-inferolateral (20.6 ± 10.7% vs. 28.4 ± 8.7%, p < 0.001, and - 12.8 ± 6.3% vs. - 16.5 ± 4.0%, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Similarly, MVP patients showed longer nT1 values in basal (1080 ± 68 ms vs. 1043 ± 43 ms, p < 0.001) and mid-inferolateral (1080 ± 77 ms vs. 1034 ± 37 ms, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Of note, nT1 values were significantly correlated with CS (r, 0.36; p < 0.001) and RS (r, 0.37; p < 0.001) but not with regurgitant volume. CONCLUSIONS T1-map and CMR-FT identify subclinical left ventricle tissue changes in patients with MVP. Further studies are required to correlate these subclinical tissue changes with the outcome. KEY POINTS • T1 mapping (T1-map) and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) techniques have been introduced for the early detection of interstitial myocardial fibrosis and deformation abnormalities. • In MVP patients, we demonstrated a longer global nT1 with associated reduced global circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) as compared to control subjects. • Among MVP patients, the mid-basal left ventricle inferolateral wall showed longer nT1 with reduced CS and RS as compared to other myocardial segments. Further studies are required to correlate these subclinical tissue changes with the outcome.","Guglielmo, Marco; Fusini, Laura; Muscogiuri, Giuseppe; Baessato, Francesca; Loffreno, Antonella; Cavaliere, Annachiara; Rizzon, Giulia; Baggiano, Andrea; Rabbat, Mark G; Muratori, Manuela; Tamborini, Gloria; Danza, Ludovica M L; Del Torto, Alberico; Tonet, Elisabetta; Viani, Giacomo; Mushtaq, Saima; Conte, Edoardo; Bonalumi, Giorgia; Gripari, Paola; Zanobini, Marco; Andreini, Daniele; Alamanni, Francesco; Pepi, Mauro; Guaricci, Andrea I; Pontone, Gianluca",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07140-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803414/,63

METHODS In a cross-sectional, observational study all consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at the central referral center of these patients in northeast of Iran were included. Ocular examinations (external and slit) were randomly performed for the patients who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and six COVID wards of the hospital. Moreover, Chart records and serum chemistry results were collected. RESULTS A total of 142 patients with the mean age of 62.6 ± 15 years (range: 23-96 years) and almost equal gender distribution (male: N = 77, 54.2%) were included in the study. During the initial external examination by the ophthalmologist, 44 (31%) patients were found to have conjunctival hyperemia and 22 (15.5%) patients had chemosis. Consecutive slit examination showed 41 (28.9%) conjunctival hyperemia, 22 (15.5%) chemosis, 11 (7.7%) cataract, and 9 (6.3%) diabetic retinopathy. The patients with at least one ocular manifestation had significantly higher blood urea levels at the time of admission compared to those with no obvious ocular involvement (median: 41.5, IQR: 28-66.3 vs. median: 33, IQR: 23.8-51.8, P = .023). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the total white blood cell count, lymphocyte percent, neutrophil count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and blood urea level between patients with positive and negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 virus. None of the patients reported ocular symptoms prior to systemic involvement. The proportion of patients with at least one ocular manifestation was significantly higher in those admitted in the ICU compared to the non-ICU wards. wards. While conjunctival hyperemia was the most prevalent ocular finding in all patients, chemosis was the most common ocular manifestation in ICU admitted patients. CONCLUSION Ocular manifestation was observed in more than half of our COVID-19 patients. Hence, it seems important to involve ophthalmologist in the diagnosis and management of these patients.","Abrishami, Mojtaba; Tohidinezhad, Fariba; Daneshvar, Ramin; Omidtabrizi, Arash; Amini, Mahnaz; Sedaghat, Alireza; Amini, Shahram; Reihani, Hamidreza; Allahyari, Abolghasem; Seddigh-Shamsi, Mohsen; Tayyebi, Mohammad; Naderi, Hamidreza; Bojdy, Amin; Khodashahi, Rozita; Eslami, Saeid",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2020.1773868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32569494/,63
83017,Effectiveness of a novel immunogenic nanoparticle platform for Toxoplasma peptide vaccine in HLA transgenic mice.,2014,"BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics and histologic remodeling of crosslinked (Peri-Guard, Permacol) and non-crosslinked (AlloDerm, Veritas) biologic meshes over a 12 month period using a porcine model of incisional hernia repair. STUDY DESIGN Bilateral incisional hernias were created in 48 Yucatan minipigs and repaired after 21 days using an underlay technique. Samples were harvested at 1, 6, and 12 months and analyzed for biomechanical and histologic properties. The same biomechanical tests were conducted with de novo (time 0) meshes as well as samples of native abdominal wall. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using 1-way analysis of variance with a Fisher's least significant difference post-test. RESULTS All repair sites demonstrated similar tensile strengths at 1, 6, and 12 months and no significant differences were observed between mesh materials (p > 0.05 in all cases). The strength of the native porcine abdominal wall was not augmented by the presence of the mesh at any of the time points, regardless of de novo tensile strength of the mesh. Histologically, non-crosslinked materials showed earlier cell infiltration (p < 0.01), extracellular matrix deposition (p < 0.02), scaffold degradation (p < 0.05), and neovascularization (p < 0.02) compared with crosslinked materials. However, by 12 months, crosslinked materials showed similar results compared with the non-crosslinked materials for many of the features evaluated. CONCLUSIONS The tensile strengths of sites repaired with biologic mesh were not impacted by very high de novo tensile strength/stiffness or mesh-specific variables such as crosslinking. Although crosslinking distinguishes biologic meshes in the short-term for histologic features, such as cellular infiltration and neovascularization, many differences diminish during longer periods of time. Characteristics other than crosslinking, such as tissue type and processing conditions, are likely responsible for these differences.","Deeken, Corey R; Melman, Lora; Jenkins, Eric D; Greco, Suellen C; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435917/,63

We review the main results of these studies and how they inform stroke patient management going forward. The main take home points for neurologists are (1) intra-arterial thrombectomy is a potently effective treatment and should be offered to patients who have documented occlusion in the distal internal carotid or the proximal middle cerebral artery, have a relatively normal noncontrast head computed tomographic scan, severe neurological deficit, and can have intra-arterial thrombectomy within 6 hours of last seen normal; (2) benefits are clear in patients receiving r-tPA before intra-arterial thrombectomy; r-tPA should not be withheld if the patient meets criteria, and benefit in patients who do not receive r-tPA or have r-tPA exclusions requires further study; and (3) these favorable results occur when intra-arterial thrombectomy is performed in an endovascular stroke center by a coordinated multidisciplinary team that extends from the prehospital stage to the endovascular suite, minimizes time to recanalization, uses stent-retriever devices, and avoids general anesthesia. In conclusion, stroke teams, including practicing neurologists caring for patients with stroke should now provide the option for intra-arterial thrombectomy for a subset of patients with acute stroke.","Grotta, James C; Hacke, Werner",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.008384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25944328/,63
83475,Meticulous surgical technique cannot be replaced by cholangiography.,2020-05-17,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to assess the adequacy of current surgical residency and gastroenterology (GI) fellowship flexible endoscopy training as measured by performance on the FES examination. METHODS Fifth-year general surgery residents and GI fellows across six institutions were invited to participate. All general surgery residents had met ACGME/ABS case volume requirements as well as additional institution-specific requirements for endoscopy. All participants completed FES testing at the end of their respective academic year. Procedure volumes were obtained from ACGME case logs. Curricular components for each specialty and institution were recorded. RESULTS Forty-eight (28 surgery and 20 GI) trainees completed the examination. Average case numbers for residents were 76 ± 26 colonoscopies and 45 ± 12 EGDs. Among GI fellows, PGY4 s (N = 10) reported 99 ± 64 colonoscopies and 147 ± 79 EGDs. PGY5 s (N = 3) reported 462 ± 307 colonoscopies and 411 ± 260 EGDs. PGY6 GI fellows (N = 7) reported 515 ± 111 colonoscopies and 418 ± 146 EGDs. The overall pass rate for all participants was 75 %, with 68 % of residents and 85 % of fellows passing both the cognitive and skills components. For surgery residents, pass rates were 75 % for manual skills and 85.7 % for cognitive. On the skills examination, Task 2 (loop reduction) was associated with the lowest performance. Skills scores correlated with both colonoscopy (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) and EGD experience (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristics curves were examined among the resident cohort. The minimum number of total cases associated with passing the FES skills component was 103. Significant variability existed in curricular components across institutions.

Moreover, there are many applications in which we have found it very difficult to directly obtain the expected dynamic load which acts on a structure. Some traditional indirect inverse analysis techniques are developed for load identification by measured responses. These inverse problems about load identification mentioned above are complex and inherently ill-posed, while regularization methods can deal with this kind of problem. However, most of regularization methods are only limited to solve the pure mathematical numerical examples without application to practical engineering problems, and they should be improved to exclude jamming of noises in engineering. In order to solve these problems, a new regularization method is presented in this article to investigate the minimum of this minimization problem, and applied to reconstructing multi-source dynamic loads on the frame structure of hydrogenerator by its steady-state responses. Numerical simulations of the inverse analysis show that the proposed method is more effective and accurate than the famous Tikhonov regularization method. The proposed regularization method in this article is powerful in solving the dyanmic load identification problems.","Wang, Linjun; Huang, Yang; Xie, Youxiang; Du, Yixian",Science progress,https://doi.org/10.1177/0036850420931283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609575/,63

We report a case of solitary parenchymal splenic recurrence of ETOC, which developed 50 months after the initial treatment. A 66-year-old woman underwent laparotomic primary cytoreduction in 2008. After platinum-based chemotherapy, she developed recurrences; thus, she underwent secondary and tertiary cytoreduction in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In April 2013, CT scan documented a solitary parenchymal splenic lesion and it was confirmed by FDG PET/CT. She underwent quaternary cytoreduction by laparoscopic splenectomy. Histopathological evaluation revealed metastatic parenchymal disease consistent with recurrent ETOC. She was alive and disease-free for ten months since splenectomy. In literature there are 35 cases of isolated spleen parenchymal metastasis of ETOC and our report is the first case of laparoscopic splenectomy in the setting of quaternary cytoreduction. Laparoscopic splenectomy as quaternary cytoreduction is safe and feasible and could be congruent to the well-established experiences already reported for the primary, secondary or even tertiary cytoreduction where the absence of residual disease has been translated in a significant survival benefit.","Sorbi, Flavia; Prosperi, Paolo; Villanucci, Alessandro; Berti, Valentina; Sisti, Giovanni; Fambrini, Massimiliano",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000366476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25677585/,63

We sought to describe the natural course of alcohol and cannabis co-use from age 12 to 17 and 20 to 31 and to describe frequent (i.e., ≥ once/month) binge drinking (i.e., ≥ 5 drinks/occasion) and cannabis use from age 20 to 31. METHOD Data were drawn from two longitudinal studies conducted in Montréal, Canada: AdoQuest (n = 1,852) and the Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) study (n = 1,293). Complete data on alcohol and cannabis were available for 620 12-17-year-olds (58% female) followed from 2005 to 2011 in AdoQuest, and 673 20-31-year-olds (56% female) followed from 2007 to 2020 in NDIT. We reported proportions of co-use, exclusive drinking (""drinking""), exclusive cannabis use (""cannabis use""), frequent co-use, frequent binge drinking, and frequent cannabis use by age and sex. RESULTS Co-use rose from 2% at age 12-13 to 23% at age 17, was stable at 44% at age 20 and 24, and then decreased to 37% at age 31. Drinking rose from 20% to 51%, and cannabis use was consistently rare (< 2%). During young adulthood, frequent co-use declined from 21% at age 20 to 12% at age 31, and frequent binge drinking declined from 29% at age 20 to 22% at age 31. Frequent cannabis use increased from 6% at age 20 to 11% at age 31. CONCLUSIONS Alcohol and cannabis use should be studied as time-varying behaviors. Co-use patterns should be monitored over time in this population.

Time-varying EEG is considered an appropriate technique to explore brain regions and related activities, and nonlinear methods may extract the irregularities in the EEG signal and gather more expanded information. Therefore, we studied Shannon Entropy in EEG raw data obtained from normal subjects and compared it to data from chronic tinnitus sufferers before and after an intervention. METHODS From the qEEG database of Iran University of Medical Sciences, the School of Rehabilitation Sciences, we have selected 23 healthy and 24 chronic tinnitus subjects. Nineteen subjects of the tinnitus group had benefited from a complete course of sound therapy (binaural beat for a month). QEEGs were measured with a 27-channel EEG amplifier in the sitting and eye-closed position for 3 minutes. Shannon entropy was investigated for all electrodes separately and compared among groups using a one-way ANOVA statistical test. FINDINGS Our results revealed a significant difference between healthy and tinnitus subjects (p<0.05). Post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni test showed increased entropy in the tinnitus group for all electrodes (p<0.05) at low frequencies and most electrodes at mid frequencies. In addition, after the intervention, paired t-test showed a reduction in entropy to somehow above normal control levels for all electrodes at low-frequencies. Such results were accompanying clinical improvement after the intervention. CONCLUSION The increased entropy in tinnitus patients might reflect the chaotic behavior of the brain. Nonlinear methods in EEG studies (Entropy) could be of great importance in understanding tinnitus neurophysiology and might potentially be a suitable criterion for clinical practice.","Sadeghijam, Maryam; Talebian, Saeed; Mohsen, Samer; Akbari, Mehdi; Pourbakht, Akram",Neuroscience letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352341/,63

Twenty years ago, all renal tumors, regardless of size were treated with radical nephrectomy (RN). Elective partial nephrectomy (PN) has emerged as the treatment of choice for small renal tumors. The basis of this paradigm shift is three major factors: (1) cancer specific survival is equivalent for T1 tumors (7 cm or less) whether treated by PN or RN; (2) approximately 45% of renal tumors have indolent or benign pathology; and (3) PN prevents or delays the onset of chronic kidney disease, a condition associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although PN can be technically demanding and associated with potential complications of bleeding, infection, and urinary fistula, the patient derived benefits of this operation far outweigh the risks.

The Comfort Ability Program for Sickle Cell Pain (CAP for SCP) introduces psychological and biobehavioral pain management strategies to children and adolescents with SCD. This study aimed to pilot the implementation of the CAP for SCP in a group setting to children and adolescents hospitalized for SCD pain examining feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness on improving pain knowledge and coping efficacy. METHOD Adaptation of CAP for SCP into a three-session group format was guided by four phases of the Dynamic Adaptation Process model: Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment. Youth with SCD (n = 57) hospitalized for pain participated in at least one session and completed self-report of knowledge of pain management skills, pain coping efficacy, and treatment acceptance. Completion rates of sessions and qualitative feedback were gathered to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. RESULTS Feasibility of conducting inpatient group sessions was suboptimal; however, patients and medical providers reported moderate to high levels of treatment acceptance. Patients also reported significant improvements in knowledge of pain management skills following session 1. CONCLUSIONS CAP for SCP is a patient-centered first-line psychoeducational intervention that can be integrated into clinical practice settings to introduce youth to cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies to support SCD pain management.","Sil, Soumitri; Lee, Jennifer L; Klosky, James; Vaz, Angela; Mee, Laura; Cochran, Shavontia; Thompson, Beth; Coakley, Rachael",Pediatric blood & cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.29013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33742546/,63

METHODS We collected data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of all incident antidepressant use. We described the incidence, prevalence, and therapeutic indications of antidepressant use. We tested the trends by using logistic regression analyses with adjustment for age and sex. RESULTS Overall, the prevalence of antidepressant use per 1000 persons increased from 32.1 in 2000 to 46.3 in 2009; however, the incidence per 1000 persons declined from 20.8 in 2000 to 16.5 in 2009. For antidepressant classes, the prescriptions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other new agents increased during the study periods; however, the use of tricyclic antidepressants, trazodone, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors declined. For therapeutic indications, we found increasing trends of antidepressant use for sleep and adjustment disorders; however, the rates of antidepressant use for mood disorder, anxiety disorders, and non-psychiatric conditions decreased. CONCLUSIONS Regarding the new use of antidepressants in Taiwan between 2000 and 2009, we found that the decreased incidence of antidepressant use might be attributed mainly to the decreased use of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Decreased use among middle-aged and older persons and fewer antidepressant prescriptions for non-psychiatric conditions were also noted.","Wu, Chi-Shin; Shau, Wen-Yi; Chan, Hung-Yu; Lee, Yen-Chieh; Lai, Yun-Ju; Lai, Mei-Shu",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.3255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511574/,63

We compared the differences between use of electrocautery and LigaSure™ Small Jaw in patients with breast cancer who underwent SSM. METHODS Between January 2012 and December 2015, 81 patients with breast cancer who underwent SSM were selected and were divided into the electrocautery group and the LigaSure™ Small Jaw group based on the devices that were used. Clinicopathological characteristics, body mass index, operative time, and weight of removed breast were obtained from medical records. Total amount and days of drain use, until removal, and postoperative skin necrosis, requiring debridement, were also analyzed. RESULTS The study population consisted of 50 patients in the electrocautery group and 31 in the LigaSure™ Small Jaw group. The latter group has significantly shorter operative time (117.5 ± 16.9 vs. 104.0 ± 23.6 min, P = 0.004). The mean total volume of drainage was less (805 ± 278 vs. 694 ± 131 mL, P = 0.017) and mean duration of drainage was also significantly shorter in the LigaSure™ Small Jaw group (11.3 ± 2.5 vs. 10.1 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS The use of LigaSure™ Small Jaw during skin-sparing mastectomy shortened the operative time and duration of drainage and reduced the total volume of drainage.","Chang, Young Woo; Kim, Hwan Soo; Jung, Seung Pil; Woo, Sang Uk; Lee, Jae Bok; Bae, Jeoung Won; Son, Gil Soo",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-017-1199-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709454/,63

ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is a bad predictor of prognosis. Sorafenib inhibited EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after RFA. Whether IF1 promotes the EMT and angiogenesis of HCC and attenuates the effect of sorafenib after insufficient RFA is investigated. In this study, higher expression of IF1 was found in residual tumor after insufficient RFA. Hep3B or Huh7 cells after insufficient RFA were designated as Hep3B-H or Huh7-H cells in vitro. Hep3B-H or Huh7-H cells exhibited enhanced capacities of colony formation, migration, and increased expression of EMT associated markers and IF1 compared with Hep3B or Huh7 cells. IF1 knockdown in Hep3B-H or Huh7-H cells decreased the colony formation and migratory capacity, and IF1 overexpression in Hep3B or Huh7 cells increased these capacities. IF1 in HCC cells directly and indirectly affected angiogenesis of TAECs after insufficient RFA. IF1 promoted HCC cells growth and metastasis after insufficient RFA. IF1 increased HCC cells resistance after insufficient RFA to sorafenib. Higher IF1 expression indicated poor disease survival in HCC patients after sorafenib therapy. NF-κB activation induced by IF1 attenuated the effect of sorafenib on HCC cells after insufficient RFA. Our results demonstrated that IF1 promotes the EMT and angiogenesis, and attenuates HCC cell sensitivity to sorafenib after insufficient RFA through NF-κB signal pathway.","Kong, Jian; Yao, Changyu; Ding, Xuemei; Dong, Shuying; Wu, Shilun; Sun, Wenbing; Zheng, Lemin",Frontiers in oncology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32670888/,63

RESULTS During the study period, robotic hepaticojejunostomy for advanced malignant biliary obstruction was completed successfully in nine patients. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and double (hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy) bypass were performed in five and four patients, respectively. The mean operating time was 212.8 minutes. The mean blood loss was 38.7 mL. The overall complication rate was 22.2%. Bile leak complication occurred in one patient only. There was no procedure-related mortality. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 13.3 days. Five patients received palliative systemic chemotherapy after bypass surgery. The mean survival time was 11.1 months. During follow up, only three patients with cholangiocarcinoma had recurrent biliary obstruction after end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy due to tumor progression, and needed percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage.

Although many guidelines have been proposed to avoid infection from COVID-19 and to promote the use of telerehabilitation, there is still no clear answer for the current scenario and strategies of therapists' practice during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Occupational Therapists' (OTs) practice, the use of telerehabilitation strategies by OTs, and their employment and mental health. Also, this study aimed to explore the OTs perspective on the role of telerehabilitation during this pandemic lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS Online cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS 114 OTs completed the survey. The results of this study showed that 52.8% of therapists had stress and anxiety due to COVID-19 lockdown. We found that 60.7% of OTs (n=65) used telerehabilitation, versus 36.1% (n=39) before the lockdown. Telerehabilitation approaches were mostly implemented during this lockdown for children with autistic problems (66.6%), stroke (12.9%), cerebral palsy (6.4%), learning disabilities (9.6%), Parkinson's diseases (1.6%), and other medical conditions (2.8%). 10% of therapists reported that they lost their job, and 76% reported that this lockdown affected their income negatively. Overall, 87.8% of therapists reported that mobile technology was very useful to overcome the stress due to COVID-19 related lockdown, social isolation, and social distancing. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown experiences made us rethink the current approach of therapy services into alternative method (mixed mode) delivery of occupational therapy practice, which is including the combined method of video-based (telerehabilitation) consultation and face to face intervention.","Ganesan, B; Fong, K N K; Meena, S K; Prasad, P; Tong, R K Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202105_25845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002837/,63

Such interactions are crucial for signaling and other cellular processes, but are difficult to detect because of their low to moderate affinities. Here we developed a dedicated approach, proteomic peptide-phage display (ProP-PD), to identify domain-SLiM interactions. Specifically, we generated phage libraries containing all human and viral C-terminal peptides using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. With these libraries we screened the nine PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains of human Densin-180, Erbin, Scribble, and Disks large homolog 1 for peptide ligands. We identified several known and putative interactions potentially relevant to cellular signaling pathways and confirmed interactions between full-length Scribble and the target proteins β-PIX, plakophilin-4, and guanylate cyclase soluble subunit α-2 using colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The affinities of recombinant Scribble PDZ domains and the synthetic peptides representing the C termini of these proteins were in the 1- to 40-μM range. Furthermore, we identified several well-established host-virus protein-protein interactions, and confirmed that PDZ domains of Scribble interact with the C terminus of Tax-1 of human T-cell leukemia virus with micromolar affinity. Previously unknown putative viral protein ligands for the PDZ domains of Scribble and Erbin were also identified. Thus, we demonstrate that our ProP-PD libraries are useful tools for probing PDZ domain interactions. The method can be extended to interrogate all potential eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral SLiMs and we suggest it will be a highly valuable approach for studying cellular and pathogen-host protein-protein interactions.","Ivarsson, Ylva; Arnold, Roland; McLaughlin, Megan; Nim, Satra; Joshi, Rakesh; Ray, Debashish; Liu, Bernard; Teyra, Joan; Pawson, Tony; Moffat, Jason; Li, Shawn Shun-Cheng; Sidhu, Sachdev S; Kim, Philip M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1312296111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550280/,63

However, the precise role of m6A methylation in hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) is still unknown. Here, we observed that HPC treatment protected H9c2 cells against H2O2-induced injury, upregulated the m6A level in the total RNA and the expression of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), methyltransferase like 14 (METTL14), and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19. Either knockdown of METTL3 or METTL14 notably reversed the HPC-induced enhancement of cell viability, anti-apoptosis ability, and H19 expression. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) indicated that knockdown of METTL3 or METTL14 decreased m6A level in the lncRNA H19. Gain-of-function assay demonstrated that H19 overexpression could partially rescue the decreased protection mediated by METTL3 or METTL14 knockdown in HPC-treated H9c2 cells. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay showed that METTL3 and METTL14 could directly bind with H19. Our study identified a novel pattern of posttranscriptional regulation in HPC treatment. Since METTL3, METTL14, and lncRNA H19 were involved in HPC protection, they could be considered as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HPC-derived cardiac rehabilitation and therapeutic approaches.","Su, Yamin; Xu, Rongfeng; Zhang, Rui; Qu, Yangyang; Zuo, Wenjie; Ji, Zhenjun; Geng, Haihua; Pan, Min; Ma, Genshan",Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1093/abbs/gmaa130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197240/,63

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. SETTING Pediatric ICU in an academic tertiary care center, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. PATIENTS One hundred seven patients with non-cyanotic congenital heart defects between 6 weeks and 6 years of age. One hundred three patients underwent corrective surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass. INTERVENTIONS Prior to surgery patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups with specific RBC transfusion thresholds: Hb 10.8 g/dl (6.8 mmol/l) and Hb 8.0 g/dl (5.0 mmol/l). MEASUREMENTS Length of stay in hospital (primary outcome), length of stay in PICU, duration of ventilation (secondary outcome), incidence of adverse events and complications related to randomization (intention to treat analysis). RESULTS In the restrictive transfusion group, mean volume of transfused RBC was 186 (±70) ml per patient and in the liberal transfusion group 258 (±87) ml per patient, (95% CI 40.6-104.6), p < 0.001. Length of hospital stay was shorter in patients with a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy: median 8 (IQR 7-11) vs. 9 (IQR 7-14) days, p = 0.047. All other outcome measures and incidence of adverse effects were equal in both RBC transfusion groups. Cost of blood products for the liberal transfusion group was 438.35 (±203.39) vs. 316.27 (±189.96) euros (95% CI 46.61-197.51) per patient in the restrictive transfusion group, p = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS For patients with a non-cyanotic congenital heart defect undergoing elective cardiac surgery, a restrictive RBC transfusion policy (threshold of Hb 8.0 g/dl) during the entire perioperative period is safe, leads to a shorter hospital stay and is less expensive.","de Gast-Bakker, D H; de Wilde, R B P; Hazekamp, M G; Sojak, V; Zwaginga, J J; Wolterbeek, R; de Jonge, E; Gesink-van der Veer, B J",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-013-3085-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23995984/,63

92125,Autumn abstracts.,2021-10-01,"INTRODUCTION The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led to stay-at-home (SAH) orders in Pennsylvania targeted at reducing viral transmission. Limitations in population mobility under SAH have been associated with decreased motor vehicle collisions (MVC) and related injuries, but the impact of these measures on severity of injury remains unknown. The goal of this study is to measure the incidence, severity, and outcomes of MVC-related injuries associated with SAH in Pennsylvania. MATERIALS & METHODS We conducted a retrospective geospatial analysis of MVCs during the early COVID-19 pandemic using a state-wide trauma registry. We compared characteristics of patients with MVC-related injuries admitted to Pennsylvania trauma centers during SAH measures (March 21-July 31, 2020) with those from the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. We also compared incidence of MVCs for each zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) in Pennsylvania for the same time periods using geospatial mapping. RESULTS Of 15,550 trauma patients treated during the SAH measures, 3486 (22.4%) resulted from MVCs. Compared to preceding years, MVC incidence decreased 10% under SAH measures with no change in mortality rate. However, in ZCTA where MVC incidence decreased, there was a 16% increase in MVC injury severity. CONCLUSIONS Stay-at-home orders issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pennsylvania were associated with significant changes in MVC incidence and severity. Identifying such changes may inform resource allocation decisions during future pandemics or SAH events.","Kaufman, Elinore J; Holena, Daniel; Koenig, George; Martin, Niels D; Maish, George O; Moran, Benjamin J; Ratnasekera, Asanthi; Stawicki, Stanislaw P; Timinski, Marie; Brown, Joshua",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/00031348211047466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645324/,63

GOALS-incisional hernia (GOALS-IH) was developed to evaluate performance of laparoscopic incisional hernia repair (LIHR). The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of GOALS-IH during LIHR simulation. GOALS-IH assesses 7 domains with a maximum score of 35. A total of 12 experienced surgeons and 10 novices performed LIHR on the Surgical Abdominal Wall simulator. Performance was assessed by a trained observer and by self-assessment using GOALS-IH, basic GOALS and a visual analog scale (VAS) for overall competence. Both interrater reliability and internal consistency were high (.76 and .95 respectively). Experienced surgeons had higher mean GOALS-IH scores than novices (32.3 ± 2 versus 22.7 ± 5). There was excellent correlation between GOALS-IH and other measures of performance (GOALS r = .93 and VAS r = .93).

Xenopus embryos are large, develop externally, and can be easily manipulated by microinjection or surgical procedures. In addition, fate maps have been established for early Xenopus embryos. Targeted microinjection into the individual blastomere that will eventually give rise to an organ or tissue of interest can be used to selectively overexpress or knock down gene expression within this restricted region, decreasing secondary effects in the rest of the developing embryo. In this protocol, we describe how to utilize established Xenopus fate maps to target the developing Xenopus kidney (the pronephros), through microinjection into specific blastomere of 4- and 8-cell embryos. Injection of lineage tracers allows verification of the specific targeting of the injection. After embryos have developed to stage 38 - 40, whole-mount immunostaining is used to visualize pronephric development, and the contribution by targeted cells to the pronephros can be assessed. The same technique can be adapted to target other tissue types in addition to the pronephros.","DeLay, Bridget D; Krneta-Stankic, Vanja; Miller, Rachel K",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/53799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27168375/,63

Wheezing is a common sign presented by children with respiratory infections. Asthma, bronchiolitis, and bronchitis are common causes of childhood wheezing disease (CWD) and are regarded as overlapping disease spectra. Macrolides are common antimicrobial agents with anti-inflammatory effects. We conducted a comprehensive literature search and a systematic review of studies that investigated the influences of macrolide treatment on CWD. The primary outcomes were the impact of macrolides on hospitalization courses of patients with CWD. Data pertaining to the study population, macrolide treatment, hospital courses, and recurrences were analyzed. Twenty-three studies with a combined study population of 2210 patients were included in the systematic review. Any kind of benefit from macrolide treatment was observed in approximately two-thirds of the studies (15/23). Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis to investigate the influence of macrolides on the length of stay (LOS), duration of oxygen demand (DOD), symptoms and signs of respiratory distress, and re-admission rates. Although the benefits of macrolide treatment were reported in several of the studies, no significant differences in LOS, DOD, symptoms and signs of respiratory distress, or re-admission rates were observed in patients undergoing macrolide treatment. In conclusion, any kind of benefit of macrolide treatment was observed in approximately two-thirds of the studies; however, no obvious benefits of macrolide treatment were observed in the hospitalization courses of children with CWD. The routine use of macrolides to improve the hospitalization course of children with CWD is not suggested.","Lin, Chien-Yu; Yeh, Tzu-Lin; Liu, Shu-Jung; Lin, Hsin-Hui; Cheng, Yu-Jyun; Hung, Hua-His; Tsai, Mu-Chieh; Liu, Jui-Ming; Lei, Wei-Te",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm7110432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423980/,63
93086,Nutritional approaches to slow late finishing pig growth.,2021-01-01,Flavonoids are a class of polyphenols that possess diverse properties. The structure-activity relationship of certain flavonoids and resveratrol with Ribonuclease A (RNase A) have been investigated. The selected flavonoids have a similar skeleton and the positional preferences of the phenolic moieties towards inhibition of the catalytic activity of RNase A have been studied. The results obtained for RNase A inhibition by flavonoids suggest that the planarity of the molecules is necessary for effective inhibitory potency. Agarose gel electrophoresis and precipitation assay experiments along with kinetic studies reveal Ki values for the various flavonoids in the micromolar range. Minor secondary structural changes of RNase A were observed after interaction with the flavonoids. An insight into the specific amino acid involvement in the binding of the substrate using docking studies is also presented. The dipole moment of the flavonoids that depends on the orientation of the hydroxyl groups in the molecule bears direct correlation with the inhibitory potency against RNase A. The direct association of this molecular property with enzyme inhibition can be exploited for the design and development of inhibitors of proteins. This article is protected by copyright.

Chronic pain assessment and treatment involves evaluating not only its biological aspects, but also psychological and sociocultural factors. Beyond neural mechanisms, a patient's perception of chronic pain can be influenced by comorbid mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety; cognitive and affective traits, such as catastrophizing and fear-avoidance; environmental stressors, family relationships, social support, and cultural beliefs. Based on this biopsychosocial model, a multidisciplinary approach to management incorporates pharmacotherapy (opioid, nonopioid, and centrally-acting analgesics, and pain adjuvant medications) with nonpharmacologic physical rehabilitation and psychological and behavioral therapies to address the multifactorial causes of chronic pain, which in turn leads to improvement of physical and psychological function.","McCarberg, Bill H; Stanos, Steven; Williams, David A",The American journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22624694/,63

In the PDUFA VI implementation plan, FDA states that it will continue to explore more structured or quantitative decision analysis approaches, however it restricts their use within the current BRF that is purely qualitative. By contrast, European regulators and researchers have been long exploring the use of quantitative decision analysis approaches for evaluating drug benefit-risk balance. In this paper, we show how quantitative modeling, backed by decision theory, could complement and extend the FDA's BRF to better support the appraisal of evidence and improve decision outcomes. After providing relevant scientific definitions for benefit-risk assessment and describing the FDA and EMA frameworks, we explain the components of and differences between qualitative and quantitative approaches. We present lessons learned from the EMA experience with the use of quantitative modeling and we provide evidence of its benefits, illustrated by a real case study that helped to resolve differences of judgements among EMA regulators.","Angelis, Aris; Phillips, Lawrence D",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32529733/,63
93925,Malaria vaccine achieves striking early success.,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND Sedation and analgesia regimens during targeted temperature management (TTM), after cardiac arrest varies widely, are poorly described in the literature and may have a negative impact on outcome. Since implementing TTM in 2005, we have used moderate-dose sedation and describe our experience with this approach. METHODS In this retrospective review, we included patients treated with TTM for cardiac arrest at our institution for 2008-2012. Patients received TTM if they did not follow verbal commands following cardiac arrest, regardless of place of arrest or rhythm. Utstein-compatible data were prospectively entered into the International Cardiac Arrest Registry, supplemented by review of nursing, pharmacy, and physical therapy records. We report analgesic and sedative medications and doses during the 24 h of active TTM at 33 °C, resource utilization, and important clinical events. RESULTS 166 patients treated with TTM after in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with complete data were included. Overall survival was 42 %, median time to following commands was 3 h after rewarming (-6, 14), time to spontaneous breathing trial was 19 h (5-35), time to extubation was 28 h (9-60), and 59 % of survivors were discharged directly home at 13 (10-20) days. The incidence of seizure was 6 %, septic shock 4 %, and pneumonia 32 %. Four survivors required tracheostomy at 8, 8, 12, and 16 days. CONCLUSIONS A moderate-dose sedation and analgesia regimen was well tolerated and effective during therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest and is an effective alternative to very deep sedation. We recommend more complete description of sedation and analgesia protocols in future studies, including expanded outcome reporting to include variables affected by sedation therapy. Further study is required to define which sedation approach for TTM may be best.","May, Teresa L; Seder, David B; Fraser, Gilles L; Stone, Philip; McCrum, Barbara; Riker, Richard R",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-014-9998-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24962894/,63

We evaluated the cerebral autoregulation in the second half of pregnancy, and compared this with a control group of healthy, fertile non-pregnant women. METHODS In a prospective cohort analysis, cerebral blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (determined by transcranial Doppler), blood pressure (noninvasive arterial volume clamping), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) were simultaneously collected for 7min. The autoregulation index (ARI) was calculated. ARI values of 0 and 9 indicated absent and perfect autoregulation, respectively. ANOVA and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used, with p<0.05 considered significant. RESULTS A total of 76 pregnant and 18 non-pregnant women were included. The ARI did not change during pregnancy, but pregnant women had a significantly higher ARI than non-pregnant controls (ARI 6.7±0.9 vs. 5.3±1.4, p<0.001). This remained significant after adjusting for EtCO2 (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Cerebral autoregulation functionality is enhanced in the second half of pregnancy, when compared to non-pregnant fertile women, even after controlling for EtCO2. The autoregulation does not change with advancing gestational age.","van Veen, Teelkien R; Panerai, Ronney B; Haeri, Sina; van den Berg, Paul P; Zeeman, Gerda G; Belfort, Michael A",Pregnancy hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.preghy.2016.08.242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27939486/,63

We present the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling that characterizes the timecourse of viral load obtained from 2970 patients from two phase 2 clinical trials. The model was used for identification of optimal doses that would result in at least 90% of patients achieving serum drug concentrations that results in 90% of maximum drug effect (IC90) for at least 28 days. The serum IC90 (95% confidence interval) was estimated to be 4.2 (3.2, 4.3) µg/mL for bamlanivimab and 12.6 (9.7, 12.8) µg/mL for etesevimab. Observed clinical trial data confirmed PK and PK/PD model predictions that doses of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1400 mg etesevimab would result in maximum reduction in viral load, with no additional effect seen at higher doses. No dose adjustment is recommended as age, sex, race, baseline viral load and hepatic impairment did not have a significant impact on the PK of the antibodies. Earlier drug administration resulted in greater reductions in viral load, demonstrating the importance of receiving treatment as soon as possible. Relative to placebo, typical reduction in viral load over a 7 day period was estimated to be 80 or 93% (drug administered 4 days or 1 days after the onset of symptoms, respectively), p<0.0001.

We present the first case report of a calcific pancreatitis associated with not only PHPT but a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of a 52 years old woman suffering from mellitus diabetes consulting the emergency rooms for acute pancreatitis with hyperlipasemia and hypercalcemia whom final imaging discovered a pituitary gland adenoma, a left surrenal adenoma, and a parathyroid adenoma, and for the pancreas it reveiled an acute mild pancreatitis with a background of calcifications, no gallstones, no bone or renal abnormalities; and the parathyroidectomy was performed following the minimally invasive selective technique. DISCUSSION Calcemia levels testing routinely performed help discover hyperparathyroidism. The associations of chronic pancreatic inflammation to hyperparathyroidism needs to be studied, even if hypercalcemia is prooven to be a risk factor of pancreatitis; the mechanism behind this association is brievely described. parathyroidectomy is the definitive cure for hyperparathyroidism, the technique advances has shown effective localization of the responsible adenoma and the intraoperative testing of parathormon levels after resection decreasing is a very reliable extemporaneous sign for the success of the procedure. CONCLUSION The endocrine system is synchronized; meaning the injury of one gland should start the search for others. In our case, the first main lead should not have been the acute pancreatitis but her diabetes. In the future we suggest that diabetes primary explorations may need a pancreatic imaging and endocrine explorations even though it could get pricier for the healthcare system, but giving the complications that we could prevent; it is to be considered.","Rahou, F; Miry, A; Mirali, H; Mahmoudi, L; Bennani, A; Bouziane, M",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.10.087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277218/,63

It was first isolated in 1997 from stillborn piglets at a commercial piggery in New South Wales, Australia, where an outbreak of reproductive disease occurred. Neutralizing antibodies to MenPV were detected in various pteropid bat species in Australia and fruit bats were suspected to be the source of the virus responsible for the outbreak in pigs. However, previous attempts to isolate MenPV from various fruit bat species proved fruitless. Here, we report the isolation of MenPV from urine samples of the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, using a combination of improved procedures and newly established bat cell lines. The nucleotide sequence of the bat isolate is 94 % identical to the pig isolate. This finding provides strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that the MenPV outbreak in pigs originated from viruses in bats roosting near the piggery.","Barr, Jennifer A; Smith, Craig; Marsh, Glenn A; Field, Hume; Wang, Lin-Fa",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.045385-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22915696/,63

Prospectively collected data were analyzed retrospectively to ascertain outcomes, complications, and recurrences. Two hundred and twenty-seven operations were performed with 35% of the operations being for recurrent hernias. A self-centering suture technique was used. Median operating time was 55 minutes. There were 8 conversions and median hospital stay was 1 night. There were 52 complications (23%) including 3 postoperative bleeds, 3 mesh infections, and 4 small bowel obstructions. Median postoperative follow-up was 53 months. There were 25 recurrences (11%) being detected, a median of 17 months after initial operation. In this large series, laparoscopic incisional hernia repair is safe and is associated with a short hospital stay. Recurrences after repair remain a concern prompting the development of strategies to try and minimize the likelihood of this occurring.","Sturt, N Julian H; Liao, Christopher C L; Engledow, Alec H; Menzies, Donald; Motson, Roger W","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31820cee0c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21471798/,63

MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten patients with acute (within 72 h) extensively occlusive thrombosis of arteriovenous graft (mean extension = 30.1 (range = 15-45) cm) were treated at our institution with the Indigo System. Of the 10 cases, thrombosis was extended to venous outflow in 7 cases and to both arterial inflow and venous outflow in 3 cases. RESULTS Both anatomic and clinical success were achieved in 8 of the 10 procedures (80.0%). In the 2 cases of technical failure, the patients underwent surgical thrombectomy with the finding of arteriovenous graft exhaustion, which was then replaced. The 6-month primary patency, primary-assisted patency, and secondary patency rates were 37.5% (3/8), 50.0% (4/8), and 62.5% (5/8). We reported 2 complications (one minor and one major adverse event).

In order to solve the challenges posed by SILS cholecystectomy, an increasing number of techniques have been reported with the advent of new surgical instruments and refinements to existing technology. We describe, in this article, two new techniques that utilize existing instrumentations: an access and a retraction technique. METHODS A consecutive series of 23 selected patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis underwent SILS cholecystectomy from April 10, 2009 to August 12, 2009. The overall procedure was similar to SILS cholecystectomy described in the literature. Hovewer, the access technique, with small-size arthroscopy cannules, was used to overcome the technical difficulty resulting from the collision of large-size caps of the laparoscopy trocars, and the retraction technique with a tacker was used to suspend the fundus of the gallbladder without taking the risk of gallbladder perforation. RESULTS All patients were female, and the mean age was 34 years (range, 27-65). The body mass index of all patients was below 30 kg/m(2). The use of arthroscopy cannules provided a wider range of movement, and the retraction of the gallbladder was achieved safely with the tacker. These techniques reduced the operative times considerably. CONCLUSIONS Most of the challenges posed by SILS cholecystectomy can be easily solved with simple technical modifications.","Ertem, Metin; Ozben, Volkan; Yilmaz, Suleyman; Ozveri, Emel",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

99247,Generation of self-organized sensory ganglion organoids and retinal ganglion cells from fibroblasts.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to determine the safety of diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% (w/w) in 45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (TDiclo) for the treatment of knee or hand osteoarthritis in persons aged 75 years or older. METHODS A pooled analysis of safety data from seven multicenter, randomized, blinded, Phase III clinical trials (4-12 weeks' duration) of TDiclo was conducted. The analysis focused on a subset of patients (n = 280) aged 75 years or older with a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee (six trials) or hand (one trial). Patients received one of three topical treatments: TDiclo (n = 138); placebo (2.33% or 4.55% dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 39); or control (45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 103). Treatment groups were compared using Chi-square analysis, Fisher's Exact test, or analysis of variance. RESULTS The most common adverse events involved the skin or subcutaneous tissue, primarily at the application site. The incidence of dry skin was higher in the TDiclo (36.2%; P < 0.0001) and dimethyl sulfoxide control (18.4%; P = 0.0142) groups than in the placebo group (2.6%); the incidence of other skin or subcutaneous tissue adverse events was similar between the groups. Relatively few patients (<18%) experienced gastrointestinal adverse events, and group differences were not detected. In the TDiclo group, constipation (3.6%), diarrhea (3.6%), and nausea (3.6%) were the most common gastrointestinal adverse events. Cardiovascular and renal/ urinary adverse events were rare, and group differences were not detected. There was one case (0.7%) each of hypertension, spider veins, and vasodilation in the TDiclo group. Changes from baseline to the final visit in blood pressure and hepatic/renal enzyme levels were also similar between the groups. CONCLUSION TDiclo appears to be well tolerated for the treatment of osteoarthritis in persons aged 75 years or older.","Roth, Sanford H; Fuller, Philip",Clinical interventions in aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s30884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22791985/,63
100486,Gold nanoparticles decorated bimetallic CuNi-based hollow nanoarchitecture for the enhancement of electrochemical sensing performance of nitrite.,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND Teleradiology has become one of the most important approaches to virtual clinical diagnosis; its importance has only grown during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. In developing countries, asking patients to take photographs of their images using a smartphone can facilitate the process and help keep its costs down. However, the images taken by patients with smartphones often are of poor quality, and there is no regulation or standard instruction about how to use smartphones to take photographs of medical examination images effectively. These problems limit the use of smartphones in remote diagnosis and treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES To formulate a set of guidelines for the most appropriate and effective use of smartphones to capture images (radiographs, CT images, and MR images), and to determine whether these guidelines are more effectively adopted by patients of differing ages and genders. METHODS In this prospective study, a set of step-by-step instructions was created with the goal of helping patients take better smartphone photographs of orthopaedic diagnostic images for transfer to telemedicine services. Following the advice of surgeons, experts in smartphone technology, imaging experts, and suggestions from patients, the instructions were modified based on clinical experience and finalized with the goals of simplicity, clarity, and convenience. Potentially eligible patients were older than 18 years, had no cognitive impairment, and used smart phones. Based on that, 256 participants (patients or their relatives and friends) who visited the orthopaedic department of our hospital from June to October 2020 potentially qualified for this study. A total of 11% (29) declined to participate, leaving 89% (227) for analysis here. Their mean age was 36 ± 11 years, 50% were women (113 of 227), and the patient himself/herself represented in 34% (78 of 227) of participants while relatives or friends of patients made up 66% (149 of 227) of the group. In this study, the diagnoses included spinal stenosis (47% [107 of 227]), disc herniation without spinal stenosis (31% [71 of 227]), vertebral fractures (14% [32 of 227]), and other (7% [17 of 227]). Each study participant first took photographs of their original medical images based on their own knowledge of how to use the smartphone camera function; each participant then took pictures of their original images again after receiving our instructional guidance. Three senior spine surgeons (YZ, TQL, TCM) in our hospital analyzed, in a blinded manner, the instructed and uninstructed imaging files based on image clarity (the content of the image is complete, the text information in the image is clearly visible, there is neither reflection nor shadow in the image) and image position (it is not tilted, curled, inverted, or reversed). If either of these conditions was not satisfied, the picture quality was deemed unacceptable; two of three judges' votes determined the outcome. Interobserver reliability with kappa values for the three judges were 0.89 (YZ versus TQL), 0.92 (YZ versus TCM), and 0.90 (TQL versus TCM). RESULTS In this study, the overall proportion of smartphone medical images deemed satisfactory increased from 40% (91 of 227) for uninstructed participants to 86% (196 of 227) for instructed participants (risk ratio 2.15 [95% CI 1.82 to 2.55]; p＜0.001). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in different age groups improved after instruction, except for in patients aged 51 years or older (3 of 17 uninstructed participants versus 8 of 17 instructed participants; RR 2.67 [95% CI 0.85 to 8.37]; p = 0.07). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in both genders improved after instruction, but there was no difference between the genders. CONCLUSION We believe our guidelines for patients who wish to take smartphone photographs of their medical images will decrease image transmission cost and facilitate orthopaedic telemedicine consultations. However, it appears that patients older than 50 years are more likely to have difficulty with this approach, and if so, they may benefit from more hands-on assistance from clinic staff or younger relatives or friends. The degree to which our findings are culture-specific should be verified by other studies in other settings, but on the face of it, there is little reason to believe our findings would not generalize to a reasonable degree. Other studies in more heterogeneous populations should also evaluate factors related to levels of educational attainment and wealth differences, but in the meantime, our findings can give clinical teams an idea of which patients may need a little extra assistance.

100723,Research collaborations bring big rewards: the world needs more.,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE Deep infiltrating endometriosis with colorectal involvement is a complex disorder, often requiring segmental bowel resection. Complete removal of all visible lesions is considered the adequate treatment of infiltrating endometriosis in order to reduce recurrence. In this article, we describe our experience with laparoscopic management of deep infiltrating endometriosis with involvement of the rectum. METHODS A retrospective analysis of data from patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis with rectal involvement who underwent a laparoscopic surgery in the years 2002-2009 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at our institution was done. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2009, a laparoscopic partial rectal resection was performed in 52 patients, and laparoscopic disk resection was performed in 4 cases with deep infiltrating endometriosis. The mean age of patients was 34.4 years (range, 22-62 years). Preoperative symptoms included dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. The laparoscopic procedure was converted to formal laparotomy in 3 patients (5.4%). The mean duration of surgery was 145 minutes. Postoperative complications included 3 cases of anastomotic leakage with rectovaginal fistula in two cases and intraabdominal bleeding in 1 case. The mean hospital stay was 7 days. Postoperatively, nine patients had a normal delivery, two of them after in vitro fertilization treatment. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic rectal resection for deep infiltrating endometriosis is a relatively safe procedure, when performed by a surgeon and a gynecologist with sufficient experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.","Jelenc, Franc; Ribič-Pucelj, Martina; Juvan, Robert; Kobal, Borut; Sinkovec, Jasna; Salamun, Vesna",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

101969,Radioimmunotherapy prevents local recurrence of colonic cancer in an experimental model.,2009,"The humanized monoclonal antibody H27K15 specifically targets human CD115, a type III tyrosine kinase receptor involved in multiple cancers and inflammatory diseases. Binding of H27K15 to hCD115 expressing cells inhibits the functional effect of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), in a non-competitive manner. Both homology modeling and docking programs were used here to model the human CD115 extracellular domains, the H27K15 variable region and their interaction. The resulting predicted H27K15 epitope includes mainly the D1 domain in the N-terminal extracellular region of CD115 and some residues of the D2 domain. Sequence alignment with the non-binding murine CD115, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and affinity measurements by quartz crystal microbalance revealed critical residues of this epitope that are essential for H27K15 binding. A combination of computational simulations and biochemical experiments led to the design of a chimeric CD115 carrying the human epitope of H27K15 in a murine CD115 backbone that is able to bind both H27K15 as well as the murine ligands CSF-1 and IL-34. These results provide new possibilities to minutely study the functional effects of H27K15 in a transgenic mouse that would express this chimeric molecule.","Grellier, Benoît; Le Pogam, Fabrice; Vitorino, Marc; Starck, Jean-Philippe; Geist, Michel; Duong, Vanessa; Haegel, Hélène; Menguy, Thierry; Bonnefoy, Jean-Yves; Marchand, Jean-Baptiste; Ancian, Philippe",mAbs,https://doi.org/10.4161/mabs.27736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492308/,63

We recently reported a small molecule inhibitor of CREB, XX-650-23, which inhibits CREB activity in AML cells. Structure-activity relationship analysis for chemical compounds with structures similar to XX-650-23 led to the identification of the anthelminthic drug niclosamide as a potent anti-leukemic agent that suppresses cell viability of AML cell lines and primary AML cells without a significant decrease in colony forming activity of normal bone marrow cells. Niclosamide significantly inhibited CREB function and CREB-mediated gene expression in cells, leading to apoptosis and G1/S cell cycle arrest with reduced phosphorylated CREB levels. CREB knockdown protected cells from niclosamide treatment-mediated cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, treatment with a combination of niclosamide and CREB inhibitor XX-650-23 showed an additive anti-proliferative effect, consistent with the hypothesis that niclosamide and XX-650-23 regulate the same targets or pathways to inhibit proliferation and survival of AML cells. Niclosamide significantly inhibited the progression of disease in AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice, and prolonged survival of PDX mice. Niclosamide also showed synergistic effects with chemotherapy drugs to inhibit AML cell proliferation. While chemotherapy antagonized the cytotoxic potential of niclosamide, pretreatment with niclosamide sensitized cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, cytarabine, daunorubicin, and vincristine. Therefore, our results demonstrate niclosamide as a potential drug to treat AML by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest through inhibition of CREB-dependent pathways in AML cells.","Chae, Hee-Don; Cox, Nick; Dahl, Gary V; Lacayo, Norman J; Davis, Kara L; Capolicchio, Samanta; Smith, Mark; Sakamoto, Kathleen M",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.23794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29435104/,63

The purpose of this study is to determine whether preventive negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) could reduce wound complications after open pectus surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS 100 patients after open procedure for the treatment of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum in the years 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analysed. 50 patients treated with Prevena™ (KCI Medical Products GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) were compared with 50 patients whose wounds were covered with OPSITE® film (Smith & Nephew, Hamburg, Germany). Wound closure was performed following a standard procedure as well as the placement of subcutaneous drains. Therefore two comparable groups of patients were formed and analysed by standardised parameters. The wound dressing was placed epicutaneously immediately after wound closure in the operating room and removed after 5 days in each case. Follow-ups were performed immediately after removal of the wound dressing, at the time of discharge from hospital as well as 6 and 12 weeks after operation. The wounds were checked for tenderness, pain, secretion, redness and fistulas. RESULTS The Prevena group showed 10 % wound complications which needed operative treatment, whereas the OPSITE group showed complications in 24 %. Some patients who were treated with Prevena showed superficial skin lesions at the rim of the foam and the film. All of these lesions healed well. CONCLUSION Treating wounds postoperatively with preventive measures (NPWT) showed a remarkable reduction of wound complications following open pectus surgery whereas statistically the difference was not significant (p = 0.074).","Simon, K; Schulz-Drost, M; Besendörfer, M; Carbon, R T; Schulz-Drost, S",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1360291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647815/,63

In this work, targeted liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) polyphenolic and curcuminoid profiles were evaluated as chemical descriptors to deal with the characterization and classification of turmeric and curry samples. The profiles corresponding to bioactive substances were obtained by TraceFinderTM software using accurate mass databases with 53 and 24 polyphenolic and curcuminoid related compounds, respectively. For that purpose, 21 turmeric and 9 curry samples commercially available were analyzed in triplicate by a simple liquid-solid extraction procedure using dimethyl sulfoxide as extracting solvent. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed profiles were excellent chemical descriptors for sample characterization and classification by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), achieving 100% classification rates. Curcuminoids and some specific phenolic acids such as trans-cinnamic, ferulic and sinapic acids, helped on the discrimination of turmeric samples; polyphenols, in general, were responsible for the curry sample distinction. Besides, the combination of both polyphenolic and curcuminoid profiles was necessary for the simultaneous characterization and classification of turmeric and curry samples. Discrimination among turmeric species such as Curcuma longa vs. Curcuma zedoaria, as well as among different Curcuma longa varieties (Alleppey, Madras and Erode) was also accomplished.","Núñez, Nerea; Vidal-Casanella, Oscar; Sentellas, Sonia; Saurina, Javier; Núñez, Oscar",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604759/,63

Watertight dural suture is challenging, and different ways to reinforce it have been proposed. Since 6 months, we use locally harvested autologous pericranium graft for dural repair in retrosigmoid approach. METHODS Retrospectively, we analyzed 27 patients operated on with key-hole retrosigmoid approach from May 2014. In all, autologous pericranium was harvested and inserted as an underlay ""hourglass-shaped"" plug under the dura plane and stitched to dura. Surgical patch and sealant were used for augmentation. Complications considered were new neurological symptoms, surgical site infections, meningitis, CSF-leaks, and pseudomeningocele. RESULTS Indications included tumor (16 cases), microvascular decompression (10 cases), and hemorrhagic cerebellar arteriovenous malformation (1 case). Surgical site infections, meningitis, and CSF leaks have never been observed. One neurofibromatosis type 2 patient operated on for large acoustic neuroma developed an asymptomatic pseudomeningocele, disappeared on 3-month magnetic resonance imaging follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In our series, autologous pericranium inserted and stitched as an underlay hourglass-shaped plug, augmented with surgical patch pieces and dural sealant seemed to be safe and effective for dural repair in ""key-hole"" retrosigmoid approach. With this technique, we obtained low complication rate, similar to the best current results of available literature.","Mastronardi, Luciano; Cacciotti, Guglielmo; Caputi, Franco; Roperto, Raffaelino; Tonelli, Maria Pia; Carpineta, Ettore; Fukushima, Takanori",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.178521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27069742/,63

Effects of the surgeon's experience level on the SL:WL ratio were evaluated, hypothesizing that small animal surgeons do not spontaneously apply SL:WL ratios equal to or larger than 4:1. PROCEDURES Three groups of surgeons with varying levels of experience performed 4 simple continuous sutures before (3 sutures) and after (1 suture) being educated on principles of the SL:WL ratio. All sutures were evaluated for their gaping, number of stitches, stitch intervals, tissue bite size and suture length. RESULTS No significant differences in suture parameters or SL:WL ratios were found among the 3 groups, and 60.5% of control sutures and 77.0% of test sutures had SL:WL ratios above 4:1. There was a significant improvement in the mean ratio after the information was provided (p = 0.003). Overall, the SL:WL ratios ranged from 1.54:1 to 6.81:1, with 36.3% falling between 4:1 and 5:1 (5.17 mm mean stitch interval, 5.52 mm mean tissue bite size). A significant negative correlation was observed between the SL:WL ratio and the stitch interval to tissue bite ratio (r = -0.886). Forty-nine of 120 sutures fulfilled the current recommendations for abdominal wall closure with a mean SL:WL ratio of 4.1:1. CONCLUSION A SL:WL ratio larger than 4:1 was achieved in 60% of the control sutures and in 77% of test sutures. Additional animal studies are necessary to evaluate the SL/WL ratio in small animal surgery.","Klonner, Moriz E; Degasperi, Brigitte; Bockstahler, Barbara; Dupré, Gilles",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026296/,63

106237,"Underpromise, overdeliver.",2020-03-23,"This study aimed to provide an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on weight loss and the impact on the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). A systematic search of five databases between 1980 and May 2018 was used to identify all RCT which employed a lifestyle intervention (i.e. diet-only, exercise-only or combination of the two) aiming to reduce the severity of OSA (assessed using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)). Random-effects meta-analyses followed by meta-regression were conducted. Ten RCT involving 702 participants (Intervention group: n = 354; Control group: n = 348) were assessed in two meta-analyses. The weighted mean difference in AHI (-8.09 events/h, 95% CI: -11.94 to -4.25) and body mass index (BMI, -2.41 kg/m2 , 95% CI: -4.09 to -0.73) both significantly favoured lifestyle interventions over control arms. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that all interventions were associated with reductions in the AHI, but only the diet-only interventions were associated with a significant reduction in BMI. No association was found between the reduction in AHI or BMI and the length of the intervention, or with baseline AHI and BMI levels. All lifestyle interventions investigated appear effective for improving OSA severity and should be an essential component of treatment for OSA. Future research should be directed towards identifying subgroups likely to reap greater treatment benefits as well as other therapeutic benefits provided by these interventions.","Edwards, Bradley A; Bristow, Claire; O'Driscoll, Denise M; Wong, Ai-Ming; Ghazi, Ladan; Davidson, Zoe E; Young, Alan; Truby, Helen; Haines, Terry P; Hamilton, Garun S",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116901/,63

Experimentally derived topic search filters offer a reliable solution to effective retrieval; however, their number and range of subject foci remain unknown. OBJECTIVES This systematic scoping review aims to identify and describe available experimentally developed topic search filters. METHODS Reports on topic search filter development (1990-) were sought using grey literature sources and 15 databases. Reports describing the conception and prospective development of a database-specific topic search and including an objectively measured estimate of its performance ('sensitivity') were included. RESULTS Fifty-four reports met inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and thematically synthesised to describe the characteristics of 58 topic search filters. DISCUSSION Topic search filters are proliferating and cover a wide range of subjects. Filter reports, however, often lack clear definitions of concepts and topic scope to guide users. Without standardised terminology, filters are challenging to find. Information specialists may benefit from a centralised topic filter repository and appraisal checklists to facilitate quality assessment. CONCLUSION Findings will help information specialists identify existing topic search filters and assist filter developers to build on current knowledge in the field.","Damarell, Raechel A; May, Nikki; Hammond, Sue; Sladek, Ruth M; Tieman, Jennifer J",Health information and libraries journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/hir.12244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578606/,63

METHODS A retrospective analysis on 508 patients was performed. Abbreviated protocol (AP) included one pre-contrast and the first post-contrast T1-weighted series. Complete protocol (CP) consisted of four post-contrast and one pre-contrast T1-weighted series. Diagnostic performance was assessed for AP and CP. Performance comparison was made using McNemar's test for sensitivity and specificity and Moskowitz and Pepe's method as regards negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV). AP has been realized in two different ways (AP1 and AP2) and they were compared by means of Cohen's κ. RESULTS Both CP and AP revealed 206 of 207 cancers. There were no statistically significant differences between AP and CP diagnostic performance (P > 0.05). NPVs of CP and both versions of AP (99.57 vs. 99.56%, P = 0.39), as well as the specificity (77.08 vs. 75.42%, P = 0.18), were substantially equivalent. Relative predictive value method did not reveal the presence of a statistically significant difference between the PPV of CP and both versions of AP (74.91 vs. 73.57%, P = 0.099). Analysis for single lesion confirmed that both CP and AP had equivalent results: CP and AP revealed 280 of 281 malignancies. NPVs of CP and both AP versions, as well as the specificity (P > 0.05), were substantially equivalent. Relative predictive value method did not reveal the presence of a significant difference between the PPV of CP and both AP versions (70.89 vs. 70.18%, P = 0.25; 70.89 vs. 70.00%, P = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS Abbreviated approach to breast MRI examination reduces the image acquisition and the reading time associated with MR substantially without influencing the diagnostic accuracy (high sensitivity and NPV >99.5%). AP could translate into cost-savings and could enable a higher number of examinations within the same MR session.","Petrillo, Antonella; Fusco, Roberta; Sansone, Mario; Cerbone, Marilena; Filice, Salvatore; Porto, Annamaria; Rubulotta, Maria Rosaria; D'Aiuto, Massimiliano; Avino, Franca; Di Bonito, Maurizio; Botti, Gerardo",Breast cancer research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-017-4264-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28447241/,63

MT is typically performed via a transfemoral approach, but catheterization of the occluded vessel can be problematic in cases of extensive vessel tortuosity. We describe a case of MT with the 'ADAPT' technique by direct carotid access due to an inability to catheterize the ICA by a transfemoral approach for acute cerebral ischemia in the setting of left MCA occlusion. Excellent angiographic and good clinical results were obtained without any complications. CASE REPORT An 80-year-old woman was admitted with a stroke by occlusion of the left MCA, with an NIHSS: 11, and an ASPECT: 7 in the CT. Under sedation a transfemoral angiography was performed, but after multiple attempts, it was impossible to make a stable catheterization of the left CCA. A transcervical approach was pursued. With ultrasound guidance the CCA was catheterized. Using the 'ADAPT' technique, we performed a successful MT. Post-procedure angiography (at 14 minutes) demonstrated recanalization of the entire left MCA (TICI: 3), without complications. The carotid access point was closed with a percutaneous closure. Control TC at 24 h showed a slight hypodensity in the left lenticular nucleus, and loss of gray-white matter differentiation in the adjacent cortex. Neurologically, the patient presented with progressive improvement. At discharge, she had an NIHSS: 0, mRS: 0 and Barthel: 100. CONCLUSIONS MT by direct carotid access is an effective alternative technique in those cases where it is not accessible by a transfemoral approach.","Castaño, Carlos; Remollo, Sebastian; García, Maria Rosa; Hidalgo, Cristina; Hernández-Perez, Maria; Ciorba, Mihaela",The neuroradiology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1971400915609352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26443297/,63
107257,Pandemic Preparedness in Animal Facilities.,2021-04-16,"Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)-listed disease of farmed Atlantic salmon, characterized by slowly developing anemia and circulatory disturbances. The disease is caused by ISA virus (ISAV) in the Orthomyxoviridae family; hence, it is related to influenza. Here we explore the pathogenesis of ISA by focusing on virus tropism, receptor tissue distribution, and pathological changes in experimentally and naturally infected Atlantic salmon. Using immunohistochemistry on ISAV-infected Atlantic salmon tissues with antibody to viral nucleoprotein, endotheliotropism was demonstrated. Endothelial cells lining the circulatory system were found to be infected, seemingly noncytolytic, and without vasculitis. No virus could be found in necrotic parenchymal cells. From endothelium, the virus budded apically and adsorbed to red blood cells (RBCs). No infection or replication within RBCs was detected, but hemophagocytosis was observed, possibly contributing to the severe anemia in fish with this disease. Similarly to what has been done in studies of influenza, we examined the pattern of virus attachment by using ISAV as a probe. Here we detected the preferred receptor of ISAV, 4-O-acetylated sialic acid (Neu4,5Ac(2)). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the in situ distribution of this sialic acid derivate. The pattern of virus attachment mirrored closely the distribution of infection, showing that the virus receptor is important for cell tropism, as well as for adsorption to RBCs.","Aamelfot, Maria; Dale, Ole Bendik; Weli, Simon Chioma; Koppang, Erling Olaf; Falk, Knut",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00047-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811536/,63

This highly infectious virus has been named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee of the Taxonomy of Viruses. It has severely affected a large population and economy worldwide. Globally various scientific communities have been involved in studying this newly emerged virus and is lifecycle. Multiple diverse studies are in progress to design novel therapeutic agents, in which understanding of interactions between the target and drug ligand is a significant key for this challenge. Structures of proteins involved in the life cycle of the virus have been revealed in RCSB PDB by researchers. In this study, we employed molecular docking study of 4-Acetamido-3-nitrobenzoic acid (ANBA) with corona virus proteins (spike protein, spike binding domain with ACE2 receptor and Main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Single crystal X-ray analysis and density functional theory calculations were carried out for ANBA to explore the structural and chemical-reactive parameters. Intermolecular interactions which are involved in the ligand-protein binding process are validated by Hirshfeld surface analysis. To study the behaviour of ANBA in a living organism and to calculate the physicochemical parameters, ADMET analysis was done using SwissADME and Osiris data warrior tools. Further, Toxicity of ANBA was predicted using pkCSM online software. Based on the molecular docking analysis, we introduce here a potent drug molecule that binds to the COVID-19 proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

108322,Action spectra of chiral secondary structure.,2020-06-26,"OBJECTIVES Endovascular procedures are one of the important treatment options for steno-occlusive arteries in ischemic stroke patients. However, embolic complications after such procedures are always a concern. The authors investigated the association between serial change of residual platelet reactivity and silent embolic cerebral infarction (SECI) after endovascular treatment. METHODS Ischemic stroke patients undergoing stenting of intra- or extracranial arteries were recruited prospectively. Residual platelet reactivity, represented by aspirin reaction units (ARUs) and P2Y12 reaction units (PRUs), was measured serially (6 hours before, immediately after, and 24 hours after the procedure). A loading dosage of aspirin (500 mg) and/or clopidogrel (300 mg) was given 24 hours before the procedure to patients naïve to antiplatelet agents, whereas the usual dosage (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg) was continued for patients who had previously been taking these agents for more than a week. Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed before and 24 hours after the procedure to detect new SECIs. Clinical characteristics, baseline ARU and PRU values, and the change in ARU and PRU values after stenting were compared between patients with and without SECIs. RESULTS Among 69 consecutive patients who underwent neurovascular stent insertion, 41 patients (59.4%) had poststenting SECIs. The lesion was located only at the vascular territory of the stented vessel in 21 patients (51.2%), outside the stented vessel territory in 8 patients (19.5%), and both inside and outside in 12 patients (29.3%). The occurrence of SECIs was not associated with the baseline ARU or PRU value, but was associated with PRU increase after stenting (36 ± 73 vs -12 ± 59, p = 0.007), deployment of a longer stent (31.1 ± 16.5 mm vs 21.8 ± 9.9 mm, p = 0.01), and stent insertion in extracranial arteries (78.1% vs 45.2%, p = 0.008). Stent length (OR 1.066, p = 0.01) and PRU change (OR 1.009, p = 0.04) were independently associated with the occurrence of SECI. CONCLUSIONS Residual platelet reactivity after dual antiplatelet treatment measured before stenting did not predict poststenting SECI. However, the longer stent and the serial increase of PRU values after stenting were related to SECI. Continuous increase of platelet activation after endovascular procedure may be important in poststent cerebral infarction.","Kim, Bum Joon; Kwon, Joo Y; Jung, Jin-Man; Lee, Deok Hee; Kang, Dong-Wha; Kim, Jong S; Kwon, Sun U",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.6.jns132448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036195/,63

However, it requires trained personnel, limiting its availability. Saliva NAAT represents an attractive alternative, but its diagnostic performance is unclear. Objective To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19. Data Sources In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020. Study Selection Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Data Extraction and Synthesis Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings. Results The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses. Conclusions and Relevance These results suggest that saliva NAAT diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of nasopharyngeal swab NAAT, especially in the ambulatory setting. These findings support larger-scale research on the use of saliva NAAT as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs.","Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Lawandi, Alexander; Schiller, Ian; Yao, Mandy C; Dendukuri, Nandini; McDonald, Emily G; Lee, Todd C",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.8876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449069/,63

We show that women are more likely to perceive COVID-19 as a very serious health problem, to agree with restraining public policy measures, and to comply with them. Gender differences in attitudes and behavior are sizable in all countries. They are accounted for neither by sociodemographic and employment characteristics nor by psychological and behavioral factors.

Stress responses are particularly important in stem cells that provide lifetime support for tissue formation and repair, but how these protective systems are integrated into developmental programs is poorly understood. Here we used myoblast differentiation to identify the E3 ligase CUL2FEM1B and its substrate FNIP1 as core components of the reductive stress response. Reductive stress, as caused by prolonged antioxidant signaling or mitochondrial inactivity, reverts the oxidation of invariant Cys residues in FNIP1 and allows CUL2FEM1B to recognize its target. The ensuing proteasomal degradation of FNIP1 restores mitochondrial activity to preserve redox homeostasis and stem cell integrity. The reductive stress response is therefore built around a ubiquitin-dependent rheostat that tunes mitochondrial activity to redox needs and implicates metabolic control in coordination of stress and developmental signaling.","Manford, Andrew G; Rodríguez-Pérez, Fernando; Shih, Karen Y; Shi, Zhuo; Berdan, Charles A; Choe, Mangyu; Titov, Denis V; Nomura, Daniel K; Rape, Michael",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941802/,63
110004,The coronavirus czar.,2020-05-01,"The majority of patients with Crohn's disease and up to 35 % of patients with ulcerative colitis will ultimately require surgery during the course of their disease. Over the past few years, surgical techniques and experience in minimal invasive surgery have evolved resulting in single-incision laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this approach is to diminish the surgical trauma by reducing the number of incision sites. This review discusses the benefits and disadvantages of single-port surgery in various procedures in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Short-term postoperative results, functional outcome, and costs available in the literature will be discussed. Single-port surgery in IBD has several benefits when compared to multi-port laparoscopic surgery. By using fewer incisions, a potential reduction of postoperative pain with less morphine use can be accomplished. In addition, accelerated postoperative recovery can result in a shorter hospital stay. Furthermore, a superior cosmesis can be reached with placement of the port at the future ostomy site or at the umbilicus. Literature on single-port surgery in IBD consists mainly of case series and a few matched case series. These studies demonstrated that single-port surgery seems to be a safe and feasible approach for the surgical treatment of IBD patients.","de Groof, E Joline; Buskens, Christianne J; Bemelman, Willem A",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-016-3509-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094562/,63

110194,Influence of hidden halogen mobility on local structure of CsSn(Cl1-x Br x )3 mixed-halide perovskites by solid-state NMR.,2020-12-30,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in modulating cardiovascular function and fluid homeostasis. While the systemic actions of the RAS are widely accepted, the role of the RAS in the brain, its regulation of cardiovascular function, and sympathetic outflow remain controversial. In this report, we discuss the current understanding of central RAS on blood pressure (BP) regulation, in light of recent literature and new experimental techniques. RECENT FINDINGS Studies using neuronal or glial-specifc mouse models have allowed for greater understanding into the site-specific expression and role centrally expressed RAS proteins have on BP regulation. While all components of the RAS have been identified in cardiovascular regulatory regions of the brain, their actions may be site specific. In a number of animal models of hypertension, reduction in Ang II-mediated signaling, or upregulation of the central ACE2/Ang 1-7 pathway, has been shown to reduce BP, via a reduction in sympathetic signaling and increase parasympathetic tone, respectively. Emerging evidence also suggests that, in part, the female protective phenotype against hypertension may be due to inceased ACE2 activity within cardiovascular regulatory regions of the brain, potentially mediated by estrogen. Increasing evidence suggests the importance of a central renin-angiotensin pathway, although its localization and the mechanisms involved in its expression and regulation still need to be clarified and more precisely defined.

METHODS We used the incubation period of 9 respiratory viruses to derive decision rules for distinguishing between community- and hospital-acquired infection. We developed a method, implemented in a simple spreadsheet, that can be used to investigate the exposure history of an individual patient and more specifically to identify the probable time and location of infection. Illustrative examples are used to explain and evaluate this technique. RESULTS If the risks of hospital and community infection are equal, 95% of patients who develop symptoms of adenovirus infection within 5 days of hospital admission will have been infected in the community, as will 95% of patients who develop symptoms within 3 days for human-coronavirus infection, 2.5 days for severe acute respiratory syndrome, 1 day for influenza A, 0.5 day for influenza B, 12 days for measles, 2 days for parainfluenza, 4 days for respiratory syncytial virus infection, and 1.5 days for rhinovirus infection. Sources of infection suggested by analysis of the symptom onset times of individual patients are consistent with those from detailed investigations. CONCLUSIONS This work shows how a detailed understanding of the incubation period can be an effective tool for identifying the source of infection, ultimately ensuring patient safety.","Lessler, Justin; Brookmeyer, Ron; Reich, Nicholas G; Nelson, Kenrad E; Cummings, Derek A T; Perl, Trish M",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1086/655023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20569117/,63

METHODS Our research team contacted patients with reported menopausal symptoms by telephone to obtain consent and administer a baseline survey. Subsequently, we sent participants a booklet on the treatment of menopausal symptoms. A nurse educator then contacted participants by telephone to review the booklet and guide them through a structured decision counseling exercise designed to help clarify treatment preference. A 60-day endpoint telephone survey was completed. RESULTS Forty-eight consenting participants completed the baseline survey and 37 (77%) also completed a decision counseling session. At baseline, 19 of the women who had decision counseling were not being treated for menopausal symptoms and 18 were being treated. After decision counseling, 13 (68%) participants who were not being treated and 14 (78%) who were being treated identified a preferred treatment. Comparison of baseline and endpoint survey data showed that participant treatment knowledge increased (P = 0.007) and treatment decisional conflict decreased (P < 0.001). Furthermore, 71% of participants reported that they had received new information about treatment and 94% said they believed better prepared to discuss treatment with their healthcare provider. CONCLUSIONS Nurse-led decision counseling increased participant treatment knowledge, reduced treatment decisional conflict, and helped to clarify treatment preference. Implementation of this strategy could help to facilitate provider-patient shared decision making about the treatment of menopausal symptoms.","Dayaratna, Sandra; Sifri, Randa; Jackson, Rebecca; Powell, Rhea; Sherif, Katherine; DiCarlo, Melissa; Hegarty, Sarah E; Petrich, Anett; Lambert, Emily; Quinn, Anna; Myers, Ronald",Menopause,https://doi.org/10.1097/gme.0000000000001807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260477/,63

Unfortunately, it can also be argued that these statements are in clear misalignment between the words described and the environments that faculty, students, trainees, and staff of color face. The purpose of this study was to analyze academic medicine institutional statements that responded to 2020 racial tensions following the murders of George Floyd, among others, and the subsequent nationwide protests against police brutality. Methods We conducted a manifest content analysis of institutional statements generated by academic medical centers after George Floyd's murder. We used manifest content analysis to gain insights into how institutional statements connect structural racism to the mission of academic medicine. We collected and examined institutional statements from 26 academic medicine centers. Selection parameters included statements that were publicly available and published by the institutions during a 2-week period. We conducted a four-stage analysis: decontextualization, recontextualization, categorization, and compilation. To better understand the collection of statements, we plotted these institutional statements according to the most salient discussed themes. Results Overall, institutional statements discussed racism through three subthemes: identifying the racial implications of health disparities, issuing a call to action to address racism, and decentering race. Absent language is also noted. Second, institutional statements evoked institutional values by expressing an explicit connection with the academic medicine mission, naming the value of social justice, and emphasizing the concept of community. Finally, institutional statements largely discussed public health in connection with racism or with institutional values. Conclusion Our study determines a much-needed reconnection to the mission of academic medicine. Reclaiming the social mission will be a major step toward recentering the foundation of institutional actions. This call is what ultimately will improve the health and well-being of marginalized populations.","Sotto-Santiago, Sylk; Sharp, Sacha; Mac, Jacqueline; Messmore, Niki; Haywood, Antwione; Tyson, Michele; Yi, Varaxy",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616971/,63
111169,"Robotic radical cystectomy: where are we today, where will we be tomorrow?",2010,"UNLABELLED This prospective study compared a 1-d SPECT/CT protocol with the commonly used 3-d protocol for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. Additionally, the influence of SPECT/CT on patient management was evaluated. METHODS From October 2011 to October 2012, all gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm patients undergoing restaging with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy on a modern SPECT/CT device were enrolled in this study. The protocol consisted of planar imaging at 4, 24, and 48 h; low-dose SPECT/CT at 24 and 48 h; diagnostic CT at 24 h using a triple-phase delay after administration of contrast; and diagnostic SPECT/CT at 24 h. All components of the imaging data were reassessed by 3 masked interpreters. The results were compared with a reference standard based on all clinical, imaging, and histopathology follow-up data available (follow-up range, 24-36 mo; mean, 29.9 mo). The reference standard was defined by a study-specific interdisciplinary tumor board that also reassessed treatment decisions. RESULTS Thirty-one patients were eligible for analysis (18 men and 13 women; mean age, 60.4 y). Ten had no imaging signs of disease and remained disease-free during follow-up. Twenty-one had persistent or recurrent disease (82 lesions: 24 in the liver, 21 in the lymph nodes, 16 in bone, 12 in the pancreas, and 9 in other locations). The respective lesion detection rates for interpreters 1, 2, and 3 were 51.9%, 49.4%, and 71.6% for low-dose SPECT/CT at 24 h; 51.9%, 55.6%, and 67.9% for low-dose SPECT/CT at 48 h; 63.0%, 70.4%, and 85.2% for diagnostic CT; and 77.8%, 84.0%, and 88.9% for diagnostic SPECT/CT. Interobserver agreement was moderate for diagnostic SPECT/CT (κ = 0.44), diagnostic CT (κ = 0.43), low-dose SPECT/CT at 48 h (κ = 0.61), and low-dose SPECT/CT at 24 h (κ = 0.55). For planar imaging, interobserver agreement was fair after 48 h (κ = 0.36) and 24 h (κ = 0.38) and moderate after 4 h (κ = 0.42). Every lesion detectable on planar imaging or low-dose SPECT/CT was also detectable on diagnostic SPECT/CT. The CT and SPECT components of diagnostic SPECT/CT strongly complemented each other, as 34 of 82 lesions (41.4%) were detected on only the CT component or only the SPECT component. Therapeutic management was influenced by the diagnostic SPECT/CT interpretation in 8 of 31 patients (25.8%). CONCLUSION The highest detection rates were achieved by diagnostic SPECT/CT. Thus, a more patient-friendly 1-d protocol is feasible. Furthermore, multiphase SPECT/CT affected management in about a quarter of patients.","Ruf, Juri; von Wedel, Friederike; Furth, Christian; Denecke, Timm; Stelter, Lars; Steffen, Ingo G; Schütte, Kerstin; Arend, Jörg; Ulrich, Gerhard; Klose, Silke; Bornschein, Jan; Apostolova, Ivalya; Amthauer, Holger","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.115.161117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26609177/,63
111213,Vacua with Small Flux Superpotential.,2020-05-29,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) has a high mortality in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), and vaccination against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is vital for this population. Although humoral response to messenger RNA vaccines was shown to be impaired in KTR, there is a lack of data regarding the antibody response to inactivated vaccines. We investigated the antibody response to two consequent doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac, Sinovac Biotech, China). METHODS A total of 118 patients from two centers were included. The levels of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike antigens were determined with enzyme immunoassay (DIA.PRO, Milano, Italy) before the vaccine and one month after the second dose of the vaccine. Thirty three patients were excluded due to antibody positivity in the serum samples obtained before vaccination. RESULTS Eighty-five patients, 47 of whom were female, with a mean age of 46±12, were included in the statistical analysis. The maintenance immunosuppressive therapy comprised tacrolimus (88.2%), mycophenolate (63.6%), and low dose steroids (95.3%) in the majority of the patients. After a median of 31 days following the second dose of the vaccine, only 16 (18.8%) patients developed an antibody response. The median (IQR) antibody level was 52.5 IU/ml (21.5-96). Age (48 vs 38, p=0.005) and serum creatinine levels (1.14 vs. 0.91, p=0.04) were higher in non-responders, and were also found to be independently associated with the antibody response (OR, 0.93, p=0.012 and 0.15, p=0.045, respectively) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION In this study, we found the antibody response to the inactivated vaccine to be considerably low (18.8%) in KTR. Increased age and impaired renal function were associated with worse antibody response. Based on the knowledge that mRNA vaccines yield better humoral responses, this special population might be considered for additional doses of mRNA vaccination. This article is protected by copyright.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Three patients (median age 6 years; range 6-13) underwent robot-assisted APV surgery for bladder dysfunction because of posterior urethral valves, myelomeningocele, and traumatic spinal cord transection. Leakage developed in each patient from the APV. After failing more conservative treatments, the patients subsequently underwent robot-assisted APV revision. RESULTS Robot-assisted APV revision was conducted at a median 14 months (range 6-34 mos) after initial surgery. Median operative time was 165 minutes (range 106-232 min), and blood loss was ≤5 mL for all patients. Intraoperative findings ranged from partial to complete separation of the APV from the bladder tunnel. APV leakage resolved for all patients at last follow-up (median 5 months; range 2-9 mos). CONCLUSION This initial series expands the scope of robotic surgical procedures in children.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA NSTI is a life-threatening diagnosis. Delay to diagnosis and surgical management is associated with increased mortality. METHODS We searched 6 databases from inception through November 2017. We included English-language studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of testing or LRINEC Score. Outcome was NSTI confirmed by surgery or histopathology. Two reviewers screened all citations and extracted data independently. Summary measures were obtained from the Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic model. RESULTS From 2,290 citations, we included 23 studies (n = 5982). Of physical examination signs, pooled sensitivity and specificity for fever was 46.0% and 77.0% respectively, for hemorrhagic bullae 25.2% and 95.8%, and for hypotension 21.0% and 97.7%. Computed tomography (CT) had sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 93.3%, while plain radiography had sensitivity of 48.9% and specificity of 94.0%. Finally, LRINEC ≥ 6 had sensitivity of 68.2% and specificity of 84.8%, while LRINEC ≥ 8 had sensitivity of 40.8% and specificity of 94.9%. CONCLUSIONS Absence of any 1 physical examination feature (eg, fever or hypotension) is not sufficient to rule-out NSTI. CT is superior to plain radiography. LRINEC had poor sensitivity, and should not be used to rule-out NSTI. Given the poor sensitivity of these tests, a high clinical suspicion warrants early surgical consultation for definitive diagnosis and management.","Fernando, Shannon M; Tran, Alexandre; Cheng, Wei; Rochwerg, Bram; Kyeremanteng, Kwadwo; Seely, Andrew J E; Inaba, Kenji; Perry, Jeffrey J",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000002774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672405/,63

OBJECTIVE The current study aims to assess whether the ultrasound-assisted paramedian technique can decrease the number of needle passes required for success compared with the landmark-guided paramedian technique in the elderly. DESIGN Prospective randomised controlled study. SETTING Single-institution, tertiary-level hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea from October 2017 to January 2018. PATIENTS Eighty patients aged at least 60 years undergoing orthopaedic surgery. INTERVENTION All received paramedian spinal anaesthesia by either the landmark-guided or preprocedural ultrasound-assisted technique. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The number of needle passes required for successful dural puncture. RESULTS The number of needle passes (median [interquartile range]) was significantly lower (1.0 [1.0 to 2.0] vs. 4.5 [2.0 to 7.0]) and the success rate at first pass significantly higher at 65.0 vs. 17.5% in the ultrasound compared with the landmark group (both P < 0.001). The ultrasound-assisted technique required a longer time for establishing landmarks 117.5 [85.5 to 150.7] vs. 17.5 [14.0 to 23.0] s, and for total procedure 181.5 [133.5 to 212.5] vs. 92.5 [62.5 to 176.5] s, but a shorter time for administering spinal anaesthesia 39.5 [31.5 to 71.3] vs. 77.0 [45.8 to 136.5] s (all P < 0.001) than the landmark-guided technique. The ultrasound group showed lower periprocedural pain scores 3 [2 to 4] vs. 4 [4 to 6] (P = 0.009) and discomfort scores 2 [0 to 3] vs. 5 [2 to 6] (P = 0.003) than the landmark group. CONCLUSION Compared with the landmark-guided paramedian technique, the ultrasound-assisted paramedian technique decreases the number of needle manipulations and periprocedural pain and discomfort scores in the elderly. Our results suggest that neuraxial ultrasonography facilitates the performance of spinal anaesthesia in the elderly.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is often detected together with H9N2, suggesting disease exacerbation in cases of co-infections. This hypothesis was therefore tested and confirmed in laboratory conditions using specific pathogen free chickens. Most common field vaccine programs were then tested to compare their efficacies against these two co-infecting agents. IBV γCoV/chicken/Morocco/I38/2014 (Mor-IT02) and LPAI virus A/chicken/Morocco/SF1/2016 (Mor-H9N2) were thus inoculated to commercial chickens. We showed that vaccination with two heterologous IBV vaccines (H120 at day one and 4/91 at day 14 of age) reduced the severity of clinical signs as well as macroscopic lesions after experimental simultaneous challenge. In addition, LPAI H9N2 vaccination was more efficient at day 7 rather than at day 1 in limiting disease post simultaneous challenge.","Belkasmi, Sakhia F Z; Fellahi, Siham; Touzani, Charifa Drissi; Faraji, Fatima Zahra; Maaroufi, Imane; Delverdier, Maxence; Guérin, Jean-Luc; Fihri, Ouafaa Fassi; El Houadfi, Mohammed; Ducatez, Mariette F",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2019.1656328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412705/,63
112846,Creating CRISPR-responsive smart materials for diagnostics and programmable cargo release.,2020-08-17,"Co-hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of livestock manure and biomass might improve the fuel properties of the hydrochar due to the high reactivity of the biomass-derived intermediates with the abundant oxygen-containing functionalities. However, the complicated compositions make it difficult to explicit the specific roles of the individual components of biomass played in the co-HTC process. In this study, cellulose was used for co-HTC with swine manure to investigate the influence on the properties of the hydrochar. The yield of hydrochar obtained from co-HTC reduced gradually with the cellulose proportion increased, and the solid yield was lower than the theoretical value. This was because the cellulose-derived intermediates favored the stability of the fragments from hydrolysis of swine manure. The increased temperature resulted in the reduction of the hydrochar yield whereas the prolonged time enhanced the formation of solid product. The interaction of the co-HTC intermediates facilitated the formation of O-containing species, thus making the solid more oxygen- and hydrogen-rich with a higher volatility. In addition, the co-HTC affected the evolution of functionalities like -OH and CO during the thermal treatment of the hydrochar and altered its morphology by stuffing the pores from swine manure-derived solid with the microspheres from HTC of cellulose. The interaction of the varied intermediates also impacted the formation of amines, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, aromatics and the polymeric products in distinct ways.","Li, Qingyin; Lin, Haisheng; Zhang, Shu; Yuan, Xiangzhou; Gholizadeh, Mortaza; Wang, Yi; Xiang, Jun; Hu, Song; Hu, Xun",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118669/,63

Many estimation methods are based on the Brownian Motion model for diffusive dispersal on a 2-dimensional plane, however the accuracy of these methods deteriorates substantially when dispersal occurs at global scales because Spherical Brownian Motion (SBM) differs from planar Brownian Motion. No statistical method exists for estimating SBM diffusion coefficients from a given timetree and tip coordinates, and no method exists for simulating SBM along a given timetree. Here I present new methods for simulating SBM along a given timetree, and for estimating SBM diffusivity from a given timetree and tip coordinates using a modification of Felsenstein's independent contrasts and maximum-likelihood. My simulation and fitting methods can accommodate arbitrary time-dependent diffusivities and scale efficiently to trees with millions of tips, thus enabling new analyses even in cases where planar BM would be a sufficient approximation.

METHODS We recruited 47 patients with mild (n=20), moderate (n=9) or severe (n=18) COVID-19 and measured two plasma biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa): neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) (a marker of intra-axonal neuronal injury) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) (a marker of astrocytic activation/injury) in samples collected at presentation and again in a subset after a mean of 11.4 days. Cross-sectional results were compared with 33 age-matched controls derived from an independent cohort. RESULTS The patients with severe COVID-19 had higher plasma concentrations of GFAp (p=0.001) and NfL (p<0.001) than controls, while GFAp was also increased in patients with moderate disease (p=0.03). In severe patients an early peak in plasma GFAp decreased upon follow-up (p<0.01) while NfL showed a sustained increase from first to last follow-up (p<0.01), perhaps reflecting a sequence of early astrocytic response and more delayed axonal injury. CONCLUSION We show neurochemical evidence of neuronal injury and glial activation in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. Further studies are needed to clarify the frequency and nature of COVID-19-related CNS damage, and its relation to both clinically-defined CNS events such as hypoxic and ischemic events and to mechanisms more closely linked to systemic SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequent immune activation, and also to evaluate the clinical utility of monitoring plasma NfL and GFAp in management of this group of patients.","Kanberg, Nelly; Ashton, Nicholas J; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Yilmaz, Aylin; Lindh, Magnus; Nilsson, Staffan; Price, Richard W; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Gisslén, Magnus",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546655/,63

In this context, the presence of comorbidities appears to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, the role of digestive manifestations is not yet well defined. The primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 compared to controls. The secondary aim was to determine the association of GI-symptoms and digestive comorbidities with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS Inpatients with COVID-19 and controls with similar symptoms and/or radiological findings were enrolled. Symptoms at admission and throughout hospitalization were collected as they were comorbidities. The measured clinical outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit admission and cumulative endpoint. RESULTS A total of 105 patients were included: 34 with COVID-19 and 71 controls. At admission, the prevalence of GI symptoms among COVID-19 patients was 8.8%. During hospitalization, the frequency of GI symptoms was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (p=0.004). Among patients with COVID-19, the mortality and a cumulative endpoint rates of those with GI symptoms were both lower than for those without GI symptoms (p=0.016 and p=0.000, respectively). Finally, we found digestive comorbidities to be associated with a milder course of COVID-19 (p=0.039 for cumulative endpoint). CONCLUSIONS Our results highlighted the non-negligible frequency of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19, partly attributable to the therapies implemented. In addition, the presence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities is associated with better outcomes. Most likely, digestive comorbidities do not hinder the host's immune response against SARS-COV-2, and the occurrence of GI symptoms might be linked to a faster reduction of the viral load via the faecal route.","Papa, A; Covino, M; Pizzolante, F; Miele, L; Lopetuso, L R; Bove, V; Iorio, R; Simeoni, B; Vetrone, L M; Tricoli, L; Mignini, I; Schepis, T; D'Alessandro, A; Coppola, G; Nicoletti, T; Visconti, E; Rapaccini, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_21923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706091/,63

The virus can also interact with ACE-2 receptors expressed in other tissues as in thyroid. This study predicted the complications involving the thyroid in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 11, 2020-May 31, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Sixty-nine patients who were radiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 according to thoracic CT and had previously performed thoracic CT before November 2019 were included in the study according to the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Age and gender-matched controls (No. 69) were selected with normal thoracic CT whose PCR tests were also negative. Thyroid densities of participants were calculated and compared from the previous and current thoracic CTs. Results were also compared with the control group. RESULTS Participants were composed of 69 patients (39 male, mean age 64.35 years). Thyroid densities were significantly decreased from 89HU to 76HU for whole gland, from 88HU to 76HU for right lobes and from 87.5HU to 75.5HU for left lobes at current thoracic CTs performed during COVID-19 (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001 respectively). The decrease in densities of the whole thyroid gland, both left and right lobes, was correlated with mortality (p<0.001). The changes in thyroid densities were not correlated with age nor gender. The decreases in HU values of thyroid densities for whole gland, left and right lobes, were correlated with mortality (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 is a multi-systemic disease that threatens vital organs, including the thyroid. Future studies are needed to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 and other complications.","Akkoyunlu, Y; Kalaycioglu, B; Yurtsever, I; Eren, A; Bayram, M; Mert, A; Akkoyunlu, M E",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202106_26058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156696/,63

Nine TRSs were previously reported for the arterivirus Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). In the present study, which was facilitated by next-generation sequencing, 96 SHFV body TRSs were identified that were functional in both infected MA104 cells and macaque macrophages. The abundance of sg mRNAs produced from individual TRSs was consistent over time in the two different cell types. Most of the TRSs are located in the genomic 3' region, but some are in the 5' ORF1a/1b region and provide alternative sources of nonstructural proteins. Multiple functional TRSs were identified for the majority of the SHFV 3' ORFs, and four previously identified TRSs were found not to be the predominant ones used. A third of the TRSs generated sg mRNAs with variant leader-body junction sequences. Sg mRNAs encoding E', GP2, or ORF5a as their 5' ORF as well as sg mRNAs encoding six previously unreported alternative frame ORFs or 14 previously unreported C-terminal ORFs of known proteins were also identified. Mutation of the start codon of two C-terminal ORFs in an infectious clone reduced virus yield. Mass spectrometry detected one previously unreported protein and suggested translation of some of the C-terminal ORFs. The results reveal the complexity of the transcriptional regulatory mechanism and expanded coding capacity for SHFV, which may also be characteristic of other nidoviruses.","Di, Han; Madden, Joseph C; Morantz, Esther K; Tang, Hsin-Yao; Graham, Rachel L; Baric, Ralph S; Brinton, Margo A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706696114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29073030/,63

We learned that both SARS and COVID-19 patients had thyroid abnormalities. In the limited number of SARS cases, where it was examined, decreased serum T3, T4 and TSH levels were detected. In a study of survivors of SARS approximately 7% of the patients had hypothyroidism. In the previous evaluation evidence was found that pituitary function was also affected in SARS. Others suggested a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. One result published recently indicates that a primary injury to the thyroid gland itself may play a key role in the pathogenesis of thyroid disorders in COVID-19 patients, too. Subacute thyroiditis, autoimmune thyroiditis and an atypical form of thyroiditis are complications of COVID-19. Thyroid hormone dysfunction affects the outcome by increasing mortality in critical illnesses like acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a leading complication in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a membrane-bound enzyme, which is also expressed in the thyroid gland and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses it for docking, entering as well as replication. Based on the available results obtained in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, beside others, we suggest that it is necessary to monitor thyroid hormones in COVID-19.","Speer, Gábor; Somogyi, Péter",Endocrine journal,https://doi.org/10.1507/endocrj.ej20-0443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33473054/,63

Here, we used super-resolution microscopy to directly visualize Aβ-receptor interactions at the nanometer scale. We report that one documented Aβ receptor, PrPC, specifically inhibits the polymerization of Aβ fibrils by binding to the rapidly growing end of each fibril, thereby blocking polarized elongation at that end. PrPC binds neurotoxic oligomers and protofibrils in a similar fashion, suggesting that it may recognize a common, end-specific, structural motif on all of these assemblies. Finally, two other Aβ receptors, FcγRIIb and LilrB2, affect Aβ fibril growth in a manner similar to PrPC. Our results suggest that receptors may trap Aβ oligomers and protofibrils on the neuronal surface by binding to a common molecular determinant on these assemblies, thereby initiating a neurotoxic signal.","Amin, Ladan; Harris, David A",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23507-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103486/,63

METHODS We used a convenience sample of 771 nurses working in 10 hospitals in northern Spain. The data on burnout, demand and resources at work and the perceived threat of COVID-19 were compiled in the second fortnight of April 2020 using an online questionnaire. We used several hierarchical linear regression models. RESULTS Work overload, material and human resources and social support at work were significant in explaining burnout. The perceived threat of COVID-19 variable was also significant and presented the highest regression coefficient (β =. 392). The perceived threat of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between social support at work and burnout. CONCLUSION The perceived threat of COVID-19 helped to explain the degree of burnout in nurses and moderated the relationship between social support at work and burnout. IMPACT Hospitals should implement strategies to ensure that health emergency situations are not perceived as a threat. In pandemics, the organisation should maintain clear, fluid and regular communication with the nursing staff, which would help increase staff members' confidence and sense of control.","Manzano García, G; Ayala Calvo, J C",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155716/,63

To achieve this goal, the homo-IPN of poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) was constructed first inside the channels of two kinds of porous silica, one mesoporous (PSi1) and one macroporous (PSi2), the textural properties of silica being exploited in controlling the sorption performances of the composites. The novel composites were fully characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by the nitrogen sorption/desorption isotherms (BET analysis). The sorption properties of the PSi1/AOX and PSi2/AOX composite sorbents for Sr2+ and Cs+ were investigated in batch mode, to determine the effect of solution pH, contact time, initial metal ion concentration, temperature and the presence of competitive ions on the adsorption performances. The fast kinetics of sorption was supported by the fact that ~ 80% of Sr2+ and ~ 65% of Cs+ were adsorbed in the first 30 min, the kinetic data being better described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The experimental isotherms were well fitted by the Langmuir and Sips isotherm models. The super-adsorption for Sr2+ and Cs+ is demonstrated by the values of the maximum sorption capacity of the best sorbent constructed with mesoporous silica (PSi1/IPN-AOX), which were: 344.23 mg Cs+/g and 360.23 mg Sr2+/g. The sorption process was spontaneous and endothermic for both metal ions. The presence of interfering cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+), at a concentration of 10-2 M, only slightly influenced the sorption capacity for the main cation, The composite sorbents were still highly efficient after five sorption/desorption cycles.","Dragan, Ecaterina Stela; Humelnicu, Doina; Ignat, Maria; Varganici, Cristian-Dragos",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c10983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935537/,63

METHODS Since December 2010, 15 pts were referred for surgical ablation due to persistent AF combined with biatrial dilatation (left atrium [LA] 5.0 ± 0.6 cm). Mean age was 52 ± 6 years, body mass index (BMI) 38 ± 6, duration of AF 2.8 ± 1.2 years, left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) 5.8 cm ± 0.6 cm. Ablation was performed via a bilateral endoscopic approach using bipolar RF energy application. Monitoring was achieved by an event recorder (Reveal XT Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) or repeated 24-hours Holter electrocardiogram. RESULTS All pts successfully received bilateral pulmonary vein isolation + box lesion + trigonal lesion + left atrial appendage resection. Mean duration of procedure was 235 ± 70 minutes. There was no intraoperative complication; however, one patient had persistent left phrenic nerve palsy. Mean hospital stay was 4 ± 2 days, mean follow-up time was 21 ± 11 months. Incidence of sinus rhythm (SR) was 67, 73, and 80% at discharge, three months, and 12 months follow-up. Mean LA diameter was reduced from 58.1 mm ± 6.0 mm preoperative to 49.7 mm ± 5.4 mm (p = 0.004) at 12 months follow-up. Incidence of SR was 86% at latest follow-up (mean time 21 months). All pts currently in SR (13/15 = 86%) are of class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs. CONCLUSION Totally endoscopic left atrial ablation including left atrial resection can safely be performed. It achieved excellent rates of SR restoration in patients with long-standing persistent AF combined with significant atrial dilatation.","Wagner, Florian Mathias; Pecha, Simon; Conradi, Lenard; Reichenspurner, Hermann",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.12523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25754505/,63

117008,Abstract Journal Surgical Education.,2021-05-01,"Objective: Telemental health (TMH) is not well described for mental health service delivery during crises. Most child and adolescent psychiatry training programs have not integrated TMH into their curricula and are ill equipped to respond during crises to their patients' needs. In this study, we present the implementation of a home-based TMH (HB-TMH) service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We describe the technological, administrative, training, and clinical implementation components involved in transitioning a comprehensive outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry program to a HB-TMH virtual clinic. Results: The transition was accomplished in 6 weeks. Most in-clinic services were rapidly moved off campus to the home. Owing to challenges encountered with each implementation component, phone sessions bridged the transition from in-clinic to reliable virtual appointments. Within 3 weeks (March 20, 2020) of planning for HB-TMH, 67% of all appointments were conducted at home, and within 4 weeks (March 27, 2020), 90% were conducted at home. By week 6 (April 3, 2020), reliable HB-TMH appointments were implemented. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic crisis created the opportunity to innovate a solution to disrupted care for our established patients and to create a resource for youth who developed problems during the crisis. Our department was experienced in providing TMH services that facilitated the transition to HB-TMH, yet still had to overcome known and unanticipated challenges. Our experience provides a roadmap for establishing a HB-TMH service with focus on rapid implementation. It also demonstrates a role for TMH during (rather than after) future crises when usual community resources are not available.","Sharma, Aditi; Sasser, Tyler; Schoenfelder Gonzalez, Erin; Vander Stoep, Ann; Myers, Kathleen",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2020.0062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32639849/,63

It was first notified by China from Wuhan on 31 December 2020 and transmission to healthcare workers was first reported on 20 January 2020. Human-to-human transmission is mainly by droplet infection. At present no effective vaccine is available. Our speciality needs to collectively address the urgent issue of risk of transmission in dermatology practice. A case series of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan described that 41.3% of their patients may have acquired the infection from the hospital. Of all the infected health care workers, 77.5% worked in general wards and departments. These data highlight the significant risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 and also the higher risk in general wards and departments compared to the emergency room or intensive care unit. Dermatology patients are generally seen in clinics and in outpatient departments in hospitals. Patients wait together in the waiting area, intermingle and then are seen by the physician in their chamber. This can cause transmission of the pathogen among patients and from patient to physician. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment are important for preventing the spread of infection and dermatology practices also have to incorporate these aspects. Telemedicine is becoming an important tool for the management of dermatology patients in these times. At-risk patients in dermatology also need to be given priority care.

It is known that in a plate with a symmetric discontinuity, with respect to the plate's mid-plane, mode conversion is restricted to modes that share the same symmetry as the incident mode. In this paper, we use an analytical model based on the reciprocity principle and finite element analysis to investigate mode conversion due to the interaction with different types of discontinuity, namely, non-symmetric, symmetric and geometrically symmetric but with opposite boundary conditions, that is one side of the discontinuity free and the other rigidly fixed. We show that the reflected field due to interaction with the latter is virtually restricted to modes with the opposite symmetry of the incident one, acting as a symmetry inverter discontinuity. Unlike fully symmetric discontinuities, the effectiveness of a symmetry inverter discontinuity depends on the frequency. This was proved with aid of the analytical model for a full-depth discontinuity and verified for partial depth discontinuities. Finally, symmetry inversion of SH waves was experimentally verified in acrylic plates which were symmetrically machined and filled with steel in one side to mimic a fixed boundary condition.","Kubrusly, Alan C; Tovar, Pedro; von der Weid, Jean Pierre; Dixon, Steve",Ultrasonics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385707/,63

DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING Fourteen hospitals in Henan Province. PARTICIPANTS 865 patients with renal dysfunction undergoing dialysis using catheters between October 2013 and October 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures were complications, risk factors and patient characteristics. Catheter-related complications included catheter-related infection (catheter exit-site infection, catheter tunnel infection and catheter-related bloodstream infection), catheter dysfunction (thrombosis, catheter malposition or kinking, and fibrin shell formation) and central vein stenosis. RESULTS The overall incidence rate was 7.74/1000 catheter-days, affecting 38.61% of all patients, for catheter infections, 10.58/1000 catheter-days, affecting 56.65% of all patients, for catheter dysfunction, and 0.68/1000 catheter-days, affecting 8.79% of all patients, for central vein stenosis. Multivariate analysis showed that increased age, diabetes, primary educational level or below, rural residence, lack of a nephropathy visit before dialysis and pre-established permanent vascular access, not taking oral drugs to prevent catheter thrombus, lower serum albumin levels and higher ferritin levels were independently associated with catheter infections. Rural residence, not taking oral drugs to prevent thrombus, lack of an imaging examination after catheter insertion, non-tunnel catheter type, lack of medical insurance, lack of nephropathy visit before dialysis and pre-established permanent vascular access, left-sided catheter position, access via the femoral vein and lower haemoglobin level were independently associated with catheter dysfunction. Diabetes, lack of nephropathy visit before dialysis and pre-established permanent vascular access, lack of oral drugs to prevent catheter thrombus, left-sided catheter location and higher number of catheter insertions, were independently associated with central vein stenosis. CONCLUSIONS The rate of catheter-related complications was high in patients with end-stage renal disease in Henan Province.

However, there is minimal knowledge on how technology-enhanced interventions for youth correspond to the stages of care, from illness or risk recognition to treatment follow-up. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of technology-enhanced youth suicide prevention and interventions across the continuum of care. METHODS Four electronic databases were searched up to spring 2019 for youth suicide preventive interventions that used technology. The review was not restricted by study design and eligible studies could report outcomes on suicidality or related behaviors, such as formal treatment initiation. An adapted version of the Methodological Quality Ratings Scale was used to assess study quality. RESULTS A total of 26 studies were identified. The findings support the emerging efficacy of technology-enhanced interventions, including a decline in suicidality and an increase in proactive behaviors. However, evidence suggests that there are gaps in the continuum of care and recent study samples do not represent the diverse identities of vulnerable youth. CONCLUSIONS The majority of identified studies were conducted in school settings and were universal interventions that aligned with the illness and risk recognition and help-seeking stages of the continuum of care. This field could be strengthened by having future studies target the stages of assessment and treatment initiation, include diverse youth demographics, and examine the varying roles of providers and technological components in emerging interventions.","Szlyk, Hannah; Tan, Jia",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/18672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33034568/,63

Clinical parameters, aneurysm characteristics, technical results and short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Eleven intracranial aneurysms were treated with the FRED in 11 patients. The technical device deployment success rate was 100%. Immediate reduction in intra-aneurysmal flow after deployment was noted in 10 cases. The aneurysm occlusion rate at 6 months was 75%. There was 1 complication of in-stent thrombosis immediately after deployment. There was no side branch occlusion, delayed aneurysm rupture, stroke, or intraparenchymal haemorrhage. There was no neurological deficit, morbidity, or mortality. CONCLUSION The FRED is a new FD. It has shown to be safe and effective in our series. The unique dual-layer design of the device renders it to have technical advantages over other FDs. The 6-month aneurysm occlusion rate and complication profile of FRED are similar to other FDs.","Mahboobani, Neeraj Ramesh; Chong, Wing Ho; Lam, Samuel Siu Kei; Siu, Jimmy Chi Wai; Tan, Chong Boon; Wong, Yiu Chung",Neurointervention,https://doi.org/10.5469/neuroint.2017.12.1.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28316865/,63

METHODS AND RESULTS Clinical characteristics, reperfusion therapy modalities, COVID-19 status and in-hospital mortality of consecutive STEMI patients who were admitted to Belgian hospitals for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were recorded during a three-week period starting at the beginning of the lockdown period on 13 March 2020. Similar data were collected for the same time period for 2017-2019. An evaluation of air quality revealed a 32% decrease in ambient NO2 concentrations during lockdown (19.5 µg/m³ versus 13.2 µg/m³, p < .001). During the three-week period, there were 188 STEMI patients admitted for PCI during the lockdown versus an average 254 STEMI patients before the lockdown period (incidence rate ratio = 0.74, p = .001). Reperfusion strategy was predominantly primary PCI in both time periods (96% versus 95%). However, there was a significant delay in treatment during the lockdown period, with more late presentations (>12 h after onset of pain) (14% versus 7.6%, p = .04) and with longer door-to-balloon times (median of 45 versus 39 min, p = .02). Although the in-hospital mortality between the two periods was comparable (5.9% versus 6.7%), 5 of the 7 (71%) COVID-19-positive STEMI patients died. CONCLUSION The present study revealed a 26% reduction in STEMI admissions and a delay in treatment of STEMI patients. Less exposure to external STEMI triggers (such as ambient air pollution) and/or reluctance to seek medical care are possible explanations of this observation.","Claeys, Marc J; Argacha, Jean-François; Collart, Philippe; Carlier, Marc; Van Caenegem, Olivier; Sinnaeve, Peter R; Desmet, Walter; Dubois, Philippe; Stammen, Francis; Gevaert, Sofie; Pourbaix, Suzanne; Coussement, Patrick; Beauloye, Christophe; Evrard, Patrick; Brasseur, Olivier; Fierens, Frans; Marechal, Patrick; Schelfaut, Dan; Floré, Vincent; Hanet, Claude",Acta cardiologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015385.2020.1796035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727305/,63

PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective review was carried out of patients admitted to the ICU following cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer in a single tertiary referral centre from 2015-2019. Patients were categorized according to length of ICU stay (<48 h and ≥48 h), and peri-operative variables were compared across the two groups. RESULTS A total of 56 patients were admitted to the ICU post-operatively, 37 for <48 h and 19 for ≥48 h (range=3-11 days). Greater duration of procedure and estimated blood loss, bowel resection, higher post-operative lactate level, lower post-operative albumin level and requirement for post-operative blood products were associated with prolonged ICU stay. Increased intraoperative fluid requirement was an independent predictor of extended ICU stay. CONCLUSION Utilizing identified intra-operative risk factors to perform individualized risk assessments might improve planning of ICU resources. Optimizing intraoperative fluid management may improve short-term patient outcomes.","Collins, Anna; Spooner, Stephanie; Horne, Jonathan; Chainrai, Mira; Runau, Franscois; Bourne, Tim; Moss, Esther L; Davies, Quentin; Chattopadhyay, Supratik; Bharathan, Rasiah",Anticancer research,https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.15089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083298/,63

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 65 symptomatic patients were prospectively enrolled for the study and underwent STD and LD CTC with filtered-back projection, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and MBIR to allow direct per-patient comparison. Objective image noise, subjective image analyses, and polyp detection were assessed. RESULTS Objective image noise analysis demonstrates significant noise reduction using MBIR technique (P < .05) despite being acquired at lower doses. Subjective image analyses were superior for LD MBIR in all parameters except visibility of extracolonic lesions (two-dimensional) and visibility of colonic wall (three-dimensional) where there were no significant differences. There was no significant difference in polyp detection rates (P > .05). Doses: LD (dose-length product, 257.7), STD (dose-length product, 483.6). CONCLUSIONS LD MBIR CTC objectively shows improved image noise using parameters in our study. Subjectively, image quality is maintained. Polyp detection shows no significant difference but because of small numbers needs further validation. Average dose reduction of 47% can be achieved. This study confirms feasibility of using MBIR in this context of CTC in symptomatic population.","Vardhanabhuti, Varut; James, Julia; Nensey, Rehaan; Hyde, Christopher; Roobottom, Carl",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2014.12.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25683499/,63

This review highlights the mechanistic, clinical and safety data with regards to hydroxychloroquine use in novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with or without metabolic syndrome. PubMed and Medline were searched for articles published from January 1970 to March 2020 using the terms 'COVID-19', 'corona-virus 2019', 'hydroxychloroquine', 'hypertension', 'diabetes', 'cardiac disease', 'retina' and 'kidney disease'. Hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are the three most common comorbidities in people with COVID-19, meaning that such people have greater morbidity and mortality. Mechanistically, hydroxychloroquine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 virus uptake into cells by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 glycosylation. This inhibits lysosome activation and the associated cytokine storm, thus reducing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which is the primary cause of death. Small, in-human studies have shown hydroxychloroquine to improve outcomes in COVID-19, either alone or in combination with azathioprine and other antiviral medications. Retina safety is not an issue with short term use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. Dose reduction is warranted when glomerular filtration rate is <50 mL/min. Cardiac monitoring is warranted in people with established cardiac disease, and cardiac rhythm should be closely monitored when hydroxychloroquine is used with azithromycin, lopinavir, ritonavir or remdesivir. Anti-diabetes medication doses may need to be reduced during treatment with hydroxychloroquine. While we await data from large, in-human trials, short-term use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 is justified, as this molecule has stood the test of time with regards to use in humans for other indications.","Dutta, Deep; Sharma, Meha; Sharma, Rahul",European endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.17925/ee.2020.16.2.109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117441/,63

To assess the validity of the hypothesis, I propose a periodization of the economic, political, and social changes that occurred in Latin America in the past decades. RECENT FINDINGS A brief review of recent studies on social determinants of mental health (with a focus on Brazil), considering research findings by historical context, shows that urbanization-modernization-migration variables were more present in the literature in the decades of 1980 and 1990, whereas social inequity factors (gender, ethnicity/race, and racism) came to be dominant as a research question after the year 2000.

The purpose of this study is to describe the dental management of patients undergoing pre-HSCT examination with the Dental Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and to report on odontogenic complications. METHODS Patients referred for evaluation as part of the standard preparation for HSCT were included. Following clinical and radiological examination, patients were assigned to one of three groups based on risk of odontogenic infection, and treatment was provided as indicated. Patients were followed, and their medical records were reviewed for odontogenic complications during the transplant admission. RESULTS Of the 375 patients evaluated, 350 patients underwent HSCT: allogeneic 143 (40.9%) and autologous 207 (59.1%). The distribution of primary cancer diagnosis was as follows: multiple myeloma 104 (29.7%), leukemias 95 (27.1%), Hodgkin's lymphoma 28 (8.0%), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 99 (28.3%), and other conditions 24 (6.9%). The median time from dental evaluation to transplant was 29 days. The median Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth Index was 17. The median Community Periodontal Index was 1. Based on dental status, 145 patients (41.4%) were classified as low risk, 133 (38%) as moderate risk and 72 (20.6%) as high risk of odontogenic infection. One hundred fourteen patients (32.6%) required dental treatment prior to HSCT, and 100 of these (28.6%) completed treatment. Two (0.57%) patients had odontogenic complications. CONCLUSIONS With conservative pre-HSCT dental treatment based on an infection risk classification system, a low odontogenic complication rate was observed.","Hansen, Heidi J; Estilo, Cherry; Owosho, Adepitan; Solano, Armand Karl; Randazzo, Joseph; Huryn, Joseph; Yom, SaeHee K",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05733-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901321/,63

125149,Materials and methods for delivery of biological drugs.,2016,"The increasing global burden of obesity and its associated comorbidities has created an urgent need for additional treatment options to fight this pandemic. Endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) provide an effective and minimally invasive treatment approach to obesity that would increase treatment options beyond surgery, medications, and lifestyle measures. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Bariatric Endoscopy Task Force comprising experts in the subject area and the ASGE Technology Committee Chair to specifically assess whether acceptable performance thresholds outlined by an ASGE Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovations (PIVI) document for clinical adoption of available EBTs have been met. After conducting a comprehensive search of several English-language databases, we performed direct meta-analyses by using random-effects models to assess whether the Orbera intragastric balloon (IGB) (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Tex) and the EndoBarrier duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve (DJBS) (GI Dynamics, Lexington, Mass) have met the PIVI thresholds. The meta-analyses results indicate that the Orbera IGB meets the PIVI thresholds for both primary and nonprimary bridge obesity therapy. Based on a meta-analysis of 17 studies including 1683 patients, the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) with the Orbera IGB at 12 months was 25.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.47%-29.41%) (random model) with a mean difference in %EWL over controls of 26.9% (95% CI, 15.66%-38.24%; P ≤ .01) in 3 randomized, controlled trials. Furthermore, the pooled percentage of total body weight loss (% TBWL) after Orbera IGB implantation was 12.3% (95% CI, 7.9%–16.73%), 13.16% (95% CI, 12.37%–13.95%), and 11.27% (95% CI, 8.17%–14.36%) at 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation, respectively, thus exceeding the PIVI threshold of 5% TBWL for nonprimary (bridge) obesity therapy. With the data available, the DJBS liner does appear to meet the %EWL PIVI threshold at 12 months, resulting in 35% EWL (95% CI, 24%-46%) but does not meet the 15% EWL over control required by the PIVI. We await review of the pivotal trial data on the efficacy and safety of this device. Data are insufficient to evaluate PIVI thresholds for any other EBT at this time. Both evaluated EBTs had ≤5% incidence of serious adverse events as set by the PIVI document to indicate acceptable safety profiles. Our task force consequently recognizes the Orbera IGB for meeting the PIVI criteria for the management of obesity. As additional data from the other EBTs become available, we will update our recommendations accordingly.","Abu Dayyeh, Barham K; Kumar, Nitin; Edmundowicz, Steven A; Jonnalagadda, Sreenivasa; Larsen, Michael; Sullivan, Shelby; Thompson, Christopher C; Banerjee, Subhas",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2015.03.1964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26232362/,63

However, there is a significant lack of an open source, expandable research tool that features latest hardware and data analysis. In this work, we propose an open research platform termed OpenHSV that is based on state-of-the-art, commercially available equipment and features a fully automatic data analysis pipeline. A publicly available, user-friendly graphical user interface implemented in Python is used to interface the hardware. Video and audio data are recorded in synchrony and are subsequently fully automatically analyzed. Video segmentation of the glottal area is performed using efficient deep neural networks to derive glottal area waveform and glottal midline. Established quantitative, clinically relevant video and audio parameters were implemented and computed. In a preliminary clinical study, we recorded video and audio data from 28 healthy subjects. Analyzing these data in terms of image quality and derived quantitative parameters, we show the applicability, performance and usefulness of OpenHSV. Therefore, OpenHSV provides a valid, standardized access to high-speed videoendoscopy data acquisition and analysis for voice scientists, highlighting its use as a valuable research tool in understanding voice physiology.

METHODS We undertook an integrative literature review informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019138938). Electronic databases were systematically search using keywords and hand searching of reference articles and grey literature was also completed. RESULTS Ten empirical studies and five theoretical articles were included in the synthesis. Empirical studies provided more information about meeting structure, whereas theoretical articles more frequently described a desired process for planning and undertaking meetings. No articles identified how the success of a meeting was defined or made recommendations for doing so. Despite reports that family meetings are commonly occurring, few articles described outcomes from either the family or clinician perspectives. CONCLUSIONS Family meetings are essential communication strategies commonly used in paediatric palliative care, yet there is little guidance about how meetings should be organised and conducted, who should participate and when they should occur. The limited data available on the outcomes of family meetings suggest improvements are required to meet the needs of families. We present a framework that synthesises the available evidence. The framework offers an overview of the elements to consider when planning for and undertaking family meetings in paediatric palliative care and may be useful for both clinicians and researchers.","Bradford, Natalie; Rolfe, Melanie; Ekberg, Stuart; Mitchell, Geoffrey; Beane, Theresa; Ferranti, Kahli; Herbert, Anthony",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680893/,63

METHODS Twelve cadaver tracheae were randomly selected to be intubated with either cuffed or self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes. To test tracheal seal efficacy, the tracheae were positioned vertically, 5 mL of water was instilled proximal to the tube cuff or baffles and they were monitored for leakage at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, recording the total volume leaked. To test fluid removal at extubation, the tracheae were intubated, then 5.6 g of 60% barium sulphate suspension was instilled proximal to the seal and left undisturbed for 5 minutes. The tubes were then extubated, with the cuffed endotracheal tubes being partially deflated before extubation, and the amount of barium recovered was weighed. These procedures were repeated on the same tracheae using the other endotracheal tubes. To test whether self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes would release pressure at ≥30 cm H2O, the tracheae were intubated, connected to an anaesthetic machine and pressurised to 30 cm H2O for 5 minutes and then 50 cm H2O for 5 minutes. Release of pressure was defined as a decrease in pressure within the closed anaesthetic circuit. RESULTS More cuffed (7/12) than baffled (0/12) endotracheal tubes leaked water after 60 minutes (p=0.016). The mean amount of barium removed by the self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes (4.9 (95% CI=3.8-4.4) g) was greater than that removed by the partially deflated cuffed endotracheal tubes (0.4 (95% CI=0.14-0.66) g) (p<0.001). None of the self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes released pressure at ≥30 cm H2O in a closed anaesthetic circuit. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes were more effective than cuffed endotracheal tubes at both preventing fluid leakage at the tracheal seal and removing fluid from the lumen of the trachea in cadaver tracheae. However they did not release pressure when the closed-circuit system was at ≥30 cm H2O in a canine cadaver model. The self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes may be a suitable substitute for cuffed endotracheal tubes.","Loomis, S L; Okrasinski, E B",New Zealand veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2018.1502101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30056782/,63

Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease for at least 3 months, assessed as moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease at screening, defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 220-450, with mucosal ulcers in the ileum or colon, or both, and a Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) of at least 7 (≥4 for patients with isolated ileitis) on ileocolonoscopy scored by a masked central reader. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 using an interactive response system to a double-blind investigational product, and stratified by previous exposure to TNF antagonists (yes vs no). Patients received intravenous 200 mg risankizumab, 600 mg risankizumab, or placebo, at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The primary outcome was clinical remission (CDAI <150) at week 12 (intention-to-treat population). Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02031276. FINDINGS Between March, 2014, and September, 2015, 213 patients were screened, and 121 patients randomised. At baseline, 113 patients (93%) had been previously treated with at least one tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist (which had failed in 96 [79%]). At week 12, 25 (31%) of 82 risankizumab patients (pooled 41 patients in 200 mg and 41 patients in 600 mg arms) had clinical remission versus six (15%) of 39 placebo patients (difference vs placebo 15·0%, 95% CI 0·1 to 30·1; p=0·0489). Ten (24%) of 41 patients who received 200 mg risankizumab had clinical remission (9·0%, -8·3 to 26·2; p=0·31) and 15 (37%) of 41 who received the 600 mg dose (20·9%, 2·6 to 39·2; p=0·0252). 95 (79%) patients had adverse events (32 in the placebo group, 32 randomised to 200 mg risankizumab, 31 randomised to 600 mg risankizumab); 18 had severe adverse events (nine, six, three); 12 discontinued (six, five, one); 24 had serious adverse events (12, nine, three). The most common adverse event was nausea and most common serious adverse event was worsening of underlying Crohn's disease. No deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION In this short-term study, risankizumab was more effective than placebo for inducing clinical remission in patients with active Crohn's disease. Therefore, selective blockade of interleukin-23 via inhibition of p19 might be a viable therapeutic approach in Crohn's disease.

128246,Chemotaxis strategies of bacteria with multiple run modes.,2020-05-01,"The transition toward sustainable agriculture requires rethinking cropping systems in the light of less intensive and chemically reliant practices. Weed management is one of the target practices to evolve cropping systems with decreased impact on the environment. While softened management will lead to increased weeds/crops coexistence, it is of importance to assess the relative benefits and drawbacks of new practices. Among the potential drawbacks of weeds/crops coexistence, disease risk may increase if weeds are hosting pathogens. In this study, we assessed the potential of weeds for hosting pathogenic generalist fungi known to translate into disease in crops. We first describe prevalence in fields after harvest and relate prevalence to species characteristics and communities. Then, we directly test the idea that weeds serve as inoculums sources during cropping with a natural experiment. This study highlights variation in host skill among feral weeds for Colletotrichum species, including potential congeneric sub-specialization on different weeds within communities. Last, prevalence within fields was more correlated to focal crop inoculation rates compared to local weed load, but there was a significant correlation effect with prevalence on weeds in the vicinity of fields, suggesting that weeds are mediating disease levels at the local scale, too. Results pointed to the importance of weed host skill in disease risk yet open the door to the potential control of pathogens via targeted weed management.","Dentika, Pauline; Ozier-Lafontaine, Harry; Penet, Laurent",Journal of fungi,https://doi.org/10.3390/jof7040283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918581/,63

The strong chelation power of amidoxime groups (AO) with uranium and ZIF-90's mesoporous structure afforded ZIF-90-AO high maximum uranium adsorption capacity of 468.3 mg/g (pH = 5). In addition, the factors affecting uranium adsorption process were investigated by a batch of adsorption tests under different adsorption conditions. ZIF-90-AO displayed good selectivity to UO22+ in the solution containing multiple co-existing ions and good regeneration property. More importantly, ZIF-90-AO showed excellent antimicrobial property against both E. coli and S. aureus. Therefore, ZIF-90-AO is a U-adsorbent with great application value for removing U (VI) from wastewater due to the high U (VI) adsorption capacity in weak acid condition and good anti-biofouling properties.","Mei, Douchao; Liu, Lijia; Li, Huan; Wang, Yudan; Ma, Fuqiu; Zhang, Chunhong; Dong, Hongxing",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399212/,63

We present the first case series utilizing the Triport+, and methodology through a single 15-mm periumbilical fascial incision. METHODS The 4 lumen multi-channel port was placed in the umbilicus through a measured 15-mm fascial incision. Instrument design and placement in the port is specific to the performance of the SPC. Retrospective review of the cases was performed. RESULTS 15 SPCs were performed without complications. No conversions or additional ports were required. Fascial defect size measured was 15 mm. Visualization of the critical view was obtained in each case. The mean total operative time was 36 minutes. CONCLUSION The Triport+ and novel SPC methodology successfully replicate the standard of retraction and exposure in traditional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Such studies can be very effective when donors provide access to linkage of their data to external health databases, and storage and genomic testing of their blood sample. In this study, we aimed to assess the willingness of Australian blood donors to provide additional data and blood sample for donation-related and other health research. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We invited 2017 donors to complete a survey using four methods (postal letter, postal letter and email, email only, and in-center recruitment). The survey asked for information on demographics, lifestyle behaviors, health, experience and attitude to blood donation, and willingness to give blood sample and additional data for research. RESULTS Response rates ranged from 23.8% for email only to 77.2% for in-center recruitment. Of those who responded (n = 827), 95.5% indicated they would be willing to provide a blood sample for donation and transfusion-related research. Of these, >90.0% were willing for their sample to be used in research involving genetic testing and other health-related topics. Also, >90.0% were willing to consent for linkage of their information to external health databases. CONCLUSIONS Donors surveyed reported a high willingness to participate in health research by completing surveys, allowing linkage to external datasets, and providing a blood sample. These findings provide strong support for future longitudinal research studies with Australian blood donors.","Karki, Surendra; Gemelli, Carley N; Davison, Tanya E; Masser, Barbara M; Marks, Denese C; Bell, Katy; Liu, Bette; Hayen, Andrew; van den Hurk, Katja; Irving, David O",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423437/,63
131256,Robotic nephroureterectomy: a simplified approach requiring no patient repositioning or robot redocking.,2014,"Laparoscopic surgery has gained prominence in recent decades and employed in minimally invasive surgeries to avoid massive cuts resulting in a reduction in pain, the chance of infection, and duration of stay in the hospital. Maryland forceps, which belongs to the category of grasper instruments, are often used in minimally invasive surgeries to hold, pull, push, manipulate, and perform dissection operations. During laparoscopic surgeries, often blood and other body fluids ooze from the site of surgery. Typically, suction-irrigation (SI) devices are used to periodically clear these fluids to get a better view of the site of surgery. To achieve this, the removal and insertion of multiple instruments are required. This process has to be repeated numerous times, which significantly increases the time needed for surgery. Literature survey and feedback from practicing surgeons suggest that this can be avoided by improving the current design of forceps. In this article, a modified design is proposed by combining the SI feature with the existing form of Maryland forceps. The modified design is first modeled in SolidWorks and then analyzed for fluid flow using ANSYS Fluent. Parametric analysis is performed to obtain the optimal design for the proposed multi-functional instrument, which can potentially improve the overall efficiency of the laparoscopic surgical process.","Junaidi, Md Abdul Raheem; Kalluri, Ram Chandra Murthy; Rao, Y V Daseswara; Gokhale, Alla Gopala Krishna; Patel, Aakrit",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2020.1855331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305607/,63

The inflow-outflow occlusion technique features: dividing the superior pulmonary vein first, then proximal control by clamping the main pulmonary artery (PA), and then distal control by clamping the inferior pulmonary vein. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of a prospective database was carried out. Patients who underwent left upper lobectomy and required clamping of the vessels were compared to those that did not. RESULTS Between January 1999 and March 2010,1796 lobectomies were performed and 360 (23%) of these were left upper lobectomies. Of these, 84 (23%) required the inflow-outflow occlusion technique. There were 70 (83%) men (median age 65 years). Fifty-one patients (61%) required resection of the PA and 33 did not. Heparin was not used in the last 17 patients. These 84 patients were compared to the remaining 276 patients who underwent standard left upper lobectomy. Although the median operative time was longer (150 vs 105 min, p < 0.001) and the median blood loss was greater (120 vs 87 ml, p = 0.03) for the inflow-outflow technique, there were no significant differences in hospital length of stay, morbidity, or mortality between the two groups. CONCLUSION In our experience, clamping of the inferior pulmonary vein instead of the distal PA achieves safe distal vascular control. It affords greater PA mobility and assessment of the tumor and easier PA repair. This technique can be used even when PA resection is not required.","Minnich, Douglas J; Bryant, Ayesha S; Ashley, David H; Cerfolio, Robert J",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.05.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21703861/,63

However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of sufficient and diverse materials in current materials repositories such as the open quantum materials database (OQMD). Recent progress in deep learning have enabled generative strategies that learn implicit chemical rules for creating hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generative design of novel cubic materials. When trained on 375 749 ternary materials from the OQMD database, the authors show that the model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such materials have been verified by phonon dispersion calculation. Considering the importance of cubic materials in wide applications such as solar panels, the GAN model provides a promising approach to significantly expand existing materials repositories, enabling the discovery of new functional materials via screening.

To achieve positive surgical outcomes in these patient populations, novel approaches are needed to restore the functional, protective and aesthetic properties of skin. Herein, we provide the first report describing the staged use of a dermal regenerate template (DRT) with a spray-on epidermal regenerative modality (spray skin) in addition to autologous split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) in non-burn trauma and compare these results with those of patients treated with DRT and STSG alone. A pilot study was performed to evaluate whether the use of spray skin technology (ReCell, Avita Medical) as an adjunct to DRT (Integra, Integra Lifesciences) and autologous skin grafting in the treatment of patients with large full-thickness soft tissue losses impacts donor site burden as well as recipient and donor site re-epithelialization. In this retrospective study, two patients who were treated with DRT and STSG alone (control group) were compared with two patients who were treated with DRT and spray skin/STSG in combination (experimental group). The mechanisms of injury, total defect and treatment sizes, time to complete re-epithelialization, lengths of follow-up, outcomes and complications were reviewed. Our group observed that using a DRT in conjunction with spray skin/STSG can reduce donor site burden and decrease time to complete healing. It can also permit greater or larger meshing ratios, while aiding in improved re-pigmentation when compared with similar wounds treated with a DRT and autologous skin grafting alone.

This study sought to determine whether tumor size or depth of invasion better correlates with the presence of lymph node metastases in appendiceal adenocarcinoma, and to compare these rates with colon adenocarcinoma. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database was performed to identify patients with appendiceal or colonic adenocarcinoma from 2004 to 2013 who underwent surgical resection. Cases were categorized by tumor size and by T stage. Rates of lymph node metastases were examined as a function of size and T stage. RESULTS A total of 3,402 appendiceal and 314,864 colonic cases were identified. For appendiceal adenocarcinoma, larger tumor size was associated with higher T stage: Pearson correlation of 0.41 (95% CI 0.408 to 0.414; p < 0.001). Lymph node metastases were present in 19.1%, 27.8%, 39.6%, 39.4%, 42.4% and 39.1% for tumor sizes <1 cm, >1 to 2 cm, >2 to 3 cm, >3 to 4 cm, >4 to 5 cm, and >5 cm, respectively. Lymph node metastases were present in 0%, 11.2%, 12.3%, 35.5%, and 40.0% for in situ, T1, T2, T3, and T4 tumors, respectively. There was no difference in the rates of lymph node metastases between appendiceal and colonic adenocarcinoma for tumor sizes <3 cm, or for in situ and T1 tumors. Rates of lymph node metastases are higher in colonic adenocarcinoma for tumor sizes >3 cm and for T2, T3, and T4 tumors (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In appendiceal adenocarcinoma, the rate of lymph node metastases is substantial, even for small tumors.

Determining the prevalence of these allergic disorders can be useful in planning prevention and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and severity of allergic rhinitis and eczema in adolescents living in Yazd city. Using an electronic questionnaire based on the Global Asthma Network (GAN) core questionnaire, 5141 adolescents aged 13-14 years were cross-sectionally surveyed. The prevalence of current symptoms of rhinitis turned out to be 36.3%, proving significantly higher in boys (p=0.009). Moreover, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis in the past year leveled at 12.4% and 10.5%, respectively; however, the former was significantly higher in females (p=0.014). Additionally, severe rhinoconjunctivitis was observed in 0.2% of the participants with no gender preference (p=0.09). Confirmed hay fever by a doctor was reported in 13.2% of adolescents, significantly higher in males (p<0.001). The prevalence of current itchy rash and current eczema was found to be 5.5%, and 2.9%, respectively, with no difference in terms of gender. Severe atopic eczema and eczema confirmed by a doctor were seen in 0.4% and 5% of the participants, no gender preference was identified. Concurrent prevalence of current rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema was detected in 1% of the participants. Despite the increasing trend of allergic diseases in most parts of the world, the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in adolescents has not increased in Yazd in the last two decades, and this city is located in a low to moderate prevalence area.","Nafei, Zahra; Behniafard, Nasrin; Mirzaei, Mohsen; Karimi, Mehran; Akbarian, Elahe","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",https://doi.org/10.18502/ijaai.v20i3.6331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134448/,63

METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 64 patients who underwent surgery for TOF and 60 normal children. The angle between the left pulmonary artery and main pulmonary artery was measured using echocardiography and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Furthermore, STI was used to record the global longitudinal strain of the four-chamber view (GLS4), the global longitudinal strain of the two-chamber view (GLS2), and the global longitudinal strain of the right ventricle (RVGLS). RESULTS The GLS4, GLS2, and RVGLS values in the TOF groups with different pulmonary artery branch angles were significantly lower than those in the control group. Furthermore, the GLS2 and RVGLS values were significantly lower for angles of 90-100° and <90° (vs >100°). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that pulmonary regurgitation and the angle between the left and main pulmonary arteries were two important factors affecting RVGLS. The Bland-Altman consistency test revealed good agreement regarding the pulmonary artery branch angles measured using echocardiography and CTA. CONCLUSION In patients with TOF, the RVGLS was lower for acute left pulmonary artery angulation than for round and blunt left pulmonary artery angulation. The angle of the pulmonary artery branches was an important factor affecting RVGLS. Echocardiography can be used to measure the angle of the pulmonary artery branches, which provides valuable information for surgical correction of pulmonary artery morphology.","Zhang, Shuai; He, Xinjian; Liu, Lei; Fan, Yanhui; Chen, Jiaoyang; Yang, Lu; Cui, Yun; Fan, Di",Echocardiography,https://doi.org/10.1111/echo.14948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594857/,63

The purpose of this study was to develop a score that incorporates both preoperative and intraoperative factors so that it could be used for patients admitted to a cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU) immediately after surgery. METHOD Preoperative and intraoperative data from 30,350 patients in four hospitals were used to build a multiple logistic regression model estimating 30-day mortality after cardiac surgery. Sixty percent of the patients were used as a derivation group and forty percent as a validation group. RESULTS Mortality occurred in 2.6% of patients (n = 790). Preoperative factors identified in the model were age, female sex, emergency status, pulmonary hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, renal dysfunction, diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, history of alcohol abuse, and refusal of blood products. Intraoperative risk factors included the need for an intra-aortic balloon pump, ventricular assist device or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation leaving the operating room, presence of any intraoperative complication reported by the surgeon, the use of inotropes, high-dose vasopressors, red blood cell transfusion, and cardiopulmonary bypass time. When used after surgery at ICU admission, the model had C-statistics of 0.86 in both derivation and validation sets to estimate the 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative and intraoperative variables can be used on admission to a cardiac surgical ICU to estimate 30-day mortality. The score could be used for risk stratification after cardiac surgery and evaluation of performance of cardiac surgical ICUs.","Lamarche, Yoan; Elmi-Sarabi, Mahsa; Ding, Lillian; Abel, James G; Sirounis, Demetrios; Denault, André Y",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.11.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27998608/,63

METHODS Transcripts encoding TLRs were assayed by quantitative real time RT-PCR on peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with HIV-1 infection who were responding or not responding to antiretroviral therapy and healthy control subjects. RESULTS Chronic HIV-1-infected patients who failed to respond to therapy showed reduced expression of TLRs 3, 4 and 9, together with increased expression of TLR7, as compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, a trend towards a higher expression of TLR3 and TLR9 was observed in responder patients compared with non-responders. In addition, we found lower levels of TRLs 3, 7 and 9 in patients with high levels of HIV-1 RNA compared to those with lower levels of viremia. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that in chronic HIV-1-positive patients who were failing to respond to the therapy, there were substantial changes in TLRs expression.

At post mortem examination, the main gross features were fluid caecal and intestinal contents. Histological examination of tissues was largely unremarkable, apart from some sections that showed crypt dilation and flattened epithelia. Negative contrast electron microscopy of caecal contents revealed virus particles, which in size and morphology had the appearance of a coronavirus. RNA was extracted (turkey/UK/412/00) and used in a number of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) with the oligonucleotides based on sequences derived from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus of domestic fowl. The RT-PCRs confirmed that turkey/UK/412/00 was a coronavirus and, moreover, showed that it had the same partial gene order (S-E-M-5-N-3' untranslated region) as IBV. This gene order is unlike that of any known mammalian coronavirus, which does not have a gene analogous to the gene 5 of IBV.The gene 5 of the turkey virus had two open reading frames, 5a and 5b, as in IBV and the coronaviruses isolated from turkeys in North America. The turkey/UK/412/00 also resembled IBV, but not mammalian coronaviruses, in having three open reading frames in the gene encoding E protein (gene 3). The percentage differences between the nucleotide sequences of genes 3 and 5 and the 3' untranslated region of turkey/UK/412/00 when compared with those of IBVs were similar to the differences observed when different strains of IBV were compared with each other. No sequences unique to the turkey isolates were identified. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a coronavirus was associated with disease in turkeys outside of North America and that it is a Group 3 coronavirus, like IBV.","Cavanagh, D; Mawditt, K; Sharma, M; Drury, S E; Ainsworth, H L; Britton, P; Gough, R E",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450120066368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19184921/,63

Many USPs assume important biological roles and emerge as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. A clear understanding of USP catalytic mechanism requires a functional evaluation of the proposed key active site residues. Crystallographic data of ubiquitin aldehyde adducts of USP catalytic cores provided structural details on the catalytic triad residues, namely the conserved Cys and His, and a variable putative third residue, and inferred indirect structural roles for two other conserved residues (Asn and Asp), in stabilizing via a bridging water molecule the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate (TI). We have expressed the catalytic domain of USP2 and probed by site-directed mutagenesis the role of these active site residues in the hydrolysis of peptide and isopeptide substrates, including a synthetic K48-linked diubiquitin substrate for which a label-free, mass spectrometry based assay has been developed to monitor cleavage. Hydrolysis of ubiquitin-AMC, a model substrate, was not affected by the mutations. Molecular dynamics simulations of USP2, free and complexed with the TI of a bona fide isopeptide substrate, were carried out. We found that Asn271 is structurally poised to directly stabilize the oxyanion developed in the acylation step, while being structurally supported by the adjacent absolutely conserved Asp575. Mutagenesis data functionally confirmed this structural role independent of the nature (isopeptide vs peptide) of the bond being cleaved. We also found that Asn574, structurally located as the third member of the catalytic triad, does not fulfill this role functionally. A dual supporting role is inferred from double-point mutation and structural data for the absolutely conserved residue Asp575, in oxyanion hole formation, and in maintaining the correct alignment and protonation of His557 for catalytic competency.","Zhang, Wanfang; Sulea, Traian; Tao, Limei; Cui, Qizhi; Purisima, Enrico O; Vongsamphanh, Ratsavarinh; Lachance, Paule; Lytvyn, Viktoria; Qi, Hongtao; Li, Yuxin; Ménard, Robert",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi101958h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542621/,63

STUDY DESIGN Canine stifle motion study using a multi-cohort, repeated measures design. SAMPLE POPULATION 27 canine cadaver stifles. METHODS Hamstring grafts (HG) were affixed at the gracilis-semitendinosus insertion and on the lateral femur (1) proximal trochlear ridge (TR), (2) craniodistal to fabella (F), or (3) condyle center (CC). Total, cranial, and caudal tibial translation and total, medial, and lateral angular displacement, with and without translational load, were quantified with the CrCL intact, transected, and reconstructed. Angular displacement was quantified from points on the distal femur and proximal tibia. Graft strain was calculated from tissue displacement measured at joint angles of 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120°. RESULTS Tibial translation was lowest in F constructs, which also achieved the least difference in tibial translation from intact stifles. Tibial translation was lower in intact stifles than in CrCL transected or reconstructed stifles. Less angular displacement of the proximal tibia was detected in the medial than in the lateral direction, and tibial displacement was lower in the cranial than the caudal direction. Angular displacement was lowest in the F treatment group. F constructs had the lowest graft strain at joint angles greater than 30°. CONCLUSIONS Femoral fixation of a canine hamstring graft craniodistal to the lateral fabella conferred the best joint stability and lowest graft strain in vitro. No fixation method restored joint stability of the intact CrCL.","Ho-Eckart, Louisa K; Seki, Masahiro; Luizza, Lindsey M; Kearney, Michael T; Lopez, Mandi J",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28075493/,63

Here, we examined the relationship between net mineralization rates and relevant functional genes, as well as fungal species composition and function following Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) invasion of evergreen broadleaf forests, by studying broadleaf forests (non-invaded), mixed bamboo-broadleaf forests (moderately invaded) and bamboo forests (heavily invaded). Fungal species composition and functional genes involved in organic matter decomposition (laccase and cellobiohydrolase), N mineralization (alkaline peptidases) and nitrification (ammonia monooxygenase) were determined via high-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR. Both net ammonification and nitrification rates were generally increased with bamboo invasion into the broadleaf forest, where the net ammonification rate, on average, was 10.8 times higher than the nitrification rate across the three forest types. The fungal species composition and ecological guilds were altered with bamboo invasion, as demonstrated by the increased proportion of saprotrophs but decreased proportion of symbiotrophs in the bamboo forest. The increased net ammonification rate in bamboo forest was positively correlated with both fungal species composition and functional groups, and the fungal lcc gene (for lignin breakdown) abundance explained 67% of the variation of the net ammonification rate. In addition, the gene abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) explained 62% of the variation of net nitrification rate across the three forest types. The increased soil ammonification and nitrification rates following bamboo invasion of broadleaf forests suggest that the bamboo-invasion associated increase in soil N supply provided a positive feedback that facilitated bamboo invasion into broadleaf forests.","Chen, Zhihao; Li, Yongchun; Chang, Scott X; Xu, Qiufang; Li, Yongfu; Ma, Zilong; Qin, Hua; Cai, Yanjiang",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33736125/,63

Approximately 10 to 20% of stillbirths are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities. However, the causal nature of single-nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions in exomes has been understudied. METHODS We generated exome sequencing data for 246 stillborn cases and followed established guidelines to identify causal variants in disease-associated genes. These genes included those that have been associated with stillbirth and strong candidate genes. We also evaluated the contribution of 18,653 genes in case-control analyses stratified according to the degree of depletion of functional variation (described here as ""intolerance"" to variation). RESULTS We identified molecular diagnoses in 15 of 246 cases of stillbirth (6.1%) involving seven genes that have been implicated in stillbirth and in six disease genes that are good candidates for phenotypic expansion. Among the cases we evaluated, we also found an enrichment of loss-of-function variants in genes that are intolerant to such variation in the human population (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46 to 3.06). Loss-of-function variants in intolerant genes were concentrated in genes that have not been associated with human disease (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.34), findings that differ from those in two postnatal clinical populations that were also evaluated in this study. CONCLUSIONS Our findings establish the diagnostic utility of clinical exome sequencing to evaluate the role of small genomic changes in stillbirth. The strength of the novel risk signal (as generated through the stratified analysis) was similar to that in known disease genes, which indicates that the genetic cause of stillbirth remains largely unknown.

Although both viruses are poorly cytopathic, persistence of either virus carries a risk of chronic liver inflammation, potentially resulting in liver steatosis, liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Virus-specific T cells are a major determinant of the outcome of hepatitis, as they contribute to the early control of chronic hepatitis viruses, but they also mediate immunopathology during persistent virus infection. We have analyzed the role of platelet-derived vasoactive serotonin during virus-induced CD8(+) T cell-dependent immunopathological hepatitis in mice infected with the noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. After virus infection, platelets were recruited to the liver, and their activation correlated with severely reduced sinusoidal microcirculation, delayed virus elimination and increased immunopathological liver cell damage. Lack of platelet-derived serotonin in serotonin-deficient mice normalized hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction, accelerated virus clearance in the liver and reduced CD8(+) T cell-dependent liver cell damage. In keeping with these observations, serotonin treatment of infected mice delayed entry of activated CD8(+) T cells into the liver, delayed virus control and aggravated immunopathological hepatitis. Thus, vasoactive serotonin supports virus persistence in the liver and aggravates virus-induced immunopathology.","Lang, Philipp A; Contaldo, Claudio; Georgiev, Panco; El-Badry, Ashraf Mohammad; Recher, Mike; Kurrer, Michael; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Ludewig, Burkhard; Calzascia, Thomas; Bolinger, Beatrice; Merkler, Doron; Odermatt, Bernhard; Bader, Michael; Graf, Rolf; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Hegazy, Ahmed N; Löhning, Max; Harris, Nicola L; Ohashi, Pamela S; Hengartner, Hans; Zinkernagel, Rolf M; Lang, Karl S",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18516052/,63

Four studies (N = 808), using both hypothetical and real-life instances of conformity, support this prediction. We find that people judge those who conform to gain social approval (self-interested conformity) as weak-willed, but those who conform out of concern for their group (benevolent conformity) as competent and possessing strong character. In addition, we predict and find that people view self-interested conformity as ""fake"" but benevolent conformity as revealing one's true self. Finally, we show that differences in perceived intentions explain how people sustain positive self-regard while succumbing to group pressures and why people judge their own conformity more favorably than others' conformity.

139366,"Reactive, reproducible, collaborative: computational notebooks evolve.",2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND The role of viruses in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is poorly understood. In part, this is secondary to difficulty in isolating viruses. Although traditional detection methods for respiratory viruses have had little clinical utility, modern viral screening techniques that use molecular sequencing are now both rapid and feasible, which makes analysis of the paranasal sinus microbiome more accessible. OBJECTIVE To detect respiratory viruses in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CRS and of healthy controls as well as to correlate clinical and radiographic measures of CRS with viral presence. METHODS In this prospective study, 13 patients with CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and 8 patients without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) were enrolled and compared with 14 healthy controls. Samples were obtained from the paranasal sinuses and were screened for viral DNA with polymerase chain reaction--based sequencing techniques. Typical symptoms of CRS, the Sinonasal Questionnaire, and objective measures, including the modified Lund-Mackay and modified Lund-Kennedy scores were obtained. RESULTS Eighty percent of the positive screens (4/5) were found in patients with CRSsNP, whereas 20% of the positive tests (1/5) were in the CRSwNP group, and none of the controls tested positive (p = 0.0029). Coronavirus was the most common virus detected. Sinonasal Questionnaire scores of the patients with CRS who tested positive for viruses were higher but not statistically different than those without a positive screen (p = 0.31). Radiographic and endoscopic measures of disease were not significantly different in the setting of a positive viral screen (p = 0.12 and 0.11 respectively). CONCLUSION Although traditionally difficult, advances in molecular sequencing enhance detection of viruses in the sinonasal tract. In this study, respiratory viruses were more commonly isolated from patients with CRS compared with healthy controls. Moreover, viral infection may play a greater role in symptom exacerbation in CRSsNP than in CRSwNP. These findings warrant further investigation into the role of the viral microbiome in CRS.","Rowan, Nicholas R; Lee, Stella; Sahu, Nivedita; Kanaan, Alyssa; Cox, Stephen; Phillips, Caleb D; Wang, Eric W",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2015.29.4242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26637569/,63

METHODS Heart rate was collected throughout 24-h shifts (N = 41). Call logs were utilized post hoc to identify heart rate at the time the alarm sounded (TIMETONE), peak heart rate following the alarm (TIMEPEAK), and heart rate at the time of station departure (TIMEDEPART) for MED and FIRE calls. A 2X3 (TONE x TIME) split-plot mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significant differences tests examined the influence of tone type on heart rate, expressed as a percent of age estimated maximum. Bivariate Pearson correlations examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and TIMEPEAK and TIMEDEPART. An alpha of 0.05 determined statistical significance and Bonferroni Corrections were applied to post hoc comparisons (p < 0.017). RESULTS Follow-up analyses for the significant 2 × 3 repeated-measures ANOVA (p = 0.035) indicated differences in heart rate for MED (p < 0.001) and FIRE (p < 0.001) where TIMETONE < TIMEPEAK, TIMETONE < TIMEDEPART, and TIMEPEAK > TIMEDEPART. There was a non-significant simple effect of time for MED and FIRE at TIMETONE (p = 0.259), but significant effects of tone type where FIRE > MED at TIMEPEAK (p < 0.001) and TIMEDEPART (p = 0.002). There was a significant small positive relationship between BMI and TIMEPEAK (p = 0.002) and TIMEDEPART (p < 0.001) for MED only. CONCLUSIONS Alarms increased heart rates to a greater extent in FIRE than MED calls. Higher BMI was related to greater heart rate responses in MED but was unrelated to FIRE response.","Marciniak, Rudi A; Tesch, Cody J; Ebersole, Kyle T",International archives of occupational and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-020-01646-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423092/,63
140651,"Postoperative Recovery in Frail, Pre-frail, and Non-frail Elderly Patients Following Abdominal Surgery.",2019,"We used data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to explore potential explanations for racial-ethnic disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations and mortality. Black adults in every age group were more likely than whites to have health risks associated with severe COVID-19 illness. However, whites were older on average than blacks. Thus, when all factors were considered, whites tended to be at higher overall risk compared to blacks, with Asians and Hispanics having much lower overall levels of risk compared to either whites or blacks. We explored additional explanations for COVID-19 disparities, namely differences in job characteristics and how they interact with household composition. Blacks at high risk of severe illness were 1.6 times as likely as whites to live in households containing health-sector workers. Among Hispanic adults at high risk of severe illness, 64.5 percent lived in households with at least one worker who was unable to work at home, versus 56.5 percent among blacks and only 46.6 percent among whites.

141181,Simultaneous noninvasive recording of electrocardiogram and skin sympathetic nerve activity (neuECG).,2020-04-20,"INTRODUCTION Capsular contracture (CC) is the most common complication of breast implantation, with an incidence of nearly 50% in patients undergoing breast reconstruction with subsequent radiotherapy. Although the move toward submuscular (SM) device placement led to a decreased incidence of CC, subcutaneous (SQ) implantation has seen a resurgence. The purpose of this study was to use a rodent model of breast reconstruction with smooth silicone implants and delayed radiotherapy to assess the occurrence of CC in SQ versus SM implantation. METHODS Custom 2 mL smooth round silicone implants were placed bilaterally into 12 female Sprague Dawley rats that were randomized into 4 groups of 3, with each group differing by implantation plane (SQ vs SM) and irradiation status (irradiated vs nonirradiated). Rats from the SQ group received implants bilaterally underlying the skin on the flank. Rats in the SM groups received implants bilaterally under the latissimus dorsi muscle. Irradiated rats received 20 Gy localized to each implant on postoperative day 10. One rat from each group was imaged with a micro-computed tomography scanner at baseline and at explant 3 months later, whereupon capsules from all rats were examined histologically. RESULTS Rats in the SQ group showed evidence of contracture on gross examination and greater evidence of morphologic disruption per micro-computed tomography scan. There was no evidence of contracture or morphologic disruption in either SM group. Mean ± SD capsule thickness was 39.0 ± 9.0 μm in the SQ versus 37.6 ± 9.8 μm in the SM nonirradiated groups and 43.9 ± 14.9 μm in the SQ versus 34.3 ± 8.3 μm in the SM irradiated groups (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a rodent model of smooth silicone breast implantation and delayed radiotherapy, although there did not appear to be differences in capsule thickness regardless of device placement plane, SQ implants demonstrated gross evidence of CC. These data indicate that capsule thickness is only part of a larger pathogenetic picture, which should take into consideration the contribution from all peri-implant tissue.","Wright, Matthew A; Samadi, Arash; Lin, Alexandra J; Lara, Daniel O; Harper, Alice D; Zhao, Runlei; Spector, Jason A",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000001892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30855398/,63
141253,Widening the scope of diversity.,2020-06-26,"Background Liver injury is common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although its effect on patient outcomes has not been well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of liver injury on the prognosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods In this retrospective, single-center study, data on 109 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were extracted and analyzed. The primary composite end-point event was the use of mechanical ventilation or death. Results At admission, of the 109 patients enrolled, 56 patients (51.4%) were diagnosed with severe disease, and 39 (35.8%) presented with liver injury, which mainly manifested as elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied simultaneously by an increase in the level of γ-glutamyl transferase. A primary composite end-point event occurred in 21 patients (19.3%). Liver injury was more prevalent in patients with severe disease than in those with non-severe disease (46.4% vs. 24.5%, P=0.017). However, there was no significant difference found between severe and non-severe patients in the use of mechanical ventilation, mortality, hospital stay, or use and dosage of glucocorticoids between individuals with and without liver injury (all P>0.05). The degree of disease severity (OR =7.833, 95% CI, 1.834-31.212, P=0.005) and presence of any coexisting illness (OR =4.736, 95% CI, 1.305-17.186, P=0.018) were predictable risk factors for primary composite end-point events, whereas liver injury had no significance in this aspect (OR =0.549, 95% CI, 0.477-5.156, P=0.459). Conclusions Liver injury was more common in severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia than in non-severe cases. However, liver injury had no negative effect on the prognosis and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ma, Guo-Guang; Shen, Ya-Xing; Wu, Ling; Luo, Zhe; Zhu, Chou-Wen; Chen, Shi-Yao; Yu, Kai-Huan; Li, Feng",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553303/,63

141491,Decisions should be made case by case.,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND Approximately 14% of UK hospital in-patients receive supplemental oxygen therapy, but only 57% have valid prescriptions. Oxygen must be optimally prescribed to ensure maximal therapeutic response whilst minimising adverse outcomes (including fatality). This study investigates prescription compliance. METHODS All adults admitted to medical wards (18th February - 3rd March 2020) were included. Analyses present proportions, descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. Ethical approval was not required for this audit. RESULTS Of the 636 patients admitted, 66 (10%) were receiving oxygen therapy. Ages ranged from 34-100 years with 36 (54.5%) males and 30 (45.5%) females. The prescription was not documented in the oxygen section of the drug chart (n=37, 56.1%, p=0.389), nor did it have the physicians signature (n=40, 60.6%, p=0.110) nor date (n=46, 69.7%, p=0.002). Thirteen chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (19.7%) were at risk of hypercapnic failure (p=1.582x10-6). Target oxygen saturation (SpO2) range had been documented for 30 (45.5%) patients. A target SpO2 range of 88-92% was documented for 9 patients (13.6%), a 94-98% range documented for 11 patients (16.7%). All patients had an invalid prescription. CONCLUSION We present real-world practice in naturalistic settings, immediately before pandemic-lockdown. Enhanced compliance is advocated to reduce risks of harm and mortality.","Barrett, Ravina; Catangui, Eugene; Scott, Railton",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1826316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945710/,63
142369,An azine-based polymer derived hierarchically porous N-doped carbon for hydrophilic dyes removal.,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND 53BP1 binds to the tumor suppressor p53 and has a key role in DNA damage response and repair. Low 53BP1 expression has been associated with decreased survival in breast cancer and has been shown to interact with several prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer. The role of 53BP1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has yet to be determined. We aimed to investigate whether 53BP1 levels interact with established prognostic factors in PDAC. METHODS 106 patients for whom there was tissue available at time of surgical resection for PDAC were included. A tissue microarray was constructed using surgical specimens, stained with antibodies to 53BP1, and scored for expression intensity. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association between 53BP1 and patient survival with known prognostic factors for survival. RESULTS The association of 53BP1 with several established prognostic factors was examined, including stage, tumor grade, surgical margin, peripancreatic extension, lymph node ratio (LNR), and CA 19-9. We found that 53BP1 modified the effects of known prognostic variables including LNR and CA 19-9 on survival outcomes. When 53BP1 intensity was low, increased LNR was associated with decreased OS (HR 4.84, 95% CI (2.26, 10.37), p<0.001) and high CA19-9 was associated with decreased OS (HR 1.72, 95% CI (1.18, 2.51), p=0.005). When 53BP1 intensity was high, LNR and CA19-9 were no longer associated with OS (p=0.958 and p=0.606, respectively). CONCLUSIONS In this study, 53BP1, a key player in DNA damage response and repair, was found to modify the prognostic value of two established prognostic factors, LNR and CA 19-9, suggesting 53BP1 may alter tumor behavior and ultimately impact how we interpret the value of other prognostic factors.","Ausborn, Natalie L; Wang, Tong; Wentz, Sabrina C; Washington, Mary Kay; Merchant, Nipun B; Zhao, Zhiguo; Shyr, Yu; Chakravarthy, Anuradha Bapsi; Xia, Fen",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-13-155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530749/,63

To further reduce these deaths, the focus must expand to include building capacity of the workforce to provide high-quality obstetric and intrapartum care. Obstetric complications, such as hypertensive disorders and obstructed labor, are significant contributors to neonatal morbidity and mortality. A well-prepared workforce with the necessary knowledge, skills, attitudes, and motivation is required to rapidly detect and manage these complications to save both maternal and newborn lives. Traditional off-site, didactic, and lengthy training approaches have not always yielded the desired results. Helping Mothers Survive training was modeled after Helping Babies Breathe and incorporates further evidence-based methodology to deliver training on-site to the entire team of providers, who continue to practice after training with their peers. Research has revealed that significant gains in health outcomes can be reached by using this approach. In the coronavirus disease 2019 era, we must look to translate the best practices of these training programs into a flexible and sustainable model that can be delivered remotely to maintain quality services to women and their newborns.","Evans, Cherrie L; Kamunya, Rosemary; Tibaijuka, Gaudiosa",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-016915m; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004643/,63

METHODS AND MATERIALS Patients who underwent percutaneous RF ablation for histologically proven RCC subtypes were retrospectively reviewed. Group comparisons were done using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine factors impacting primary, secondary, and total technique effectiveness. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS One hundred pathologically proven RCC lesions in 84 patients were analyzed. The median (mean) follow-up was 24 (27) months (range 1-106 months). Overall RF ablation primary, secondary and total technique effectiveness was 86%, 9%, and 95%, respectively. Clear cell subtype demonstrated worse treatment efficacy with primary, secondary, and total technique effectiveness of 42/55 (76.4%), 8/55 (14.5%), and 50/55 (90.9%), respectively. Non-clear cell subtypes had primary, secondary, and total technique effectiveness of 44/45(97.8%), 1/45 (2.2%), 45/45 (100%), respectively. The difference in primary (p = 0.002), secondary (p = 0.032), and total (p = 0.038) technique effectiveness between the two groups was statistically significant. CONCLUSION Clear cell RCC was a novel predictor of primary, secondary, and total technique efficacy in the percutaneous RF ablation of clear cell RCC.","McClure, Timothy; Pantuck, Allan; Sayer, James; Raman, Steven",Abdominal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-017-1322-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28936542/,63

The authors use the analogy of a hiker to illustrate how different researchers studying a similar phenomenon can choose among different research directions, which lead down different paths and offer different perspectives on a problem. Following the hiker analogy, the authors use the ""Research Compass"" to categorize the 15 research papers included in the 2020 Research in Medical Education supplement according to their research aim and corresponding methodological approach. The authors then discuss implications of the relative balance of these study types within this supplement and within health professions education research at large, emphasizing the critical importance of studying a topic from multiple vantage points in order to construct a richer and more nuanced understanding of health professions education challenges. The authors conclude by recognizing the challenges we face in the current era of COVID-19 and by calling health professions education researchers and practitioners to continue our collective efforts to improve learner education and patient care, as we together navigate the unfamiliar terrain of the present day.","Sewell, Justin L; Hunderfund, Andrea N Leep; Schumacher, Daniel J; Zaidi, Zareen",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769471/,63
142868,Bacterial seed endophyte shapes disease resistance in rice.,2021-01-04,"BACKGROUND Clinical assessments for children and young people entering a mental health service help to identify the prevalence of need within that population, support intervention recommendations, and enable service evaluation. Evidence related to the use of standardised measures in an ever-expanding online environment, for the purpose of identifying need, is limited. METHODS This study explores the reliability of using a standardised measure to detect clinical need in an online therapeutic environment, and the measures assessed are as follows: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Young Person's CORE (YP-CORE) and the Short Warwick and Edinburgh Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). A deep-dive approach is used to inform practitioner assessment of young people, followed by a Weighted Cohen's Kappa (Κw) to measure the interrater reliability between this and the individuals' self-rated outcome. Composite case studies represent the complexities of presentation among the sample population. RESULTS The interrater reliability between self-rated and practitioner rated assessment varied between Κw = .222 and Κw = 0.446 depending on the measure. High levels of need and low levels of well-being were found among the sample (YP-CORE Avg. = 26.9, SDQ Avg. = 19.56, SWEMWBS Avg. = 18.1). CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate a fair to moderate reliability when assessing concordance between service users and practitioners, which suggests standardised measures are a reliable indicator of need. Higher levels of need were present than those seen previously in general or face-to-face clinical populations, which suggests using such measures in an online therapeutic environment influences the way in which assessments are responded to.","Mindel, Charlotte; Oppong, Crystal; Rothwell, Emily; Sefi, Aaron; Jacob, Jenna",Child and adolescent mental health,https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763935/,63

METHODS 25 inpatients with AN were tested roughly weekly for up to 16 weeks. Muscle power was assessed by two independent researchers. RESULTS Intra-class coefficients (ICCs) indicated high Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) for the HGS (10 participants). Cohen's Kappa showed moderate IRR for the SUSS test (25 participants). Stepwise multiple regression showed that the SUSS tests plus HGS predicted BMI and BMI risk level explaining about two-third of the variance. Each test individually had lower predictive value. There was a little difference between the two versions of the SUSS tested. CONCLUSIONS HGS and SUSS are valid and reliable measurements of muscle power in AN. Together, the SUSS tests and the HGS represent a useful and effective measure of muscle power and hence one aspect of physical risk in Anorexia Nervosa. In the light of Covid restrictions, the SUSS test is one way that physical state can be monitored on video link in a way that is hard to falsify.","Etemadi, Sara; Sun, Grey Xiaoliai; Leung, Sum-Ping; Siddique, Arshad; Cooper, Steven; Ezenwa, Nwabunma Christiana; Treasure, Janet; Robinson, Paul",European eating disorders review : the journal of the Eating Disorders Association,https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33950546/,63

This study examined the consequences of factors that might predict a change in the self-rated health of older adults and aimed to assess their monetary costs. In particular, two predisposing risk factor moderators were studied: high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The effects of these on two serious adverse cardiovascular events - heart attack and stroke - were estimated. Using data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) carried out in 2014, a two-stage procedure was applied as well as pairwise comparison. The results revealed the significant role of socioeconomic status in health outcomes. Behavioural risk factors were found to be significant predictors for heart attack and stroke. The findings support the claim that variables such as age, wealth and behavioural risk factors are additional predictors of a change in these two diseases. The monetary consequences can reach up to 12.8 thousand Euros for older adults per unit of predisposing risk factor. Since national health budgets are limited, health policies might be prioritized.","Tur-Sinai, Aviad; Becker, Nir",Journal of biosocial science,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0021932021000432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407900/,63

Our retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness of an AI-CDSS in improving the incidence of hospital-related VTE and the impact of anticoagulant drug use. Methods This study collected relevant data on adult patients over 18 years of age who are not discharged 24 hours, from January to July 2019 and from January to July 2020, the VTE high-risk department of Ruijin Hospital. Before and after using AI-CDSS, the incidence of hospital-related VTE and using anticoagulants were analyzed. Results Between January to July 2019 and January to July 2020, 3,565 and 4,423 adult patients over 18 years old were hospitalized in our hospital and were designed as a control group and intervention group, respectively (7,988 in total). Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. There were 4,716 (59.03%) male patients, the mean age was 60.43±13.09 years, and the mean stay was 7.56±7.76 days. More than half of the patients (4,605, 57.58%) came from the respiratory. VTE events during hospitalization occurred in 41 patients; overall, 5.13/1,000 (41 episodes in 7,988 patients). Compared with the control group, before implementing AI-CDSS, the rate of VTE during hospitalization was reduced from 5.89/1,000 (21 episodes in 3,565 patients) to 4.75/1,000 patients (20 episodes in 4,423 patients) (relative reduction of 19.35%) in the intervention group. The use rate of anticoagulant drugs was increased from 19.97% (712/3,565) in the control group to 22.88% (1,012/4,423) in intervention group [P<0.01, odds ratio (OR): 1.19, 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI) (1.07-1.32)], (relative 14.57% increase).

It is still, however, not widely accepted as the standard of care. Multiple randomized trials have shown that short-term outcomes and perioperative morbidity and mortality of laparoscopic proctectomy are equivalent to open surgery. However, data regarding long-term oncologic outcomes are still scarce, with only a few randomized trials reporting similar outcomes in both laparoscopic and open group. A more recent trial failed to replicate those results in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. In this article, we will look at the most recent evidence regarding the use of laparoscopy for patients with rectal cancer.

144586,COVID's cardiac connection.,2021-06-01,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), a vector of many important human diseases including yellow fever, dengue fever and Zika fever, shows a strong preference for human hosts over other warm-blooded animals for blood meals. Olfactory cues play a critical role for mosquitoes as they explore their environment and seek a human host to obtain blood meals, thus transmitting human diseases. Odorant receptors (ORs) expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons are known to be responsible for the interaction of mosquito vectors with human odors. To gain deeper insights into Ae. aegypti's olfactory physiology and investigate their interactions with humans at the molecular level, we used an optimized protocol of Xenopus Oocytes heterologous expression to functionally analyze Ae. aegypti odorant receptors in response to human odors. Three example experiments are presented: 1) Cloning and synthesizing cRNAs of ORs and odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) from four to six days old Ae. aegypti antennae; 2) Microinjection and expression of ORs and Orco in Xenopus oocytes; and 3) Whole-cell current recording from Xenopus oocytes expressing mosquito ORs/Orco with a two-electrode voltage-clamp. These optimized procedures provide a new way for researchers to investigate human odor reception in Aedes mosquitoes and reveal the underlying mechanisms governing their host-seeking activity at a molecular level.","Wang, Xin; Chen, Zhou; Wang, Yifan; Liu, Feng; Jiang, Shanshan; Liu, Nannan",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/61813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180875/,63

Since viruses cannot replicate on their own, they have developed unique abilities to alter metabolic and signaling cell pathways, including protein PTMs, to ensure faithful replication of their genomes. This review describes several ways of how lysine-specific PTMs are used by various viruses to ensure its successful invasion and replication. Covalent modifications like acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation form a complex system of reversible and often competing modifications, which adds an additional level of complexity to the system of regulation of the activity of host proteins involved in viral replication and propagation. In furthering these, we also describe the manner in which PTM pathways can also be accosted by various types of viruses to neutralize the host's cellular mechanisms for anti-viral protection and highlight key areas for future therapeutic targeting and design.","Loboda, Anna P; Soond, Surinder M; Piacentini, Mauro; Barlev, Nickolai A",Cell cycle,https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2019.1639305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291816/,63
145347,Trends in herbgenomics.,2019,"Infection and sepsis are leading causes of death worldwide but the epidemiology and outcomes are not well understood in resource-limited settings. We conducted a four-year prospective observational study from March 2013 to February 2017 to examine the clinical epidemiology and outcomes of adults admitted with community-acquired infection in a resource-limited tertiary-care hospital in Ubon Ratchathani province, Northeast Thailand. Hospitalized patients with infection and accompanying systemic manifestations of infection within 24 hours of admission were enrolled. Subjects were classified as having sepsis if they had a modified sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥2 at enrollment. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02217592. A total of 4,989 patients were analyzed. Of the cohort, 2,659 (53%) were male and the median age was 57 years (range 18-101). Of these, 1,173 (24%) patients presented primarily to the study hospital, 3,524 (71%) were transferred from 25 district hospitals or 8 smaller hospitals in the province, and 292 (6%) were transferred from one of 30 hospitals in other provinces. Three thousand seven hundred and sixteen (74%) patients were classified as having sepsis. Patients with sepsis had an older age distribution and a greater prevalence of comorbidities compared to patients without sepsis. Twenty eight-day mortality was 21% (765/3,716) in sepsis and 4% (54/1,273) in non-sepsis patients (p<0.001). After adjusting for gender, age, and comorbidities, sepsis on admission (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.48-4.41, p<0.001), blood culture positive for pathogenic organisms (adjusted HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.89-2.58, p<0.001) and transfer from other hospitals (adjusted HR 2.18; 95% CI 1.69-2.81, p<0.001) were independently associated with mortality. In conclusion, mortality of community-acquired sepsis in Northeast Thailand is considerable and transferred patients with infection are at increased risk of death. To reduce mortality of sepsis in this and other resource-limited setting, facilitating rapid detection of sepsis in all levels of healthcare facilities, establishing guidelines for transfer of sepsis patients, and initiating sepsis care prior to and during transfer may be beneficial.","Hantrakun, Viriya; Somayaji, Ranjani; Teparrukkul, Prapit; Boonsri, Chaiyaporn; Rudd, Kristina; Day, Nicholas P J; West, T Eoin; Limmathurotsakul, Direk",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256845/,63

We evaluated patients' adherence to GRMT following AMI and the association with long-term (up-to 10 years) mortality, healthcare resource utilization and costs. METHODS AMI patients hospitalized in a tertiary medical center in Israel that survived at least a year following post-discharge and enrolled in the two largest health plans were analyzed. Data were obtained from computerized medical records. Patients were defined as adherent when ≥80 % of the GRMT prescriptions were issue during the first post-discharge year. Hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, primary care utilization and outpatient consulting clinic and other ambulatory services expenditure were calculated annually. RESULTS Overall 8287 patients qualified for the study (mean age 65.0 ± 13.6 years, 69.7 % males). Adherent patients (n = 1767, 21.3 %) were more likely to be younger, women and increased prevalence of most traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Throughout the follow-up, 2620 patients (31.6 %) died, 22.0 % versus 34.2 %, in the adherent vs. the non-adherent group (adjHR = 0.816, 95 % CI:0.730-0.913, p < 0.001). Reduced hospitalizations (adjOR = 0.783, p < 0.001), ED visits (adjOR = 0.895, p = 0.033), and costs (adjOR = 0.744, p < 0.001), yet increased primary clinics (adjOR = 2.173, p < 0.001) ambulatory (adjOR = 1.072, p = 0.018) and consultant (adjOR = 1.162, p < 0.001) visits, were observed.

In order to identify these factors, we conducted a study of rubella-specific humoral immunity before (Baseline) and after (Day 28) a third dose of MMR-II vaccine in a cohort of 109 women of childbearing age. We performed mRNA-Seq profiling of PBMCs after rubella virus in vitro stimulation to delineate genes associated with post-vaccination rubella humoral immunity and to define genes mediating the association between prior immune response status (high or low antibody) and subsequent immune response outcome. Our study identified novel genes that mediated the association between prior immune response and neutralizing antibody titer after a third MMR vaccine dose. These genes included: CDC34; CSNK1D; APOBEC3F; RAD18; AAAS; SLC37A1; FAS and JAK2. The encoded proteins are involved in innate antiviral response, interferon/cytokine signaling, B cell repertoire generation, the clonal selection of B lymphocytes in germinal centers, and somatic hypermutation/antibody affinity maturation to promote optimal antigen-specific B cell immune function. These data advance our understanding of how subjects' prior immune status and/or genetic propensity to respond to rubella/MMR vaccination ultimately affects innate immunity and humoral immune outcomes after vaccination.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) within the TME are well recognized and consist of T cell-rich areas containing dendritic cells (DCs) and B cell-rich areas containing germinal centers (GCs). Accumulating research has indicated that there is a close association between tumor-associated TLSs and favorable clinical outcomes in most types of cancers, though a minority of studies have reported an association between TLSs and a poor prognosis. Overall, the double-edged sword role of TLSs in the TME and potential mechanisms need to be further investigated, which will provide novel therapeutic perspectives for antitumor immunoregulation. In this review, we focus on discussing the main functions of TLSs in the TME and recent advances in the therapeutic manipulation of TLSs through multiple strategies to enhance local antitumor immunity.","Kang, Wendi; Feng, Zhichao; Luo, Jianwei; He, Zhenhu; Liu, Jun; Wu, Jianzhen; Rong, Pengfei",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.689270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394083/,63

As governments and health care systems develop and update policies and guidelines regarding the allocation of resources, patients and families affected by chronic disabilities, including many neuromuscular disorders that affect children and young adults, have become alarmed at the possibility that they may be determined to have less favorable prognoses due to their underlying diagnoses and thus be assigned to lower priority groups. It is important for health care workers, policymakers, and government officials to be aware that the long term prognoses for children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders are often more promising than previously believed, due to a better understanding of the natural history of these diseases, benefits of multidisciplinary supportive care, and novel molecular therapies that can dramatically improve the disease course. Although the realities of a global pandemic have the potential to require a shift from our usual, highly individualistic standards of care to crisis standards of care, shifting priorities should nonetheless be informed by good facts. Resource allocation guidelines with the potential to affect children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders should take into account the known trajectory of acute respiratory illness in this population, and rely primarily on contemporary long-term outcome data.","Laventhal, Naomi T; Graham, Robert J; Rasmussen, Sonja A; Urion, David K; Kang, Peter B",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482844/,63
148807,Deep learning distinguishes tauopathies.,2021-09-02,"Reproductive strategies vary according to season length, individual reproductive traits, and factors associated with the social context such as density and sex ratio of the individuals. The social context predicts the intensity of sexual selection due to its effect on mate choice and intra-sexual competition. Moreover, it exacerbates the costs derived from sexual conflict and allows for the existence of alternative reproductive tactics to counteract such costs. However, these mechanisms are still underexplored in many animal taxa. Majoidea ""spider crabs"" show a diversity of life history, and behavioral and morphological adaptations for reproduction, which have evolved as an outcome of competition to maximize reproductive success. We aimed to analyze in this study, male reproductive strategies through mating behavior under different social contexts, density of individuals, and males size differences in two species of ""spider crabs"", Leurocyclus tuberculosus and Libinia spinosa. The experiments were as follows: one female and one male per aquarium (Experiment 1); a female and three males of similar sizes per aquarium (Experiment 2); and a female and three males of distinct sizes per aquarium (Experiment 3). The experiments showed that mating behavior and duration of mate guarding differ between species and among different social contexts. The presence of males with similar or different sizes showed a relevant different behavior, the female copulated with more than one male when males were similar in size (E2), and copulated only with the largest male when males were different in size (E3). In mate guarding, the shape and the use of the chelipeds had an important role: the male of Leurocyclus tuberculosus grasped the female with the chelipeds and did not fight with other males, but the male of Libinia spinosa surrounded the female with the chelipeds and fought with other males. The longest duration of mate guarding was during precopulatory guarding. Precopulatory guarding was present in all the experiments and its duration did not present significant differences among the experiments. However, in both species, the experiments differ in the duration of postcopulatory guarding until spawning. Gonopod morphology revealed important differences between species and are probably associated with sperm competition. The experiments under distinct social contexts linked to the use and shape of the chelipeds and the morphology of the gonopods, could allow to understand the functional significance of the different reproductive strategies.","González Pisani, Ximena; López Greco, Laura S",Zoology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2020.125847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142122/,63

In this study, we investigated the toxicity of wastewaters originating from beef cattle feeding operation on Daphnia pulex. Specifically, we assessed lethal and chronic sublethal exposure effects using various endpoints including survival, oxygen consumption, morphology, reproduction, and swimming behavior. Exposure assessments (acute and chronic) were performed with ten (10) surface water samples collected from on-site retention ponds designated as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and R (reference site). Surface water samples were diluted to yield five concentrations (stock, 1 × , 2 × , 3 × , and 4 ×) as treatments and deionized water was used as control. Results showed site-specific and concentration-related effects on toxicity endpoints. Among treatments, significant (p < 0.05) increase in mortality rate (for A, E, F, and H) and decreasing total body length and width (for B, C, D, and G) of D. pulex were observed with increasing wastewater concentration. However, treatments did not have significant effect on swimming behavior (average speed) after exposure to the wastewater samples from all sites except for site E. Evidence from this study suggested that surface waters near beef cattle feed yards affected physiological responses in D. pulex and therefore may similarly affect organisms in the surrounding aquatic ecosystems.","Ayodeji, Olukayode J; Awoyemi, Olushola M",Environmental monitoring and assessment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09181-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117952/,63

We investigated a possible association of an IFNgamma +874 T/A polymorphism and infectious complications in sickle cell patients. Seventy-two sickle cell patients were typed for +874 T/A IFNgamma polymorphism. Genotype frequencies were different between cases and controls. Indeed, the T allele frequency was significantly higher in patients with infections than in patients without infections (P = 0.014). Our results suggest that the +874 T/A IFNgamma polymorphism is associated with infectious complications in sickle cell patients.

AREAS COVERED This review evaluates existing information about mortality rates and effectiveness of antiviral, immune-modulating, and anticoagulation treatments in COVID-19 patients who received mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate and the follow-up periods in patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged widely. Antivirals, including remdesivir and convalescent plasma, have shown no definitive mortality benefit in this population despite positive results in other COVID-19 patients. Dexamethasone was associated with an absolute reduction in 28-day mortality by 12.3% (95% CI, 6.3 to 17.6), after adjusting for age. Reduced mortality has been demonstrated with tocilizumab use alongside corticosteroids. Evidence is inconclusive for therapeutic anticoagulation, and further studies are needed to determine the comparative benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation. EXPERT OPINION Significant variation and high mortality rates in mechanically ventilated patients necessitate more standardized outcome measurements, increased consideration of risk factors to reduce intubation, and improved treatment practices. Anticoagulation and dexamethasone should be incorporated in the treatment of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, while more rigorous studies are required for other potential treatments.","Tsikala Vafea, Maria; Zhang, Raina; Kalligeros, Markos; Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2021.1915764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836621/,63

We aimed to characterize the impact of disease on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in COPD outpatients. Methods We conducted a national, cross-sectional study among pulmonologists and general practitioners (GPs). The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C) was used. Inclusion criteria were a physician's diagnosis of COPD and age ≥40 years. Subjects with a history of lung surgery, lung cancer or COPD exacerbation within the last four weeks were excluded. Results Sixty-seven pulmonologists and 6 GPs enrolled 1175 COPD patients. Two hundred forty-eight of those did not fulfill GOLD criteria for COPD (FEV1/FVC <0.7) and 77 were excluded due to missing data. Finally, 850 patients (62.8% men; mean age 66.2 ± 0.3 (SE) years; mean FEV1%pred. 51.5 ± 0.6 (SE)) were analyzed. Last year, 55.4% reported at least one exacerbation, and 12.7% were hospitalized for COPD exacerbation. Mean SGRQ-C total score was 43.1 ± 0.83 (SE) and mean component scores for symptoms, activity and impacts were 55.6, 55.4 and 30.5, respectively. Half of the patients (50.3%) reported not being able to do any sports and 78.7% stated that their respiratory symptoms did not allow them doing anything they would like to do. In patients with less severe COPD (FEV1pred ≥50% and non-frequent exacerbations), global health status was overrated, ie, estimated as better by the physician than by the patient, while it was underrated in more severe COPD. Conclusion In Austria, the burden of disease in COPD outpatients tends to be underestimated in patients with milder airway obstruction and less exacerbations and overestimated in patients with more severe airway obstruction and frequent exacerbations. Our finding suggests that validated assessment of global health status might decrease these differences of perception.","Horner, Andreas; Burghuber, Otto C; Hartl, Sylvia; Studnicka, Michael; Merkle, Monika; Olschewski, Horst; Kaiser, Bernhard; Wallner, Eva Maria; Lamprecht, Bernd",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s252033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764911/,63

While the initial surge of COVID-19 was concentrated in some areas, COVID-19 became pervasive across the entire continent with high impacts in the northern region and central region in the end of 2020. With this geographical transition, we aim to investigate patterns of these racial/ethnic disparities over time. We assessed associations of percentage of race/ethnic minorities and racial segregation indexes with COVID-19 case and mortality rates in 3108 counties of the continental United States during the pandemic's early phase, second, and third phase (January 21-June 15, June 16-August 31, and September 1-December 18, 2020, respectively). We adjusted for population density, age, and sex. We tested whether time-varying associations were consistent across climate regions and explained by socioeconomic variables. In the early phase, counties with higher percentage of Black/African Americans and higher Black-White segregation had higher COVID-19 case and mortality rates. These associations decreased over time and reversed in the third phase. Associations between Hispanic and COVID-19 outcomes were positive in all periods, but more so early in the pandemic. Higher COVID-19 case rates for counties with higher non-Hispanic White population emerged in the third phase. These trends were similar across climate regions, and socioeconomic variables did not explain these trends. In summary, county-level racial/ethnic disparities of COVID-19 are not stationary but change over the course of the pandemic, suggesting complex social, cultural, and political influences.","Kim, Honghyok; Zanobetti, Antonella; Bell, Michelle L",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118681/,63

Transanal endoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) has been shown to be feasible and to be associated with a low conversion rate. Combining the transanal and transabdominal single-port approaches (with an abdominal single port implanted in the future stoma and extraction site) could allow TME with minimal wound trauma, low morbidity, and faster recovery. The aim of the current study was to assess the short- and mid-term results of this technique. METHODS We conducted a prospective single-centre study of consecutive patients presenting with low rectal cancer requiring a conservative proctectomy with a manual coloanal anastomosis between January 2012 and April 2015. RESULTS During the study period, 41 patients were recruited. Conversion to open surgery was required in only one patient (2.4%). The median operating time was 358.5 min (range 300-600 min). Partial intersphincteric resection was necessary for 15 patients (36.6%). The specimens were mostly extracted via the abdominal access (n = 34) without wound complications. The mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 12.7 (range 6-24 lymph nodes). Specimens were graded as complete (n = 31) or nearly complete (n = 10) in all of the patients, and the circumferential resection margin positivity was 4.9%. Intraoperative morbidity rate was 4.9%, and the 30-day morbidity rate was 24.4% (n = 10). Sixty per cent (n = 6) of the patients with 30-day morbidity were Dindo I-II. At a median follow-up of 29 months, overall and disease-free survival rates were 97.5 and 80.5%, respectively. The stoma-free survival rate was 95.1%.

Responding to the public's concerns, the US government introduced enhanced entry screening and post-arrival monitoring by public health authorities to reduce the risk of importation and domestic transmission of Ebola while continuing to allow travel from West Africa. This case study describes a new initiative, the Check and Report Ebola (CARE+) program that engaged travelers arriving to the United States from countries with Ebola outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employed CARE ambassadors, who quickly communicated with incoming travelers and gave them practical resources to boost their participation in monitoring for Ebola. The program aimed to increase travelers' knowledge of Ebola symptoms and how to seek medical care safely, increase travelers' awareness of monitoring requirements, reduce barriers to monitoring, and increase trust in the US public health system. This program could be adapted for use in future outbreaks that involve the potential importation of disease and require the education and active engagement of travelers to participate in post-arrival monitoring.","Joseph, Heather A; Wojno, Abbey E; Winter, Kelly; Grady-Erickson, Onalee; Hawes, Erin; Benenson, Gabrielle A; Lee, Amanda; Cetron, Martin",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354919878165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600452/,63

No vaccine or effective treatment exists nowadays, especially against intracellular pathogens. The increase in multiple drug and superbug antibiotic resistance strains, excessive medication, or misuse of drugs has prompted the search for other safe and effective alternatives. Consistent with this, adjuvants (Latin word ""adjuvare"": ""help or aid"") co-administered (Exo) in vaccines have emerged as a promising alternative to initiate and boost an innate, downstream signal that led to adaptative immune response. Nowadays, a promising model of strong immunogens and adjuvants at mucosal sites are the microbial bacterial toxins. Other adjuvants that are also used and might successfully replace aluminum salts in combination with nanotechnology are CpG-ODN, poly IC, type I IFNs, mRNA platforms. Therefore, in the present review, we focused to revisit the old to the new adjuvants compounds, the properties that make them friends in vaccine formulations against infectious diseases.","Guerrero Manriquez, G G; Tuero, I",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1934354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288795/,63

MATERIALS AND METHODS This institutional review board-approved retrospective study reviewed 29 patients (12 men and 17 women; median age, 73 y; age range, 55-86 y) with treatment-naïve T1 lung tumors treated with radiofrequency ablation. Tumors in the 29 patients included 21 T1a and 8 T1b first primary (n = 11), metachronous (n = 14), or synchronous (n = 4) tumors (adenocarcinoma, n = 25; squamous cell carcinoma, n = 3; unspecified, n = 1). Median tumor diameter was 14 mm (range, 10-26 mm). Surveillance computed tomography or positron emission tomography-computed tomography was performed over a median period of 28 months (range, 12-83 mo). Technical success and effectiveness rates and overall and progression-free 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survivals were calculated according to stage, first primary, metachronous, and synchronous tumor status. RESULTS Technical success and effectiveness was 97%. Local control occurred in 17 of 21 T1a tumors (81%) and 5 of 8 T1b tumors (62.5%). The local progression rate of first primary tumors (5 of 11; 45%) was higher than that of metachronous (2 of 14; 14%; P = .07) and synchronous (0 of 4; P = .01) tumors. Estimated 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year local tumor progression-free survival was 79%, 75%, and 75%. Estimated 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival was 100%, 60%, and 14%. Survival outcomes were similar for patients with first primary, metachronous, or synchronous tumors. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation results in good local control and progression-free survival in patients with treatment-naïve T1 lung tumors, including patients with metachronous and synchronous tumors.","Ridge, Carole A; Silk, Mikhail; Petre, Elena N; Erinjeri, Joseph P; Alago, William; Downey, Robert J; Sofocleous, Constantinos T; Thornton, Raymond H; Solomon, Stephen B",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2014.02.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703321/,63

Cell guidance is a new concept that provides an alternative approach, obviating a requirement for an external cell source. This relies on site-specific homing and differentiation of the patient's own cells to an implanted scaffold through controlled delivery of cytokines. In this study, we used stromal-cell-derived factor 1-alpha (SDF-1α) in combination with bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 to induce cell migration and osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation, respectively, in implanted scaffolds in a rat model. A customized cytokine microdelivery apparatus was used to ensure the constant rate and concentration of cytokine delivery around the scaffold. The formation of osteoid or early cartilage was observed after 4 weeks in specimens treated with SDF-1α and either BMP-2 or TGF-β1. The density of cellular infiltrate and formation of differentiated tissue were lower in scaffolds treated only with BMP-2 or TGF-β1. Thus, controlled SDF-1α delivery induces cell migration into scaffolds and can result in enhanced osteogenesis and chondrogenesis when used in combination with differentiation cytokines for purposes of tissue engineering.","Chim, Harvey; Miller, Erin; Gliniak, Christy; Alsberg, Eben",Cell and tissue research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1449-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22684849/,63

METHODS We performed the literature review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), by searches in PubMed and EMBASE, until 1 November 2020 (PROSPERO ID CRD42020213999). We included peer-reviewed observational cohort studies and case-control studies and scored them according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, to assess the risk of bias and confounding. RESULTS 39 studies were included. Women with endometriosis had an increased risk of gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, placenta previa, placental abruption, cesarean section, and stillbirth, compared to women without endometriosis. These results remained unchanged in sub-analyses, including studies on spontaneous pregnancies only. Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy and bowel perforation seemed to be associated with endometriosis; however, the studies were few and did not meet the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS The literature shows that endometriosis is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, placenta previa, placental abruption, cesarean section, and stillbirth.","Breintoft, Kjerstine; Pinnerup, Regitze; Henriksen, Tine Brink; Rytter, Dorte; Uldbjerg, Niels; Forman, Axel; Arendt, Linn Håkonsen",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10040667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572322/,63

154284,Observational study of decision making concerning radiotherapy in rectal cancer.,2014,"INTRODUCTION : The management of pancreaticobiliary disorders relies heavily on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which is performed with a duodenoscope. Bacterial colonization of reusable duodenoscopes leading to subsequent infectious outbreaks is well recognized and remains an issue despite efforts to optimize best practices in high level disinfection. The EXALT Model D duodenoscope (EXALT) (Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA) is a single-use device, designed to achieve technical equivalency with reusable devices while eliminating the potential for device related outbreaks. AREAS COVERED : This review covers the challenges associated with reprocessing duodenoscopes and the development of duodenoscope-related infections, with an emphasis on the use of single-use duodenoscopes as a potential solution to this issue. EXPERT OPINION : Duodenoscope-related infections are an increasingly recognized problem. Infectious outbreaks harm patients, significantly affect providers and medical centers, and can erode patient trust in the healthcare system. Single use duodenoscopes eliminate both the risk of device related infection transmission and the need for burdensome duodenoscope reprocessing. In clinical evaluations, the EXALT device has demonstrated an equivalent technical performance and provider satisfaction compared to reusable duodenoscopes. Increasing use of this device will clarify how it compares to reusable duodenoscopes in a variety of clinical settings among endoscopists of varying skills levels.","Ehrlich, Dean; Muthusamy, V Raman",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2021.1917990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855920/,63

A case was defined by clinical manifestations compatible with VL or CL and laboratory confirmation.ResultsBetween 2004 and 2018, 881 VL (862 domestic, 19 imported) and 58 CL cases (24 domestic, 34 imported) were recorded. The mean annual notification rate of domestic VL was 0.5 per 100,000 (range: 0.12-1.43/100,000) with a statistically significant increasing trend (p = 0.013). Cases were reported by all regions. The highest notification rate occurred in the age group 0-4 years (1.3/100,000). Overall 24% (164/680) of the cases were immunocompromised and their proportion increased after 2010 (p < 0.001). The mean annual notification rate of domestic CL was 0.05 per 100,000 (range: 0.01-0.19/100,000) with the highest rate in the age group 5-14 years (0.03/100,000). Cases were recorded in six of the 13 regions. Among 34 imported CL cases, 29 were foreign nationals.ConclusionVL is endemic in Greece, with an increasing trend and a considerable burden of severe disease and young children being most affected. CL is rarely reported. A sustainable action plan is needed to reduce the burden of VL and prevent local transmission of CL.","Tzani, Myrsini; Barrasa, Alicia; Vakali, Annita; Georgakopoulou, Theano; Mellou, Kassiani; Pervanidou, Danai",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2021.26.18.2000159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960290/,63

STUDY DESIGN Twenty-eight women who had symptomatic leiomyomas and underwent laparoscopic myomectomy between June 2013 and July 2014 were included in the present study. In the first half period, continuous sutures were used in 12 patients, and in the latter half period, single interrupted sutures were used in 16 patients. Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used 3 or 6 months after surgery to evaluate vascularity after laparoscopic myomectomy. We defined avascularity index as the percentage of avascular area after surgery to cross sectional area of myoma before surgery. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to compare avascularity indeces in the two study groups. RESULTS At 3 months after surgery, avascularity index in continuous sutures group was significantly higher than that in single interrupted sutures group (median 5.0 vs.1.2, p<0.001), suggesting a poorer vascular recovery of the myometrium sutured continuously. CONCLUSION Simple interrupted suturing might be superior to continuous suturing in terms of vascularity evaluated using contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.","Fujimoto, Akihisa; Morimoto, Chieko; Hosokawa, Yumi; Hasegawa, Akiko","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2017.02.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28260688/,63

Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose was to evaluate presentation, injury pattern, outcomes, and complications of surgically managed PCL injuries in pediatric patients. It was hypothesized that pediatric patients would have good patient-reported outcomes and no significant radiographic changes or complications. Study Design Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases between 1975 and December 16, 2019. Search terms included ""posterior cruciate ligament,"" ""peel-off injury,"" ""avulsion,"" ""PCL,"" ""pediatric,"" ""skeletally immature,"" and ""adolescent."" Included were studies on pediatric patients with PCL injuries managed operatively. Exclusion criteria included case reports, studies not reporting clinical results, reviews, abstract or conference papers, or papers not in the English language. Quality assessment was performed on all included studies using the MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies) criteria. Results Four articles comprising 43 knees in 42 patients met the criteria and were included. Motor vehicle accidents were the most common mechanism of injury (39.5%; n = 17/43), followed by sports-related injuries (35%; n = 15/43). All studies commented on tear pattern, with the following distribution: 42% (n = 18/43) midsubstance tears, 37% (n = 16/43) tibial avulsions, and 21% (n = 9/43) femoral avulsions. Overall, good patient-reported outcomes (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, and Lysholm scores) and return to activity, as well as satisfactory posterior stability (KT-1000 arthrometer, posterior drawer test, and kneeling radiographs) and range of motion, were reported. There was no significant leg-length discrepancy or angular deformity reported. Arthrofibrosis was reported in 7% of postoperative knees and was the most commonly reported complication. Osteoarthritis was reported in 21% (n = 9/43) of knees. The average MINORS score was 7 (range, 6-8) for noncomparative studies and 10 for comparative studies. Conclusion Good patient-reported outcomes and return to activity can be obtained using repair or reconstruction. This evidence was limited by the quality of the included studies and overall small sample size; however, this review serves as a baseline for futures studies on PCL repair/reconstruction in pediatric patients.","Scarcella, Michael J; Yalcin, Sercan; Scarcella, Nicholas R; Saluan, Paul; Farrow, Lutul D",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/23259671211032539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604428/,63

METHODS Three independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and other sources between January 2000 and December 2020 for eligible published and unpublished studies in English and extracted data. Primary outcomes were caries increment, plaque levels, gingival health, reported frequency and/or amount of free sugars intake and oral hygiene behaviour. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. RESULTS Eight cluster RCTs met the inclusion criteria and had substantial heterogeneity. Three trials assessed caries increment and one found significant reductions in the intervention group. Another trial found similar benefits, but these were limited to children from high socioeconomic groups. The third trial found an increase in dental caries in the intervention group. Three studies reported significant reductions in plaque scores and improvements in gingival health with modest effects. Interventions delivered by peers (at adolescence) or with parents' involvement (at pre-adolescence) showed significant reductions in plaque scores compared to those delivered by dentists or teachers only. Most interventions showed significant improvements in self-reported behaviours. CONCLUSIONS There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to dental health from school-based behavioural interventions. There is a need to conduct well-designed trials of behavioural interventions that are theory-derived and include environmental elements (e.g. supervised toothbrushing). Future trials would benefit from cost-effectiveness analysis and assessment of interventions' effect on oral health inequalities amongst children.","Shakir, A; Barngkgei, I; Godson, J; Joury, E",Community dental health,https://doi.org/10.1922/cdh_00014shakir09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351713/,63

Although DAVFs have been linked to other types of intracranial tumors, this is the first case reporting the association between DAVF and an epidermoid tumor. CASE DESCRIPTION A middle-aged patient with chronic headache presented with Borden type II DAVF draining into the right transverse sigmoid junction and was also found to have an epidermoid tumor over the right mastoid. The patient underwent staged embolization of the fistula through both transvenous and transarterial routes. Continuous intraoperative venous pressure monitoring confirmed marked reduction in intracranial venous pressure, and the patient's symptoms completely resolved. However, the fistula still remained. The residual DAVF was then surgically disconnected, and the epidermoid tumor was resected in the same procedure. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates a DAVF can be associated with an epidermoid tumor. Tumor can compromise the venous outflow, which can then lead to intracranial venous hypertension and development of the DAVF. Venous pressure monitoring offers an objective method to verify resolution of venous hypertension, which might correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms.","Yoon, Jang W; Hamade, Youssef J; Navarro, Ramon; Brown, Benjamin L; Lundy, Larry; Tawk, Rabih G",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2017.08.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830738/,63

While preventive materials for postoperative adhesions have been studied for many years, they are all still in the development phases. Methods: In this animal study, an insoluble hyaluronic acid membrane was used in VATS for wedge resection to test its operability and to examine the body's response to the membrane. Ten beagles were divided into two groups, an experimental group and a negative control group. In the experimental group, an insoluble hyaluronic acid membrane containing glycerol was used as the test membrane (10 x 10 x 0.1 cm3). The test membrane was implanted in the left thoracic cavity of the animal under VATS following wedge resection. The animals were observed for two weeks and then euthanized for examination. Results: Macroscopically, the median adhesion score was lower in the experimental group (0) than in the control group (2.5). On histopathological examination, the test membrane elicited only a minor inflammatory response and foreign body reaction. Conclusion: The test membrane showed satisfactory operability and appears to be a practical material to prevent postoperative adhesions after thoracic surgery in VATS.","Uemura, Akiko; Fukayama, Toshiharu; Tanaka, Takashi; Hasegawa-Baba, Yasuko; Shibutani, Makoto; Tanaka, Ryou",International journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.24050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29910673/,63
156982,Design and Characterization of a Novel Biaxial Bionic Hair Flow Sensor Based on Resonant Sensing.,2020-08-11,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted care homes and vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing health inequalities. However, the role of area deprivation in shaping the impacts of COVID-19 in care homes is poorly understood. We examine whether area deprivation is linked to higher rates of COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths among care home residents across upper tier local authorities in England (n=149). METHODS We constructed a novel dataset from publicly available data. Using negative binomial regression models, we analysed the associations between area deprivation (Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) extent) as the exposure and COVID-19 outbreaks, COVID-19-related deaths and all-cause deaths among care home residents as three separate outcomes-adjusting for population characteristics (size, age composition, ethnicity). RESULTS COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes did not vary by area deprivation. However, COVID-19-related deaths were more common in the most deprived quartiles of IDAOPI (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47) and IMD extent (IRR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.34), compared with the least deprived quartiles. DISCUSSION These findings suggest that area deprivation is a key risk factor in COVID-19 deaths among care home residents. Future research should look to replicate these results when more complete data become available.","Bach-Mortensen, Anders Malthe; Degli Esposti, Michelle",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558430/,63
157070,The color of normal: How a Eurocentric focus erases pigmentation complexity.,2020-12-18,"A total of 336 newborn pigs (DNA 241 × 600, initially 1.75 ± 0.05 kg bodyweight [BW]) from 28 litters were used in a 63-d study evaluating the effects of increasing injectable Fe dose on suckling and subsequent nursery pig performance and blood Fe status. GleptoForte (Ceva Animal Health, LLC., Lenexa, KS) contains gleptoferron which is a Fe macro-molecule complex that is commercially used as an injectable Fe source for suckling piglets. On the day of processing (d 3 after birth), all piglets were weighed and six barrows and six gilts per litter were allotted within sex to 1 of 6 treatments in a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of a negative control receiving no Fe injection and increasing injectable Fe to achieve either 50, 100, 150, 200 mg, or 200 mg plus a 100 mg injection on d 11 after birth. Pigs were weaned (~21 d of age) and allotted to nursery pens based on BW and corresponding treatment in a completely randomized design. During lactation, increasing injectable Fe up to 100 mg improved (quadratic; P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and d 21 BW with no further improvement thereafter. There was no evidence of differences (P > 0.10) observed between the 200 mg and 200 mg + 100 mg treatments for growth. For the nursery period, increasing Fe dosage increased (linear; P < 0.05) ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and d 42 BW. There was no evidence of differences (P > 0.10) between the 200 mg and 200 mg + 100 mg treatments for nursery growth. For blood criteria, significant treatment × day interactions (P = 0.001) were observed for hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct). The interactions occurred because pigs that had less than 150 mg of injectable Fe had decreased values to d 21 and then increased to d 63 while pigs with 150 or 200 mg of injectable Fe had increased values to d 21 then stayed relatively constant to d 63. In summary, piglet performance during lactation was maximized at 100 mg while nursery growth performance and blood Fe status were maximized with a 200 mg Fe injection at processing. Providing an additional 100 mg of Fe on d 11 of age increased Hb, and Hct values at weaning and 14 d into the nursery but did not provide a growth performance benefit in lactation or nursery. These results indicate that providing 200 mg of injectable Fe provided from GleptoForte is sufficient to optimize lactation and subsequent nursery growth performance and blood Fe status.","Williams, Hayden E; DeRouchey, Joel M; Woodworth, Jason C; Dritz, Steven S; Tokach, Michael D; Goodband, Robert D; Holtcamp, Andrew J; Bortoluzzi, Eduarda M; Gebhardt, Jordan T",Journal of animal science,https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skaa221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663303/,63

This study compared the level of physical activity (PA), sitting and screen time before and during the confinement and identified the impact of initial PA, sedentary profiles of the participants and housing conditions.Results: 1,178 people were included in this study. Reaching PA recommendations before lock-down was associated with the change in PA level during lock-down (p < .001). Besides, geographic location was associated with the change in PA, sitting time and screen time during lock-down (respectively p = .03, p = .02, p = .02).Conclusion: This study confirm the negative impact of confinement on senior movement behaviors, whether or not they met with public health recommendations prior to the pandemic. The housing conditions of older people must be also taken into future public health policies.","Chambonniere, C; Lambert, C; Tardieu, M; Fillon, A; Genin, P; Larras, B; Melsens, P; Baker, Js; Pereira, B; Tremblay, A; Thivel, D; Duclos, M",Experimental aging research,https://doi.org/10.1080/0361073x.2021.1908750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827390/,63
157484,Possible role of carpal hyperextension in superficial digital flexor tendinopathy.,2012,"Sciatic hernia is a rare pelvic floor hernia. A variety of treatment modalities were proposed, but a guideline is lacking although a mesh-based tension-free repair may be preferred. A 67-year-old woman with an uncomplicated sciatic hernia received primarily closing of the hernia orifice that was covered with a preperitoneal mesh in March 2019. Six months later, she developed a clinical and radiographical recurrence requiring remedial surgery. Due to the previous mesh fixation, the preperitoneal plane was obliterated. Therefore, the pouch of Douglas was closed, leaving the hernia sac in place, by folding two opposing peritoneal layers and covering it with a Ventralight ST mesh. After 9 months, the hernia had not recurred and the patient was symptom-free. It is concluded that recurrent sciatic hernia may be treated by obliterating the Douglas pouch and subsequent mesh coverage.","Van Hoef, Stijn; Zwaans, Willem A R; Luijten, Arijan",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-238755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853813/,63
157704,Fresh frozen cadaver workshops for advanced vascular surgical training.,2014,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this report was to discuss the overall limitations, safety and efficacy of flow-diverter stenting for intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The authors performed a meta-analysis from January 2009 to September 2014 using the terms ""flow diverter"" and ""intracranial aneurysms."" Additional studies were identified through references in each reviewed article. Data extraction, performed independently by the authors, included demographic data, technical and clinical complications, morbidity and mortality, aneurismal occlusion rates related to flow-diverter devices. The analysis was performed using a fixed effect. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies with 1524 patients and three to 62 months of follow-up were identified for analysis. The overall technical failure and complication rate was 9.3% (95% CI 6%-12.6%). The rate of procedure-related complication was 14% (95% CI 10.2%-17.9%) and 6.6% (95% CI 4%-9.1%) for morbidity and mortality. Fusiform, dissecting and circumferential aneurysm (OR 3.10, 95% CI 0.93-10.37) were significant risk factors for technical failure and complication. Posterior circulation location (OR 4.03, 95% CI 2.45-6.61), peripheral location (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.52-4.94) and fusiform, dissecting and circumferential aneurysm (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.15-3.30) were statistically significant risk factors for procedure-related complications. Posterior circulation location (OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.44-7.90) and peripheral location (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.74-7.62) were statistically significant risk factors for morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Fusiform, dissecting and circumferential aneurysm, posterior circulation and peripheral locations have greater procedure-related complications.","Lv, Xianli; Yang, Hongchao; Liu, Peng; Li, Youxiang",The neuroradiology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1971400915621321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26838174/,63

158085,Quantifying Global Drivers of Zoonotic Bat Viruses: A Process-Based Perspective.,2016,"The study describes our experience with Amplatzer Vascular Plugs (AVP2 and 4) and highlights a more refindes telescopic technique for AVP2 delivery. AVPs are well-established occlusion devices for vascular anomalies in congenital heart disease (CHD). The AVP2 is sometimes preferred to the AVP4 due to its shorter length, flat-profiled retention disks, and the availability of larger diameters, but its profile requires a larger inner lumen for safe delivery. The latter may actually hamper access to target lesions. This is a retrospective analysis of all CHD patients treated with the AVP2 and AVP4 between 12/2012 and 12/2015. Target vessels were characterized, measured, and the device-to-vessel diameter ratio calculated. A modified pigtail technique for AVP2 delivery was frequently used: a floppy wire was simply reinforced by the curved tip of a pigtail catheter (instead of the long sheath's dilator) to guide the required delivery sheath towards the desired landing zone. 59 patients with a median age and bodyweight of 3.0 years (range 0.1-75) and 13.8 kg (range 2.5-80) underwent the implantation of 106 plug-devices (30 AVP2, 76 AVP4) in 91 target vessels. Indications for their use were ductus arteriosus (19%), aortopulmonary (43%) as well as venovenous collaterals (34%) and other miscellaneous lesions (4%). The pigtail-supported AVP2 delivery in six patients proved very convenient. No complications occurred. AVPs are excellent devices for embolizing shunt vessels in CHD patients. Here, we describe a simplified telescoping technique for AVP2 delivery to enter curvy target lesions gently and efficiently.","Kubicki, Rouven; Stiller, Brigitte; Hummel, Johanna; Höhn, Rene; Fleck, Thilo; Grohmann, Jochen",Heart and vessels,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00380-018-1232-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043154/,63

Acoustic analysis is also brought to bear on the present investigation with the aim of providing accurate findings. Several psycholinguistic models are invoked in the analysis, and Praat 6 is used to provide spectrograms and waveforms for the errors detected. The present study concludes that the SOTs examined in the present corpus reveal much about the processing of erroneous speech. Substitution errors, being the most prominent, exhibit uniform processing through a replacement on phonemic or higher levels. As for anticipation errors, they prove to be irregular in their production. Other errors are sparse in the present corpus, and cannot be generalized over a wide range of instances, since they occur either once or twice.","El-Zawawy, Amr M",Journal of psycholinguistic research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10936-020-09755-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423116/,63

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current evidence of the association between folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on three primary outcomes: the incidence of low birthweight, small for gestational age, and mean birthweight. Seventeen studies were identified, which satisfied the inclusion criteria, covering a total of 275,421 women from 13 cohort studies and four randomized controlled trials. For the primary outcome of mean birthweight (n = 9), the pooled mean difference between folic acid and control groups was 0.37 kg (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24 to 0.50), and this effect was larger in the randomized controlled trials (0.56, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.97, n = 3). The pooled odds ratio was 0.59 for low birthweight (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.74, n = 10) among folic acid supplementation versus control. The pooled odds ratio for the association with small for gestational age was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.39 to 1.01, n = 5).

160803,"Breastfeeding, Human Milk Collection and Containers, and Human Milk Banking: Hot Topics During the COVID-19 Pandemic.",2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND Pertussis is a disease leading to high morbidity and mortality in neonates and infants. Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization especially in children < 2 year-old. Although the clinical findings are different in these two diseases, it is sometimes difficult to make this distinction in partially or fully vaccinated children. This study aimed to identify the incidence, clinical and laboratory effects of B. pertussis as a causative agent in hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis. METHODS The study included patients diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis and admitted to the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases from January 2012 to December 2015, aged 24 months or younger, evaluated for viruses and bacteria with polymerase chain reaction in respiratory tract secretions. RESULTS The study included 380 patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. Of these patients, 85.8% were identified to be positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. The most commonly identified pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, bocavirus and metapneumovirus A/B. B. pertussis was only detected in 5 patients (1.5%). In the patients with B. pertussis identified, coinfection with another virus was observed including rhinovirus (n= 2), influenza A virus (n= 1), coronavirus OC43 (n= 1) and RSV A/B (n= 1). The presence of B. pertussis did not appear to cause any significant clinical or laboratory differences in patients. CONCLUSIONS B. pertussis is a rare pathogen in patients admitted to hospital for acute bronchiolitis. However, in patients who do not respond to standard bronchiolitis treatment, B. pertussis should be considered as a causative agent. Early identification of this pathogen is important in terms of quarantining the patient, administering appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and prophylactic treatment to household and other close contacts.","Efendiyeva, Emilya; Kara, Tuğçe Tural; Erat, Tuğba; Yahşi, Aysun; Karbuz, Adem; Kocabaş, Bilge Aldemir; Özdemir, Halil; Karahan, Zeynep Ceren; İnce, Erdal; Çiftçi, Ergin",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.24953/turkjped.2020.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108074/,63
160843,Corrigendum.,2014-07-01,"Objective Despite widespread use of flow diverters (FDs) to treat aneurysms, the exact healing mechanism associated with FDs remains poorly understood. We aim to describe the healing process of aneurysms treated using FDs by demonstrating the histopathologic progression in a canine aneurysm model. Methods Twenty-one side wall aneurysms were created in common carotid artery of eight dogs and treated with two different FDs. Angiographic follow-ups were done immediately after placement of the device, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At last follow-up, the aneurysm and the device-implanted parent artery were harvested. Results Histopathologic findings of aneurysms at 4 weeks follow-up showed intra-aneurysm thrombus formation in laminating fashion, and neointimal thickening at the mid-segment of aneurysm. However, there are inhomogenous findings in aneurysms treated with the same type of FD showing same angiographic outcomes. At 12 weeks, aneurysms of complete and near-complete occlusion revealed markedly shrunken aneurysm filled with organized connective tissues with thin neointima. Aneurysms of incomplete occlusion at 12 weeks showed small amount of organized thrombus around fringe neck and large empty space with thick neointmal formation. Neointimal thickness and diameter stenosis was not significantly different between the groups of FD specification and follow-up period. Conclusion Intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation and organization seem to be an important factor for the complete occlusion of aneurysms treated using the FD. Neointimal formation could occur along the struts of the FD independently of intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation. However, neointimal formation could not solely lead to complete aneurysm healing.","Lee, Jong Young; Cho, Young Dae; Kang, Hyun-Seung; Han, Moon Hee",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2019.0067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295979/,63

161394,Call for Papers.,2020-05-01,"Background Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) after intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for acute ischemic stroke is associated with a poor functional outcome. We aimed to develop a score assessing risk of sICH including novel putative predictors-namely, pretreatment with statins and severe renal impairment. Methods We analyzed our local cohort (Berlin) of patients receiving rt-PA for acute ischemic stroke between 2006 and 2016. Outcome was sICH according to ECASS-III criteria. A multiple regression model identified variables associated with sICH and receiver operating characteristics were calculated for the best discriminatory model for sICH. The model was validated in an independent thrombolysis cohort (Basel). Results sICH occurred in 53 (4.0%) of 1,336 patients in the derivation cohort. Age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, systolic blood pressure on admission, blood glucose on admission, and prior medication with medium- or high-dose statins were associated with sICH and included into the risk of intracranial hemorrhage score. The validation cohort included 983 patients of whom 33 (3.4%) had a sICH. c-Statistics for sICH was 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.79) in the derivation cohort and 0.69 (95% CI 0.60-0.77) in the independent validation cohort. Inclusion of severe renal impairment did not improve the score. Conclusion We developed a simple score with fair discriminating capability to predict rt-PA-related sICH by adding prior statin use to known prognostic factors of sICH. This score may help clinicians to identify patients with higher risk of sICH requiring intensive monitoring.","Erdur, Hebun; Polymeris, Alexandros; Grittner, Ulrike; Scheitz, Jan F; Tütüncü, Serdar; Seiffge, David J; Audebert, Heinrich J; Nolte, Christian H; Engelter, Stefan T; Rocco, Andrea",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.00074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29503629/,63

The analysis of gait signals from the lower trunk, acquired through accelerometers, begins with the proper identification of gait cycles. The goal of this work is to supplement gait-event based segmentation methods, tested for unimpaired and impaired populations, so that their need to calibrate or rely on pre-defined thresholds is overcome, and to implement strategies that reduce step-detection errors. A new system for the automatic extraction and analysis of gait cycles from acceleration signals of the lower trunk, combining knowledge from previous strategies with a dynamic time warping function, is presented. Performance was tested on gait signals from public databases. Sensitivities in step detection above 99.95% were achieved, with a positive predictive value of 100.00%. Step-correction strategies reduced the number of incorrect detections from 57 to 3 of 7056 steps. Bland-Altman plots and equivalence tests performed on cycle times by the proposed method and selected references showed good agreement, with mean differences below 0.003 s, and percent errors of 2%. This method may give place to a research tool for the automatic analysis of signals from subjects in a variety of cases.","Ghersi, Ignacio; Ferrando, Maria H; Fliger, Carlos G; Castro Arenas, Cristhian F; Edwards Molina, Diego J; Miralles, Mónica T",Medical engineering & physics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709267/,63

This is why nephrologists in many centers have begun to create arteriovenous fistulas themselves. The aim of this study was to determine possible differences and predictive parameters for arteriovenous fistula function in patients whose fistulas were created by a nephrologist or a vascular surgeon. METHODS The study was organized as a retrospective, descriptive-analytical study of interventions by nephrologists and vascular surgeons during a period of 15 years. The total number of arteriovenous fistulae created by surgical interventions in this interval was 1048. A nephrologist created them in 764 (72.9%) patients, while vascular surgeons were responsible for 284 (27.1%) fistulae. All laboratory, demographic, and clinical parameters which might affect functioning of these arteriovenous fistulae were analyzed. RESULTS Patients whose arteriovenous fistula was formed by the nephrologist differed significantly from those created by vascular surgeons in relation to positioning of the anastomosis (p <0.001), the preventive character of the arteriovenous fistula (p <0.001), lumen of the vein (p = 0.004) and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02). Statistically significant predictors of arteriovenous fistula dysfunction, in the multivariate logistic regression model, were female gender (B = 0.439; p = 0.003), who created the fistula (vascular surgeon or nephrologist) (B = 0.325; p = 0.041), and the site of the arteriovenous fistula (B = -0.454; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Arteriovenous fistulae created by vascular surgeons, female gender and the location are predictors of dysfunction.","Stolić, Radojica V; Bukumiric, Zoran; Mitrovic, Vekoslav; Sipic, Maja; Krdzic, Biljana; Relic, Goran; Nikolic, Gordana; Sovtic, Sasa; Suljkovic, Naja E","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",https://doi.org/10.1159/000512632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120382/,63

Current methods of repair have high recurrence rates and are associated with severe complications. Autologous full-thickness skin as reinforcement may reduce the recurrence and complication rates. This study aims to investigates the tensile strength of full-thickness skin; information that is essential if we are to proceed with clinical trials on humans. Methods: Full-thickness skin samples from 12 donors were tested for tensile strength, as well as the load tolerated by a suture through the skin. Strips of skin were cut out and stretched until breaking point. Sutures were made through skin samples and traction applied until either the tissue or the suture gave way. All done while recording the forces applied using a dynamometer. Identical tests were carried out on commercially available synthetic and biologic graft material for comparison. Results: The full-thickness skin strips had a median tensile strength of 604 N/cm. This tensile strength was significantly higher than that of the compared materials evaluated in this study. In full-thickness skin, the suture, or tissue endured a median force of 67 N before giving way, which was as high as, or higher than similar sutures through the compared materials. Conclusions: The tensile strength of full-thickness skin vastly exceeds the physiological forces affecting the abdominal wall, and sutures through skin endure high loads before giving way. The tensile strength of a full-thickness skin graft and the strength of sutures through this material will not limit its use for reinforcement in parastomal hernia repair.","Holmdahl, Viktor; Backman, Olof; Gunnarsson, Ulf; Strigård, Karin",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2019.00069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31921883/,63

Contaminants in the air can deteriorate indoor air quality and negatively affect the health of infants and toddlers in daycare centers. Also, with the COVID-19 spread, the outbreak of infectious diseases in daycare centers is another airborne threat to young children. In closed spaces, air contaminants such as PM10 can be used as potential containers to transmit indoor infectious matters. Since young children have immature immunity, indoor air contaminant controls are significant to support a healthy indoor air environment. Accordingly, the government of Korea has enhanced indoor air quality control regulations and recommendations, but on-site evaluation of daycare centers is still not sufficient to provide systematic knowledge of the indoor air contaminants. Therefore, this study monitored a daycare center in the metropolitan area and then diagnosed the occurrence and correlations of indoor air contaminants. The results of this study verified that many hours still exceeded the maximum air quality criteria in the daycare center, which were mostly found during the daytime. Also, correlations between indoor air contaminants were varying depending on outdoor air conditions.

To achieve that level of confidence, monitoring the stability of the microscope performance over time with standardized quality testing routines is essential for mining quantitative data. Three levels of microscope quality control procedures should be considered: i) usage of accessible and affordable tools and samples, ii) execution of easy and fast, preferably automatized, acquisition protocols, iii) analysis of data in the most automated way possible with adequate metrics for long-term monitoring. In this paper, we test the acquisition protocols on the mainly used microscope techniques (wide-field, spinning disk and confocal microscopy) with simple quality control tools. Seven protocols specify metrics on measuring the lateral and axial resolution (Point-Spread Function) of the system, field flatness, chromatic aberrations and co-registration, illumination power monitoring and stability, stage drift and positioning repeatability and finally temporal and spatial noise sources of camera detectors. We designed an ImageJ/FiJi java plugin named MetroloJ_QC to incorporate the identified metrics and automatize the data processing for the analysis. After processing and comparing the data of microscopes from more than ten imaging facilities, we test the robustness of the metrics and the protocols by determining experimental limit values.

Health care workers are leaving at alarming rates. Already in dire straits prior to COVID-19, the impact of the pandemic further exacerbated this problem, resulting in many health care professionals, including DCES, losing their jobs;or working from home virtually with the added burden of caring for children and homeschooling;or retiring—some by choice and some not;or being reassigned to COVID-19. Thinking it was a temporary situation, health care workers, including DCES, stepped up to help wherever they could and were lauded as heroes—until the burden just became too much.","Pearson, Teresa",ADCES in Practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/2633559x211033760,63

We concluded that the best distribution law to predict the evolution of the pandemic, if basic conditions (i.e., distancing measures, start of schools, intensive use of public transportation, beginning and end of holidays, new vaccines, spread of new Covid variants) of the pandemic do not appreciably change, is a distribution of the type of Planck's law with three parameters. In our 2020 study we did not use the number of daily positive cases in Italy but the ratio of daily positive cases per number of daily tests, ratio today sometimes referred to as: ""positivity rate"". We showed that, if basic conditions do not change, the Planck's distribution with three parameters provides very good predictions of the positivity rate about one month in advance. In a second paper, using the Planck's distribution with three parameters, we predicted, about one month in advance, the spread of the pandemic in Italy during the Christmas holidays. Here we show that indeed in our second paper the spread of the pandemic in Italy, after one month, was well predicted using the Planck's distribution with an error of a few percent only. We then study the present (beginning of September) evolution of the pandemic in Italy and we show that the Planck's distribution, based on the data of July and August, predicts well the evolution of the pandemic. We then show that, at present, the peak of the ratio of the positivity rate was reached during the second part of August. However, the end of the Italian holidays and the start of schools, intensive use of public transportation and further distancing measures may change again the trend of the positivity rate of the pandemic.","Ciufolini, I.; Paolozzi, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.06.21263173v1?rss=1,63
166934,OmicLoupe: Facilitating biological discovery by interactive exploration of multiple omic datasets and statistical comparisons,2020-10-22,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is causing a global health crisis, which has inevitably led to a worldwide economic slowdown. In Malaysia, the small business sector is most affected by the movement control order (MCO). The MCO has caused the closure of the retail and transport sectors that has sharply curtailed the daily operations of the majority of small entrepreneurs, leading to a loss in income. However, if small business communities make optimal use of digital applications for their business activities, their income will be less affected by the current Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the everyday use of ICT has the potential to create numerous landscape improvement and business continuity, specifically for small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs). This, in turn, would increase community participation in entrepreneurship. Therefore, it is crucial to study the role of digital marketing in strengthening new business norms among small entrepreneurs during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also imperative to identify other factors that can help boost digital business. This research examined the relationship between ICT use in empowering rural entrepreneurs during MCO in Malaysia. The study design consisted of a quantitative form for each research instrument using the Google Form online survey. This study's sample was selected using a particular sampling method (purposive sampling) and snowball sampling (snowball sampling) involving 158 small rural entrepreneurs in Penang, Malaysia. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 27.0 software. The findings showed that the respondents navigated the Covid-19 pandemic by carrying out business activities on the digital platform and took full advantage of the ICT applications as part of their new business norms. This study can provide input for the government to formulate strategies related to ICT in increasing awareness among rural entrepreneurs. Additionally, the input of this study can offer programs and activities to further enhance the entrepreneurs' skills in using ICT. © 2021 Abdul Rashid et al..

It examines points where the global economy, Covid-19, and Southeast Asian labour interact. These intersections reveal some important truths both about the JIT economy and about more general consequences of the mobility of humans and their “fellow-travellers.” Southeast Asian workers, whether labouring as migrant workers in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand or labouring at home, supply relatively cheap wares for the world. Many experience confined living and working conditions, where disease transmission can accelerate. The chapter then considers some Southeast Asian workers’ experiences in production, care, and transport. It concludes with the often-forgotten material connectedness of humans to other plants and animals.

169012,A single sugar makes all the difference,2021,"Lenses are a category theoretic construct and are used in a wide variety of applications. Symmetric lenses compose to, of course, form new symmetric lenses. Symmetric lenses are usually represented as spans of asymmetric lenses. In many applications, the fact that a symmetric lens might also be represented as a cospan of asymmetric lenses is important, especially for implementation purposes. However, the composition of symmetric lenses does not preserve the property that the lenses can be represented by cospans -- two such symmetric lenses may (and frequently do) compose to form a symmetric lens which cannot be represented as a cospan of asymmetric lenses. Thus preserving the factorisation to show how cospans of asymmetric lenses might be used in implementations becomes important. In 2018, the first work on multilenses was begun. Multilenses can be represented as multi-spans of asymmetric lenses (often called 'wide spans', these are spans with an arbitrary finite number of legs). In this paper we analyse a small but realistic example of a supply chain in which the cospan representations would be 'composed away' by ordinary symmetric lens composition, and introduce a new kind of composition which we call 'fusion' in which two ordinary symmetric lenses (spans with two legs) fuse to form a multilens with three legs preserving the cospan representations, and more generally, two symmetric multilenses, spans with say m and n legs, fuse to form a symmetric multilens with m+n-1 legs, again preserving cospan representations.","Johnson, Michael; Rosebrugh, Robert",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10482v1.pdf,63
169201,Analysis of wild plant pathogen populations reveals a signal of adaptation in genes evolving for survival in agriculture in the beet rust pathogen (Uromyces beticola),2021-08-13,"SARS-CoV-2 could originate from unknown bats or intermediate hosts and cross the species barrier to humans. Virus-host interactions affect viral entry and replication. The virus genome encodes four essential structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein, the small envelope protein, the matrix proteins, and the nucleocapsid protein. The SARSCoV- 2 glycoprotein S binds to the host cell receptors of the enzyme, the conversion of angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is a critical step for virus entry. It is expressed more in men than in women, probably by estradiol and testosterone that can influence ACE activity in different ways. In the viremia phase, it passes from the salivary glands and mucous membranes, especially the nasal and larynx, to the lungs and other organs with the same ACE2 receptors, such as the heart, liver, and even the central nervous system. It can reach the intestines, which can explain the symptoms and is detected in the stool from the beginning of the infection. Comorbidities such as immunodeficient status, old age, systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus or chronic lung diseases, obesity or smoking are key to viral pathogenesis. When the immune system is inefficient to effectively control the virus in the acute phase, it can evolve into a macrophage activation syndrome that results in the dreaded cytokine storm that puts the patient in a very critical condition. Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cornerstone to provide timely diagnosis and implement appropriate treatment for patients, limiting the spread of the virus and ultimately eliminating the presence of the virus in humanity. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] La glucoproteína S del SARS-CoV-2 se une a la enzima convertidora de la angiotensina 2 (ACE2). El genoma del virus codifica cuatro proteínas estructurales esenciales: glucoproteína espiga, proteína de envoltura pequeña, proteínas matrices y proteína de nucleocápside. Se expresa más en hombres, quizá por el estradiol y la testosterona. En la viremia pasa de las glándulas salivales y membranas mucosas, especialmente nasal y laringe, a los pulmones y a otros órganos con los mismos receptores ACE2: corazón, hígado e, incluso, al sistema nervioso central;llega a los intestinos, lo que puede explicar los síntomas ;se detecta en las heces desde el inicio de la infección. La coexistencia de hipertensión arterial sistémica, diabetes mellitus o neumopatías crónicas, obesidad o tabaquismo, inmunodeficiencias y la senescencia son clave en la patogénesis viral. Cuando el sistema inmunológico es ineficiente en controlar efectivamente al virus en la fase aguda, puede evolucionar a un síndrome de activación de macrófagos que da pie a la temida tormenta de citocinas que pone al paciente en un estado crítico. Entender la fisiopatogenia de la infección por SARS-CoV-2 es la piedra angular para establecer el diagnóstico oportuno e implementar el tratamiento adecuado y limitar la propagación del virus y, en última instancia, eliminarlo.

The phylogenetic classification of the PVs is performed based on the sequence homology of the Open Reading Frame L1, the most conserved among different viral serotypes. Given the immunogenicity of saponins, it,s has been used as a candidate as adjuvant use. For this reason, the safety of using saponin as an adjuvant has to be better determined to human or veterinary vaccine use. So, this study aimed to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effect of saponins in comparison with the adjuvant widely used aluminum hydroxide using an isolated and purified L1 protein from BPV as model. In this study, genomic lesions, which after processed without repair can result in mutations, were detected by comet assay. Possible damages to genetic material caused by structural chromosomal changes (clastogenesis), as well as chromosomal losses (aneugenesis) were evaluated by the micronucleus test. Both tests were done on polychromatic erythrocytes and Vero cells. The evaluation of apoptosis and necrosis of treated Vero cells was made by Annexin V / PI staining and flow cytometry. The two vaccine products (L1 +Saponin and L1 + Aluminum Hydroxide) showed damages compatible with the positive control in the comet assay and both slightly elevated the micronucleus levels, in the Cell Viability Assay the results with Aluminum Hydroxide were satisfactory, characterizing Aluminum Hydroxide as a safer adjuvant according to the proposed tests, better than the saponins. Some fractions of the saponin extract separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography were evaluated against genotoxic activity by comet assay, and their identities were confirmed by similarity to the reference standard by mass spectrometry.","Magnelli, Roberta Fiusa; de Cássia Stocco, Rita; da Silva Junior, Pedro Ismael; Mendonça, Ronaldo Zucatelli",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.442590,63
171904,RBPSpot: Learning on Appropriate Contextual Information for RBP Binding Sites Discovery,2021-06-07,"Purpose There is a growing desire for health professions educators to engage learners in more meaningful instruction. Many have tapped Wikipedia to offer an applied approach to engage learners, particularly as it relates to evidence-based medicine (EBM). However, little is known about the benefits and challenges of using Wikipedia as a pedagogical tool from the collective experience of educators who have sought to improve their instructional practice with it. This study aims to uncover and synthesize the perspectives of health professions education (HPE) instructors who have incorporated Wikipedia in their HPE courses. Methods Applying a constructivist approach, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participating HPE instructors who had substantively integrated Wikipedia into their curriculum. Participants were interviewed about their experiences of integrating Wikipedia editing into their courses. Thematic analysis was conducted on resulting transcripts. Results Authors observed two broad themes among participants’ expressed benefits of teaching with Wikipedia: 1) provides a meaningful instructional alternative that also benefits society and develops learners’ information literacy and EBM skills, and 2) supports learners’ careers and professional identity formation. Identified challenges included: 1) high effort and time, 2) issues with sourcing references, and 3) challenging interactions with skeptics, editors, and students. Discussion Findings build on known benefits, such as providing a real-world collaborative project that contextualizes students’ learning experiences. They also echo known challenges, such as the resource-intensive nature of teaching with Wikipedia. At the same time, findings extend the current literature by revealing a potential opportunity to approach crowd-sourced information tools, like Wikipedia, as a vehicle to engage and enculturate HPE students within a situated learning context. These findings present implications for HPE programs considering implementing Wikipedia and faculty development needed to help instructors harness crowd-sourced information tools’ pedagogical opportunities as well as anticipate their challenges.","Martin, Paolo C.; Maggio, Lauren A.; Murray, Heather; Willinsky, John M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.461409,63

A lack of minable survival distributions has made it difficult to identify factors determining the success and failure of clinical trials and improve trial design. We imputed survival IPD from ∼500 arms of phase III oncology trials (representing ∼220,000 events) and found that they are well fit by a two-parameter Weibull distribution. This makes it possible to use parametric statistics to substantially increase trial precision with small patient cohorts typical of phase I or II trials. For example, a 50-person trial parameterized using Weibull distributions is as precise as a 90-person trial evaluated using traditional statistics. Mining IPD also showed that frequent violations of the proportional hazards assumption, particularly in trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), arise from time-dependent therapeutic effects and hazard ratios. Thus, the duration of ICI trials has an underappreciated impact on the likelihood of their success.","Plana, Deborah; Fell, Geoffrey; Alexander, Brian M.; Palmer, Adam C.; Sorger, Peter K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.442837,63

However, the risks of addiction to them are growing with the access to the Internet and new digital devices, the lower cost of them, and the lack of parental control. On the other hand, a weird circumstance as the COVID-19 pandemic involves weeks-long confinements, which may significantly influence increased consumption. This study aims to know university students' situation in Spain regarding the problem described in this pandemic scenario. It analyzes the use of video games and whether addiction risks appearance, examining which factors are determinants of this behavior. The method is based on various statistical techniques: descriptive analysis, the association between variables, and logistic regression to check the phenomenon studied, which are predictive variables. As a result, high video game consumption during confinement was got, finding addiction patterns in 16.6%. The excessive use of social networks and being male show significant relevance. These results also show the existence of comorbidity, meaning that university students may suffer from psychological and psychiatric disorders linked to other consumptions. Health and academic authorities should consider this individual, social, and health problem and implement prevention, detection, and treatment programs.","Gómez-Galán, José Lázaro-Pérez Cristina Martínez-López José Ángel",Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research,https://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2021.7.750,63

Comparison of these models was made using some statistics (F-test, AIC, BIC, AICc and WIC).The results indicate that the Weibull model is the best adequate model for studying the cumulative daily number of COVID-19 cases in Iraq according to some criteria such as having the highest F and lowest values for RMSE, bias, MAE, AIC, BIC, AICc and WIC with no any violations of the assumptions for the model’s residuals (independent, normal distribution and homogeneity variance). The overall model test and tests of the estimated parameters showed that the Weibull model was statistically significant for describing the study data.From the Weibull model predictions, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Iraq will increase by a range of 101,396 (95% PI: 99,989 to 102,923) to 114,907 (95% PI: 112,251 to 117,566) in the next 24 days (23rd of July to 15th of August 15, 2020). From the inflection points in the Weibull curve, the peak date when the growth rate will be maximum, is 7th of July, 2020, and at this time the daily cumulative cases become 67,338.

However, viral vector manufacturing typically is resource intensive, suffers from batch-to-batch variability, and includes several animal components, adding regulatory and supply chain pressures. Here, CAR T cells were generated within nine days using recombinant SpCas9 protein and nucleic acids, without any viral vectors or animal components. In comparison to traditional retroviral CAR T cells, nonviral CAR T cells exhibit TRAC-targeted genomic integration of the CAR transgene, gene expression signatures associated with a memory phenotype, and low receptor signaling prior to infusion. Upon exposure to the GD2 target antigen, the nonviral anti-GD2 CAR cells exhibited specific cytotoxicity against GD2+ cells in vitro and induced solid tumor regression in vivo, with robust homing and persistence within a murine neuroblastoma xenograft model.

There is emerging evidence that Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which inhibit JAK-dependent cytokine activity, may hold promise in sarcoidosis. In this open-label trial, 10 patients with recalcitrant sarcoidosis with cutaneous involvement were treated with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. There was no washout period and patients were permitted to continue, taper, or discontinue other treatments. The primary outcome was the change in the Cutaneous Sarcoidosis Activity and Morphology Instrument (CSAMI) activity score after 6 months. Change in internal organ disease activity was also assessed using total lesion glycolysis (TLG) determined by full-body positron emission tomography. A mean reduction in the CSAMI activity score of 82.7% was observed, with 6 patients showing a complete response. Internal organ response data was available in 8 patients; a decrease in TLG of [≥]50% was noted in 5 patients, with complete or near complete resolution in 3 (>98% reduction in TLG). Patients were generally able to significantly taper or discontinue their baseline immunosuppressive regimen, which included prednisone in 5 patients. Single cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-sequencing, and high-throughput proteomic analyses were performed on skin and blood as a function of treatment in order to delineate changes in immunologic signals with therapy. We identified CD4+ T cell derived IFN-gamma as a central cytokine driver of sarcoidosis and inhibition of its activity was achieved with tofacitinib and correlated closely with clinical improvement. Tofacitinib appears to have impressive activity in treatment of sarcoidosis and likely acts by inhibiting IFN-gamma, larger, controlled studies are warranted.","Damsky, W.; Wang, A.; Young, B.

This systematic review explored the use of telehealth consultations for people from racial/ethnic minority populations in relation to health outcomes, access to care, implementation facilitators and barriers, and satisfaction with care. Materials and Methods: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. Five major databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Screening, full-text review, quality appraisal and data extraction were all completed independently and in duplicate. A convergent integrated approach to data synthesis was applied with findings reported narratively. Results: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. Telehealth-delivered interventions were mostly effective for the treatment/management of physical and mental health conditions including depression, diabetes and hypertension. In several studies, telehealth improved access to care by providing financial and time benefits to patients. Technological difficulties were the main barriers to effective telehealth consultation, although overall satisfaction with telehealth-delivered care was high. Discussion Telehealth-delivered care for racial/ethnic minorities offers promise across a range of conditions and outcomes, particularly when delivered in the patient preferred language. However, telehealth may be problematic for some due to cost and limited digital and health literacy. Conclusion: The development and implementation of guidelines, policies and practices in relation to telehealth consultations for racial/ethnic minorities should consider the barriers and facilitators identified in this review to ensure existing health disparities are not exacerbated.","Truong, M.; Yeganeh, L.; Cook, O.; Crawford, K.; Wong, P.; Allen, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.25.21262592v1?rss=1,63

This article gives an overview of those proposals, with particular focus on religious weddings, including Anglican weddings. It examines proposed changes to each aspect of the process of getting married, from the preliminaries to the people required to officiate at the wedding, the permitted locations and the rules governing the content of the ceremony. The article argues that the legal status of marriage itself is highly flexible, recognising a range of unions. The proposed reforms aim to reflect the diverse range of views about the meaning of marriage, and ensure that the way in which the law recognises a legally binding wedding fits with the many different traditions according to which religious groups celebrate the formation of marriage.","Hopkins, Nicholas Welch Elizabeth",Ecclesiastical Law Journal,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0956618x21000351,63

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the most vulnerable trade sector to risk because they tend not to have sufficient resources to survive during the pandemic. Therefore, to maintain its existence, survival and sustainability strategies are essential concerns for SMEs. Accordingly, this paper aims to develop a framework on how SMEs build survival and sustainability strategies during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. The strategies were developed by adopting the Resource-based View (RBV). The proposed framework includes increasing human resources, expanding and increasing network utilization, maintaining financial resources, and increasing innovation in technology. Through strengthening and optimally utilizing resources, it is expected that SMEs can maintain their business existence well and can create a competitive advantage during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Najihah, N.; Permatasari, D.; Mutoharoh,","15th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, CISIS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79725-6_53,63

We assessed the risk of dying from perioperatively acquired COVID-19 during the peak of the London outbreak Materials and Methods: 43 consecutive patients who had vascular (n=48) procedures in March and April 2020 at a regional hub serving five London hospitals were analysed. The patients were screened for COVID-19 in the 30-day postoperative period and the main outcome measure was mortality from COVID-19. A comparison was then made with patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures from our integrated interventional radiology department. Median follow-up was 41days (IQR 8-58 days) Result: Three patients (7%) in the vascular group (median age 61 years all diabetic, two male) died from COVID-19, all of whom tested positive postoperatively. Two others became positive but recovered. In comparison two patients (2%) in the interventional radiology group died from COVID-19, however one was positive prior to their procedure Conclusion: Only urgent vascular cases should be performed during a COVID-19 surge, with elective work delayed or continued at clean sites However, with growing waiting lists for elective surgery currently, further restrictions may not be a viable long-term solution. Resumption of care at hot sites should be considered, if resources allow for it and if safety measures can be implemented. The advantages of minimally invasive surgery may inherently reduce risk as well Take-home Message: Only urgent vascular cases should be performed during a peak outbreak of COVID-19, however we cannot continue to postpone elective procedures indefinitely or restrict all cases to solely clean sites. The resumption of care at hot sites encompasses a fine balance of risks versus benefits .","Liu, P.; Cheema, S. M.; Adeoye, I.; Theivacumar, N. S.; Hussain, S.

It has demanded new forms of leadership and leadership practices that are network based and technologically driven. The rapid emergence of the ‘network school leader’ during the pandemic raises questions about the forms of leadership practices that are being enacted and the forms they take. The article examines the functions assigned to those occupying leadership positions in various education networking environments and focuses on the multi-faceted nature of leadership in these networks. This article considers some of the contemporary specialist literature on networking that offers insights into network leadership processes and practices. In this article, it is proposed that distributed leadership offers an important theoretical and analytical lens to investigate network school leadership more deeply. The article concludes by positing that in the dramatically changed world of education, network leadership is no longer an option for some but rather is a new educational imperative for all.

Individuals with low prepandemic levels of communication anxiety saw those levels increase, which negatively affected their self-efficacy. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to examine the moderating effect of fear of COVID-19 on the relationship between communication anxiety and self-efficacy. Materials/methods – Three measurement tools were used to perform analyses regarding the purpose of the research;the Communication Anxiety Scale, the Self-efficacy Scale, and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Along with these variables, the moderating effect of COVID-19 fear was examined. IBM’s SPSS 25 package program and Hayes’s process were used to perform the analysis. Data from 393 participants were included in the analysis within the scope of the research. Results – In the model in which the moderating effect of COVID-19 fear was examined, it was concluded that fear of COVID-19 worsened the relationship between communication anxiety and self-efficacy. In addition, a negative and significant result was obtained between communication anxiety and self-efficacy. Conclusion – According to the results obtained from this research, fear of COVID-19 increases communication anxiety and decreases self-efficacy. At the same time, fear of COVID-19 had a negative moderating effect on the relationship between communication anxiety and self-efficacy.

In this paper, we attempt to identify data patterns that signal either guessing on assessment problems or disengaging from the task for students while working through homework modules in an introductory physics class by contrasting data from the general student population with those who completed homework modules in controlled, observed environments. We found that abnormally short problem solving attempts that were previously modeled as a single guessing or answer copying behavior actually consisted of two different types of ""guessing"" behavior: rapid and strategic guessing. Both types were associated with lower levels of self-confidence, but had different distribution among proctored and unproctored student populations.

Here, we performed a global analysis of the mammalian MHC-Ii from 29 and 19 primary human and mouse tissues, respectively. First, we observed that different HLA-A, -B and -C allotypes do not contribute evenly to the global composition of the MHC-Ii across multiple human tissues. Second, we found that peptides that are presented in a tissue-dependent and -independent manner share very distinct properties. Third, we discovered that proteins that are evolutionarily hyperconserved represent the primary source of the MHC-Ii at the organism-wide scale. Finally, we uncovered new components of the antigen processing and presentation network that may drive the high level of heterogeneity of the MHC-Ii across different tissues in mammals. This study opens up new avenues toward a system-wide understanding of antigen presentation in vivo and may serve as ground work to understand tissue-dependent T cell responses in autoimmunity, infectious diseases and cancer.","Kubiniok, Peter; Marcu, Ana; Bichmann, Leon; Kuchenbecker, Leon; Schuster, Heiko; Hamelin, David; Despault, Jérome; Kovalchik, Kevin; Wessling, Laura; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Stevanovic, Stefan; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Neidert, Marian C.; Sirois, Isabelle; Caron, Etienne",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.28.317750,63

Methods and FindingsWe combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, as evidenced by their increased {pi}N/{pi}S ratios per geographical region. Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world. The S477N variant arose quickly in Australia and experimental data support that this variant increases Spike protein fitness and its binding to ACE2. ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 is evolving non-randomly, and human hosts shape emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population. We propose that V1776F and S477N variants occurring in the Spike protein are two novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and may pose significant public health concerns in the future.","Farkas, Carlos; Mella, Andy; Haigh, Jody J",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.23.20218511,63

The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has further disrupted agricultural activities and supply chains and has become a serious threat for public health. Like in many developing countries, South Asian farmers are now facing the double challenge of addressing the impacts of a changing climate and managing the disruptions caused by COVID-19. Despite growing concern, there is limited understanding of how climate change, public health, and COVID-19 interact, and of the possible pathways to achieving a climate-friendly recovery from COVID-19 to achieve food and nutrition security. In view of this, this paper explores the multifaceted challenges that farmers are now facing in South Asia due to climate change and the disruption caused by COVID-19 from the agricultural and food security lens. The analysis reveals that the complex interactions of COVID-19 and climate change have impacted all dimensions of food security. These interlinkages demand an integrated approach in dealing with food, public health, and climate change to harness synergies and minimize trade-offs between food production, public health, and climate mitigation. I present a framework to address the immediate challenge of COVID-19 and the longer-term challenge of anthropogenic climate change. Key elements of the framework include the strengthening health sector response capacities, strengthening of local and regional food systems, making agriculture resilient to pandemics, adopting flexible and smart approaches-including the implementation of climate-smart agricultural interventions on different scales, promotion of appropriate research and innovation, and the integration of short-term support to address the challenges of COVID-19 to build long-term productivity, and resilience of food systems by investing on natural capital. This framework would enable policy makers to choose the appropriate policy responses at different scales, to address these twin challenges of COVID-19 and climate change.","Rasul, G.",Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.679037,63

Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) are considered ""aerosol-generating procedures"" (AGPs) in the treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to measure air and surface environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus when CPAP and HFNO were used, compared with supplemental oxygen, to investigate the potential risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers and patients. Methods. 30 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, with a fraction of inspired oxygen [≥]0.4 to maintain oxygen saturations [≥]94%, were prospectively enrolled into an observational environmental sampling study. Participants received either supplemental oxygen, CPAP or HFNO (n=10 in each group). A nasopharyngeal swab, three air and three surface samples were collected from each participant and the clinical environment. RT qPCR analyses were performed for viral and human RNA, and positive/suspected-positive samples were cultured for the presence of biologically viable virus. Results. Overall 21/30 (70%) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx. In contrast, only 4/90 (4%) and 6/90 (7%) of all air and surface samples tested positive (positive for E and ORF1a) for viral RNA respectively, although there were an additional 10 suspected-positive samples in both air and surfaces samples (positive for E or ORF1a). CPAP/HFNO use or coughing was not associated with significantly more environmental contamination. Only one nasopharyngeal sample was culture positive. Conclusions.

The screen recovered twenty-one potential host proteins that modulate ZIKV replication in an IFN-dependent manner, including the previously known IFITM3 and LY6E. Further characterization contributed to delineate the spectrum of action of these genes towards other pathogenic RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV-2. Our data revealed that APOL3 acts as a proviral factor for ZIKV and several other related and unrelated RNA viruses. In addition, we showed that MTA2, a chromatin remodeling factor, possesses potent flavivirus-specific antiviral functions.

The aim of this study was to introduce Alphitobius diaperinus as a new intermediate host for Hadjelia truncata. METHODS: H. truncata infection was identified in a pigeon flock in Ahvaz City, Khuzestan Province, Iran by performing fecal examination and autopsy. Adult and larval stages of beetles were collected from the litter of pigeon houses, and identified morphologically. The beetle larvae were cultured in a medium, containing feces of the infected pigeons. Nematode larval stages from naturally and experimentally (culturally) infected adult beetles were fed to two groups of pigeons RESULTS: The collected beetles were identified as Alphitobius diaperinus. Average length and width of the adult beetles were 6.31 mm and 2.88 mm respectively. Infection rates of naturally and experimentally infected beetles with larval stages of the nematode were 66.2% and 45.1% respectively. The adult nematodes collected from gizzards of experimentally infected pigeons were identified as H. truncata. Nematode infection rates in pigeons after feeding the infective larvae collected from naturally and experimentally infected beetles were 44.7% and 32.5% respectively.

Identification of existing approaved therapy with proven safety profile to treat hyperinflammation is critical unmet need in order to reduce COVID-19 associated mortality. To date, no specific therapeutic drugs are available to treat COVID-19 infection. Preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune suppressive treatments might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease. This article review the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of COVID-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in attempt to provide valuable medication guidance for clinical treatment.","Rumende, Cleopas Martin; Susanto, Erwin C; Sitorus, Truely P",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020343/,63
187586,Chemists seek image overhaul.,2003,"Recent studies showed that nasal high flow (NHF) with or without supplemental oxygen can assist ventilation of patients with chronic respiratory and sleep disorders. The hypothesis of this study was to test whether NHF can clear dead space in two different models of the upper nasal airways. The first was a simple tube model consisting of a nozzle to simulate the nasal valve area, connected to a cylindrical tube to simulate the nasal cavity. The second was a more complex anatomically representative upper airway model, constructed from segmented CT-scan images of a healthy volunteer. After filling the models with tracer gases, NHF was delivered at rates of 15, 30, and 45 l/min. The tracer gas clearance was determined using dynamic infrared CO2 spectroscopy and 81mKr-gas radioactive gamma camera imaging. There was a similar tracer-gas clearance characteristic in the tube model and the upper airway model: clearance half-times were below 1.0 s and decreased with increasing NHF rates. For both models, the anterior compartments demonstrated faster clearance levels (half-times < 0.5 s) and the posterior sections showed slower clearance (half-times < 1.0 s). Both imaging methods showed similar flow-dependent tracer-gas clearance in the models. For the anatomically based model, there was complete tracer-gas removal from the nasal cavities within 1.0 s. The level of clearance in the nasal cavities increased by 1.8 ml/s for every 1.0 l/min increase in the rate of NHF. The study has demonstrated the fast-occurring clearance of nasal cavities by NHF therapy, which is capable of reducing of dead space rebreathing.","Möller, Winfried; Celik, Gülnaz; Feng, Sheng; Bartenstein, Peter; Meyer, Gabriele; Oliver, Eickelberg; Schmid, Otmar; Tatkov, Stanislav",Journal of applied physiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25882385/,63

METHODS Eighty-one patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward under the responsibility of three medical aid teams in the Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from February 8, 2020 to March 28, 2020, were selected to collect clinical data. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the disease status of the patients was classified into moderate cases (n=35), severe cases (n=39) and critical cases (n=7) when lymphocyte subset testing was performed. Their blood routine tests, lymphocyte subsets and other indicators were tested to compare whether there were differences in each indicator between the patients of different clinical classification groups. RESULTS The differences in the absolute count of total lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, CD4+T-lymphocytes, CD8+T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells among the three groups of patients were all statistically significant (P < 0.05), and the critical cases were significantly lower than the moderate and severe cases in the above indicators, and the indicators showed a decreasing trend with the severity of the disease. In 22 patients, the six indicators of the absolute count of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, CD4+T-lymphocytes, CD8+T-lymphocytes and NK cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio were all within the normal reference range in the first test, and 59 patients had abnormalities of the above indicators, with the absolute count of NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreasing most frequently (61%, 56%). The patients with the absolute count of NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes below the normal reference range were one group, and the remaining abnormal patients were the other group. There were more critical cases in the former group (moderate : severe : critical cases were 4 : 8 : 7 vs. 19 : 21 : 0, respectively, P=0.001), and all the deaths were in this group (6 cases vs. 0 case, P=0.001). The absolute B lymphocyte count was below the normal reference range in 15 patients, and the remaining 64 cases were within the normal range. The ratio of moderate, severe and critical cases in the reduced group was 4 : 7 : 4, and the ratio of critical cases was more in normal group which was 30 : 31 : 3, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P=0.043). CONCLUSION The more critical the clinical subtype of patients with COVID-19, the lower the absolute count of each subset of lymphocytes.","Bao, F; Shi, W L; Hu, J; Zhang, D; Gao, D H; Xia, Y X; Jing, H M; Ke, X Y; Ge, Q G; Shen, N",Beijing da xue xue bao.

METHODS We discuss and compare different methods of estimating the incubation distribution allowing for interval censoring of exposures, using data from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 as an example. RESULTS Combining data on unselected samples of 149 and 168 patients with defined exposure intervals from Toronto and Hong Kong, respectively, we estimated the mean and variance of the incubation period to be 5.1 day and 18.3 days and the 95th percentile to be 12.9 days. We conducted multiple linear regression on the log incubation times and found that incubation was significantly longer in Toronto than in Hong Kong and in older compared with younger patients, while it was significantly shorter in healthcare workers than in other patients. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest subtle but important heterogeneities in the incubation period of SARS among different strata of patients. Robust estimation of the incubation period should be independently carried out in different settings and subgroups for novel human pathogens using valid statistical methods.","Cowling, Benjamin J; Muller, Matthew P; Wong, Irene O L; Ho, Lai-Ming; Louie, Marie; McGeer, Allison; Leung, Gabriel M",Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17235210/,63

In contrast to [3H]glucosamine, gp300 showed very low levels of [3H]glucosamine, gp300 showed very low levels of [3H]mannose incorporation. The Mr of gp300 showed no detectable change upon treatment of purified virus with N-glycanase, and showed only a small change in virus-infected cells treated with tunicamycin. In addition, gp300 failed to bind the lectin concanavalin A. Taken together, these results indicate a lack of N-linked carbohydrate on gp300. The major carbohydrate species were found to be composed primarily of O-linked chains, as indicated by the sensitivity of the protein to monensin, to exoglycanase enzymes specific for sugars present in O-linked chains and to mild alkaline borohydride treatment, which revealed three species of carbohydrate of Mr of greater than 10,000, 2400 and 1100, respectively. Neuraminidase treatment and binding of Helix pomatia lectin indicated the presence of alpha-N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid as terminal sugars.

Recognizing the aminopeptidase N (APN or CD13) receptor on the membrane of tumor cells, the peptide can be further internalized into cytoplasma by the endosomal pathway. Hence NGR can serve as an ideal candidate for tumor imaging, once it is conjugated with fluorescent or radiolabeled imaging probes.

Impact on solar atmospheric heating,2021-08-04,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the emergency department (ED). METHODS Computerised records of all ED visits in January and May 2003 were analysed and compared, representing before and during the SARS epidemic respectively. Data were grouped into two categories. Group 1 was the indicators of impact on patients, including visitor's condition classification, number of patients that died on arrival (DOA), received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, underwent endotracheal intubation, needed mechanical ventilation, discharged against medical advice (AAD), died in the ED, and the admission rate to wards. Group 2 was the indicators of impact on the quality of medical care, including number of visits that returned within 72 hours (early returns), underwent chest radiography, upper abdomen sonography or computed tomography, and the length of stay. RESULTS There were 6650 and 3901 consecutive encounters in January and May 2003 respectively. There were significant differences on condition classifications (p = 0.000), increased rate of patients that underwent endotracheal intubation (p = 0.003), needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.020), and admission (p = 0.000). The rate of AAD decreased significantly (p = 0.024). There was no significant difference on early returns, although the length of stay in the ED increased (p = 0.043). The number of visits that underwent chest radiological examination increased (p = 0.000) and upper abdomen sonography (p = 0.007) decreased significantly in May. CONCLUSIONS SARS had an impact on the medical service system and decreased visits by 40% in the ED. Patients visiting the ED had more severe conditions than before.

202178,Insights on the role of periphytic biofilm in synergism with Iris pseudacorus for removing mixture of pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater,2021,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) non-structural proteins (nsps) play a key role in processing and maturation of the repertoire of structural and nsps of the virion, but little is known about the anti-nsp immune response. Here, it was hypothesized that pronounced antibody responses are generated to PRRSV nsp1 and nsp2, as they are present in infected cells and cytolytic infection releases viral proteins into interstitial spaces. Accordingly, nsp1 and nsp2 were cloned and expressed, and antibody responses in the sera of infected and vaccinated pigs were determined. Pigs mounted significant cross-reactive antibody responses that appeared equivalent to or greater than the response to nucleocapsid (N). Antibody reactivity to nsp1 and N was highly dependent on refolding of denatured proteins, suggesting that the porcine antibody response is directed primarily to conformational epitopes. The proteins reacted with sera from pigs infected with other PRRSV strains, indicating that multiple epitopes are conserved. Antibody responses to nsp1 and nsp2 were much higher than those to nsp4, which is encoded on the same RNA molecule and is equivalent in predicted antigenicity. These findings suggest either that nsp1 and nsp2 are highly immunogenic or that they are expressed at higher levels than nsp4 in PRRSV-infected cells, or both. Strong antibody responses to nsp1 and nsp2 may benefit the host by limiting potentially pathological consequences of viral protease activities encoded in these proteins that are released from dying cells. The identification of strain-specific antibody responses to a highly variable region of nsp2 may also provide the basis for immunoassays that differentiate serological responses of vaccines from field isolates.","Johnson, Craig R; Yu, Wanqin; Murtaugh, Michael P",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17374762/,63

208843,Chiral metal surfaces for enantioselective processes,2020,"The circulating metabolome provides a snapshot of the physiological state of the organism responding to pathogenic challenges. Here we report alterations in the plasma metabolome reflecting the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients with mild (ambulatory) diseases, moderate disease (radiologically confirmed pneumonitis, hospitalization and oxygen therapy), and critical disease (in intensive care). This analysis revealed major disease- and stage-associated shifts in the metabolome, meaning that at least 77 metabolites including amino acids, lipids, polyamines and sugars, as well as their derivatives, were altered in critical COVID-19 patient's plasma as compared to mild COVID-19 patients. Among a uniformly moderate cohort of patients who received tocilizumab, only 10 metabolites were different among individuals with a favorable evolution as compared to those who required transfer into the intensive care unit. The elevation of one single metabolite, anthranilic acid, had a poor prognostic value, correlating with the maintenance of high interleukin-10 and -18 levels. Given that products of the kynurenine pathway including anthranilic acid have immunosuppressive properties, we speculate on the therapeutic utility to inhibit the rate-limiting enzymes of this pathway including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase.","Danlos, François-Xavier; Grajeda-Iglesias, Claudia; Durand, Sylvère; Sauvat, Allan; Roumier, Mathilde; Cantin, Delphine; Colomba, Emeline; Rohmer, Julien; Pommeret, Fanny; Baciarello, Giulia; Willekens, Christophe; Vasse, Marc; Griscelli, Frank; Fahrner, Jean-Eudes; Goubet, Anne-Gaëlle; Dubuisson, Agathe; Derosa, Lisa; Nirmalathasan, Nitharsshini; Bredel, Delphine; Mouraud, Séverine; Pradon, Caroline; Stoclin, Annabelle; Rozenberg, Flore; Duchemin, Jérôme; Jourdi, Georges; Ellouze, Syrine; Levavasseur, Françoise; Albigès, Laurence; Soria, Jean-Charles; Barlesi, Fabrice; Solary, Eric; André, Fabrice; Pène, Frédéric; Ackerman, Félix; Mouthon, Luc; Zitvogel, Laurence; Marabelle, Aurélien; Michot, Jean-Marie; Fontenay, Michaela; Kroemer, Guido",Cell Death Dis,,63
210629,Reuse of Disposable Isolation Gowns in Rodent Facilities during a Pandemic,2021,"With the multiplication of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome cases due to SARS-COV2, some concerns about angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have emerged. Since the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to up-regulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.","Alexandre, Joachim; Cracowski, Jean-Luc; Richard, Vincent; Bouhanick, Béatrice",Ann Endocrinol (Paris),,63

Indeed, frailty could complicate the course of COVID-19, much more than the number of years lived. As demonstration, there are centenarians showing remarkable capacity to recover after coronavirus infection.We hypothesize that centenarian's portfolio could help in identifying protective biological mechanisms underlying the coronavirus infection.The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is one of the major genetic regions associated with human longevity, due to its central role in the development of adaptive immune response and modulation of the individual's response to life threatening diseases. The HLA locus seems to be crucial in influencing susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.In this hypothesis, we assume that the biological process in which HLA are involved may explain some aspects of coronavirus infection in centenarians, although we cannot rule out other biological mechanisms that these extraordinary persons are able to adopt to cope with the infection.","Guerini, Franca Rosa; Cesari, Matteo; Arosio, Beatrice",Immun Ageing,,63
214521,Scientists make precise gene edits to mitochondrial DNA for first time,2020,"Abstract Aim: This study aimed at understanding determinants of food choices and eating practices of aesthetics and weight class athletes from two countries. Methods: In this qualitative study, through recorded in-depth individual and focal group interviews, gymnasts (n = 16) and martial arts (n = 18) athletes from Brazil and Spain reported their eating practices. Transcripts were analyzed through the Content Analysis method. Results: The main determinants of athletes' eating practices were the quest for a specific body in line with each sports' discipline and cultural food aspects. The everyday eating practices respected the country of origin's food culture; however, some practices, especially aiming at weight loss were similar in both countries and related to the sports discipline. Female Brazilian aesthetics athletes were particularly worried about achieving a thinner body. Martial arts athletes from both countries reported adopting fast weight loss strategies presently or at some point in their sports trajectory. Internal and external pressure to lose weight was a constant factor, especially amongst Brazilians. Conclusions: There is a specific body culture in each sport discipline, which extends beyond country borders. The idealized bodies athletes seek are constructed socially according to their sports. This confers them an identity and promotes beliefs and meanings to foodways. The sports-related eating practices which superimposed national foodways were similar in both countries, suggesting a group identity process, and the existence of a ""sports discipline's food culture"". Understanding athletes' determinants of food choices and eating practices provide insights to address the gap between nutritional recommendations and eating practices.","Juzwiak, Claudia Ridel",Motriz (Online),,63

On February 23, 2020, the exanthema began in the first confirmed case of measles this year. At the same time, on February 28, 2020, the first case of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed. Up to June 6, 2020, 176 measles cases have been confirmed: 137 in Mexico City, 37 in the state of Mexico, and two in the state of Campeche. In Mexico City, municipalities with more cases were Gustavo A. Madero, Miguel Hidalgo, and Iztapalapa; in the State of Mexico were Ecatepec, Tlalnepantla, and Netzahualcoyotl; in Campeche, there are only two cases reported. On the other hand, 7,065,133 cases of COVID-19 have been registered worldwide with a global case fatality rate of 5.7%. In Mexico, there have been 113,619 confirmed cases and 13,511 deaths, while in Mexico City, there have been 30,223 cases and 3062 deaths. Iztapalapa and Gustavo A. Madero are the locations with more cases reported. Hence, a campaign of social distancing started as part of the strategies to control the spread of the infection. The potential threat is that as social confinement measures are relaxed and mobility is initiated, both viruses could continue to spread.

220904,Extraction of Carotenoids from Tomato Pomace via Water-Induced Hydrocolloidal Complexation,2020,"Purpose: Some authors have highlighted the danger of intraoral use of rotating instruments which can produce droplets and aerosols. During the Covid lockdown phase, dental operators were limited to providing emergency treatment that could not be postponed. Therefore, it is necessary for the dental team to restart safely to treat neglected oral diseases that may also affect systemic health. The role of the dental hygienist has apparently changed for procedures performed close to the patient's oral cavity, particularly in terms of the droplets and aerosols produced during oral hygiene practices. Through an analysis of the most recent literature on the use of dedicated PPE and changed post-Covid 19 work processes, and a review of the differences between manual causal therapy and mechanical therapy in terms of outcome after oral hygiene treatment, we define how the role of the dentï»¿al hygienist can change positively. Materials and Methods: Narrative reviews of the literature in terms of PPE adopted and oral hygiene procedures performed were carried out in Pubmed. Results: 188 articles from February 2020 to May 2020 using the search terms 'dentistry' and 'covid-19' were examined. 10 reviews of the literature were performed using the search terms 'mechanical procedures' and 'manual hygiene'. Conclusion: Only continuous update of evidence-based literature on the new standards in oral hygiene procedures and the different results yielded by different procedures can ensure a safe working environment for the dental hygienist while supporting the dentist in this phase of the pandemic.","Polizzi, Elisabetta; Tetè, Giulia",Oral Health Prev Dent,,63
220905,Extraction of Carotenoids from Tomato Pomace via Water-Induced Hydrocolloidal Complexation,2020,"Rapid, accurate, portable, and large-scale diagnostic technologies for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are crucial for controlling the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The current standard technologies, i.e., reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, serological assays, and computed tomography (CT) exhibit practical limitations and challenges in case of massive and rapid testing. Biosensors, particularly electrochemical conducting polymer (CP)-based biosensors, are considered as potential alternatives owing to their large advantages such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid detection, low cost, simplicity, flexibility, long self-life, and ease of use. Therefore, CP-based biosensors can serve as multisensors, mobile biosensors, and wearable biosensors, facilitating the development of point-of-care (POC) systems and home-use biosensors for COVID-19 detection. However, the application of these biosensors for COVID-19 entails several challenges related to their degradation, low crystallinity, charge transport properties, and weak interaction with biomarkers. To overcome these problems, this study provides scientific evidence for the potential applications of CP-based electrochemical biosensors in COVID-19 detection based on their applications for the detection of various biomarkers such as DNA/RNA, proteins, whole viruses, and antigens. We then propose promising strategies for the development of CP-based electrochemical biosensors for COVID-19 detection.","Tran, Vinh Van; Tran, Nhu Hoa Thi; Hwang, Hye Suk; Chang, Mincheol",Biosens Bioelectron,,63

This paper contributes to the growing literature by considering the dynamics of country-wise growth rates of infection numbers. Low-order serial correlation of growth rates is predominantly negative with cycles of two to four days for most countries. The results of fitted spatial autoregressive models suggest that there is high degree of spillover between countries. Forecast variances of many countries, in particular those with a high absolute number of infections, can to a large extent be explained by structural innovations of other countries.

Many articles are being published regarding medical staff protection and patient management during the pandemic. Objective To provide an easy access to and a trustful review of the main aspects that have changed in the head and neck surgery and otorhinolaryngology practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data Synthesis The search terms used were: (head and neck or otorhinolaryngology or ORL or thyroid) AND (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-COV-2] or COVID-19 or CORONAVIRUS). The results were limited to the year of 2020. Articles were read in English, Portuguese, French, German, and Spanish or translated from Chinese. All included articles were read by at least two authors. Thirty-five articles were included. Most articles suggest postponing elective surgeries, with exception to cancer surgeries, which should be evaluated separately. Twenty-five articles recommended some kind of screening prior to surgery, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and epidemiological data. Extra precautions, such as use of personal protective equipment (PPE), are suggested for both tracheostomies and endoscopies. Fifteen articles give recommendation on how to use telemedicine. Conclusion The use of PPE (N95 or powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) during procedures should be mandatory. Patients should be evaluated about their COVID-19 status before hospital admission. Cancer should be treated. Tracheostomy tube cuff should be inflated inside the tracheal incision. All COVID-19 precautions should be kept until there is a validated antiviral treatment or an available vaccine.","Hojaij, Flavio Carneiro; Chinelatto, Lucas Albuquerque; Boog, Gustavo Henrique Pereira; Kasmirski, Júlia Adriana; Lopes, João Vitor Ziroldo; Medeiros, Vitor Macedo Brito",Int. arch. otorhinolaryngol.

The search for a medication that could reduce risk of serious disease, and ideally of any manifestation of disease from SARS-CoV2, and of asymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV2 is of urgent interest. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is among the approaches to achieve these ends. We performed a systematic review of all interventional studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a focus on one repurposed drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The detailed analysis of these studies, some of them already recruiting, provide an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 prophylaxis around the world.

230596,The Impacts of Low Diversity Sequence Data on Phylodynamic Inference during an Emerging Epidemic,2021,"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown to be effective in preventing hospitalization for severe COVID-19. However, multiple reports of break-through infections and of waning antibody titers have raised concerns on the durability of the vaccine, and current discussions on vaccination strategies are centered on evaluating the opportunity of a third dose administration. Here, we monitored T cell responses to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in 71 healthy donors vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) for up to 6 months after vaccination. We find that vaccination induces the development of a sustained anti-viral memory T cell response which includes both the CD4+ and the CD8+ lymphocyte subsets. These lymphocytes display markers of polyfunctionality, are fit for interaction with cognate cells, show features of memory stemness, and survive in significant numbers the physiological contraction of the immune response. Collectively, this data shows that vaccination with BNT162b2 elicits an immunologically competent and potentially long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell population. Understanding the immune responses to BNT162b2 provides insights on the immunological basis of the clinical efficacy of the current vaccination campaign and may instruct future vaccination strategies.","Borsellino, Giovanna; Guerrera, Gisella; Picozza, Mario; Placido, Roberta; Pirronello, Marta; Verdiani, Alice; Termine, Andrea; Fabrizio, Carlo; Giannessi, Flavia; Sambucci, Manolo; Balice, Maria Pia; Caltagirone, Carlo; Salvia, Antonino; Rossini, Angelo; Battistini, Luca",,,63

Despite the majority of patients will evolve asymptomatic or mild-moderate upper respiratory tract infections, 20% will develop severe disease. Based on current pathogenetic knowledge, a severe COVID-19 form is mainly a hyperinflammatory, immune-mediated disorder, triggered by a viral infection. Due to their particular immunological features, pregnant women are supposed to be particularly susceptible to complicate by intracellular infections as well as immunological disturbances. As an example, immune-thrombosis has been identified as a common immune-mediated and pathogenic phenomenon both in COVID-19, in obstetric diseases and in COVID-19 pregnant women. According to extensive published clinical data, is rationale to expect an interference with the normal development of pregnancy in selected SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, mainly during third trimester.This manuscript provides insights of research to elucidate the potential harmful responses to SARS-CoV-2 and /or other coronavirus infections, as well as bidirectional interactions between COVID-19 and pregnancy to improve their respective management.","Ferrer-Oliveras, Raquel; Mendoza, Manel; Capote, Sira; Pratcorona, Laia; Esteve-Valverde, Enrique; Cabero-Roura, Lluis; Alijotas-Reig, Jaume",Arch Gynecol Obstet,,63

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, new structural data from many viral proteins have been provided at a very fast pace. This effort includes many cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, together with more traditional ones (X-rays, NMR), using several modeling approaches and complemented with structural predictions. At the same time, a plethora of new genomics and interactomics information (including fragment screening and structure-based virtual screening efforts) have been made available from different servers. In this context we have developed 3DBionotes-COVID-19 as an answer to: (1) The need to explore multi-omics data in a unified context with a special focus on structural information and (2) the drive to incorporate quality measurements, especially in the form of advanced validation metrics for cryogenic Electron Microscopy.

239384,How diseases rise and fall with the seasons—and what it could mean for coronavirus,2020,"The ultimate purpose of macroprudential policy is to avoid financial instability, such as banking crises, which have a long-lasting and devastating effect on the economy. Although a growing number of studies have examined the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth, few empirical studies have analyzed its effect on the probability of a banking crisis. Does macroprudential policy actually affect the probability of a banking crisis? Do other macroeconomic policies matter for the effectiveness of macroprudential policy? To answer these questions, this paper empirically investigates the effect of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis and its relationship with other macroeconomic policies. Specifically, using data on 65 countries from 2000 to 2016, we employ a probit model to analyze the effect of changes in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on crisis probability. Our results show that macroprudential policy is effective in changing the probability of a banking crisis via a credit channel and that its effectiveness depends on other macroeconomic policies. Changes in the LTV ratio are found to be effective in influencing the probability of a banking crisis in countries that have inflation targeting frameworks, floating exchange rate regimes, and/or no capital controls. Our results underscore the importance of policy coordination among different government bodies to design an appropriate macroprudential policy, especially in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis.","Nakatani, Ryota",Journal of policy modeling,,63

240120,Program and Abstracts for 2020 Annual Meeting of the Society for Glycobiology,2020,"A variety of serological tests have been developed to detect the presence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated the performance of 18 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Early (6-8 days after the start of symptoms) and late sera (>14 days) from ICU patients (n=10 and n=16, respectively) and healthcare workers (n=5 and n=9, respectively) were included. Additionally, 22 sera were included to detect potential cross-reactivity. Test characteristics were determined for the 18 assays. In >14 days samples, the Vircell IgG and Wantai Ig ELISAs had superior sensitivity compared to the other ELISAs (96%). Furthermore, the Roche Ig, the Epitope Diagnostics IgM, Wantai IgM, Euroimmun IgG, and IgA all showed a specificity of 100%. The POCTs of Boson Biotech and ACRO Biotech showed the highest sensitivities: 100% and 96% (83.5-99.8), respectively. The POCT of Orient Gene Biotech, VOMED Diagnostics, and Coris-Bioconcept showed highest specificities (100%). For the IgM and IgA assays, the Euroimmun IgA test showed the highest sensitivity in early samples: 46.7% (23.5-70.9) to 53.3% (29.1-76.5). In general, all tests performed better in patients with severe symptoms (ICU patients). We conclude that the Wantai Ig and Vircell IgG ELISAs may be suitable for diagnostic purposes. The IgM/IgA tests performed poorer than their IgG/Ig counterparts but may have a role in diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 in a population in which the background seroprevalence of IgG high, and IgM and/or IgA may distinguish between acute or past infection.","Hanssen, Daniëlle A T; Slaats, Michiel; Mulder, Marlies; Savelkoul, Paul H M; van Loo, Inge H M",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,63

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions were undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","Kraemer, Moritz U G; Yang, Chia-Hung; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Klein, Brennan; Pigott, David M; du Plessis, Louis; Faria, Nuno R; Li, Ruoran; Hanage, William P; Brownstein, John S; Layan, Maylis; Vespignani, Alessandro; Tian, Huaiyu; Dye, Christopher; Pybus, Oliver G; Scarpino, Samuel V",Science,,63

242538,E-consensus on telemedicine in proctology: A RAND/UCLA-modified study,2021,"The use of indicator species can simplify bird monitoring by reducing the level of specialized skills needed, which increases the potential pool of participants and reduces training costs and complexity. To facilitate monitoring in the humid forests of northeast Central America, we conducted point count surveys for birds across gradients of disturbance in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize, and analyzed the association of bird species with remotely sensed metrics of forest condition and anthropogenic disturbance using indicator species analysis. Twenty species exhibited significant associations with one or more of these metrics. We propose six species as indicators for anthropogenic disturbance based on our criteria of being associated with anthropogenically disturbed sites, or anthropogenically disturbed and riparian sites with no explicit mention in the literature of an obligate association with riparian habitats, or association of remotely sensed metrics that appeared to reflect disturbance: yellow-olive flycatcher, red-legged honeycreeper, dusky antbird, blue ground dove, buff-throated saltator, and brown jay. We propose the keel-billed motmot as an indicator of undisturbed forest based on its association with forested sites in our analyses. Green shrike vireo, collard trogon, rufous-tailed jacamar, and rufous piha were associated with a specific elevational range but not associated with disturbance, so upward shifts in elevation that might indicate response to climate change would not be confounded with habitat disturbance or degradation. This exercise yielded a much-reduced list of monitoring targets, which will greatly reduce the cost and complexity of forest bird monitoring in the region, as well as reducing barriers to participation.","King, David I; Jeffery, Matthew; Bailey, Brett A",Environ Monit Assess,,63

243337,"Reinfections, still rare, provide clues on immunity",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To address concerns regarding the effect of MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the expression of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Review of the current state of knowledge regarding the viral etiology of COVID-19, mechanisms of injury by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effect of individual DMTs on the risk of infection and COVID-19 disease expression. RESULTS: Although data are limited, MS DMTs do not obviously increase the risk of acquiring symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The severe morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be largely the consequence of an overly robust immune response rather than the consequence of unchecked viral replication. The effects of specific MS DMTs on the immune response that may increase the risk of impaired viral clearance and their potential counterbalancing beneficial effects on the development of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome are reviewed. CONCLUSION: Although there is currently insufficient real-world experience to definitively answer the question of the effect of a specific MS DMT on COVID-19, registries presently in nascent form should provide these answers. This review provides an approach to addressing these concerns while the data are being accumulated. Early insights suggest that the risk of infection and associated morbidity of COVID-19 in this population is little different than that of the population at large.","Berger, Joseph R; Brandstadter, Rachel; Bar-Or, Amit",,,63

This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations. Five patients who did not have positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded. CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was &#8804; 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was > 3 days). The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment. The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (p = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (r = 0.93; p = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (r = 0.83; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION. Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","Huang, Guoquan; Gong, Tao; Wang, Guangbin; Wang, Jianwen; Guo, Xinfu; Cai, Erpeng; Li, Shirong; Li, Xiaohu; Yu, Yongqiang; Lin, Liangjie",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,63

245564,Do coronavirus genes slip into human chromosomes?,2021,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization recommended measures to mitigate the outbreak such as social distancing and confinement. Since these measures have been put in place, anecdotal reports describe a decrease in the number of endovascular therapy (EVT) treatments for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect on EVT for patients with acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 confinement. In this retrospective, observational study, data were collected from November 1, 2019, to April 15, 2020, at 17 stroke centers in countries where confinement measures have been in place since March 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic (Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Canada, and United States). This study included 1600 patients treated by EVT for acute ischemic stroke. Date of EVT and symptom onset-to-groin puncture time were collected. Mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval and mean stroke onset-to-groin puncture time were calculated before confinement measures and after confinement measures. Distributions (non-normal) between the 2 groups (before COVID-19 confinement versus after COVID-19 confinement) were compared using 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The results show a significant decrease in mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval between before COVID-19 confinement (9.0 [95% CI, 7.8-10.1]) and after COVID-19 confinement (6.1 [95% CI, 4.5-7.7]), (P<0.001). In addition, there is a significant increase in mean stroke onset-to-groin puncture time (P<0.001), between before COVID-19 confinement (300.3 minutes [95% CI, 285.3-315.4]) and after COVID-19 confinement (354.5 minutes [95% CI, 316.2-392.7]). Our preliminary analysis indicates a 32% reduction in EVT procedures and an estimated 54-minute increase in symptom onset-to-groin puncture time after confinement measures for COVID-19 pandemic were put into place.","Hajdu, Steven D; Pittet, Valerie; Puccinelli, Francesco; Ben Hassen, Wagih; Ben Maacha, Malek; Blanc, Raphaël; Bracco, Sandra; Broocks, Gabriel; Bartolini, Bruno; Casseri, Tommaso; Clarençon, Frederic; Naggara, Olivier; Eugène, François; Ferré, Jean-Christophe; Guédon, Alexis; Houdart, Emmanuel; Krings, Timo; Lehmann, Pierre; Limbucci, Nicola; Machi, Paolo; Macho, Juan; Mandruzzato, Nicolo; Nappini, Sergio; Nawka, Marie Teresa; Nicholson, Patrick; Marto, João Pedro; Pereira, Vitor; Correia, Manuel A; Pinho-E-Melo, Teresa; Nuno Ramos, João; Raz, Eytan; Ferreira, Patrícia; Reis, João; Shapiro, Maksim; Shotar, Eimad; van Horn, Noel; Piotin, Michel; Saliou, Guillaume",Stroke,,63

Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has a strong scientific basis and historical perspective to treat previous viral infections such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma CP therapy in patients with COVID-19.We searched for every available study from major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE) through 20th April 2020. We independently screened, extracted, assessed the risk of bias, analyzed the data using SPSS version 26, and narratively summarized the data. For the outcomes, we wanted to evaluate the changes of clinical parameters, radiological appearance, pulmonary function, the titer of neutralizing antibody, viral load, the disappearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and adverse events.We found five case series from our literature searching. The overall methodological quality of the case series was moderate. We included 27 patients, and all patients received CP transfusion. All patients experienced improvement of clinical symptoms and pulmonary lesions after receiving 200 to 2400 mL (median 200 mL) of CP transfusion. All patients in reported studies had negative results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) after 1 to 26 days of transfusion (median 3 days). There was one non-life threatening adverse event reported after CP transfusion (facial red spot). In conclusion, CP therapy in COVID-19 patients showed promising results as it improved clinical symptoms and parameters, and it is well-tolerated based on our included studies. However, further expanded clinical trials with better designs are still required to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment although suchidea will be quite challenging to be conducted in the era of an epidemic.","Putera, David Dwi; Hardianti, Mardiah Suci",Journal Of The Medical Sciences (Berkala Ilmu Kedokteran),,63

251378,Recent Randomized Trials of Antithrombotic Therapy for Patients With COVID-19: JACC State-of-the-Art Review,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health crisis with an extremely rapid progress resulting in thousands of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment who may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). So far, no specific antiviral therapeutic agent has been demonstrated to be effective for COVID-19; therefore, the clinical management is largely supportive and depends on the patients' immune response leading to a cytokine storm followed by lung edema, dysfunction of air exchange, and ARDS, which could lead to multiorgan failure and death. Given that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various tissue sources have revealed successful clinical outcomes in many immunocompromised disorders by inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the microenvironment, there is a growing demand for MSC infusions in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS in the ICU. In this review, we have documented the rationale and possible outcomes of compassionate use of MSCs, particularly in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, toward proving or disproving the efficacy of this approach in the near future. Many centers have registered and approved, and some already started, single-case or phase I/II trials primarily aiming to rescue their critical patients when no other therapeutic approach responds. On the other hand, it is also very important to mention that there is a good deal of concern about clinics offering unproven stem cell treatments for COVID-19. The reviewers and oversight bodies will be looking for a balanced but critical appraisal of current trials.","Can, Alp; Coskun, Hakan",Stem cells transl. med. (Online),,63

The colony is protected and the species is included in the Convention on Conservation to Migratory Wild Animal Species, to which Argentina has adhered in 1991. As an alternative that could make compatible the opposed interests of the conservationists groups and the civil employees in charge of the security of the dam, the colony of bats was relocated and confined to one of the seven inner bays of the structure, without affecting the integrity of the colony. The controlled confinement will facilitate the later tasks of auscultation, indispensable to guarantee the security of the dam, the people, and the material goods and productive activities downstream, and will constitute an alternative of viable handling for the protection of the colony.","Nuñez, A.; Regidor, H.; Mosa, S.",Chiropt. neotrop.,,63

The hospital-based retrospective study analyzed 435 medical staffers, treated with or without thymosin drugs as preventive medicines in our hospital of Wuhan City, from January 25 to March 25, 2020. For the prophylactics, the medical staff was prevented from pre-exposure prophylaxis (risk prevention of exposure to COVID-19 patients before using thymosin drugs) and postexposure prophylaxis (risk prevention of exposure to COVID-19 patients after using thymosin drugs). The effectiveness and safety of thymosin drugs were studied in the prevention and control of COVID-19 application, in real-world data research for the application of the drug for COVID- 19. In a similar exposure environment, compared to medical staffers who did not take preventive medicine, the use of thymosin drugs, before exposure and after exposure had an insignificant effect, and the adverse drug reaction (ADR) was increased, especially when thymosin drugs were used together with &#945;-interferon.","Liu, Xiulan; Liu, Yi; Wang, Liuming; Hu, Luhong; Liu, Dong; Li, Juan",J. med. virol,,63

Applying the neuroticism questionnaire by A. Kokoshkarova and Multifactor questionnaire by R. Cattell, an empirical examination of 152 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 17 showed that quarantine measures under pandemic conditions increase the risk of neurotic disorders of adolescents owing to a very similar constellation of changes in such individual psychological factors as forced isolation, emotional instability because of exhausting tension, anxiety and worry emerging from timidity. Hence, preventive and rehabilitative measures, aimed at reducing the risks of adolescents neurotization after the quarantine period in the face of an epidemiological threat should be focused primarily on increasing communication openness, emotional stability, social courage, self-confidence reducing anxiety and tension.","Aleksandrov, D.; Okhrimenko, I.",Brain-Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience,,63

Long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients who discharge intensive care unit (ICU) are unclear. ObjectivesWe investigated the effect of COVID-19 on lung structure, pulmonary functional, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients discharge from ICU and medical ward. MethodsA prospective single-centre study conducted in PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients who has been discharged from University of Health Sciences, Dr. Suat Seren Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Teaching and Research Hospital between 15 January and 5 March 2021. Patients who followed up for more than 48 hours in ICU and more than 72 hours in medical ward were included the study. Computed tomography scores, pulmonary functional tests (PFT), 6-min walking distance and health related quality of life by SF-36 were compared between ICU and medical ward patients at 6 months after discharge. ResultsSeventy patients were included final analyses and 31 of them discharged from ICU. ICU patients had higher CT scores than non-ICU patients at admission (17 vs 11) and follow up visit (6 vs 0). Two-three of ICU patients had at least one abnormal finding at control CT. Advanced age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15) and higher CT score at admission (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.27) were risk factors for having radiological abnormalities at control CT. ConclusionA number of COVID-19 survivors especially with severe disease could not fully recover after 6 months of hospital discharge.","Yildirim, Suleyman; Susam, Seher; Cimen, Pinar; Yapicioglu, Sena; Sunecli, Onur; Ediboglu, Ozlem; Kirakli, Cenk",,,63

In Spring 2020, a 3-station remote Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was implemented for first-year pharmacy students. The day following the remote OSCEs students answered three open-text prompts about the remote OSCE experience: (1) ""I liked..."", (2) ""I learned "", and (3) ""I suggest "". Responses were open-coded and frequency counts were calculated to determine the most prevalent codes. Concept maps were created to visualize and explore connections between the codes. Out of 157 students, 156 students completed the reflection assignment, a 99.36% response rate. The three major themes in the Liked data were: Logistics (n = 65, 41.7%), Differences In-person Versus Remote (n = 59, 37.8%), and Skill Development (n = 43, 27.6%). The three major themes in the Learned data were: Technology (n = 66, 42.3%), Communication (n = 58, 37.2%), and Skill Development (n = 56, 35.9%). The three major themes in the Suggest data were: Logistics (n = 89, 57.1%), Technology (n = 31, 19.9%), and Continuation of Remote OSCE (n = 31, 19.9%). Overall, the remote OSCE experience was well-received, and students described it as applicable to their future pharmacy practice. Future work should explore the design, implementation, and outcomes of remote OSCEs.","Savage, Amanda; Minshew, Lana M; Anksorus, Heidi N; McLaughlin, Jacqueline E",,,63
263907,Biodiversity Conservation and the Earth System: Mind the Gap,2020,"Medicinal mushrooms have documented effects against different diseases, including infections and inflammatory disorders. The related Basidiomycota Agaricus blazei Murill (AbM), Hericium erinaceus (HE), and Grifola frondosa (GF) have been shown to exert antimicrobial activity against viral agents, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and parasites in vitro and in vivo. Since the mechanism is immunomodulatory and not antibiotical, the mushrooms should be active against multi-drug resistant microbes as well. Moreover, since these Basidiomycota also have anti-inflammatory properties, they may be suited for treatment of the severe lung inflammation that often follows COVID-19 infection. An AbM-based mushroom extract (Andosan&#8482;), also containing HE and GF, has been shown to significantly reduce bacteraemia and increase survival in mice with pneumococcal sepsis, and to improve symptoms and quality of life in IBD patients via an anti-inflammatory effect. Hence, such mushroom extracts could have prophylactic or therapeutic effect against the pneumonic superinfection and severe lung inflammation that often complicates COVID-19 infection. Here, we review antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of AbM, HE and GF mushrooms, which could be used for the battle against COVID-19.","Hetland, Geir; Johnson, Egil; Bernardshaw, Soosaipillai V; Grinde, Bjørn",Scand J Immunol,,63

266532,Editorial 58(1),2020,"The brain has its own intrinsic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with all its components present in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent data demonstrate that also the main components of the angiotensin concerting enzyme 2 (ACE2) system (at least ACE2 itself, as well as the biologically active angiotensin (1-7) and its cognate receptor Mas) are expressed in the brain. Aside from these members, alamadine and MrgD are discussed as further members that have neuro-active roles in the CNS. Little is known about the possible functions of MrgD within the brain. Concerning angiotensin (1-7) acting through the Mas receptor, data were accumulating that this system is involved in numerous processes contributing to neuronal plasticity and even learning and memory. Malfunctions in the brain ACE2 system are associated with disturbances in neuronal plasticity. Since SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity towards ACE2, Neuro-Covid may directly or indirectly depend on a disturbed balance in the ACE2 derived angiotensin system in the brain. Since the ACE2 system in the brain is far from being understood, a deeper understanding of e.g. the angiotensin (1-7) / Mas system is needed, especially with regard to the roles of angiotensin (1-7) in neuronal plasticity.","von Bohlen Und Halbach, Oliver",Histol Histopathol,,63

Currently, effective treatment of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is limited and broad spectrum antiviral therapies to meet other emerging pandemics are absent leaving the World population largely unprotected. Here, we have identified distinct members of the family of polyether ionophore antibiotics with potent ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathogenicity in cells. Several compounds from this class displayed more than 100-fold selectivity between viral-induced cytopathogenicity and inhibition of cell viability, however the compound X-206 displayed >500-fold selectivity and was furthermore able to inhibit viral replication even at sub-nM levels. The antiviral mechanism of the polyether ionophores is currently not understood in detail. We demonstrate, e.g. through unbiased bioactivity profiling, that their effects on the host cells differ from those of cationic amphiphiles such as hydroxychloroquine. Collectively, our data suggest that polyether ionophore antibiotics should be subject to further investigations as potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","Svenningsen, Esben B; Thyrsted, Jacob; Blay-Cadanet, Julia; Liu, Han; Lin, Shaoquan; Moyano-Villameriel, Jaime; Olagnier, David; Idorn, Manja; Paludan, Søren R; Holm, Christian K; Poulsen, Thomas B",Antiviral Res,,63

We aimed to present patients who presented to the emergency department without any coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and were incidentally diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 in addition to the diagnosis related to their complaints on presentation. Materials and Methods: The study included patients presented to the emergency department of a hospital in Erzurum (Turkey) with non-coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and were incidentally diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 on the basis of their chest computed tomography findings. The patients' primary diagnoses were evaluated, and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to confirm the incidental coronavirus disease 2019 diagnoses. Results: The 42 patients included in the study had various complaints, and the most common complaint was abdominal pain in 8 patients (19%). The other complaints were at different rates. The most common diagnose was ST-elevated myocardial infarction in 6 patients (14.3%), and the other diagnoses were rib fracture in 3 patients (7.1%) and other similar diseases in the remaining patients. Conclusion: Patients with highly the contagious coronavirus disease 2019 can sometimes be asymptomatic and can be incidentally diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 after presenting to emergency departments with symptoms and manifestations other than those of coronavirus disease 2019. Therefore, healthcare professionals working in the emergency department should approach all patients who present to the emergency service as potential coronavirus disease 2019 carriers and wear their protective equipment and take necessary precautions.

Across many sectors, low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) lag behind more economically developed countries in their application of this safety science, due to resource and, in some cases, awareness and expertise. Most previous applications of HFE related to occupational ergonomics rather than healthcare safety. METHODS: The paper details how the reputation of HFE is being developed within healthcare communities of Latin America (LatAm), through increasing awareness and understanding of its role as safety science in the healthcare sector. It starts by articulating the need for HFE and then provides examples from Mexico, Colombia and Peru. RESULTS: The practical examples for research and education illustrate a developing awareness of the relevance of HFE to the healthcare sectors in LatAm and an appreciation of its worth to improve health service quality and patient safety through healthcare community engagement. A new LatAm Network of HFE in Healthcare Systems (RELAESA) was formed in 2019, which has provided a platform for HFE advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a real opportunity in LatAm and other LMIC health services to make more rapid and sustainable progress in healthcare-embedded HFE than has been experienced within healthcare services of more developed nations.","Aceves-González, Carlos; Rodríguez, Yordán; Escobar-Galindo, Carlos Manuel; Pérez, Elizabeth; Gutiérrez-Moreno, Beatriz; Hignett, Sue; Lang, Alexandra Rosewall",Int J Qual Health Care,,63

Previous reviews show a high prevalence of mental disorders among health care workers, but these need updating and inclusion of studies written in Chinese. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese. METHODS: Systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies published in both English and Chinese were included. RESULTS: Data on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%). Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder. Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate support is urgently needed. The response would benefit from additional research on which interventions are effective at mitigating these risks.","Li, Yufei; Scherer, Nathaniel; Felix, Lambert; Kuper, Hannah",PLoS One,,63

Moreover, school closure is systematically associated with the development of problems involving students, teachers and parents, particularly among populations with poor resources. Although several researches have tried to evaluate the real efficacy of school closure for pandemic control over time, no definitive answer to this question has been given. Available findings seem to confirm that to ensure adequate learning and to avoid social and economic problems, schools must remain open, provided that the adults who follow children at home and at school absolutely comply with recommendations for prevention measures and that school facilities can be optimized in order to significantly reduce the spread of infection. In this regard, the universal use of face masks in addition to hand hygiene and safe distancing in schools, at least starting from the age of 6 years, seems extremely useful. Moreover, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak the use of telemedicine to manage suspected SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in the community has appeared to be an easy and effective measure to solve many paediatric problems and could represent a further support to schools . CONCLUSIONS: We think that schools must remain open, despite COVID-19 pandemic. However, several problems strictly related to school frequency and reduction of infectious risk must be solved before school attendance can be considered completely safe. A single more in-depth guideline agreed between countries with the same school problems could be very useful in eliminating doubts and fostering the compliance of students, teachers and non-teaching school staff reducing errors and misinterpretations.","Esposito, Susanna; Cotugno, Nicola; Principi, Nicola",Ital J Pediatr,,63

However, it is toxic to the eye and skin. This study investigated the neutralization of BAK using ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation as an effort to reduce BAK toxicity potential. METHODS: BAK solutions were irradiated with a germicidal UVC lamp at various doses. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) were then exposed to the UVC-irradiated BAK solutions for 5 minutes. After exposure, the cultures were assessed for metabolic activity using PrestoBlue; for cell viability using confocal microscopy with viability dyes; and for tight junction proteins using immunofluorescence staining for zonula occludens (ZO)-1. RESULTS: UVC radiation reduced BAK toxicity on cell metabolic activity in a dose-dependent manner. When the solution depth of BAK was 1.7 mm, the UVC doses needed to completely neutralize the toxicity of BAK 0.005% and 0.01% were 2.093 J/cm2 and 8.374 J/cm2, respectively. The cultures treated with UVC-neutralized BAK showed similar cell metabolic activity and cell viability to those treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (p = 0.806 â¼ 1.000). The expression of ZO-1 was greatly disturbed by untreated BAK; in contrast, ZO-1 proteins were well maintained after exposure to UVC-neutralized BAK. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the cell toxicity of BAK can be neutralized by UVC radiation, which provides a unique way of detoxifying BAK residues. This finding may be of great value in utilizing the antimicrobial efficacy of BAK (e.g. fighting against SARS-CoV-2) while minimizing its potential hazards to human health and the environment.","Xu, Manlong; Sivak, Jacob G; McCanna, David J",Cutan Ocul Toxicol,,63

We herein detail a case of a young patient who suffered life-threatening disease and multiorgan failure. His clinical course involved rapid and profound respiratory decompensation such that he required support with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). He also demonstrated hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein peak 444.6 mg/L) with severe cytokine elevation (Interleukin-6 peak > 3000 pg/ml). Through treatment targeting hyperinflammation, he recovered from critical COVID-19 respiratory failure and required only 160 hours of VV-ECMO support. He was extubated 4 days after decannulation, had progressive renal recovery, and was discharged to home on hospital day 24. Of note, repeat SARS-CoV-2 test was negative 21 days after his first positive test. We present one of the first successful cases of VV-ECMO support to recovery of COVID-19 respiratory failure in North America.","Hartman, Matthew E; Hernandez, Roland A; Patel, Krish; Wagner, Teresa E; Trinh, Tony; Lipke, Anne B; Yim, Eric T; Pulido, Juan N; Pagel, John M; Youssef, Samuel J; Mignone, John L",ASAIO J,,63

Two different sequential assembly approaches in comparison with a direct single-step protocol were applied, and molecular organization in correlation with biological activity of the resulting nanoparticle systems was investigated. Differences in the structure of the nanoparticles were revealed by thorough physicochemical characterization including small angle neutron scattering (SANS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). All hybrid systems, combining lipid and polymer, displayed significantly increased transfection in comparison to lipid/mRNA and polymer/mRNA particles alone. For the hybrid nanoparticles, characteristic differences regarding the internal organization, release characteristics, and activity were determined depending on the assembly route. The systems with the highest transfection efficacy were characterized by a heterogenous internal organization, accompanied by facilitated release. Such a system could be best obtained by the single step protocol, starting with a lipid and polymer mixture for nanoparticle formation.","Siewert, Christian D; Haas, Heinrich; Cornet, Vera; Nogueira, Sara S; Nawroth, Thomas; Uebbing, Lukas; Ziller, Antje; Al-Gousous, Jozef; Radulescu, Aurel; Schroer, Martin A; Blanchet, Clement E; Svergun, Dmitri I; Radsak, Markus P; Sahin, Ugur; Langguth, Peter",,,63

Application to biodegradability studies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic factors may impact how a patient is treated for prostate cancer (CaP). Our objective was to determine if county of residence or neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics were associated with treatment for CaP in New York City (NYC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the NYSPACED database to identify men aged 40 to 80 years with localized CaP in NYC between 2004 and 2016. We categorized patients into receiving either aggressive local therapy (ALT) or non-aggressive treatment (NT). We identified borough of residence through NYSPACED and used Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) designation to define neighborhood characteristics using United States Census data. We hypothesized that differences exist in use of ALT according to county of residence and neighborhood characteristics. We used multivariable logistic regression to test the association between county of residence and ALT as well as between ALT and PUMA characteristics. RESULTS: Our cohort included 40,668 patients. Overall, 80% had ALT, and 21% had NT. NT use increased over time from 16% in 2004 to 32% in 2016 (P < .001). On multivariable logistic regression, patients in Manhattan were less likely to receive ALT compared with those in other boroughs (P < .001). PUMAs with lower education attainment, larger foreign-born populations, lower crime rate, and higher median income were significantly associated with receipt of ALT (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant differences in use of treatment for men with newly diagnosed CaP in NYC. The ability to receive this treatment was associated with borough of residence as well as neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. Additional research is required to identify barriers in access to NT within NYC.","Smigelski, Michael; Wallace, Brendan K; Lu, Jun; Li, Gen; Anderson, Christopher B",,,63

294572,U.S. 'Warp Speed' vaccine effort comes out of the shadows,2020,"In this paper, we proposed a multi-method modeling approach to community-level spreading of COVID-19 disease. Our methodology was composed of interconnected age-stratified system dynamics models in an agent-based modeling framework that allowed for a granular examination of the scale and severity of disease spread, including metrics such as infection cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU usage. Model parameters were calibrated using an optimization technique with an objective function to minimize error associated with the cumulative cases of COVID-19 during a training period between March 15 and October 31, 2020. We outlined several case studies to demonstrate the model's state- and local-level projection capabilities. We further demonstrated how model outcomes could be used to evaluate perceived levels of COVID-19 risk across different localities using a multi-criteria decision analysis framework. The model's two, three, and four week out-of-sample projection errors varied on a state-by-state basis, and generally increased as the out-of-sample projection period was extended. Additionally, the prediction error in the state-level projections was generally due to an underestimation of cases and an overestimation of deaths. The proposed modeling approach can be used as a virtual laboratory to investigate a wide range of what-if scenarios and easily adapted to future high-consequence public health threats.","Mokhtari, Amir; Mineo, Cameron; Kriseman, Jeffrey; Kremer, Pedro; Neal, Lauren; Larson, John",Sci Rep,,63

The primary objective of this study was to assess the effects of hydroxychloroquine according to its plasma concentration in ICU patients. A single-center retrospective study was performed from March to April 2020 in an ICU of a university hospital. All patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed Covid-19 pneumonia and treated with hydroxychloroquine were included. The study compared 17 patients in whom the hydroxychloroquine plasma concentration was in the therapeutic target (on-target) and 12 patients in whom the plasma concentration was below the target (off-target). The follow-up of patients was 15 days. No association was found between hydroxychloroquine plasma concentration and viral load evolution (P = 0.77). There was no significant difference between the two groups for duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, in-hospital mortality, and 15-days mortality. These findings indicate that hydroxychloroquine administration for Covid-19 patients hospitalized in ICU is not associated with improved outcomes. Larger multicenter studies are needed to confirm these results.","Lopez, Alexandre; Duclos, Gary; Pastene, Bruno; Bezulier, Karine; Guilhaumou, Romain; Solas, Caroline; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent; Leone, Marc",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,63
296123,How to digitize your lab notebooks,2020,"Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is widely used in biological and chemical sensing with fascinating properties. However, the application of SPR to detect trace targets is hampered by non-specific binding and poor signal. A variety of approaches for amplification have been explored to overcome this deficiency including DNA aptamers as versatile target detection tools. Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a high-efficiency enzyme-free DNA amplification method operated at room temperature, in which two stable species of DNA hairpins coexist in solution until the introduction of the initiator strand triggers a cascade of hybridization events. At an optimal salt condition, as the concentrations of H1 and H2 increased, the HCR signals were enhanced, leading to signal amplification reaching up to 6.5-fold of the detection measure at 30 min. This feature enables DNA to act as an amplifying transducer for biosensing applications to provide an enzyme-free alternative that can easily detect complex DNA sequences. Improvement of more diverse recognition events can be achieved by integrating HCR with a phase-sensitive SPR (pSPR)-tested aptamer stimulus. This work seeks to establish pSPR aptamer system for highly informative sensing by means of an amplification HCR. Thus, combining pSPR and HCR technologies provide an expandable platform for sensitive biosensing.","Yang, Ching-Hsu; Wu, Tzu-Heng; Chang, Chia-Chen; Lo, Hui-Yun; Liu, Hui-Wen; Huang, Nien-Tsu; Lin, Chii-Wann",Biosensors (Basel),,63
296269,Playing with Creativity Across the Lifespan: a Conversation with Dr. Sandra Russ,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease characterised by systemic inflammation, which might enhance baseline thrombotic risk, especially in hospitalised patients. Little is, however, known about predictors of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively followed up 180 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Demographics, clinical and laboratory features at presentation and past medical history were tested as predictors of the first thrombotic complication through multivariate Cox regression analysis and a categorical score generated based on the results. RESULTS: Sixty-four thromboses were recorded in 54 patients, of whom seven with thrombosis on admission and 47 with thrombosis during hospitalisation. Patients with thrombosis were mainly Caucasian and diabetic, had marked baseline signs of inflammation and organ damage, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio, higher D-dimer levels and history of major haemorrhages. The latter three variables were independently associated to thrombotic complications and concurred to a 0-5 score, which accounted for 80% of the total sample variability. Patients with three or more points of the newly generated score were at higher risk for thrombotic complications (HR=4.9, p<0.001). Patients with thrombotic complications were more likely to be admitted to intensive care and/or to die (HR=1.9, p=0.036). Five of 180 patients were diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation and three of them died. Eleven minor and no major bleeding events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk for thrombosis and might be stratified on admission based lower Pao2/FiO2 ratio, higher D-dimer levels and history of major haemorrhages.","Ramirez, Giuseppe A; Calvisi, Stefania L; DE Lorenzo, Rebecca; DA Prat, Valentina; Borio, Giorgia; Gallina, Gabriele; Farolfi, Federica; Cavallo, Ludovica; Pascali, Maria; Castellani, Jacopo; Baccellieri, Domenico; Guzzo, Francesca; Baiardo Redaelli, Martina; Azzolini, Maria Luisa; Alba, Ada C; Zangrillo, Alberto; Bozzolo, Enrica P; Scotti, Raffaella; DI Lucca, Giuseppe; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Rovere Querini, Patrizia; D039,; Angelo, Armando; Tresoldi, Moreno",Minerva med,,63

298866,Did a Chinese team 'obscure' early coronavirus sequences?,2021,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) infections almost always caused overt symptoms, so effective case and contact management enabled its effective eradication within months. However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes only mild symptoms, so transmission chains may grow to include several individuals before at least one index case becomes ill enough to self-report for diagnosis and care. Here, simple mathematical models were developed to evaluate the implications of delayed index case detection for retrospective contact tracing and management responses. Specifically, these simulations illustrate how: (1) Contact tracing and management may effectively contain most but not all large SARS-CoV-2 clusters arising at foci with high reproduction numbers because rapidly expanding transmission chains ensure at least one overtly symptomatic index case occurs within two viral generations a week or less apart. (2) However, lower reproduction numbers give rise to thinner transmission chains extending through longer sequences of non-reporting asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals, often spanning three or more viral generations (&#8805;2 weeks of transmission) before an overtly symptomatic index case occurs. (3) Consequently, it is not always possible to fully trace and contain such long, thin transmission chains, so the community transmission they give rise to is underrepresented in surveillance data. (4) Wherever surveillance systems are weak and/or transmission proceeds within population groups with lower rates of overt clinical symptoms and/or self-reporting, case and contact management effectiveness may be more severely limited, even at the higher reproduction numbers associated with larger outbreaks. (5) Because passive surveillance platforms may be especially slow to detect the thinner transmission chains that occur at low reproduction numbers, establishing satisfactory confidence of elimination may require that no confirmed cases are detected for two full months, throughout which presumptive preventative measures must be maintained to ensure complete collapse of undetected residual transmission. (6) Greater scope exists for overcoming these limitations by enhancing field surveillance for new suspected cases than by improving diagnostic test sensitivity. (7) While population-wide active surveillance may enable complete traceability and containment, this goal may also be achievable through enhanced passive surveillance for paucisymptomatic infections, combining readily accessible decentralized testing with population hypersensitization to self-reporting with mild symptoms. Containment and elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will rely far more upon presumptive, population-wide prevention measures than was necessary for SARS-CoV-1, necessitating greater ambition, political will, investment, public support, persistence and patience. Nevertheless, case and contact management may be invaluable for at least partially containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially larger outbreaks, but only if enabled by sufficiently sensitive surveillance. Furthermore, consistently complete transmission chain containment may be enabled by focally enhanced surveillance around manageably small numbers of outbreaks in the end stages of successful elimination campaigns, so that their endpoints may be accelerated and sustained.","Killeen, Gerry F; Kearney, Patricia M; Perry, Ivan J; Conroy, Niall",,,63

We show the application of the method to data from Italy and several of its region; it is found that $R_0$ had decreased consistently below 1 around March 20, and in the beginning of April it was between 0.5 and 0.8 in the whole Italy and in most regions.","Pugliese, Andrea; Sottile, Sara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09404v1.pdf,63

DESIGN: Quantitative analysis of resident-level assessment data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Long-stay residents living in Connecticut nursing homes. METHODS: We used Minimum Data Set assessments to measure nursing home resident outcomes observed in each week between March and July 2020 for long-stay residents (eg, those in the nursing home for at least 100 days) who lived in a nursing home at the beginning of the pandemic. We compared outcomes to those observed at the beginning of the pandemic, controlling for both resident characteristics and patterns for outcomes observed in 2017-2019. RESULTS: We found that nursing home resident outcomes worsened on a broad array of measures. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased by 6 percentage points relative to before the pandemic in the beginning of March-representing a 15% increase. The share of residents with unplanned substantial weight loss also increased by 6 percentage points relative to the beginning of March-representing a 150% increase. We also found significant increases in episodes of incontinence (4 percentage points) and significant reductions in cognitive functioning. Our findings suggest that loneliness and isolation play an important role. Though unplanned substantial weight loss was greatest for those who contracted COVID-19 (about 10% of residents observed in each week), residents who did not contract COVID-19 also physically deteriorated (about 7.5% of residents in each week). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These analyses show that the pandemic had substantial impacts on nursing home residents beyond what can be quantified by cases and deaths, adversely affecting the physical and emotional well-being of residents. Future policy changes to limit the spread of COVID-19 or other infectious disease outbreaks should consider any additional costs beyond the direct effects of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.","Levere, Michael; Rowan, Patricia; Wysocki, Andrea",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,63

313002,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in Water and Wastewater,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted immunization activities in many countries, causing declines in the delivery of routine doses of antigens, and the postponement of scheduled supplemental immunization activities (SIAs). Following the declaration of the pandemic, Ethiopia postponed nationwide follow-up measles preventive vaccination campaign which was scheduled for April 2020. The disruptions to routine services and the postponement of the SIAs increased the risk for measles outbreaks. The national authorities, in consultation with the secretariat of the National COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention and Control Ministerial Coordination Committee, subnational level authorities, technical partner agencies and stakeholders, reviewed the risks for measles outbreaks and decided to implement the nationwide measles SIAs, with strict implementation of COVID prevention measures. The revised micro-plans accommodated the additional human resource and logistics needs for COVID prevention, for which partner resources were mobilized to fill the gaps. The key SIAs preparatory and implementation activities including training, logistics, social mobilization, service delivery and supervision were modified to take into consideration the COVID context. Infection prevention and control supplies were procured and distributed as a package with the bundled vaccines and other supplies. The SIAs were completed in July 2020 and reached 102.8% administrative coverage nationwide, with 78% of the 1123 woredas attaining the target of 95% coverage. The strong commitment of the leadership, the coordination role of the national and regional COVID prevention and control taskforces, the engagement of community leaders, the use of multi-channel communication, the timely availability of additional resources and modification of the service delivery approaches contributed to the success of the SIAs.","Nigus, Mulat; Zelalem, Meseret; Abraham, Kibrom; Shiferaw, Amsalu; Admassu, Mekonnen; Masresha, Balcha",Pan Afr Med J,,63
313916,Suitability of DIALux for designing UVC disinfection cabins,2021,"PURPOSE: Little evidence of increased thrombotic risk is available in COVID-19 patients. Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.","Helms, Julie; Tacquard, Charles; Severac, François; Leonard-Lorant, Ian; Ohana, Mickaël; Delabranche, Xavier; Merdji, Hamid; Clere-Jehl, Raphaël; Schenck, Malika; Fagot Gandet, Florence; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Castelain, Vincent; Schneider, Francis; Grunebaum, Lélia; Anglés-Cano, Eduardo; Sattler, Laurent; Mertes, Paul-Michel; Meziani, Ferhat",Intensive Care Med,,63

Previously infected individuals were excluded from pivotal clinical trials and the optimum dose regimen in this population has not been clearly studied. The CRO-VAX HCP study aims to investigate the early antibody response in a population of health-care professionals having received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. METHODS: The CRO-VAX HCP study is a multicentre, prospective, interventional study conducted in several sites in Belgium. The study included 231 health-care professional volunteers who received the two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 73 were previously infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 158 were uninfected and seronegative. In the first group, blood samples were collected at baseline and after 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days. In the second group, samples were obtained at baseline and after 14 and 28 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time-points. RESULTS: In uninfected individuals, 95.5% (95% CI 91.0%-98.2%) developed anti-spike antibodies after 14 days and a 24.9-fold rise (95% CI 21.4%-28.9%) in antibody titre was observed after the second dose. In previously infected individuals, peak antibody response was reached after 7 days (i.e. 6347 U/mL) and the second dose did not lead to significantly higher antibody titres (i.e. 8856-11 911 U/mL). Antibody titres were higher in previously infected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the concept that a single dose of BNT162b2 would be sufficient in previously infected individuals.","Favresse, Julien; Bayart, Jean-Louis; Mullier, François; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Closset, Mélanie; Douxfils, Jonathan",Clin. microbiol. infect,,63

The analyses were carried out in three sub-groups of students: who self-reported having a formal diagnosis of dyslexia (CDYS), self-reported reading difficulties, but had no formal diagnosis of dyslexia (SIDYS), and who reported no reading difficulties (CON). The results of the survey revealed that compared with the CON group, more students from CDYS and SIDYS groups did not pass at least one exam in the summer semester. CDYS and SIDYS groups experienced higher stress due to epidemiological restrictions, they had more difficulties than CON with the organisation of learning and obtaining credit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate a need for special consideration of additional support for students experiencing reading difficulties (whether or not they have a formal diagnosis).","Zawadka, Joanna; Miekisz, Aneta; Nowakowska, Iwona; Plewko, Joanna; Kochanska, Magdalena; Haman, Ewa",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,63

Due to dozens of large outbreaks in correctional facilities, tens of thousands of seriously ill incarcerated people are receiving medical care in the community hospital setting. Yet community clinicians often have little knowledge of the basic rights and ethical principles governing care of seriously ill incarcerated patients. Such patients are legally entitled to make their own medical decisions just like non-incarcerated patients, and retain rights to appoint surrogate decision makers and make advance care plans. Wardens, correctional officers, and prison health care professionals should not make medical decisions for incarcerated patients and should not be asked to do so. Dying incarcerated patients should be offered goodbye visits with their loved ones, and patients from federal prisons are legally entitled to them. Community health care professionals may need to advocate for this medically vulnerable hospitalized patient population to receive ethically appropriate, humane care when under their care in community hospitals. If ethical care is being obstructed, community health care professionals should contact the prison's warden and medical director to explain their concerns and ask questions. If necessary, community clinicians should involve a hospital's ethics committee, leadership, and legal counsel.

325501,Remediation of organophosphorus pesticide polluted soil using persulfate oxidation activated by microwave,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Endovascular variable aortic control (EVAC) is an automated partial resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) platform designed to mitigate the deleterious effects of complete REBOA. Long-term experiments are needed to assess potential benefits. The feasibility of a 24-hour experiment in a complex large animal trauma model remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthetized swine were subjected to controlled hemorrhage, blunt thoracic trauma, and tibial fractures. Animals were then randomized (N = 3/group) to control (No balloon support), 90 minutes of complete supraceliac REBOA, or 10 minutes of supraceliac REBOA followed by 80 minutes of EVAC. One hundred ten minutes after injury, animals were resuscitated with shed blood, the REBOA catheter was removed. Automated critical care under general anesthesia was maintained for 24 hours. RESULTS: Animals in the control and EVAC groups survived to the end of the experiment. Animals in the REBOA group survived for 120, 130, and 660 minutes, respectively. Animals in the EVAC group displayed similar mean arterial pressure and plasma lactate concentration as the control group by the end of the experiment. Histologic analysis suggested myocardial injury in the REBOA group when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of intermediate-term experiments in a complex swine model of polytrauma with 90 minutes of REBOA. EVAC may be associated with improved survival at 24 hours when compared with complete REBOA. EVAC resulted in normalized physiology after 24 hours, suggesting that prolonged partial occlusion is possible. Longer studies evaluating partial REBOA strategies are needed.","Hoareau, Guillaume L; Beyer, Carl A; Caples, Connor A; Spruce, Marguerite W; Kevin Grayson, J; Neff, Lucas P; Williams, Timothy K; Johnson, M Austin",Mil. med,,63

One hundred and fifty nine children were recruited. Exploratory variables were malnutrition and enamel defects. The outcome variables were the prevalence of ECC in 0-2-year-old, 3-5-year-old, and 0-5-year-old children. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the associations, and socioeconomic status, oral hygiene status, and frequency of in-between-meals sugar consumption were adjusted for. The adjusted prevalence ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values were calculated. RESULTS: The prevalence of ECC was 2.1% in 0-2-year-old children and 4.9% in 3-5-year-old children. In adjusted models, underweight, stunting, and wasting/overweight were not significant risk indicators for ECC in either age group. 0-2-year-old children who had amelogenesis imperfecta (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. 3-5-year-old children who had hypoplasia (p = 0.004), amelogenesis imperfecta (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. 0-5-year-old children with hypoplasia (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. There were significant associations between various types of malnutrition and various types of enamel defects. CONCLUSION: Although different types of malnutrition were associated with enamel defects, and enamel defects were associated with ECC, malnutrition was not associated with ECC. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between malnutrition and genetically and toxin-induced enamel defects.","Folayan, Morenike Oluwatoyin; El Tantawi, Maha; Oginni, Ayodeji Babatunde; Alade, Michael; Adeniyi, Abiola; Finlayson, Tracy L",PLoS One,,63

Our findings suggest that a natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to that observed previously for rhinovirus (RV) infections,9 does not induce a protective antibody response inhibiting the virus-receptor interaction in all infected patients and therefore underline the urgent need for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The molecular interaction assays could be useful for identifying subjects having developed protective antibodies and for screening candidate vaccines to induce antibodies that inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction once they have been validated.","Gattinger, P.; Borochova, K.; Dorofeeva, Y.; Henning, R.; Kiss, R.; Kratzer, B.; Muhl, B.; Perkmann, T.; Trapin, D.; Trella, M.; Ettel, P.; Tulaeva, I.; Pickl, W.

326782,High-Pressure Polymeric Nitrogen Allotrope with the Black Phosphorus Structure,2020,"Background: The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a health threat worldwide and has been declared global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Possible transmission routes, including respiratory droplets, close contact, and aerosol propagation, have put plastic and reconstructive healthcare professionals at high risk, especially during surgical procedures. The aim of this study was to summarize and share our experience of infection control measures and corresponding outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Infection control measures, including workflow optimization, useful epidemiologic survey methods, and personal full protective clothing, were discussed. Characteristics and outcomes of emergency cases and elective cases under local and general anesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic were summarized. Results: A hierarchy of interventions were applied mainly from 4 aspects. First, administration control and online consultation significantly decreased patient attendance. Second, a triage workflow was established to identify high-/low-risk patients, with clinical manifestations (fever, fatigue, cough, nasal discharge, etc), epidemiologic survey, blood test, chest computed tomographic scan, and coronavirus test if necessary. Third, strict environmental control was adopted using increasing ventilation, isolated room for inpatients, etc. Fourth, proper rotation of healthcare staff was ensured to reduce workload and minimize possible contact. A total of 904 emergency interventions, 2561 local anesthesia, and 570 general anesthesia were performed during this period, and none of the cases/healthcare professionals were found to be infected. Conclusions: Our experience could help global plastic and reconstructive healthcare professionals to get better preparation and continue to give qualified medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proper adjustments should be taken according to their own clinical settings.","Wang, Zhichao; Wang, Wei; Bai, Ting; Di, Meihua; Zan, Tao; Gu, Bin; Li, Shengli; Li, Qingfeng","Plast. Reconstr.

328026,Crowdsourcing virtual summer research opportunities to support minorities in microbiology,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the first week of March, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak reached more than 100 countries with over 100,000 cases. Health care authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities worldwide. A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%). Most participants (n=276, 61.0%) used social media to obtain information on COVID-19. A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs worldwide, and further studies are warranted.","Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth; Aldhaleei, Wafa Ali; Rahmani, Jamal; Mahabadi, Mohammadjavad Ashrafi; Bandari, Deepak Kumar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,63

The article is devoted to the current issue of the augmented reality technology use in professional education. The paper analyzes foreign and domestic experience of the use of augmented reality technologies as a means educational, research and project activities implementation. The author also describes the benefits of the augmented reality technologies use for the curricula design. Taking into account the reorganization of the educational process due to pandemic isolation, caused by COVID-19, the issue of the identification of AR technologies impact on the development of cognitive component of future specialists’ mental capacity is becoming extremely relevant especially in the conditions of adaptive and blended learning. The paper, in a structured way, describes the experience of introducing the augmented reality elements in the process of developing cognitive component of future professionals’ mental capacity. The ascertaining and formative stages of the empirical research were carried out during 2020 on the basis of Bogdan Khmelnytsky Melitopol State Pedagogical University. Relevant interdisciplinary research is a logical construct of cooperation between leading scientists of the Department of Psychology and the Department of Informatics and Cybernetics of Bogdan Khmelnytsky Melitopol State Pedagogical University. The structure of the study includes the main scientific developments in the context of the research work, performed at the expense of the General Fund of the state budget: “Adaptive system for individualization and personalization of professional training of future specialists in blended learning”. Based on certain psychological and pedagogical determinants of the AR technologies use for the development of cognitive component of the future specialists’ mental capacity, we have proposed the implementation of interactive technologies at three levels: competence-oriented, structural-cognitive, emotional-reflexive, on the example of doing the course “Introduction to Specialty (Psychology)” in the conditions of distance learning. According to the results of an interdisciplinary research, it was found out that students gained skills which are necessary for their adaptation to a new intellectual and educational environment. Due to positive qualitative and quantitative changes in the cognitive structure of personality there was an increase in the first-year students’ mental capacity in its main components (the level of attention stability and selectivity, short-term memory span and analytical thinking, level of development of special qualities necessary for mental capacity, formation of mental capacity culture).","Osadchyi, V.

These subjects develop local and systemic hyper-inflammation, which are associated with thrombotic complications and multi-organ failure. Therefore, understanding SARS-CoV-2 induced hyper-inflammation in elderly men is a pressing need. Here we focus on the role of extracellular DNA, mainly mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and telomeric DNA (telDNA) in the modulation of systemic inflammation in these subjects. In particular, extracellular mtDNA is regarded as a powerful trigger of the inflammatory response. On the contrary, extracellular telDNA pool is estimated to be capable of inhibiting a variety of inflammatory pathways. In turn, we underpin that telDNA reservoir is progressively depleted during aging, and that it is scarcer in men than in women. We propose that an increase in extracellular mtDNA, concomitant with the reduction of the anti-inflammatory telDNA reservoir may explain hyper-inflammation in elderly male affected by COVID-19. This scenario is reminiscent of inflamm-aging, the portmanteau word that depicts how aging and aging related diseases are intimately linked to inflammation.","Storci, Gianluca; Bonifazi, Francesca; Garagnani, Paolo; Olivieri, Fabiola; Bonafè, Massimiliano",Ageing Res Rev,,63

The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention 14 days after implementation. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, segmented regression analysis. INTERVENTION: A series of outbreak measures classified into 4 categories: case and contact management, proactive case detection, rigorous infection control practices and resource prioritization and stewardship. METHODS: A mixed-effects segmented Poisson regression model was fitted to the incidence rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), calculated every 2 days, within each facility and case type (staff vs residents). For each facility, the outbreak time period was segmented into an early outbreak period (within 14 days of the intervention) and postintervention period (beyond 14 days following the intervention). Model outputs quantified COVID-19 incidence trend and rate changes between these 2 periods. A secondary model was constructed to identify effect modification by case type. RESULTS: The significant upward trend in COVID-19 incidence rate during the early outbreak period (rate ratio [RR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.11; P < .001) reversed during the postintervention period (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.80; P < .001). The average trend did not differ by case type during the early outbreak period (P > .05) or the postintervention period (P > .05). However, staff had a 70% larger decrease in the average rate of COVID-19 during the postintervention period than residents (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.88; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in LTCFs. This intervention can be adapted and utilized by other jurisdictions to protect the vulnerable individuals in LTCFs.","Vijh, Rohit; Prairie, Jessica; Otterstatter, Michael C; Hu, Yumian; Hayden, Althea S; Yau, Brandon; Daly, Patricia; Lysyshyn, Mark; McKee, Geoff; Harding, John; Forsting, Sara; Schwandt, Michael",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,63

345284,The development of a vaccine - a highly regulated process,2021,"The interaction between epidemic spreading and information diffusion is an interdisciplinary research problem. During an epidemic, people tend to take self-protective measures to reduce the infection risk. However, with the diffusion of rumor, people may be difficult to make an appropriate choice. How to reduce the negative impact of rumor and to control epidemic has become a critical issue in the social network. Elaborate mathematical model is instructive to understand such complex dynamics. In this paper, we develop a two-layer network to model the interaction between the spread of epidemic and the competitive diffusions of information. The results show that knowledge diffusion can eradicate both rumor and epidemic, where the penetration intensity of knowledge into rumor plays a vital role. Specifically, the penetration intensity of knowledge significantly increases the thresholds for rumor and epidemic to break out, even when the self-protective measure is not perfectly effective. But eradicating rumor shouldn't be equated with eradicating epidemic. The epidemic can be eradicated with rumor still diffusing, and the epidemic may keep spreading with rumor being eradicated. Moreover, the communication-layer network structure greatly affects the spread of epidemic in the contact-layer network. When people have more connections in the communication-layer network, the knowledge is more likely to diffuse widely, and the rumor and epidemic can be eradicated more efficiently. When the communication-layer network is sparse, a larger penetration intensity of knowledge into rumor is required to promote the diffusion of knowledge.","Huang, He; Chen, Yahong; Ma, Yefeng",Appl.

Many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, affect disease severity and can be used to aid this prediction. OBJECTIVE: Because rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we aimed to investigate how data from the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 can be used to predict clinical outcomes. METHODS: We investigated clinical data sets of patients with COVID-19 with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and deep learning methods. RESULTS: Our work revealed that several clinical parameters that are measurable in blood samples are factors that can discriminate between healthy people and COVID-19-positive patients, and we showed the value of these parameters in predicting later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We developed a number of analytical methods that showed accuracy and precision scores >90% for disease severity prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We developed methodologies to analyze routine patient clinical data that enable more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. With this approach, data from standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood could be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of mortality, thus enabling optimization of hospital facilities for COVID-19 treatment.","Aktar, Sakifa; Ahamad, Md Martuza; Rashed-Al-Mahfuz, Md; Azad, Akm; Uddin, Shahadat; Kamal, Ahm; Alyami, Salem A; Lin, Ping-I; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Quinn, Julian Mw; Eapen, Valsamma; Moni, Mohammad Ali",JMIR Med Inform,,63

Because of its debilitating impact on the quality of life of patients, recent research aims to investigate the mechanisms behind nociception to discover novel therapeutic agents to alleviate pain. One such target is the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which has shown to play an integral role in migraine pathophysiology. Effective treatments of migraines with CGRP antagonists have stimulated our efforts toward checking a possible involvement of CGRP in nonheadache pain conditions such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular ischemia. Here, we provide a brief overview of chronic pain, with a particular emphasis on the role of CGRP as a fundamental mediator of nociceptive pain as well as a target for novel therapeutic agents.","Urits, Ivan; Li, Nathan; Bahrun, Ehab; Hakobyan, Hayk; Anantuni, Lekha; An, Daniel; Berger, Amon A; Kaye, Alan D; Paladini, Antonella; Varrassi, Giustino; Vorenkamp, Kevin E; Viswanath, Omar",Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol,,63

By focusing directly on masculinity as a social process, this analysis contributes to the broader literature on gender and leadership, unpacking the gendered double bind that leaders who identify as men must navigate in acknowledging and responding to risks. I examine the responses of Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump suggesting that their respective struggles to acknowledge and respond to the public health threat were not simply the result of a lack of available information to inform rational policy decisions. Acknowledging risk and taking measures to prevent rather than 'fight' are not culturally neutral, they are coded as feminine and 'weak'. Clearly, the delay in the response and subsequent spread of the virus in North America was not inevitable, other jurisdictions were able to respond more quickly. The masculinity double bind may have been one of the factors that undermined a prompt response in the increasingly macho context of North America.","Thomson, Kelly",Health Sociol Rev,,63
357630,"A new species of Tetragonopterus (Characiformes: Characidae) from Central Amazon lowlands, Brazil",2018,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has resulted in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Worldwide this disease has infected over 2.5 million individuals with a mortality rate ranging from 5 to 10%. There are several efforts going on in the drug discovery to control the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The main protease (MPro) plays a critical role in viral replication and maturation, thus can serve as the primary drug target. To understand the structural evolution of MPro, we have performed phylogenetic and Sequence Similarity Network analysis, that depicted divergence of Coronaviridae MPro in five clusters specific to viral hosts. This clustering was corroborated with the comparison of MPro structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that backbone and binding site conformations are conserved despite variation in some of the residues. These attributes can be exploited to repurpose available viral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 MPro. In agreement with this, we performed screening of â¼7100 molecules including active ingredients present in the Ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 MPro as the primary target. We identified several natural molecules like Î´-viniferin, myricitrin, taiwanhomoflavone A, lactucopicrin 15-oxalate, nympholide A, afzelin, biorobin, hesperidin and phyllaemblicin B that strongly binds to SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Intrestingly, these molecules also showed strong binding with other potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection like viral receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We anticipate that our approach for identification of multi-target-directed ligand will provide new avenues for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

358640,Nanomedicine for the poor: a lost cause or an idea whose time has yet to come?,2021,"Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) is a transcription factor (TF) that mediates protection from adverse effects of hypertonicity by increasing transcription of genes, including those that lead to cellular accumulation of protective organic osmolytes. NFAT5 has three intrinsically ordered (ID) activation domains (ADs). Using the NFAT5 N-terminal domain (NTD), which contains AD1, as a model, we demonstrate by biophysical methods that the NTD senses osmolytes and hypertonicity, resulting in stabilization of its ID regions. In the presence of sufficient NaCl or osmolytes, trehalose and sorbitol, the NFAT5 NTD undergoes a disorder-to-order shift, adopting higher average secondary and tertiary structure. Thus, NFAT5 is activated by the stress that it protects against. In its salt and/or osmolyte-induced more ordered conformation, the NTD interacts with several proteins, including HMGI-C, which is known to protect against apoptosis. These findings raise the possibility that the increased intracellular ionic strength and elevated osmolytes caused by hypertonicity activate and stabilize NFAT5.","Kumar, Raj; DuMond, Jenna F; Khan, Shagufta H; Thompson, E Brad; He, Yi; Burg, Maurice B; Ferraris, Joan D",Proc.

358971,Illustrating quantum information with quantum candies,2021-09-30,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus over and above that contributed by stress hyperglycemia. Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""diabetes"", ""diabetes mellitus"", ""SARS"", ""infection"" and ""management of diabetes mellitus"" with interposition of the Boolean operator ""AND"". RESULTS: Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct ß-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.","Pal, Rimesh; Bhadada, Sanjay K",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,63

OBJECTIVE: This work has attempted to examine the perception-based influence factors of individuals' intention to adopt COVID-19 epidemic prevention in a modified behavioral framework. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: A behavioral framework composed of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior is developed to incorporate some additional perception-based influence factors. METHODS: A partial least square-based path analysis has been employed to estimate the path coefficients of those factors in terms of drivers, barriers, and neutral factors based on questionnaire data of 302 respondents from six universities and two hospitals in China. RESULTS: Among the perception-based influence factors, governments' guidelines on epidemic prevention is found to be the most important and influential factor, which was followed by risk perception. Finally, attitude towards epidemic prevention exhibited the least degree of impact on individuals' intention to adopt epidemic prevention. Moral norms did not show any contribution to individuals' intention to adopt epidemic prevention. CONCLUSION: Concerning importance ranking, the governments' guidelines on epidemic prevention, risk perception, and epidemic knowledge are revealed as the top three drivers of individuals' intention to adopt epidemic prevention, while the perceived feasibility to adopt epidemic prevention is found to be a barrier. Moreover, moral norms is identified to have an insignificant influence on individuals' intention to adopt epidemic prevention. Given the empirical results, dissemination of Governments' guidelines on epidemic prevention, proper risk perception, and knowledge about epidemic would help prevent the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak within China and worldwide.","Ahmad, Munir; Iram, Khadeeja; Jabeen, Gul",Environ Res,,63

SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells via the binding of its S protein to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). The use of ACEIs/ARBs (RAAS inhibitors) regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and may increase ACE2 expression. Considering the large use of ACEIs/ARBs in hypertensive patients, some professional groups are concerned about whether the use of RAAS inhibitors affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or the risk of severe illness and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we summarize preclinical and clinical studies to investigate whether the use of ACEIs/ARBs increases ACE2 expression in animals or patients. We also analyzed whether the use of these drugs affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe illness or mortality based on recent studies. Finally, the review suggests that current evidence does not support the concerns.","Zhang, Jishou; Wang, Menglong; Ding, Wen; Wan, Jun",Life Sci,,63

This preliminary study evaluated some claims about COVID-19 including vaccine conspiracy theories among Nigerians with factors influencing it. An online structured questionnaire was designed to collect one-time data from voluntary participants. Demographically, major respondents were;bachelor: 284 (75.1%), age-group between 18 and 30 years: 312 (82.5%) and male: 207 (54.8%). Those that do not know the range of infected population in the country accounted for 260 (72.2%). In opinion, 57 (15.1%) supported that SARS-COV-2 cannot survive the warm climate of African continent, and 41 (10.8%) believed the hoax theory about COVID-19. Unapproved herbal medication was reported to be used by 251 (66.4%) of the respondents while 92 (24.3%) made use of Chloroquine. For transmission related conceptions, 52 (13.8%) indicated that an asymptomatic carrier cannot spread the virus to another healthy individual. About half of the respondents 182 (48.1%) suspected that SARS-COV-2 was an engineered virus and 173 (45.8%) supported that there are underlying negative intentions on the clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccines on Africans. There is a weak correlation between the demographic data of the respondents and the claims. The level of misconception Nigerians have about COVID-19 is a major concern. Thus, it is imperative to continuously engage in community awareness and education using proven facts about the virus, and its available prophylaxis measures in order to avoid the dangers that are associated with the prevailing misconceptions","Kayode, Adeyemi",International Journal of Modern Anthropology,,63

A total of 23 SOT transplant recipients suffering from COVID-19 were identified (n = 3 heart; n = 15 kidney; n = 1 kidney-after-heart; n = 3 lung, and n = 1 liver transplant recipient). The presenting symptoms were similar to nonimmunocompromised patients. Eighty-three percent (19/23) of the patients required hospitalization, but only two of these were transferred to the intensive care unit. Five patients died from COVID-19; all had high Clinical Frailty Scores. In four of these patients, mechanical ventilation was deemed futile. In 57% of patients, the immunosuppressive therapy was not changed and only three patients were treated with chloroquine. Most patients recovered without experimental antiviral therapy.

A pandemic crisis like the Covid-19 outbreak is a complex event, involving numerous aspects of the social life on multiple temporal scales. Focusing on the Spanish Twittersphere, we characterized users activity behaviour across the different phases of the Covid-19 first wave. Firstly, we analyzed a sample of timelines of different classes of users from the Spanish Twittersphere in terms of their propensity to produce new information or to amplify information produced by others. Secondly, by performing stepwise segmented regression analysis and Bayesian switchpoint analysis, we looked for a possible behavioral footprint of the crisis in the statistics of users' activity. We observed that generic Spanish Twitter users and journalists experienced an abrupt increment of their tweeting activity between March 9 and March 14, in coincidence with control measures being announced by regional and State level authorities. However, they displayed a stable proportion of retweets before and after the switching point. On the contrary, politicians represented an exception, being the only class of users not experimenting this abrupt change and following a completely endogenous dynamics determined by institutional agenda. On the one hand, they did not increment their overall activity, displaying instead a slight decrease. On the other hand, in times of crisis, politicians tended to strengthen their propensity to amplify information rather than produce it.","Esquirol, Bernat; Prignano, Luce; D'iaz-Guilera, Albert; Cozzo, Emanuele",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06550v2.pdf,63

Emotional distress included depression and anxiety symptoms. COVID-19 stressors included current and expected income, housing, healthcare, and food insecurities. RESULTS: Older persons of color reported higher rates of stressors and emotional distress than their White counterparts. In relation to current stressors, older Black persons responded with less emotional distress and older Latino persons responded with more emotional distress than older White persons. In addition, older persons of color were more likely to expect future resource losses related to COVID-19, and the association between these expectations and emotional distress varied by race-ethnic group.

In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether those trained through these programmes were involved in the COVID-19 response and if so, in which area(s) of the emergency response they were applying their skills. Methods: From the records for each training programme, we identified the individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999-2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015-2020 for PGTS, and 2009-2019 for SORT-IT. Between March and April 2020, we sent trainees an online questionnaire by e-mail. Results: Out of 1254 trained, 1143 could be contacted and 699 responded to the survey. Of the latter, 411 were involved with the COVID-19 response, of whom 315 (77%) were applying their acquired skills in 85 countries. With some overlap between programmes, 84% of those trained through CRDF were applying their skills in 27 countries, 91% of those trained through PGTS were applying their skills in 19 countries, and through SORT IT, this was 73% in 62 countries. Skills were being applied in various areas of the emergency response, including: emergency preparedness, situation analysis/surveillance, infection control and clinical management, data generation, mitigating the effect of COVID on the health system, and research. Depending on the type of training programme, 26-74% were involved in implementation, operational or clinical research. Conclusion: Research training programmes build research capacity and equip health workers with transferable core competencies and skillsets prior to epidemics. This becomes invaluable in building health system resilience at a time of pandemics.","Zachariah, Rony; Maher, Dermot; Aseffa, Abraham; Vahedi, Mahnaz; Launois, Pascal; Khogali, Mohammed; Aslanyan, Garry; Reeder, John C",F1000Res,,63

We aimed to investigate whether physical activity, and the timing and balance of physical activity and sleep/rest, were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity. Data from 91,248 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data and complete covariate and linked COVID-19 data to July 19, 2020, were included. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity-in relation to overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), balance between activity and sleep/rest, and variability in timing of sleep/rest-was assessed with adjusted logistic regression. Of 207 individuals with a positive test result, 124 were classified as having a severe infection. Overall physical activity and MVPA were not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas a poor balance between activity and sleep/rest was (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.81]). This finding was related to higher daytime activity being associated with lower risk (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93) but higher movement during sleep/rest being associated with higher risk (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.42) of severe infection. Greater variability in timing of sleep/rest was also associated with increased risk (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.35). Results for testing positive were broadly consistent. In conclusion, these results highlight the importance of not just physical activity, but also quality sleep/rest and regular sleep/rest patterns, on risk of COVID-19. Our findings indicate the risk of COVID-19 was consistently approximately 1.2-fold greater per approximately 40-minute increase in variability in timing of proxy measures of sleep, indicative of irregular sleeping patterns.","Rowlands, Alex V; Kloecker, David E; Chudasama, Yogini; Davies, Melanie J; Dawkins, Nathan P; Edwardson, Charlotte L; Gillies, Clare; Khunti, Kamlesh; Razieh, Cameron; Islam, Nazrul; Zaccardi, Francesco; Yates, Tom",Mayo Clin Proc,,63

388200,ACNP 59th Annual Meeting: Poster Session I,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to COVID-19, the course of which is highly variable and depends on numerous patient-specific risk factors. Patients with tumor diseases are considered to be more susceptible to severe COVID-19; however, they also represent a heterogeneous group of individuals with variable risk. Identifying specific risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 in patients with cancer is of great importance. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with solid tumors or hematological malignancies and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included into the multicentric ADHOK (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Hämatologen und Onkologen im Krankenhaus e.V.) coronavirus tumor registry. Detailed information about the patients' cancer disease, treatment, and laboratory parameters prior to infection, was collected retrospectively. The outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was graded according to the WHO. RESULTS: A total of 195 patients (68% with solid neoplasms and 32% with hematological malignancies) were included in the registry. Overall, the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection varied greatly, as 69% of all patients were either asymptomatic or encountered a mild to moderate course, while 23% of the cohort died from COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, preinfection laboratory parameters (determined at least 10 days and a median of 21 days before the first documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection) significantly correlated with severe course of the disease. Out of these, the absolute neutrophil count prior to infection showed the strongest association with COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSION: The course of COVID-19 in patients with tumor diseases is highly variable. Preinfection laboratory parameters may aid to identify patients at risk for severe COVID-19 at an early stage prior to infection with the virus.

390038,Delegation im Krisenfall,2020,"Purpose: The present study investigated the correlation between the nutritional status and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different nutritional status. Methods: 429 patients who were diagnosed positive for COVTD-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from December 2019 to March 2020 were selected and divided into different groups based on Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score (0–4: the low CONUT score group; 5–12: the high CONUT score group). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate the effects of CONUT score on prognosis. Results: The total score of admission status of patients with higher CONUT score was higher than that of those with lower CONUT score (χ2= 7.152, P = 0.007). The number of adverse outcomes of female was higher than that of male (χ2= 10.253, P = 0.001). The number of adverse outcomes was higher for patients with smoking history (P = 0.004) or hypertension (χ2= 11.240, P = 0.001) than those without. Also, the number of adverse outcomes was higher for older patients than younger ones (χ2= 15.681, P &lt; 0.001). Patients with adverse outcomes had lower urine red blood cell count than patients without adverse outcomes (χ2= 5.029, P = 0.025). However, BMI, drinking history and diabetes did not show correlation with the prognosis of COVID-19 (P &gt; 0.05). Among patients ≥ 61 years old, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 6.191 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 6.191, 95% CI: 1.431–26.785). Among the non-diabetic patients, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT group was 11.678 times that of the low CONUT group (OR = 11.678, 95% CI: 2.754–49.41). For the patients who had a total score of admission status &lt; 6, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 8.216 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 8.216, 95% CI: 2.439–27.682). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with good nutritional status showed a small chance to have adverse outcomes. Gender, age, hypertension, the number of urine red blood cell count and CONUT score affected the adverse outcomes of patients.","Zhou, J.; Ma, Yi; Liu, Y.; Xiang, Y.; Tao, C.; Yu, H.; Huang, J.",J.

390142,Inebilizumab: First Approval,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). Face shields are an important component of PPE for front-line workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing protection of the face from splashes and sprays of virus-containing fluids. Existing face shield designs and manufacturing procedures may not allow for production and distribution of face shields in sufficient volume to meet global demand, particularly in Low and Middle-Income countries. This paper presents a simple, fast, and cost-effective curved-crease origami technique for transforming flat sheets of flexible plastic material into face shields for infection control. It is further shown that the design could be produced using a variety of manufacturing methods, ranging from manual techniques to high-volume die-cutting and creasing. This demonstrates the potential for the design to be applied in a variety of contexts depending on available materials, manufacturing capabilities and labour. An easily implemented and flexible physical-digital parametric design methodology for rapidly exploring and refining variations on the design is presented, potentially allowing others to adapt the design to accommodate a wide range of ergonomic and protection requirements.","Bukauskas, Aurimas; Koronaki, Antiopi; Lee, Ting-Uei; Ott, Daniel; Al Asali, M Wesam; Jalia, Aftab; Bashford, Tom; Gatóo, Ana; Newman, Josh; Gattas, Joseph M; Shah, Darshil U; Ramage, Michael",PLoS One,,63

396833,Assessing the Needs of the Quantum Industry,2021-08-25,"BACKGROUND: North West Wales is predominantly rural with a relatively small population spread over a large geographical area. The rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a radical re-thinking of how to provide continuing paediatric outpatient care in the face of a lockdown. The solution adopted was to use telephone consultations. AIMS: This study took place during the summer of 2020, after the first lockdown had been relaxed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of telephone consultations as an alternative to conventional paediatric outpatient appointments and assess whether it could continue to have a useful role beyond the pandemic. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-five telephone surveys were conducted with respondents, most of whom were carers of paediatric outpatients. Questions explored the child's underlying condition, respondents' attitudes towards the service received, social factors including distance previously travelled to the hospital and whether they would find ongoing telephone review acceptable or not. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of respondents expressed a positive interest in ongoing telephone consultations. They commented particularly on compatibility with work commitments, childcare arrangements and travel times. Those travelling more than 1 h were particularly positive in their support. Respondents expressed the continued need for face-to-face review if the child's condition changed acutely. CONCLUSION: Telephone consultations are an acceptable means of improving clinic punctuality, accessibility and convenience for families in rural areas, with ongoing potential beyond the pandemic. Careful consideration is required of the individual's needs and requirement for physical examination when extending the use of telephone consultations.","Edwards, Lowri M; Parry, Mair",Ir. j. med. sci,,63
397922,Microbes modify plant root permeability,2021,"Background: About 5% of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients will need intensive care unit (ICU) admission for hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring oxygen support. The choice between early mechanical ventilation and noninvasive oxygen therapies, such as, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and/or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has to balance the contradictory priorities of protecting healthcare workers by minimizing aerosol-generation and optimizing resource management. This survey over two timeframes aimed to explore the controversial issue of location and noninvasive oxygen therapy in non-intubated ICU patients using a clinical vignette. Materials and methods: An online survey was designed, piloted, and distributed electronically to Indian intensivists/anesthetists, from private hospitals, government hospitals, and medical college hospitals (the latter two referred to as first-responder hospitals), who are directly responsible for admitting/managing patients in ICU. Results: Of the 204 responses (125/481 in phase 1 and 79/320 in phase 2), 183 responses were included. Respondents from first-responder hospitals were more willing to manage non-intubated hypoxemic patients in neutral pressure rooms, while respondents from private hospitals preferred negative-pressure rooms (p < 0.001). In both the phases, private hospital doctors were less comfortable to use any form of noninvasive oxygen therapies in neutral-pressure rooms compared to first-responder hospitals (low-flow oxygen therapy: 72 vs 50%, p < 0.01; HFNO: 47 vs 24%, p < 0.01 and NPPV: 38 vs 28%, p = 0.20). Interpretation: Variations existed in practices among first-responder and private intensivists/anesthetists. The resource optimal private hospital intensivists/anesthetists were less comfortable using noninvasive oxygen therapies in managing COVID-19 patients. This may reflect differential resource availability necessitating resolution at national, state, and local levels. How to cite this article: Subramaniam A, Haji JY, Kumar P, Ramanathan K, Rajamani A.

407660,Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction for Co-evolutionary models,2021-08-09,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in China in late 2019 and is caused by newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Previous studies had reported the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture media and deposited onto surfaces under a limited set of environmental conditions. Here, we broadly investigated the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and droplet size on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in a simulated clinically relevant matrix dried on nonporous surfaces. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 decayed more rapidly when either humidity or temperature was increased but that droplet volume (1 to 50 µl) and surface type (stainless steel, plastic, or nitrile glove) did not significantly impact decay rate. At room temperature (24°C), virus half-life ranged from 6.3 to 18.6 h depending on the relative humidity but was reduced to 1.0 to 8.9 h when the temperature was increased to 35°C. These findings suggest that a potential for fomite transmission may persist for hours to days in indoor environments and have implications for assessment of the risk posed by surface contamination in indoor environments.IMPORTANCE Mitigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings and public spaces is critically important to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases while effective vaccines and therapeutics are under development. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is thought to primarily occur through direct person-to-person transfer of infectious respiratory droplets or through aerosol-generating medical procedures. However, contact with contaminated surfaces may also play a significant role. In this context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies. To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify indoor environments in which the virus is most persistent.","Biryukov, Jennifer; Boydston, Jeremy A; Dunning, Rebecca A; Yeager, John J; Wood, Stewart; Reese, Amy L; Ferris, Allison; Miller, David; Weaver, Wade; Zeitouni, Nathalie E; Phillips, Aaron; Freeburger, Denise; Hooper, Idris; Ratnesar-Shumate, Shanna; Yolitz, Jason; Krause, Melissa; Williams, Gregory; Dawson, David G; Herzog, Artemas; Dabisch, Paul; Wahl, Victoria; Hevey, Michael C; Altamura, Louis A",MSphere,,63

Tele otology is very fruitful methodology in providing health care facility from distant site to the doorsteps of needy individuals. The action initiated in the field of tele otology in India was reviewed at electronic databases: Pubmed, Google scholar, Medline, Cochrane library, science direct and author mapper using the keywords 'tele otology' and 'tele audiometry' in January 2021. Eligible studies were those related to tele otology and tele audiometry in India. A total of 16 articles were shortlisted for the present study. Tele hearing testing was satisfactory for the parents in regard to accessibility, testing process and counselling. Tele audiometry surveillance shows better overall follow-up compliance rate then in-person audiological surveillance. During covid 19 pandemic virtual approach to the patient through video calling and telephone calls proved handy approach, ensuring safety profile of both health care professionals and patients. Even Tele ABR conducted in tele van shows similar results as in face-to-face mode ABR. Tele otology should be considered by the service providers and policy makers while planning for hearing screening programmes for both new-born and school going children in view of its reliability, low-cost, non-invasive and portability. The village health workers (VHWs) should be well trained in assisting tele practice and internet connectivity should be well established.

Together with previous work that described a pathway conveying visual information from the medulla to the ventral accessory calyx of the mushroom body, our study defines a second, parallel pathway that is anatomically poised to convey information from the visual system to the dorsal accessory calyx.","Li, Jinzhi; Mahoney, Brennan Dale; Jacob, Miles Solomon; Caron, Sophie Jeanne Cécile",Cell Rep,,63

410098,Preventing airborne infection,2020,"Advanced data encryption requires the use of true random number generators (TRNGs) to produce unpredictable sequences of bits. TRNG circuits with high degree of randomness and low power consumption may be fabricated by using the random telegraph noise (RTN) current signals produced by polarized metal/insulator/metal (MIM) devices as entropy source. However, the RTN signals produced by MIM devices made of traditional insulators, i.e., transition metal oxides like HfO2 and Al2 O3 , are not stable enough due to the formation and lateral expansion of defect clusters, resulting in undesired current fluctuations and the disappearance of the RTN effect. Here, the fabrication of highly stable TRNG circuits with low power consumption, high degree of randomness (even for a long string of 224 - 1 bits), and high throughput of 1 Mbit s-1 by using MIM devices made of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is shown. Their application is also demonstrated to produce one-time passwords, which is ideal for the internet-of-everything. The superior stability of the h-BN-based TRNG is related to the presence of few-atoms-wide defects embedded within the layered and crystalline structure of the h-BN stack, which produces a confinement effect that avoids their lateral expansion and results in stable operation.","Wen, Chao; Li, Xuehua; Zanotti, Tommaso; Puglisi, Francesco Maria; Shi, Yuanyuan; Saiz, Fernan; Antidormi, Aleandro; Roche, Stephan; Zheng, Wenwen; Liang, Xianhu; Hu, Jiaxin; Duhm, Steffen; Roldan, Juan B; Wu, Tianru; Chen, Victoria; Pop, Eric; Garrido, Blas; Zhu, Kaichen; Hui, Fei; Lanza, Mario",Adv Mater,,63
410910,Safepaths: Vaccine Diary Protocol and Decentralized Vaccine Coordination System using a Privacy Preserving User Centric Experience,2021-03-01,"There has been a surge in ""quarantine15"" social media posts during the self-isolation and lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. Given the influence of other body and weight-centered social media content (e.g., Fitspiration, Fatspiration) on body image and weight stigmatizing thoughts and attitudes, characterizing the features of quarantine15 content is an imperative first step towards understanding its impact on those who view it. Therefore, the present study is a content analysis of quarantine15 content on Instagram. A total of 668 posts were sampled using the hashtag quarantine15, and systematically analyzed for features related to positive and negative body image, as well as weight stigma. The results showed that the posts containing human figures (57.5 %) showcased individuals who were perceived as lower-weight (88.8 %), White (70.3 %), and women (87 %). Approximately one-third (34.4 %) of the images containing individuals were considered objectifying. Posts also perpetuated the controllability of weight through diet (51.5 %) and physical activity (27.5 %), while 46.9 % expressed dislike towards higher-weight bodies. Future experimental research in this area will be important for understanding both the acute and long-term effects of viewing quarantine15 content on body image, weight stigmatizing attitudes and thoughts, and internalized weight stigma.","Lucibello, Kristen M; Vani, Madison F; Koulanova, Alyona; deJonge, Melissa L; Ashdown-Franks, Garcia; Sabiston, Catherine M",Body Image,,63

In response, aggressive efforts are underway around the world to overcome COVID-19. In this study, referencing the data published on the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 7BV2) on April 22, we conducted a detailed analysis of the interaction between the complex structures of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 and Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, from the quantum chemical perspective based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method. In addition to the hydrogen bonding and intra-strand stacking between complementary strands as seen in normal base pairs, Remdesivir bound to the terminus of an primer-RNA strand was further stabilized by diagonal &#960;-&#960; stacking with the -1A' base of the complementary strand and an additional hydrogen bond with an intra-strand base, due to the effect of chemically modified functional group. Moreover, stable OH/&#960; interaction is also formed with Thr687 of the RdRp. We quantitatively revealed the exhaustive interaction within the complex among Remdesivir, template-primer-RNA, RdRp and co-factors, and published the results in the FMODB database.","Kato, Koichiro; Honma, Teruki; Fukuzawa, Kaori",J Mol Graph Model,,63

Despite increasing documentation of pervasive inequalities within the scope of radiology, dedicated curricula designed to improve cultural competency and understanding of healthcare disparities among radiology trainees remains sparse. With relatively fewer patient interactions, radiology trainees are particularly susceptible to insufficient contextual awareness of how socioeconomic factors influence patient health and behaviors, physician recommendations, and ultimately clinical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to provide a high-yield background of foundational health equity and disparity concepts for radiology trainees, from which additional educational curricula may be derived. Specifically, this article will discuss the fundamental socioeconomic factors known to contribute to discrepant access and use of imaging services, followed by areas in radiology with well-documented disparities of which trainees should be aware. Lastly, previous and current strategies for addressing disparities in radiology will be discussed with the ultimate goal of stimulating trainee participation and the development of novel approaches.","Mach, John C; Omar, Abdillahi; Abujudeh, Hani",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,,63

415382,Construction of a novel microbial consortium valued for the effective degradation and detoxification of creosote-treated sawdust along with enhanced methane production,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In the newly emerged Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disaster, little is known about the nutritional risks for critically ill patients. It is also unknown whether the modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score is applicable for nutritional risk assessment in intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. We set out to investigate the applicability of the mNUTRIC score for assessing nutritional risks and predicting outcomes for these critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs which had been specially established and equipped for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The study population was critically ill COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to these ICUs between January 28 and February 21, 2020. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of ï¼18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of ï¼24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available. Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score. A score of &#8805;5 indicated high nutritional risk. Mortality was calculated according to patients' outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU. RESULTS: A total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57-77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study. Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (&#8805;5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (<5 points) was observed in 39%. The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P ï¼0.001). Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors. Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-3.32, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score. Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk. Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Ping; He, Zhigang; Yu, Gang; Peng, Dan; Feng, Yikuan; Ling, Jianmin; Wang, Ye; Li, Shusheng; Bian, Yi",Clin. nutr.

415980,Woolen Respirators for Thermal Management,2021,"PURPOSE: In the U.S., TikTok surged in popularity as the COVID-19 virus spread nationally. TikTok posts may both reflect and shape young people's perceptions of the pandemic. This mixed methods study applied a uses and gratifications framework to a systematic analysis of trending TikToks related to COVID-19, with attention to changes over a 2-month period. METHODS: Analyses are based on an original data set of 2,675 TikToks (529 unique videos across 68 COVID-relevant hashtags) viewed over 2,840,347,014 times. TikToks were tracked daily for 65 days after the beginning of U.S. stay-at-home orders (March 17 to May 20, 2020). A thematic analysis used 28 content codes and nine codes related to subject(s) to examine content patterns. Chi-square tests facilitated analyses of changes over time. RESULTS: Trending TikToks related to COVID-19 most often featured details of everyday circumstances and/or relatable commentary on Pandemic Life. These posts were similarly prevalent in Months 1 and 2. Health-Promoting TikToks outnumbered those exhibiting Risky or Concerning Health Practices (58:13) and were more common in Month 1. Advertisements and sponsored campaigns also shaped trending COVID-relevant content during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: On TikTok, public health information appears to coexist with an abundance of commentary about everyday life during the pandemic. Posts arguably reflect documented social media use goals such as information seeking/sharing, archiving, and self-expression. Yet, TikToks during the pandemic period perhaps most often connect to another previously undocumented use goal: a digital search for common humanity in seeing difficult experiences as part of a larger human experience.","Unni, Zoya; Weinstein, Emily",J Adolesc Health,,63

418104,Highlights from this issue,2020,"Objective: Early reports suggest an increased risk of ischemic stroke during COVID-19 infection. We aimed to identify patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke and explore markers of endotheliopathy, inflammation, and hypercoagulability. Background: Novel coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is associated with a diverse array of neurologic complications, including ischemic stroke. Suspected mechanisms include hypercoagulability and endothelial injury, although evidence is sparse in stroke patients. Design/Methods: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke and COVID-19 (n=21) compared to non-COVID-19 acute ischemic stroke patients (n=11). Timing of stroke onset during COVID-19 course, acute phase reactant levels, cytokine levels, endothelial activation, and hypercoagulability were evaluated with respect to stroke onset and etiology. Results: Twenty-one ischemic stroke patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Both groups had a similar age and burden of vascular risk factors. COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of endothelial activation around the time of stroke when compared to controls. The mean Factor VIII level was 332% of normal in the COVID-19 group and 49% in the control group, while von Willebrand Factor antigen and activity were 330% and 285% in the COVID-19 group and 213% and 152% in the control group, respectively. Cytokine storming and a strong inflammatory responses are defining features of severe COVID-19. We demonstrated a temporal correlation between stroke onset and the peak of acute phase reactants. Elevated cytokine levels, IL-6 and soluble IL-2 receptor levels in particular, were significantly associated with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) in COVID-19 patients when compared with other etiologies. Conclusions: We provide emerging evidence that endotheliopathy and the systemic inflammatory response in patients with vascular risk factors and COVID-19 is associated with ischemic stroke. Further research is needed. Understanding the mechanism of stroke in COVID- 19 patients will be critical in providing primary stroke prevention and treatment.","McAlpine, L.; Zubair, A.; Maran, I.; Chojecka, P.; Lleva, P.

418676,Seaweed Phenolics: From Extraction to Applications,2020,"PURPOSE: Telechaplaincy (the use of telecommunications and virtual technology to deliver spiritual and religious care by healthcare chaplains or other religious/spiritual leaders) is a relatively novel intervention that has increasingly been used in recent years, and especially during COVID-19. Telephone-based chaplaincy is one mode of telechaplaincy. The purpose of this study was to (1) describe telephone-based chaplaincy interventions delivered as the first point of contact to patients who screen positive for religious/spiritual concern(s) using an electronic data system, and (2) assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering interventions in an outpatient cancer institute using this methodology. METHODS: Patients were screened for religious and spiritual (R/S) concern(s) using an electronic data system. Patients indicating R/S concern(s) were offered a telephone-based chaplaincy intervention and asked to complete a survey assessing acceptability of the intervention. Feasibility and acceptability data were collected. RESULTS: Thirty percent of screened patients indicated R/S concern(s). Telephone-based chaplaincy interventions were offered to 100% of eligible patients, establishing contact with 61% of eligible patients, and offering chaplaincy interventions to 48% of those patients. Survey participants report high acceptability of the offered intervention. CONCLUSION: This is the first study examining feasibility and acceptability of telephone-based chaplaincy with oncology patients. Telephone-based chaplaincy is feasible and acceptable within an outpatient oncology setting, supporting the promise of this interventional strategy.

420571,Metal Complex Bactericides with Detergent Properties,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, a new coronavirus has emerged in China and was rapidly classified as a pandemic. Pregnant women with GDM are considered risk patients for a severe course of COVID-19. In the context of the COVID-19-pandemic and with a focus on women with GDM, there are serious concerns regarding adverse effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Effective treatments for GDM patients are therefore particularly important. Due to the contact restrictions and infection risks, digital approaches such as telemedicine are suitable. Against this background, it is important to focus on pregnant women with GDM in more detail in the context of COVID-19 and with a view to telemedical treatment options. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimes to summarize currently available evidence on maternal and offspring outcomes of pregnant women with GDM and COVID-19 (1) and to examine telemedical interventions to improve maternal glycemic control during COVID-19-pandemic (2). METHODS: Publications were systematically identified by searching the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, EMBASE, and CINAHL for studies published until March 2021. We sorted the COVID-19 studies (1) by outcomes and divided the telemedical intervention studies (2) into two groups: web-based and app-based. We analyzised case reports (COVID-19 studies) and randomized as well as non-randomized controlled clinical trials (telemedicine studies). For determining the change in HbA1c, we pooled appropriate studies and calculated the difference in means, with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the intervention and control group at the end of the interventions. RESULTS: Regarding COVID-19 studies, we identified n=11 case reports, n=3 letter, n=1 case series and n=1 retrospective single center study. In total, n=41 patients with GDM and COVID-19 were analyzed. The maternal and neonatal outcomes were extremely heterogeneous. We identified adverse outcomes for mother and child through the interaction of GDM and COVID-19 such as cesarean sections, admission to (neonatal) intensive care unit, ventilation, and low Apgar scores. Furthermore, we selected n=9 telemedicine-related articles: n=6 were RCTs, n=2 CCTs and n=1 quasi-experimental design. In total, we analyzed n=480 GDM patients in the intervention and n=494 in the control groups. Of the n=9 telemedical studies, 4 were rated as strong, 4 were rated as moderate and 1 as weak quality studies. Telemedical interventions, in particular web-based and app-based treatments, can contribute to favourable impacts on HbA1c and FBG values in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aMeta-analysis revealed a an effect size of mean difference in HbA1c of -0.19 % (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.03) for all telemedical interventions, MD = -0.138 % (95% CI: -0.,24 to -0.,04) for web-based interventions and MD = -0.305 % (96% CI: -0.,88 to 0.,27) for app-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is an effective approach in the context of COVID-19 and GDM, as it provides social distancing and represents an optimal care of GDM patients, especially with regard to glycemic control, which is very important in view of the identified adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further research is needed.","Eberle, Claudia; Stichling, Stefanie",,,63

Renal replacement therapies are highly demanding and involve lifelong restrictions and readjustments that sometimes translate into profound changes in couples' routines. However, little is known about the experiences of these couples with this condition. This study examined the experiences of couples living with ESRD. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted with a purposive sample. Semistructured dyadic interviews were conducted with 12 patients (65.1 ± 12.8 years old; eight males) undergoing in-center hemodialysis for 18.6 (±13.3) months and their spouses (60.3 ± 11.2 years old; seven females). The interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and submitted to thematic analysis by two independent researchers. FINDINGS: The findings from the dyadic perspective were conceptualized into two major themes: negative impacts (emotional distress, constraints on leisure and daily activities, impacts on couples' dynamics, and difficulties in meal planning) and unmet needs (educational, relational, financial, instrumental, and supportive needs). DISCUSSION: The findings suggested that ESRD has several negative impacts that are related to the reported unmet needs, which might difficult couples' psychosocial adjustment to the condition. Both partners may benefit from educational and supportive interventions that address their needs, targeting the couple as a unit. Recognizing ESRD as a family condition is crucial for the development of innovative family-based interventions that can promote couples' healthy adjustment to the disease.","Sousa, Helena; Ribeiro, Oscar; Figueiredo, Daniela",Hemodial. int,,63
430781,"Face Coverings, Aerosol Dispersion and Mitigation of Virus Transmission Risk",2020-05-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16-28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

431391,In the Shadow,2020,"BACKGROUND: In a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs), cloth masks resulted in a higher risk of respiratory infections compared with medical masks. This was the only published RCT of cloth masks at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To do a post hoc analysis of unpublished data on mask washing and mask contamination from the original RCT to further understand poor performance of the two-layered cotton cloth mask used by HCWs in that RCT. SETTING: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: A subgroup of 607 HCWs aged &#8805;18 years working full time in selected high-risk wards, who used a two-layered cloth mask and were part of a randomised controlled clinical trial comparing medical masks and cloth masks. INTERVENTION: Washing method for cloth masks (self-washing or hospital laundry). A substudy of contamination of a sample of 15 cloth and medical masks was also conducted. OUTCOME MEASURE: Infection rate over 4 weeks of follow up and viral contamination of masks tested by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Viral contamination with rhinovirus was identified on both used medical and cloth masks. Most HCW (77% of daily washing) self-washed their masks by hand. The risk of infection was more than double among HCW self-washing their masks compared with the hospital laundry (HR 2.04 (95% CI 1.03 to 4.00); p=0.04). There was no significant difference in infection between HCW who wore cloth masks washed in the hospital laundry compared with medical masks (p=0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Using self-reported method of washing, we showed double the risk of infection with seasonal respiratory viruses if masks were self-washed by hand by HCWs. The majority of HCWs in the study reported hand-washing their mask themselves. This could explain the poor performance of two layered cloth masks, if the self-washing was inadequate. Cloth masks washed in the hospital laundry were as protective as medical masks. Both cloth and medical masks were contaminated, but only cloth masks were reused in the study, reiterating the importance of daily washing of reusable cloth masks using proper method. A well-washed cloth mask can be as protective as a medical mask.

432800,Removal of micropollutants in drinking water using UV-LED/chlorine advanced oxidation process followed by activated carbon adsorption,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led many countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public discourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown policies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point, and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior -- the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) model as a prior mean function with""country-and-policy-specific""parameters that capture fatality curves under""counterfactual""policies within each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors) -- i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with other models listed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and provide scenario analyses for various lockdown and reopening strategies highlighting their impact on COVID-19 fatalities.","Qian, Zhaozhi; Alaa, Ahmed M.; Schaar, Mihaela van der",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08837v2.pdf,63

In particular, effective antiviral therapeutics capable of stopping infections in its tracks is critical to reducing infection fatality rate and healthcare burden. With the field of drug delivery witnessing tremendous advancement in the last two decades owing to a panoply of nanotechnology advances, the present review summarizes and expounds on the research and development of therapeutic nanoformulations against various infectious viral pathogens, including HIV, influenza, and coronaviruses. Specifically, nanotechnology advances towards improving pathogen- and host-targeted antiviral drug delivery are reviewed, and the prospect of achieving effective viral eradication, broad-spectrum antiviral effect, and resisting viral mutations are discussed. As several COVID-19 antiviral clinical trials are met with lackluster treatment efficacy, nanocarrier strategies aimed at improving drug pharmacokinetics, biodistributions, and synergism are expected to not only contribute to the current disease treatment efforts but also expand the antiviral arsenal against other emerging viral diseases.","Yang, Kai-Chieh; Lin, Jung-Chen; Tsai, Hsiao-Han; Hsu, Chung-Yao; Shih, Vicky; Hu, Che-Ming Jack",Drug Deliv Transl Res,,63

However, these drugs pose some adverse side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea during clinical applications. Therefore, it is of great value and significance to identify effective and safe therapeutic drugs to solve the clinical problems associated with intake of western medicine. As a unique medical treatment, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has gradually exerted its advantages in the treatment of IPF worldwide through a multi-level and multi-target approach. Further, to overcome the current clinical problems of oral and injectable intakes of TCM, pulmonary drug delivery system (PDDS) could be designed to reduce the systemic metabolism and adverse reactions of the drug and to improve the bioavailability of drugs. Through PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and CNKI, we retrieved articles published in related fields in recent years, and this paper has summarized twenty-seven Chinese compound prescriptions, ten single TCM, and ten active ingredients for effective prevention and treatment of IPF.

The Faculty for the Built Environment within the University of Malta conducted this as a pilot study in collaboration with the Counselling Services Unit to support students in finding ways to improve their work/study balance. The methodology used was an appreciative inquiry through workshops and focus groups over two academic years. The main findings suggest that students requested time management and resilience techniques to strengthen their study–work–life balance and develop an improved work ethic once university life is complete. Students who felt valued throughout the study period appreciated their ideas and self-identity more than others. Results were presented to the faculty staff who suggested an action–response approach to transition management. Conclusions indicated that the strength of the approach undertaken served to manage students’ transition from academic life to career entry, conduct a gap analysis to identify issues between students and staff, and facilitate a discussion of values and ethics in preparation for post-graduation career performance.","Rebecca Dalli, Gonzi Camilleri Joan",Sustainability,,63
434816,Omics Application in Animal Science-A Special Emphasis on Stress Response and Damaging Behaviour in Pigs,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought on challenges not only to acute care, but also chronic care of patients. Individuals maintained on immunosuppression appear to be especially susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) frequently require immunosuppression and may be at increased risk for developing COVID-19. The incidence and impact of COVID-19 on patients with AAV is currently not known. We aimed to investigate this impact via a telephone questionnaire-based patient survey and chart review. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of AAV patients followed at two centers was conducted. Data regarding demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were confirmed by chart review. A telephone survey was conducted to ascertain symptoms and contact exposure related to COVID-19, as well as changes in health care delivery during the pandemic period between January and July, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 206 patients surveyed, the median age was 64 years, 51% were female and mean (SD) disease duration was 7 (5) years. The majority had kidney (n = 160) and lung (n = 108) involvement. Seventy-five percent (n = 155) were receiving immunosuppression, with 77 patients (50%) receiving rituximab during the pandemic period. Of the 10 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) by PCR, three were positive. Patients had a significant disruption in care; none had an in-person visit and 69% had a telemedicine consultation. Rituximab maintenance was postponed in 21 patients. Twelve patients experienced disease relapse. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with AAV appears to be similar to that of the general population. For a patient population that requires active clinical surveillance, there is significant disruption in care as a result of the pandemic. Reduction of immunosuppression may not be indicated, and the risk of relapse likely far outweighs the risk of COVID-19.","Kant, Sam; Morris, Adam; Ravi, Srekar; Floyd, Lauren; Gapud, Eric; Antichos, Brendan; Dhaygude, Ajay; Seo, Phil; Geetha, Duvuru",J. nephrol,,63

Using anion photodissociation spectroscopy, we have measured the intrinsic absorption electronic spectroscopy (400-214 nm) and numerous accompanying ionic photofragmentation pathways of the benzophenone-4 anion ([BP4-H]-). Relative ion yield plots reveal the locations of the bright S1 and S3 excited states. For the first time for an ionic UV filter, ab initio potential energy surfaces are presented to provide new insight into how the photofragment identity maps the relaxation pathways. These calculations reveal that [BP4-H]- undergoes excited-state decay consistent with a statistical fragmentation process where the anion breaks down on the ground state after nonradiative relaxation. The broader relevance of the results in providing a basis for interpreting the relaxation dynamics of a wide range of gas-phase ionic systems is discussed.","Wong, Natalie G K; Rankine, Conor D; Dessent, Caroline E H",J Phys Chem Lett,,63

The objective of this review is to describe how patients with unclassifiable ILD should be evaluated and what impact specific clinical, radiological, and histopathological features may have on management decisions, focusing on patients with a predominantly fibrotic phenotype. We highlight recent data that have suggested an increasing role for antifibrotic medications in a variety of fibrotic ILDs, but justify the ongoing importance of making an accurate ILD diagnosis given the benefit of immunomodulatory therapies in many patient populations. We provide a practical approach to support management decisions that can be used by clinicians and tested by clinical researchers, and further identify the need for additional research to support a rational and standardised approach to the management of patients with unclassifiable ILD.","Ryerson, Christopher J; Corte, Tamera J; Myers, Jeffrey L; Walsh, Simon L F; Guler, Sabina A",Eur. respir. j,,63

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Currently, there is no vaccine and no approved therapy. Therapeutic approaches are aimed at preventing viral replication and spread, limiting the impact of the inflammatory overdrive (cytokine storm), preventing thromboembolic complications and replacing or supporting organ function. However, despite organ support, mortality is currently 65% for those receiving advanced respiratory support and 78% for those requiring renal replacement therapies. Thus, efforts should be made to provide adjuvant organ protection therapy. This may imply novel therapies in clinical development (e.g., the Fas ligand trap asunercept), but uptake of repurposed drugs already in clinical use may be faster. In this regard, sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were recently shown to protect the heart and kidney both within and outside of a diabetic milieu context.

The COVID-19 pandemic reached its peak in mid-April 2020 in the UK. During this period, NHS Occupational Health Services (OHS) were stretched to their limit along with other health services. OHS may have had to change their pattern of operation, operating times, services offered, etc. to cope with the pandemic. Data about business model modifications, services offered by the OHS businesses during the pandemic could help in better utilization of OHS resources in the future. AIMS: To understand the behaviour of OHS in different parts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey link was sent to both accredited and unaccredited UK Occupational Health Physicians (OHPs). RESULTS: Sixty-two OHPs responded to the survey. In the current pandemic, 51% of the OHS (95% CI 0.38-0.62) offered weekend or out-of-hours (OOH) services, 21% had to employ extra staff (95% CI 0.13-0.33) and 54% had to change their working hours (95% CI 0.41-0.65). Ninety per cent of the OHS (95% CI 0.78-0.94) continued to offer routine services; however, there was a decline in offering vaccination services. Fifty-six per cent of the OHS (95% CI 0.42-0.67) offered a dedicated telephone line and 46% of the OHS (95% CI 0.32-0.56) started a dedicated COVID-19 queries inbox. CONCLUSIONS: There was a change in the behaviour of the OHS to cope with the pandemic.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students were barred access. This prompted us to launch and evaluate a new freeware PET/CT viewing system hosted in the university network. METHODS: We asked our students to install the multiplatform Fiji viewer with Beth Israel PET/CT plugin (http://petctviewer.org) on their personal computers and connect to a central image database in the university network based on the public domain orthanc server (https://orthanc-server.com). At the end of course, we conducted an anonymous student survey. RESULTS: The new system was online within eight days, including regulatory approval. All 76 students (100â%) in the fifth year completed their course work, reading five anonymized PET/CT cases as planned. 41 (53â%) students answered the survey. Fiji was challenging to install with a mean score of 1.8 on a 5-point Likert scale (5â=âeasy, 1â=âdifficult). Fiji was more difficult to use (score 3.0) than the previously used diagnostic workstations in the hospital (score 4.1; pâ<â0.001, paired t-test).

451811,Measurement of the absolute gamma-ray emission intensities from the decay of 147Nd,2020,"Worldwide governments have decided to temporarily closures of educational institutions in an attempt to minimize the spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic, which has forged significant challenges for the education community. The present study is from the digital education scenario during the COVID-19 lockdown to find out the factors affecting online learning. This study is exploratory from 1218 students who have been collected based on a structured questionnaire having a 5-point linear scale. Jamovl software has been used for data analysis and results demonstrate that there are three major factors like affordability, infrastructural, and training that affect online learning during the COVID-19. Besides, correlation analysis between these factors highlights the relationship among them. Linear regression has applied to know the impact of affordability and infrastructure on the training factor. Outcomes suggested that infrastructure has a negative impact but affordability has a positive impact on the training factor. In the present scenario, this study highlighted the importance of social distancing and digital education tools that should he adopted by schools and colleges.","Arora, M.; Goyal, L.

We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization, virological clearance, and severe adverse events. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Eleven articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. We can conclude that dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries, since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Abeldaño Zuñiga, Roberto Ariel; Coca, Silvia Mercedes; Abeldaño, Giuliana Florencia; González-Villoria, Ruth Ana María",Ther Adv Respir Dis,,63

456305,Introducing John Higgins,2021,"The immunomodulatory effects of immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy for cancer may act at the crossroads between the need to increase antiviral immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to decrease the inflammatory responses in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is evidence from preclinical models that blocking programmed death receptor 1 (PD1) protects against RNA virus infections, which suggests that patients with cancer receiving ICB may have lower rates of viral infection. However, given the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, this would be difficult to demonstrate using population-based registries or in clinical trials. Most studies of the impact of ICB therapy on the course of COVID-19 have centered on studying its potential detrimental impact on the course of the COVID-19 infection, in particular on the development of the most severe inflammatory complications. This is a logical concern as it is becoming clear that complications of COVID-19 such as severe respiratory distress syndrome are related to interferon signaling, which is the pathway that leads to expression of the PD1 ligand PD-L1. Therefore, PD1/PD-L1 ICB could potentially increase inflammatory processes, worsening the disease course for patients. However, review of the current evidence does not support the notion that ICB therapy worsens complications from COVID-19, and we conclude that it supports the continued use of ICB therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic provided that we now collect data on the effects of such therapy on COVID-19 vaccination.","Garassino, Marina Chiara; Ribas, Antoni",Cancer immunology res.

This highlight summarizes our continuing efforts towards the effective utilization of renewable resources for new chemicals, fuels and soft materials, and selected successful stories in that direction. Cashew nut shell liquid, an industrial by-product, was used as a raw material to synthesize aryl glycolipids which upon self-assembly generated an array of soft materials such as lipid nanotubes, twisted/helical nanofibers, low-molecular-weight hydro/organogels and liquid crystals. These soft architectures were fully characterized by using different techniques. In another example, amygdalin, a by-product of the apricot industry, was used to develop novel amphiphiles, which showed unprecedented gelation properties in a wide range of solvents. To take these soft nanomaterials to a second level, we successfully demonstrated the utility of these hydrogels as drug delivery vehicles. Intriguingly, enzyme catalysis was used as a tool to make and break the hydrogels, which apparently triggered controlled drug delivery. We believe these results and this highlight will motivate us and others in the field of biobased materials research, green chemistry and soft material development through self-assembly processes, to design and develop new functional materials from plant/crop-based renewable resources, otherwise underutilized.","John, George; Vemula, Praveen Kumar",Soft Matter,,63

We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th-April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). RESULTS: Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. CONCLUSIONS: NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources. Programs developed to mitigate stress among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate HCW preferences.","Shechter, Ari; Diaz, Franchesca; Moise, Nathalie; Anstey, D Edmund; Ye, Siqin; Agarwal, Sachin; Birk, Jeffrey L; Brodie, Daniel; Cannone, Diane E; Chang, Bernard; Claassen, Jan; Cornelius, Talea; Derby, Lilly; Dong, Melissa; Givens, Raymond C; Hochman, Beth; Homma, Shunichi; Kronish, Ian M; Lee, Sung A J; Manzano, Wilhelmina; Mayer, Laurel E S; McMurry, Cara L; Moitra, Vivek; Pham, Patrick; Rabbani, LeRoy; Rivera, Reynaldo R; Schwartz, Allan; Schwartz, Joseph E; Shapiro, Peter A; Shaw, Kaitlin; Sullivan, Alexandra M; Vose, Courtney; Wasson, Lauren; Edmondson, Donald; Abdalla, Marwah",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,63

462251,Comparing factual recall of tapped vs. handwritten text,2020,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid shift to online delivery in higher education. This learning and teaching environment is associated with reduced student engagement, a crucial prerequisite of student satisfaction, retention and success. This paper presents a case study that explored student engagement in the synchronous virtual learning environment, during the mandatory move to exclusive online learning in Australian higher education in April to June 2020. Three university instructors used the Teaching and Learning Circles Model to observe a series of their peers' synchronous virtual classrooms, from which they reflected on ways to enhance their own practice. The findings demonstrate how student engagement in these classrooms can be strengthened across the four constructs of Kahu and Nelson's (2018) engagement conceptual framework: belonging;emotional response;wellbeing and self-efficacy. The case study also reveals limitations of the synchronous virtual environment as a means of supporting student engagement in the online learning and teaching environment, and proposes ways to address them. Against emerging reports of increased mental health issues among isolated university students during the current pandemic, the case study's recommendations to improve student wellbeing and belonging are particularly salient. This article also highlights the usefulness of the Teaching and Learning Circles Model of peer observation as a way to guide its participants' reflections on their own practice, support their collegiality with academic peers and build their confidence and competence in the synchronous virtual learning environment.","Andrew, Lesley Wallace Ruth Sambell Ros",Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice,,63

463985,AACVPR 35th Annual Meeting Scientific Abstract Presentations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social containment measures imposed in Europe during the lockdown to face COVID-19 pandemic can generate long-term potential threats for metabolic health. METHODS: A cohort of 494 non-COVID-19 subjects living in 21 EU countries were interviewed by an anonymous questionnaire exploring anthropometric and lifestyle changes during 1-month lockdown. A subgroup of 41 overweight/obese Italian subjects with previously diagnosed nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) joined the study following a 12-month follow-up period promoting weight loss by healthy lifestyle. RESULTS: During the lockdown, body weight increased in 55% of subjects (average 2.4 ± 0.9 kg). Weight change increased with age, but not baseline body mass index. Subjects living in Italy had greater weight gain than those living in other European Countries. Weight gain during the lockdown was highest in subjects reporting no physical activity, and low adherence to Mediterranean diet. In the NAFLD group, weight gain occurred in 70% of cases. Subjects reporting weight loss during lockdown had decreased fatty liver score at 3 months before the lockdown, as compared with 1 year before. CONCLUSIONS: Strict measures of social containment-even short-term-pave the way to the increased risk of metabolic abnormalities in the medium-long term. In this context, adherence to Mediterranean diet and regular physical activity play a protective role both in terms of weight gain and fatty liver development/progression, with implication for primary and secondary prevention. When adopting measures imposing social containment, intensive educational campaigns must increase public awareness about beneficial effects of healthy lifestyles.","Shanmugam, Harshitha; Di Ciaula, Agostino; Di Palo, Domenica Maria; Molina-Molina, Emilio; Garruti, Gabriella; Faienza, Maria Felicia; vanErpecum, Karel; Portincasa, Piero",Eur J Clin Invest,,63

469463,"Reactive, reproducible, collaborative: computational notebooks evolve",2021,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces many challenges: two-thirds of the world's extreme poor population;a shrinking economy because of commodity price declines and the COVID-19 pandemic;widespread energy poverty;and climate variability that is disrupting agrarian livelihoods and stirring conflict over natural resources. Climate change threatens to exacerbate these through further disruption of the physical environment, and a transition away from the fossil fuels on which many of the region's economies depend. Through their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement, all SSA countries committed to the increased utilisation of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES) to tackle the twin challenges of energy poverty-which limits economic development-and climate change. There is a dearth of analysis on the nature of sustainable energy transition(s) necessary to deliver these NDCs, especially given the limited financial and technical resources of SSA. Using Nigeria as a case study, this study seeks to address this gap by determining the power system transitions required to deliver NDCs alongside universal energy access in SSA by 2050;their financial and policy implications;and the barriers and opportunities that they present to sustainable development efforts. We find that Nigeria can deliver its NDCs with no added cost implications, thereby debunking the prevalent view that climate change mitigation is too costly to pursue in SSA. Furthermore, we find that the higher availability and dispatchability of fossil fuel generation makes it critical for the rapid scale-up of energy supply;thus, entirely leapfrogging carbon-intensive development will prove costly to SSA. Finally, owing to the limited cost reductions that IRES have experienced in SSA, delivering NDCs through the deployment of decentralised IRES systems proves more expensive than using conventional generation. The distributed nature of IRES however means that they can democratise energy investment and job creation, thus facilitating the equitable sharing of economic resources which is crucial to conflict prevention in the fragile socio-political landscapes that pervade the region.","Daggash, H.

Accordingly, we screened a number of phenolic natural compounds for their in vitro anti-SARS CoV-2 activity. We found sinapic acid (SA) selectively inhibited the viral replication in vitro with an half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) value of 2.69 microg/mL with significantly low cytotoxicity (CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 189.3 microg/mL). Subsequently, we virtually screened all currently available molecular targets using a multistep in silico protocol to find out the most probable molecular target that mediates this compound's antiviral activity. As a result, the viral envelope protein (E-protein) was suggested as the most possible hit for SA. Further in-depth molecular dynamic simulation-based investigation revealed the essential structural features of SA antiviral activity and its binding mode with E-protein. The structural and experimental results presented in this study strongly recommend SA as a promising structural motif for anti-SARS CoV-2 agent development.","Orfali, R.; Rateb, M. E.; Hassan, H.

In early prethrombolytic and thrombolytic periods, LVT was present in 20%-50% of patients in the context of acute MI, more commonly in acute anterior or apical MI. While the incidence of LVT has dropped in recent times, its identification is expected to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with chest pain are more likely to delay initial hospitalization because of a fear of contracting COVID-19. Infection with COVID-19 was associated with the remarkably hypercoagulable state which increased the risk of the early development of LVT in the setting of MI or underlying prethrombotic conditions. We present a series of four cases in which COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease were characterized by various configurations of large LVT.","Jariwala, P.; Punjani, A.; Boorugu, H.; Reddy, M.

479294,Suppression of Acoustic Streaming in Shape-Optimized Channels,2020,"Complement system hyperactivation has been proposed as a potential driver of adverse outcomes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients, given prior research of complement deposits found in tissue and blood samples, as well as evidence of clinical improvement with anticomplement therapy. Its role in augmenting thrombotic microangiopathy mediated organ damage has also been implicated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to examine associations between complement parameters and progression to severe COVID-19 illness, as well as correlations with other systems. Blood samples of COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) were analyzed for a wide panel of complement and inflammatory biomarkers. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity at index ED visit, while the secondary outcome was peak disease severity over the course of illness. Fifty-two COVID-19 patients were enrolled. C3a (p = 0.018), C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.002), and sC5b-9/C3 ratio (p = 0.021) were significantly elevated in with severe disease at ED presentation. Over the course of illness, C3a (p = 0.028) and C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.003) were highest in the moderate severity group. In multivariate regression controlled for confounders, complement hyperactivation failed to predict progression to severe disease. C3a, C3a/C3 ratio, and sC5b-9/C3 ratio were correlated positively with numerous inflammatory biomarkers, fibrinogen, and VWF:Ag, and negatively with plasminogen and ADAMTS13 activity. We found evidence of complement hyperactivation in COVID-19, associated with hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. Complement inhibition should be further investigated for potential benefit in patients displaying a hyperinflammatory and microangiopathic phenotype.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Szergyuk, Ivan; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L; Vikse, Jens; Benoit, Stefanie W",J. med. virol,,63
480399,A multi-agent system for simulating the spread of a contagious disease,2020,"In order to decrease spreading of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) over the world, the activity of many industries has declined, several flights were cancelled and so many people staying home that made drop in fuel consumption in road transport. As industries, transport networks and businesses have closed down, it has brought a sudden drop in carbon emissions. Hence, in this paper, a simple estimation model is developed by using some excel features to assess the reduced CO 2emissions in March 2020. Then this indicator is calculated for 3 scenarios which are based on this disease situation worldwide and therefore based on different reduction percent of fossil fuels consumption in various sectors over year 2020. In scenario 1, it is assumed the number of infected people increasing but it is before peak region. In this zone, the measures to slow the rate of infection would be similar till end of year. In scenario 2, the infectious growth rate in the world reaches to peak region. Hence, the protective measures would be extended. As a result, industries activities and various kinds of transportations will be probably reduced much more in comparison with scenario 1. In scenario 3, it is assumed the growth rate begins to fall and it is after peak region. In this zone, the intervention and protective measures would be lessened toward scenario 1. So, industries activities and transportations will be likely increased in compare to other scenarios. The results show that CO 2emissions worldwide in March 2020 has been 7% lower than the monthly average of this parameter in 2019 as consequence of COVID-19. Moreover, carbon emission through 2020 has been estimated to be 34.4, 32.4 and 35.3 Gton based on scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. It is worth to mention that based on these three scenarios, this indicator in 2020 will be approximately the same as 2011, 2008 and 2012.","Safarian, Sahar; Unnthorsson, Runar; Richter, Christiaan",Aerosol Air Qual.

480911,Braided absorbable sutures for traumatic wounds,2021,"BACKGROUND: Isolation due to a COVID-19 infection can limit activities and cause physical and mental decline, especially in older adults and people with disabilities. However, due to limited contact, adequate rehabilitation is difficult to provide for quarantined patients. Telerehabilitation technology could be a solution; however, issues specific to COVID-19 should be taken into consideration, such as strict quarantine and respiratory symptoms, as well as accessibility to deal with rapid increases in need due to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and to investigate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation system for patients who are quarantined due to COVID-19 by combining existing commercial devices and computer applications. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team has identified the requirements for a telerehabilitation system for COVID-19 and developed the system to satisfy those requirements. In the subsequent feasibility study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=10; mean age 60 years, SD 18 years) were included. A single session of telerehabilitation consisted of stretching exercises, a 15-minute exercise program, and a video exercise program conducted under real-time guidance by a physical therapist through a video call. The system included a tablet computer, a pulse oximeter, videoconferencing software, and remote control software. The feasibility of the system was evaluated using the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ; 14 items) and an additional questionnaire on the telerehabilitation system (5 items). Each item was rated from ""1 = strongly disagree"" to ""5 = strongly agree."" RESULTS: The telerehabilitation system was developed by combining existing devices and applications, including a pulse oximeter and remote control mechanism, to achieve user-friendliness, affordability, and safety, which were determined as the system requirements. In the feasibility study, 9 out of 10 patients were able to use the telerehabilitation system without any on-site help. On the TSQ, the mean score for each item was 4.7 (SD 0.7), and in the additional items regarding telerehabilitation, the mean score for each item was 4.3 (SD 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility of this simple telerehabilitation system in quarantined patients with COVID-19, encouraging further investigation on the merit of the system's use in clinical practice.","Mukaino, Masahiko; Tatemoto, Tsuyoshi; Kumazawa, Nobuhiro; Tanabe, Shigeo; Katoh, Masaki; Saitoh, Eiichi; Otaka, Yohei",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,,63

DesignRetrospective analysis of pulse oximeter saturation and arterial blood gas analysis obtained at arrival. SettingTertiary referral hospital in Mexico City converted early in the pandemic to a COVID-19 center. Patients and measurementsA total of 2,960 patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the emergency department from April 2020 until March 2021. Pulse oximeter saturation and arterial blood gas analysis was obtained in all of them. Pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) to inspired oxygen fraction ratio (FiO2), oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SatO2) to FiO2 ratio, and oxygen pressure in arterial blood to FiO2 ratio were calculated for every patient. InterventionsNone. Main ResultsA strong correlation was seen between PaO2/FiO2 & SpO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.6, p < 0.001), and SatO2/FiO2 & SpO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.65, p < 0.001), while a very strong correlation was seen between PaO2/FiO2 & SatO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.88, p < 0.001). When classifying severity by quantiles, considerable cross-over was observed when comparing oxygenation indexes, as only 785 (26.5%) patients were in the same quintile across the three indexes. ConclusionsHypoxemia severity is heterogeneous according to the oxygenation index utilized. This limits their usefulness as sole markers of severity, as inter-observer variability, especially on FiO2 estimation, and different practices limit consistent follow up and treatment decisions.","Núñez, Isaac; Soto-Mota, Adrian",,,63

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2, one needs to unravel the intricacies of host immune response to the virus, the viral pathogen's mode of transmission, and alterations in specific biological pathways in the host allowing viral survival. This review critically analyzes recent research using high-throughput ""omics"" technologies (including proteomics and metabolomics) on various biospecimens that allow an increased understanding of the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The altered biomolecule profile facilitates an understanding of altered biological pathways. Further, we have performed a meta-analysis of significantly altered biomolecular profiles in COVID-19 patients using bioinformatics tools. Our analysis deciphered alterations in the immune response, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism and other pathways that cumulatively result in COVID-19 disease, including symptoms such as hyperglycemic and hypoxic sequelae.","Aggarwal, Shalini; Acharjee, Arup; Mukherjee, Amrita; Baker, Mark S; Srivastava, Sanjeeva",J Proteome Res,,63

486482,What can vaccines learn from aviation?,2020,"In the wake of COVID-19, the postgraduate activities in physiology were shifted from live (face-to-face teaching) to virtual mode. This transition posed a challenge to postgraduate students and faculty moderators, especially for participant-centric group discussion, wherein face-to-face interaction contributes significantly to active learner engagement. To bridge the gap between live group discussion (GD) and virtual GD in the conventional format (VGD), we implemented an innovative yet feasible multistep approach of conducting structured virtual group discussion (sVGD). It involved priming of students during the preparatory phase and incorporation of the Tuckman model of group dynamics, which consists of sequential substages of forming, storming, norming, and performing into the virtual format. Unsupervised synchronous and asynchronous, as well as supervised synchronous interactions within and in between the minigroups in a structured way, led to active engagement of students with one another and the moderator, despite the constraints imposed by the virtual format. After establishing the feasibility of the approach during the first GD (sVGD-1), sVGD-2 was conducted, further refining the approach, and feedback was obtained from the postgraduate students. Pre-GD feedback revealed that the live session was preferred over virtual for the conduct of GD, whereas both live GD and sVGD were perceived to be more effective than VGD in the post-GD feedback. Such pedagogical innovations may also help to address the challenges posed in traditional teaching across the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medical education and beyond during such unforeseeable circumstances.","Kaur, Simran; Bir, Megha; Chandran, Dinu S; Deepak, Kishore Kumar",Adv Physiol Educ,,63

This study aimed to provide information regarding the impact of the mandatory confinement on the physical activity, eating disorders risk, sleep quality and well-being on a Spanish sample. An online survey that included the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Eating Attitude Test-26, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was administered two days after the state of alarm was stablished in Spain and five days after such measures began to be eased. Out of the 693 people who answered the first questionnaire, 161 completed the second one. These participants spent a total of 48 days locked at home, a period during which a significant worsening in all the variables assessed except for the risk of developing eating disorders, was observed: weight (kg), 67.3 ± 14.8 vs 67.7 ± 15.1, p = 0.012; physical activity (MET minutes per week), 8515.7 ± 10260.0 vs 5053.5 ± 5502.0, p < 0.001; sleep problems (total score), 6.2 ± 3.5 vs 7.2 ± 3.9, p < 0.001; self-perceived well-being (score), 4 (3-4) vs 3 (3-4), p < 0.001. The confinement had a significant differential effect on physically active participants, who experienced a significant decline (p < 0.05) on their physical activity levels, quality of sleep and well-being; whereas physically inactive participants did not experience significant changes. Findings from this longitudinal study indicate that a lockdown period due to COVID-19 had a negative impact on the physical activity levels, sleep quality and well-being in a group of physically active Spanish adults. Public health authorities should be aware that people who usually lead an active lifestyle, might be particularly susceptible to such disruptions.","Martínez-de-Quel, Óscar; Suárez-Iglesias, David; López-Flores, Marcos; Pérez, Carlos Ayán",Appetite,,63

Until now, no certified drugs have been discovered to efficiently inhibit the virus. The scientists are struggling to find new safe bioactive inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, we aim to find antagonists that may inhibit the activity of the three major viral targets: SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (6LU7), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6VYB), and a host target human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (1R42), which is the entry point for the viral encounter, were studied with the prospects of identifying significant drug candidate(s) against COVID-19 infection. Then, the protein stability produced score of less than 0.6 for all residues of all studied receptors. This confirmed that these receptors are extremely stable proteins, so it is very difficult to unstable the stability of these proteins through utilizing individual drugs. Hence, we studied the combination and tricombination therapy between bioactive compounds which have the best binding affinity and some antiviral drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, simeprevir, baloxavir, lopinavir, and favipiravir to show the effect of combination and tricombination therapy to disrupt the stability of the three major viral targets that are mentioned previously. Also, ADMET study suggested that most of all studied bioactive compounds are safe and nontoxic compounds. All results confirmed that caulerpin can be utilized as a combination and tricombination therapy along with the studied antiviral drugs for disrupting the stability of the three major viral receptors (6LU7, 6VYB, and 1R42).

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study of women admitted to labor and delivery units in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) hospitals between April 6 and May 11, 2020 who were universally offered testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 3,963). Hospital inpatient and outpatient physician encounter, and laboratory records were used to ascertain universal testing levels, test results, and medical and obstetrical histories. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated from the number of women who tested positive during labor per 100 women delivered. RESULTS: Of women delivered during the study period, 3,923 (99.0%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. A total of 17 (0.43%; 95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.63%) women tested positive, and none of them were symptomatic on admission. There was no difference in terms of characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative tested women. One woman developed a headache attributed to COVID-19 3 days postpartum. No neonates had a positive test at 24 hours of life. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that in pregnant women admitted for delivery between April 6 and May 11, 2020 in this large integrated health care system in Southern California, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 test positive was very low and all patients were asymptomatic on admission. KEY POINTS: · The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large diverse cohort of term pregnant women was 0.43%.. · 99% of women accepted SARS-CoV-2 screening on admission to labor and delivery.. · All women with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing..","Fassett, Michael J; Lurvey, Lawrence D; Yasumura, Lyn; Nguyen, Marielle; Colli, Joseph J; Volodarskiy, Marianna; Gullett, Jonathan C; Braun, David; Fong, Alex; Trivedi, Neha; Bruxvoort, Katia; Chiu, Vicki; Getahun, Darios",Am J Perinatol,,63
504830,Luminescent Chemosensor Based on Ru(II) Bipyridine Complex for Detection of Sudan I through Inner Filter Effect,2020,"The chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC) B locus has been linked to resistance to infectious diseases. We have previously provided evidence that the MHC congenic chicken lines 331/B2 and 335/B19 differ in susceptibility to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains M41 and ArkDPI in in vivo challenge experiments. Innate immune responses can be difficult to measure in vivo because they are nonspecific and can be triggered by environmental factors. In an attempt to address this issue, we used tracheal organ cultures derived from 331/B2 and 335/B19 birds to study local cytokine production after in vitro challenge with IBV M41. Interferon (IFN)-ß, interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, and IL-10 gene expression and production were assessed. Tracheal organ cultures derived from 335/B19 birds presented an increased inflammatory response compared to 331/B2. However, it was not possible to discriminate between cytokine responses in IBV-infected and phosphate-buffered saline-treated tracheal organ cultures. Because tracheal processing entails physical damage to the trachea, it is possible that the tracheal organ cultures presented high levels of inflammation regardless of the IBV challenge. To demonstrate the effects of IBV on innate immune responses in the MHC congenic chicken lines, we performed an additional in vivo experiment that focused on cytokine gene expression and production in tracheas up to 60 hr after a challenge with IBV M41. Our results corroborate previous in vivo observations that suggest that detrimental local inflammatory responses in 335/B19 birds might be associated with their susceptibility to IBV and that inflammation does not necessarily lead to the assembly of an appropriate adaptive immune response. This work provides further insight into the increased susceptibility of 335/B19 birds to infectious bronchitis.","da Silva, Ana P; Schat, Karel A; Gallardo, Rodrigo A",Avian Dis,,63

This study aims to evaluate the presence of cardiac and liver alterations in patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and liver elastography (LE). (2) Methods: A total of 97 subjects recovering from COVID-19, attending the hospital’s specialized outpatient clinic for persisting symptoms at 3 to 11 weeks after the acute illness, were included in this study. They all had a basal COVID-19 assessment, and subsequently, a clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, TTE, and LE. (3) Results: considering the presence of pulmonary injury during COVID-19, patients were divided into two groups. Although none of them had altered systolic function, we evidenced pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, increased liver stiffness, viscosity, and steatosis in around one-third of the patients, with significantly higher values in subjects with pulmonary injury compared to those without. (4) Conclusion: persisting symptoms characterizing the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome could be explained by residual cardiac and hepatic lesions, which were worse in more severe COVID-19 forms. These patients may be at risk of developing liver fibrosis and cardiac alterations and should be investigated in the first 12 weeks after the onset of the infection.","Bende, Felix Tudoran Cristina Sporea Ioan Fofiu Renata Bâldea Victor Cotrău Radu Popescu Alina Sirli Roxana Ungureanu Bogdan Silviu Tudoran Mariana",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,63

509606,"Nature's ""responsible"" response to disease",2021,"A novel coronavirus disease has emerged (later named COVID-19) and caused the world to enter a new reality, with many direct and indirect factors influencing it. Some are human-controllable (e.g. interventional policies, mobility and the vaccine); some are not (e.g. the weather). We have sought to test how a change in these human-controllable factors might influence two measures: the number of daily cases against economic impact. If applied at the right level and with up-to-date data to measure, policymakers would be able to make targeted interventions and measure their cost. This study aims to provide a predictive analytics framework to model, predict and simulate COVID-19 propagation and the socio-economic impact of interventions intended to reduce the spread of the disease such as policy and/or vaccine. It allows policymakers, government representatives and business leaders to make better-informed decisions about the potential effect of various interventions with forward-looking views via scenario planning. We have leveraged a recently launched open-source COVID-19 big data platform and used published research to find potentially relevant variables (features) and leveraged in-depth data quality checks and analytics for feature selection and predictions. An advanced machine learning pipeline has been developed armed with a self-evolving model, deployed on a modern machine learning architecture.

510156,Getting a head start: turn-of-the-month submission effect for accepted papers in management journals,2020,"During the X-ray bursts of GS 1826$-$24,""clocked burster"", the nuclear reaction flow that surges through the rapid-proton capture process path has to pass through the NiCu cycles before reaching the ZnGa cycles that moderate the further extent of hydrogen burning in the region above germanium and selenium isotopes. The $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction located in the NiCu cycles plays an important role in influencing the burst light curves as found by Cyburt et al. (2016). We deduce the $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction rate based on the experimentally determined important nuclear structure information, isobaric-multiplet-mass equation, and large-scale shell model calculations. With the isobaric-multiplet-mass equation, we propose a possible order of $1^+_1$ and $2^+_3$ dominant resonance states that the $2^+_3$ resonance state is higher than the $1^+_1$ state, and estimate the resonance energy of $1^+_2$ contributing resonance state. The new rate is up to a factor of five lower than the Forstner et al. (2001) rate recommended by JINA REACLIB v2.2. Using the one-dimensional implicit hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to model the thermonuclear X-ray bursts of GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster, we find that the new $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction redistributes the reaction flow in the NiCu cycles and reduces the production of $^{58}$Zn, whereas the $^{59}$Cu(p,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni and $^{59}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{60}$Zn reactions suppress the influence of the $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction and strongly diminish the impact of nuclear reaction flow that by-passes the important $^{56}$Ni waiting point induced by the $^{55}$Ni(p,$\gamma$)$^{56}$Cu reaction on burst light curve. The influence of the newly deduced $^{56}$Ni(p,$\gamma$)$^{57}$Cu is also discussed.","Lam, Yi Hua; Lu, Ning; Heger, Alexander; Jacobs, Adam Michael; Smirnova, Nadezda A.; Nieto, Teresa Kurtukian; Johnston, Zac; Kubono, Shigeru",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11552v1.pdf,63

In this study, we conduct an interpretive case study on South Korea's response to the pandemic and construct a chronological narrative to identify key aspects of digital resilience. We identify agility, diversity, and plurality - enabled by active roles of various stakeholders, including citizens, research communities, and private sector - as keys to digital resilience to the pandemic.

Yet there are few studies of the effects of state EITC policies on population health. We examined whether state EITC policies affect mental health and health behaviors. Participants were drawn from the 1995-2015 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a diverse national cohort study (N = 10,567). We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine the effects of state EITC programs among eligible individuals, accounting for secular trends among similar individuals in non-EITC states. Outcomes included self-reported general health, psychological distress, alcohol use, and smoking. The mean size of state EITC refunds in our sample was $265 for eligible individuals. In the overall sample, state EITC programs were not associated with any health outcomes of interest. This finding was robust to alternative specifications, and similar in subgroup analyses by gender and marital status. This study suggests that state EITC programs, which tend to provide smaller refunds than the federal program, may not be large enough to have a positive impact on mental health and health behaviors. These findings may inform policymaking related to the generosity of state EITC programs, especially as states seek to address the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Collin, Daniel F; Shields-Zeeman, Laura S; Batra, Akansha; White, Justin S; Tong, Michelle; Hamad, Rita",Soc Sci Med,,63

511422,Up Front,2020,"The pervasive spread of infectious diseases and pandemics, such as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), are becoming increasingly serious and urgent threats to human health. Preventing the spread of such diseases prioritizes the development of sensing devices that can rapidly, selectively, and reliably detect pathogens at minimal cost. Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are promising tools that satisfy those criteria. Numerous paper-based biosensors have been established that rival conventional pathogen detection methods. Among them, colorimetric strategies are promising since results can be interpreted by eye, and are simple to operate, which is advantageous for point-of-care testing (POCT). Particularly, the application of nanomaterials on paper-based biosensors has become important as these materials are capable of converting signals from pathogens through unique mechanisms to yield an amplified colorimetric readout. To highlight the research progress on using nanomaterials in colorimetric paper-based biosensor for pathogen detection, we discuss the sensing mechanisms of how they work, structural and analytical characteristics of the devices, and representative recent applications. Current challenges and future directions of using PADs and nanomaterial-mediated strategies are also discussed.","Nguyen, Quynh Huong; Kim, Moon Il",Trends Analyt Chem,,63

There is major divergence among nations, however, between a ""privacy-first"" approach which protects citizens' data at the cost of extremely limited access for public health authorities and researchers, and a ""data-first"" approach which stores large amounts of data which, while of immeasurable value to epidemiologists and other researchers, may significantly intrude upon citizens' privacy. The lack of a consensus on privacy protection in the contact tracing process creates risks of non-compliance or deliberate obfuscation from citizens who fear revealing private aspects of their lives - a factor greatly exacerbated by recent major scandals over online privacy and the illicit use of citizens' digital information, which have heightened public consciousness of these issues and created significant new challenges for any collection of large-scale public data. While digital contact tracing for COVID-19 remains in its infancy, the lack of consensus around best practices for its implementation and for reassuring citizens of the protection of their privacy may already have impeded its capacity to contribute to the pandemic response.","Fahey, Robert A; Hino, Airo",Int J Inf Manage,,63

To address this gap, we conducted an online study among undergraduate students (n = 366) to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academics, social isolation, and mental health, as well as the extent to which they have been implementing a variety of coping strategies. The pandemic had a more pronounced negative effect on female students' academics, social isolation, stress and mental health compared to male counterparts. Moreover, for females, frequent use of social media as a coping mechanism was associated with greater perceived negative impacts on their academic performance and stress levels, compared to males. However, frequent social media use related to similar negative mental health effects for both males and females. While male and female students both reported using substances to cope, for males the use of cannabis was associated with greater negative impacts on academic outcomes, stress and mental health compared to females.

METHODS: We performed clinical, electrophysiological, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and muscle pathology studies in four SOD1 p.D12Y variant-positive patients. RESULTS: The SOD1 p.D12Y clinical manifestations ranged from a benign phenotype characterized by distal distribution of muscular weakness and long survival to classic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with poor prognosis. Two patients with the distal clinical phenotype showed MRI and muscle pathology alterations indicating a concurrent muscle involvement. In one of these patients significant myopathic changes were associated with rimmed vacuolar pathology. CONCLUSIONS: We expand the clinical spectrum of SOD1 p.D12Y variant, including predominant lower motor neuron forms with long survival and classic forms with aggressive course. Some patients may have concomitant distal myopathy without other explanations. Given clinical, MRI and muscle pathology alterations, SOD1 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of molecularly undefined distal myopathies with rimmed vacuoles.","Tasca, G; Lattante, S; Marangi, G; Conte, A; Bernardo, D; Bisogni, G; Mandich, P; Zollino, M; Ragozzino, E; Udd, B; Sabatelli, M",Eur J Neurol,,63

The AusDiagnostics SARS-CoV-2, Influenza and RSV 8-well assay is used at sixteen UK hospitals and detects part of the ORF8 gene (together with a segment from the ORF1a gene). The objective of this study was to determine if the recently identified mutation in ORF8 (G28048T) in the B.1.1.7. lineage could be used to identify the new variant quickly in clinical cases with PCR positive results. The melt data from SARS-CoV-2 positives from two hospitals (October through December 2020) were reviewed, and distribution over time and location was evaluated. A low melt variant of the ORF8 amplicon started to appear in samples from Guy's and St. Thomas’ NHS Trust, London, at the start of November, and grew as a proportion of the total positives during the subsequent two months. These low melt variants were very rare during the same period at the Northern Care Alliance, Greater Manchester, North West of UK. It was confirmed that these carried the G28048T mutation. The geographic and temporal distribution of the low melt amplicons makes it very likely that these are lineage B.1.1.7 strains. The melt temperature of this amplicon could be used to discriminate between the original and new variants in advance of the full sequencing of the isolate. However, the appearance of other mutations in the same amplicon means that this approach would be of diminishing value over time.","Hale, Richard S.; Green, Ashleigh Cunningham Emma Joel Paul",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,,63

520966,Ambulant erworbene Pneumonie,2021,"Parking demand forecasting and behaviour analysis have received increasing attention in recent years because of their critical role in mitigating traffic congestion and understanding travel behaviours. However, previous studies usually only consider temporal dependence but ignore the spatial correlations among parking lots for parking prediction. This is mainly due to the lack of direct physical connections or observable interactions between them. Thus, how to quantify the spatial correlation remains a significant challenge. To bridge the gap, in this study, we propose a spatial-aware parking prediction framework, which includes two steps, i.e. spatial connection graph construction and spatio-temporal forecasting. A case study in Ningbo, China is conducted using parking data of over one million records before and during COVID-19. The results show that the approach is superior on parking occupancy forecasting than baseline methods, especially for the cases with high temporal irregularity such as during COVID-19. Our work has revealed the impact of the pandemic on parking behaviour and also accentuated the importance of modelling spatial dependence in parking behaviour forecasting, which can benefit future studies on epidemiology and human travel behaviours.","Gong, Shuhui; Mo, Xiaopeng; Cao, Rui; Liu, Yu; Tu, Wei; Bai, Ruibin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07731v1.pdf,63

Here, we propose and demonstrate the concept of dually modulated photonic crystals to realize such lasers, wherein the positions and sizes of the photonic-crystal lattice points are modulated simultaneously. We show using nano-antenna theory that this photonic nanostructure is essential to realize 2D beam scanning lasers with high output power and high beam quality. We also fabricate an on-chip, circuit-driven array of dually modulated photonic-crystal lasers with a 10 × 10 matrix configuration having 100 resolvable points. Our device enables the scanning of laser beams over a wide range of 2D directions in sequence and in parallel, and can be flexibly designed to meet application-specific demands.","Sakata, Ryoichi; Ishizaki, Kenji; De Zoysa, Menaka; Fukuhara, Shin; Inoue, Takuya; Tanaka, Yoshinori; Iwata, Kintaro; Hatsuda, Ranko; Yoshida, Masahiro; Gelleta, John; Noda, Susumu",Nat Commun,,63
522789,Preparation and Characterization of Electromagnetic Shielding Composites Based on Graphene-Nanosheets-Loaded Nonwoven Fabric,2021,"The intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDPRs) are known to be responsible for multiple cellular processes and are associated with many chronic diseases. In viruses, the existence of a disordered proteome is also proven and is related to its conformational dynamics inside the host. The SARS-CoV-2 has a large proteome, in which, structure and functions of all proteins are not known yet, along with non-structural protein 11 (nsp11). In this study, we have performed extensive experimentation on nsp11. Our results based on the CD spectroscopy gives characteristic disordered spectrum for IDPs. Further, we investigated the conformational behavior of nsp11 in the presence of membrane mimetic environment, &#945;-helix inducer, and natural osmolyte. In the presence of negatively charged and neutral liposomes, nsp11 remains disordered. However, with SDS micelle, it adopted an &#945;-helical conformation, suggesting the helical propensity of nsp11. Finally, we again confirmed the IDP behavior of nsp11 using MD simulations. In future, this conformational dynamic study could help to clarify its functional importance in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gadhave, Kundlik; Kumar, Prateek; Kumar, Ankur; Bhardwaj, Taniya; Garg, Neha; Giri, Rajanish",Microb Pathog,,63

One of the categories heavily affected by the lockdown were patients with dystonia. Objective. To assess the impact of botulinum toxin (BoNT) injection therapy discontinuation on the physical status and quality of life (QoL) of patients suffering from dystonia. Methods. A questionnaire was applied between April 1 stand April 15 th, 2020 to a group of 50 dystonia patients that met the inclusion criteria for this study. Results. The majority of the respondents (92%) indicated that their greatest issue during SARS-CoV-2 lockdown was the lack of access to regular BoNT injections. Over 50% of respondents stated that they experienced atypical physical pain, followed by the inability to perform usual activities, with further impact on the QoL. Alteration of the physical status due to the inability to follow an in-clinic rehabilitation program was also reported by up to 25% of patients. In 10% of patients, dystonia became more severe, and led to further afflictions, with a great impact on their QoL. Younger dystonia participants registered lower QoL scores than older participants. Furthermore, isolation and income reduction were found to cause a moderate impact on QoL in most patients and may be associated with mild to moderate forms of depression. Conclusion. The healthcare field must work to ensure that all these patients have access to their regular treatment plan in a safe environment. Meanwhile, recommendations should be made for these individuals to follow an adequate physical therapy program at home.","Barbu, Madalina-Gabriela; Thompson, Dana-Claudia; Popescu, Marius Nicolae; Beiu, Cristina; Mihai, Mara-Madalina; Enachescu, Catalin-Ionel",Rom.

OnTrackNY is a nationally recognized model of CSC treatment in New York state. In 2019, OnTrackNY was awarded a hub within the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) to advance its learning health care system (LHS). The OnTrackNY network is comprised of 23 CSC teams across New York state. OnTrack Central, an intermediary organization, provides training and implementation support to OnTrackNY teams. OnTrack Central coordinates a centralized data collection protocol for quality improvement and evaluation of program fidelity and a mechanism to support practice based-research. OnTrackNY sites’ breadth coupled with OnTrack Central oversight provides an opportunity to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in New York State, and supplementary funding was awarded to the OnTrackNY EPINET hub in 2021 for that purpose. METHODS: This project will examine the implications of modifications to service delivery within the OnTrackNY LHS during and after the COVID-19 crisis. We will use the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modification-Enhanced (FRAME) to classify systematically, code, and analyze modifications to CSC services and ascertain their impact. We will utilize integrative mixed methods. Qualitative interviews with multi-level stakeholders (program participants, families, providers, team leaders, agency leaders, trainers (OnTrack Central), and decision-makers at the state and local levels) will be used to understand the process of making decisions, information about modifications to CSC services, and their impact. Analysis of OnTrackNY program data will facilitate examining trends in team staffing and functioning, and participant service utilization and outcomes. Study findings will be summarized in a CSC Model Adaptation Guide, which will identify modifications as fidelity consistent or not, and their impact on service utilization and care outcomes. DISCUSSION: A CSC Model Adaptation Guide will inform CSC programs, and the state and local mental health authorities to which they are accountable, regarding modifications to CSC services and the impact of these changes on care process, and participant service utilization and outcomes. The guide will also inform the development of tailored technical assistance that CSC programs may need within OnTrackNY, the EPINET network, and CSC programs nationally.

593738,Perspectives on virtual interviews-A follow-up study of the Comprehensive Endocrine Surgery Fellowship interview process,2021,"Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S – insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complimentary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.","Bagdonaite, Ieva; Thompson, Andrew J.; Wang, Xiaoning; Søgaard, Max; Fougeroux, Cyrielle; Frank, Martin; Diedrich, Jolene K.; Yates, John R.; Salanti, Ali; Vakhrushev, Sergey Y.; Paulson, James C.; Wandall, Hans H.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564762/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.429627,63
594944,Open data in a deeply connected world,2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Nutrition is not a treatment for COVID-19, but it is a modifiable contributor to the development of chronic disease, which is highly associated with COVID-19 severe illness and deaths. A well-balanced diet and healthy patterns of eating strengthen the immune system, improve immunometabolism, and reduce the risk of chronic disease and infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effect of diet, nutrition, obesity, and their implications for COVID-19 mortality among 188 countries by using new statistical marginalized two-part models. METHODS: We globally evaluated the distribution of diet and nutrition at the national level while considering the variations between different World Health Organization regions. The effects of food supply categories and obesity on (as well as associations with) the number of deaths and the number of recoveries were reported globally by estimating coefficients and conducting color maps. RESULTS: The findings show that a 1% increase in supplementation of pulses reduced the odds of having a zero death by 4-fold (OR 4.12, 95% CI 11.97-1.42). In addition, a 1% increase in supplementation of animal products and meat increased the odds of having a zero death by 1.076-fold (OR 1.076, 95% CI 1.01-1.15) and 1.13-fold (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.0-1.28), respectively. Tree nuts reduced the odds of having a zero death, and vegetables increased the number of deaths. Globally, the results also showed that populations (countries) who consume more eggs, cereals excluding beer, spices, and stimulants had the greatest impact on the recovery of patients with COVID-19. In addition, populations that consume more meat, vegetal products, sugar and sweeteners, sugar crops, animal fats, and animal products were associated with more death and less recoveries in patients. The effect of consuming sugar products on mortality was considerable, and obesity has affected increased death rates and reduced recovery rates. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are differences in dietary patterns, overall, unbalanced diets are a health threat across the world and not only affect death rates but also the quality of life. To achieve the best results in preventing nutrition-related pandemic diseases, strategies and policies should fully recognize the essential role of both diet and obesity in determining good nutrition and optimal health. Policies and programs must address the need for change at the individual level and make modifications in society and the environment to make healthier choices accessible and preferable.","Kamyari, Naser; Soltanian, Ali Reza; Mahjub, Hossein; Moghimbeigi, Abbas",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439850/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22717,63

Till date, there is no licensed vaccine of EBOV is available in the market; however, the world is increasingly vulnerable to this emerging threat. Hence, it is the need of time to develop a vaccine for EBOV to hinder its dissemination. The current study has been designed for identification and characterization of the potential B and T-cell epitopes using the Immuno-informatics tools, and it helped in finding the potent vaccine candidates against EBOV. Prediction, antigenicity and allergenicity testing of predicted B and T cells' epitopes was done as well to identify their potential as a vaccine candidate and to measure their safety level respectively. Among B-cell epitopes “WIPAGIGVTGVIIA” showed a high antigenicity score and it would play an important role in evoking the immune response. In T-cell epitopes, peptides “AIGLAWIPY” and “IRGFPRCRY” presented high antigenicity score, which binds to MHC class-I and MHC class-II alleles respectively. All predicted epitopes were analyzed and compared with already reported peptides carefully. Comparatively, Peptides predicted in the present study showed more immunogenicity score than already reported peptides, used as positive control, and are more immunogenic as compared to them. Peptides reported in the present study do not target only Zaire EBOV (ZEBOV), as in previous studies, but also other species, i.e. Tai Forest EBOV (TAFV), Sudan EBOV (SUDV), Bundibugyo EBOV (BDBV), and Reston EBOV (RESTV) and would bring the promising results as potent vaccine candidates.","Ahmad, Bilal; Ashfaq, Usman Ali; Rahman, Mahmood-ur; Masoud, Muhammad Shareef; Yousaf, Muhammad Zubair",Microb Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075428/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.05.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401018306053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401018306053,63
599145,Vaccines for the twenty-first century society,2011-11-04,"More than 60% of the 1,700 infectious diseases that affect human come from animals and zoonotic pandemics, after starting from sporadic phenomena limited to rural areas, have become a global emergency. The repeated and frequent zoonotic outbreaks such as the most recent COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed also to human activities. In particular, the creation of enormous intensive domestic animal farms, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the destruction of forests, the consumption of the meat of wild animals and the illegal animal trade are all factors causing the insurgence and the transmission of zoonotic diseases from animals to humans. The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge of the One Health concept including the zoonotic risk potentially derived from illegally traded pet animals and wildlife among adolescents in 6 different countries (Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, Mauritius, and Japan). A representative sample of 656 students was recruited and all participants took an anonymous questionnaire. Data were analyzed by ANOVAs to estimate the prevalence of correct health prevention behaviors and to identify the influential factors for these behaviors. After two theoretical-practical lectures, the same anonymous questionnaire was administered for the second time in order to assess the efficacy of the program. The proportion of students who did not know that many diseases affecting humans come from animals is 28.96% while 32.16% of them did not know what a zoonosis is. The circularity of the One Health concept related to the transmission of diseases from animals to humans and vice-versa is not understood from a large prevalence of the adolescents with 31.40 and 59.91% of wrong responses, respectively. Furthermore, rabies is not considered as a dangerous disease by 23.02% of the adolescents. After two theoretical-practical classroom sessions, the correct answers improved to 21.92% according to the different question. More than a third of the student cohort investigated showed a profound ignorance of the zoonotic risks and a poor understanding of the One Health concept. The authors believe that the teaching of health prevention with a One Health approach and a practical training should be included in every school curriculum.","Zucca, Paolo; Rossmann, Marie-Christin; Dodic, Mitja; Ramma, Yashwantrao; Matsushima, Toshiya; Seet, Steven; Holtze, Susanne; Bremini, Alessandro; Fischinger, Ingrid; Morosetti, Giulia; Sitzia, Marcello; Furlani, Roberto; Greco, Oronzo; Meddi, Giulio; Zambotto, Paolo; Meo, Fabiola; Pulcini, Serena; Palei, Manlio; Zamaro, Gianna",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869135/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.658876,63

We used plaque reduction neutralization testing as the reference standard to evaluate the diagnostic performance of six commercial serologic tests for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Euroimmun ELISA anti-spike 1 IgG, Euroimmun anti-spike 1 IgG QuantiVac ELISA, Elecsys Anti-nucleocapsid protein total antibodies, Elecsys Anti-receptor-binding domain total antibodies, VIDAS anti-spike subdomain IgG, and Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG assay were performed on 228 sera from 89 healthcare workers who participated in a six-month seroprevalence survey. Although all immunoassays demonstrated similar performances, VIDAS SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Euroimmun QuantiVac IgG (area under the curve 0.96 and 0.95 respectively) showed the better ability to detect Nabs. Except for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assays, the commercial serologic tests evaluated here showed a significant decrease of antibody titers in the 6-month follow-up samples. Depending on the immunoassay, 21% to 33% of the participants became seronegative, and 16.9% had a loss of neutralizing antibodies. Microblot-Array assay results showed cross-reactivity with HCoVNL63 in only one sample, and this sample showed SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity. In conclusion, our results support the use of VIDAS SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA IgG and Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG assays to monitor neutralizing antibody response following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. These immunoassays could facilitate the prediction of post-vaccine protection in the long term and the allocation of booster doses.","Montesinos, Isabel; Dahma, Hafid; Wolff, Fleur; Dauby, Nicolas; Delaunoy, Sabrina; Wuyts, Magaly; Detemmerman, Cedric; Duterme, Cecile; Vandenberg, Olivier; Martin, Charlotte; Hallin, Marie",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607239/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104988; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221002559?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221002559,63
607654,"Antibacterial, Antifungal and Ecotoxic Effects of Ammonium and Imidazolium Ionic Liquids Synthesized in Microwaves",2020-11-06,"Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behaviour of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses.","Duchene, Sebastian; Lemey, Philippe; Stadler, Tanja; Ho, Simon YW; Duchene, David A; Dhanasekaran, Vijaykrishna; Baele, Guy",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/810697,63

The sdAbs targeting the cleavage site (CS) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein efficiently neutralised the infectivity of a pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV2 S protein. Anti-CS sdAb blocked the virus infectivity by inhibiting proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV2 S protein. Both the sdAbs retained characteristic structure within the pH range of 2 to 12 and remained stable upto 65°C. Furthermore, structural disruptions induced by a high temperature in both the sdAbs were largely reversed upon their gradual cooling and the resulting products neutralised the reporter virus. Our results therefore suggest that targeting CS in addition to the RBD of S protein by sdAbs could serve as a viable option to reduce SARS-CoV2 infectivity and that proteolytic processing of the viral S protein is critical for infection.","Singh, Sudhakar; Dahiya, Surbhi; Singh, Yuviana J.; Beeton, Komal; Jain, Ayush; Sarkar, Roman; Dubey, Abhishek; Tehseen, Syed Azeez; Sehrawat, Sharvan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.426537,63

So far, no specific antiviral therapeutic agent has been demonstrated to be effective for COVID‐19; therefore, the clinical management is largely supportive and depends on the patients' immune response leading to a cytokine storm followed by lung edema, dysfunction of air exchange, and ARDS, which could lead to multiorgan failure and death. Given that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various tissue sources have revealed successful clinical outcomes in many immunocompromised disorders by inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the microenvironment, there is a growing demand for MSC infusions in patients with COVID‐19‐related ARDS in the ICU. In this review, we have documented the rationale and possible outcomes of compassionate use of MSCs, particularly in patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infections, toward proving or disproving the efficacy of this approach in the near future. Many centers have registered and approved, and some already started, single‐case or phase I/II trials primarily aiming to rescue their critical patients when no other therapeutic approach responds. On the other hand, it is also very important to mention that there is a good deal of concern about clinics offering unproven stem cell treatments for COVID‐19.

610412,Understanding the spreading patterns of mobile phone viruses,2009-06-24,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are associated with respiratory viruses. The most common agent causing viral infections in patients with CF before the age of 3 years is respiratory syncytial virus. OBJECTIVES: To obtain the prevalence of the different types of viral infection in CF patients and to identify its relation with the type of bacterial infection, (CFTR) mutations and pulmonary function test (PFT). METHODOLOGY: A retrospective charts review of 387 patients with CF of all age groups who were screened for the detection of viruses during respiratory exacerbation from the period of January 1, 1984 to June 1, 2016. RESULTS: A total of 159 CF patients had pulmonary exacerbation and had viral PCR obtained. Fifty-eight patients (36%) had positive viral PCR. Males were more commonly infected in 30/58 patients (52%) compared to females in 28 patients (48%). Forty-five of 58 patients (78%) were alive and 13 patients (22%) died. Rhinovirus was the most frequently reported viral PCR in 33/74 sample (45%). Out of 74 viral PCR, 41 (55.4%) were during the colder seasons (October–February) and 33 (44.5%) during the warmer seasons (March–September). During viral infection and viral recurrence, there was an increase in bacterial colonization specifically of H. influenza and staphylococcus aureus. The most common CFTR mutation for the CF viral infection is: 3120+1G>A in Intron 16 in 11/57 patients (19%). The Eastern Province had the highest viral infection of 24 out of 57 patients (42%). Follow-up PFT post viral infection showed no significant difference in the type and the severity of PFT compared to the initial PFT during the viral illness. CONCLUSION: Viral infections contributed to the increase in morbidity and mortality of CF patients in our population, and rhinovirus was the most common causative agent. Viral infections and viral recurrence increased the prevalence of bacterial infection of specific pathogens such as H. influenza and S. aureus. Physicians should be aware to prevent progressive lung damage in CF patients by treating the concomitant viral and bacterial infections. Viral infection may be associated with some common CFTR mutations.","Banjar, Hanaa; Chaballout, Mohammad; Karkour, Kawthar; Al-Ghamdi, Hadeel; Al-Mogarri, Ibrahim; Al-Haider, Sami; Nizami, Imran; Raja, Rawia; AlNakhli, Ali",Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292813/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352646718302138; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpam.2019.09.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352646718302138,63

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is one condition where relatively few cytotoxic immune cells target skin stem cells to produce significant morbidity and mortality. By analogy, SARS-CoV-2 is a vector that initially homes to pulmonary stem cells that preferentially express the ACE2 receptor, thus potentially incurring similarly robust pathological consequences. In older individuals, stem cell number and/or function become depleted due to pathways independent of disease-related injury to these subpopulations. Accordingly, pathologic targeting of stem cells in conditions like aGVHD and COVID-19 infection where these cells are already deficient due to the aging process may have dire consequences in elderly individuals. A hypothesis is herein advanced that, as with aGVHD, lung stem cell targeting is a potential co-factor in explaining age-related severity of COVID-19 infection.","Murphy, George F.",Lab Invest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299126/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-020-00520-2,63

In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between chronic use of RAAS inhibitors and in-hospital adverse events among hypertensive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled 349 consecutive hypertensive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. All patients were chronically on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or other antihypertensive therapies before hospital admission. Adverse clinical events were defined as in-hospital mortality, admission to intensive care unit, need for high-flow oxygen and intubation. RESULTS: Patients were categorized into two groups according to the type of antihypertensive therapy. (ACEI/ARBs users, N=201; ACEI/ARB nonusers, N=148) There was no statistically significant difference between ACEI/ARBs users and ACEI/ARBs nonusers concerning adverse clinical events, such as in-hospital mortality (29 (14.4%) vs. 20 (13.5%), p=0.81), ICU admission (45(22.4%) vs. 27 (18.2%), p=0.34), need for high-flow oxygen (97 (48.3%) vs. 68 (45.9%), p=0.67) and need for intubation (32(15.9%) vs. 23(15.5%), p=0.92), respectively. Also, the severity of infection did not differ among groups. The logistic regression multivariate analysis showed that age, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, procalcitonin and ferritin levels were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that chronic use of ACEI/ARBs did not increase in-hospital adverse outcomes of hypertensive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Although the recent data are contradictory, chronic ACEI/ARB therapy is not recommended to be discontinued in hypertensive patients during their hospitalization for COVID-19.","Cetinkal, Gokhan; Kocas, Betul Balaban; Ser, Ozgur Selim; Kilci, Hakan; Yildiz, Suleyman Sezai; Ozcan, Safiye Nur; Verdi, Yildiz; Altinay, Mustafa; Kilickesmez, Kadriye",Sisli Etfal Hastan Tip Bul,https://doi.org/10.14744/semb.2020.15689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364877/,63

RESULTS: We identified 242 relevant documents which included 430 patients with COVID-19 who had acute neurological symptoms prompting CSF testing. Of those, 321 (75%) patients had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). Of 303 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, there were 16 (5%) whose test was positive, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). The majority (12/16, 75%) of these patients were admitted to the hospital because of neurological symptoms. Of 58 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 7 (12%) had positive antibodies with evidence of intrathecal synthesis, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the CNS.

For coronaviruses, this critical step is governed by the virally-encoded spike (S) protein, a class I viral fusion protein that has several unique features. Coronavirus entry is unusual in that it is often biphasic in nature, and can occur at or near the cell surface or in late endosomes. Recent advances in structural, biochemical and molecular biology of the coronavirus S protein has shed light on the intricacies of coronavirus entry, in particular the molecular triggers of coronavirus S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, characterization of the coronavirus fusion peptide (FP), the segment of the fusion protein that inserts to a target lipid bilayer during membrane fusion, has revealed its particular attributes which imparts some of the unusual properties of the S protein, such as Ca(2+)-dependency. These unusual characteristics can explain at least in part the biphasic nature of coronavirus entry.

The logistic model, adjusted by age, lobular involvement score and lymphocyte cell count, could be applied for assessing the severity of Covid‐19 (AUC, 0.903; Sensitivity, 90.9%; Specificity, 78.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Age >60 years old, chronic comorbidities, lymphocytopoenia and lobular involvement score were associated with the Covid‐19 severity. The inflammation induced by Covid‐19 caused myocardial injury with elevated BNP and cTnI level and abnormal electrocardiograms.","Huang, Jiana; Gao, Jiebing; Zhu, Wenliang; Feng, Ruiling; Liu, Qianru; Chen, Xiumin; Huang, Jingmin; Yang, Zhe; Lin, Xiufang; Zhang, Zuoquan; Lin, Yubi",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170611/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14571,63

Here, we integrated a genome-wide association study of COVID-19 hospitalization (7,885 cases and 961,804 controls from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative) with mRNA expression, splicing, and protein levels (n=18,502). We identified 27 genes related to inflammation and coagulation pathways whose genetically predicted expression was associated with COVID-19 hospitalization. We functionally characterized the 27 genes using phenome- and laboratory-wide association scans in Vanderbilt Biobank (BioVU; n=85,460) and identified coagulation-related clinical symptoms, immunologic, and blood-cell-related biomarkers.

To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.","Xu, Hao; Zhong, Liang; Deng, Jiaxin; Peng, Jiakuan; Dan, Hongxia; Zeng, Xin; Li, Taiwen; Chen, Qianming",Int J Oral Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094336/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-020-0074-x,63

624195,Additive Manufacturing of Plastics Used for Protection against COVID19—The Influence of Chemical Disinfection by Alcohol on the Properties of ABS and PETG Polymers,2021-08-25,"COVID-19 patients can excrete viable SARS-CoV-2 virus via urine and faeces, which has raised concerns over the possibility of COVID-19 transmission via aerosolized contaminated water or via the faecal-oral route. These concerns are especially exacerbated in many low- and middle-income countries, where untreated sewage is frequently discharged to surface waters. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in river water (RW) and raw wastewater (WW) samples. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 viability in these environmental matrices. Determining the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water under different environmental conditions is of great importance for basic assumptions in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). In this study, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using plaque assays following spiking of RW and WW samples with infectious SARS-CoV-2 that was previously isolated from a COVID-19 patient. These assays were carried out on autoclaved RW and WW samples, filtered (0.22 µm) and unfiltered, at 4°C and 24°C. Linear and nonlinear regression models were adjusted to the data. The Weibull regression model achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and was hence chosen to estimate T(90) and T(99) (time required for 1 log and 2 log reductions, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 remained viable longer in filtered compared with unfiltered samples. RW and WW showed T(90) values of 1.9 and 1.2 day and T(99) values of 6.4 and 4.0 days, respectively. When samples were filtered through 0.22 µm pore size membranes, T(90) values increased to 3.3 and 1.5 days, and T(99) increased to 8.5 and 4.5 days, for RW and WW samples, respectively. Remarkable increases in SARS-CoV-2 persistence were observed in assays at 4°C, which showed T(90) values of 7.7 and 5.5 days, and T(99) values of 18.7 and 17.5 days for RW and WW, respectively. These results highlight the variability of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in water and wastewater matrices and can be highly relevant to efforts aimed at quantifying water-related risks, which could be valuable for understanding and controlling the pandemic.","de Oliveira, Leonardo Camilo; Torres-Franco, Andrés Felipe; Lopes, Bruna Coelho; Santos, Beatriz Senra Álvares da Silva; Costa, Erica Azevedo; Costa, Michelle S.; Reis, Marcus Tulius P.; Melo, Marília C.; Polizzi, Rodrigo Bicalho; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Mota, César R.",Water Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135421002001?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135421002001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714910/,63

Using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA), the pooled data analysis process was performed. Results A total of 15 eligible articles were enrolled in the current quantitative synthesis. The statistical analysis showed that clinical improvement in the group of patients who had received convalescent plasma was significantly increased compared to the control group (OR: 2.23; 1.12-4.45 with 95% CIs; p value: 0.022; Q-value: 6.11; I 2 : 83.64; Eggers p value: 0.064; Beggs p value: 0.093).

The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus' spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model.

Prior work has demonstrated that a visual scoring system applied to chest radiographs (CXR) is associated with adverse outcomes in ICU patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative CXR score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general ICU population, regardless of underlying diagnosis. METHODS: All individuals enrolled in the Registry of Critical Illness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital between June 2008 and August 2018 who had a CXR within 24 h of admission were included. Each patient’s CXR was assigned an opacification score of 0–4 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. Multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and APACHE II scores, were used to assess the total score’s association with ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 560 patients were included. Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05–1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07–1.17, p < 0.001). CXR scores were also independently associated with both ICU length of stay (rate ratio 1.06, CI 1.04–1.07, p < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (rate ratio 1.05, CI 1.02–1.07, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher values on a simple visual score of a patient’s CXR on admission to the medical ICU are associated with increased in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, overall mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.","Mason, Stefanie E.; Dieffenbach, Paul B.; Englert, Joshua A.; Rogers, Angela A.; Massaro, Anthony F.; Fredenburgh, Laura E.; Higuera, Angelica; Pinilla-Vera, Mayra; Vilas, Marta; San Jose Estepar, Raul; Washko, George R.; Baron, Rebecca M.; Ash, Samuel Y.",Respir Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1201-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606045/,63

Dosing is usually guided by therapeutic drug monitoring adjusted to target trough levels of CNIs to keep the balance between over-dose causing severe toxicity and increased risk of infections or under-dose with a risk of graft injury. Adaptation of CNI-based immunosuppression by monitoring of torque teno virus (TTV), a latent nonpathogenic DNA virus, measured in the whole blood in addition to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring may reduce the toxicity of immunosuppression with similar efficacy. METHODS/DESIGN: An open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial in lung transplant recipients will be conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of immunosuppression guided by TTV monitoring as an add-on to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring. Adult lung transplant recipients 21 to 42 days after transplantation are eligible to participate. Patients (N = 144) will be randomized 1:1 to the experimental intervention (arm 1: immunosuppression guided by TTV monitoring in addition to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus trough levels) and control intervention (arm 2: conventional therapeutic drug monitoring). Outcomes will be assessed 12 months after randomization with the change in glomerular filtration rate as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints will be additional measurements of renal function, allograft function, incidence of acute rejections, incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, graft loss, and infections.

633233,Coloring ultrasensitive MRI with tunable metal–organic frameworks,2021-02-09,"We analysed the patterns of genetic variability of eastern Mediterranean populations of the scleractinian coral Cladocora caespitosa, from the Aegean and Levantine seas, using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, 11 of which were newly characterized. The observed genetic pattern reflects a scenario of isolation by environment: F(ST) comparisons showed a higher degree of genetic differentiation between the two Cypriot populations that are separated by only 11 km than between these two Levantine populations and the Aegean population in Greece, which are separated by 1300 km. We hypothesize that local-scale oceanographic factors influenced the dispersal of planulae between the geographically close populations, playing a crucial role in the genetic structure of this coastal coral. Yet, despite being characterized as a species with limited dispersal and high self-recruitment, large-scale migration does eventually occur as first-generation migrants were identified between the most distant populations. In line with previous findings of reproductive plasticity in C. caespitosa, we also found localized differences in reproduction mode (sexual vs. asexual) within a geographically limited context. Several individuals were identified as clones, indicating the predominance of asexual reproduction in one of the Cypriot populations. We interpret this predominance either as a direct response to or as an indirect consequence of perturbations suffered by this C. caespitosa population. These perturbations are caused by unfavourable environmental conditions that threatened local survival, in particular water temperature changes and windstorm swells. Asexual reproduction may be a mechanism used by C. caespitosa to counteract mortality events and recolonize devastated areas, and likely accounts for the occasional high levels of clonality and low levels of genetic diversity. Local adaptations such as these should therefore be considered in conservation and management strategies to maintain and preserve the gene pool of this endangered species.

Most of them are not prepared to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: A coordinated on-site medicalization program (MP) in response to a sizeable COVID-19 outbreak in four nursing homes was organized, with the objectives of improving survival, offering humanistic palliative care to residents in their natural environment, and reducing hospital referrals. Ten key processes and interventions were established (provision of informatics infrastructure, medical equipment, and human resources, universal testing, separation of 'clean' and 'contaminated' areas, epidemiological surveys, and unified protocols stratifying for active or palliative care approach, among others). Main outcomes were a composite endpoint of survival or optimal palliative care (SOPC), survival, and referral to hospital. RESULTS: 272 out of 457 (59.5%) residents and 85 out of 320 (26.5%) staff members were affected. The SOPC, survival, and referrals to hospital, occurred in 77%, 72.5%, and 29% of patients diagnosed before MP start, with respect to 97%, 83.7% and 17% of those diagnosed during the program, respectively. The SOPC was independently associated to MP (OR=15 [3-81]); and survival in patients stratified to active approach, to the use of any antiviral treatment (OR=28 [5-160]).

Mass screening of the asymptomatic general population has been established as a priority strategy by carrying out diagnostic tests to detect possible cases, isolate contacts, cut transmission chains and thus limit the spread of the virus. Objective: To evaluate the economic impact of mass COVID-19 screenings of an asymptomatic population during the first and second wave of the epidemic in Catalonia, Spain. Methodology: Cost-Benefit Analysis based on the estimated total costs of mass screening versus health gains and associated health costs avoided. Results: Excluding the value of monetized health, the Benefit-Cost ratio was estimated at 0.45, a low value that would seem to advise against mass screening policies. However, if monetized health is included, the ratio is close to 1.20, reversing the interpretation. In other words, the monetization of health is the critical element that tips the scales in favour of the desirability of screening. Results show that the interventions with the highest return are those that maximize the percentage of positives detected. Conclusion: Efficient management of resources for the policy of mass screening in asymptomatic populations can generate high social returns. The positivity rate critically determines its desirability. Likewise, precocity in the detection of cases will cut more transmissions in the chain of contagion and increase the economic return of these interventions. Maximizing the value of resources depends on screening strategies being accompanied by contact-tracing and specific in their focus, targeting, for example, high-risk subpopulations with the highest rate of expected positives.","López Seguí, Francesc; Estrada Cuxart, Oriol; Mitjà i Villar, Oriol; Hernández Guillamet, Guillem; Prat Gil, Núria; Maria Bonet, Josep; Isnard Blanchar, Mar; Moreno Millan, Nemesio; Blanco, Ignacio; Vilar Capella, Marc; Català Sabaté, Martí; Aran Solé, Anna; Argimon Pallàs, Josep Maria; Clotet, Bonaventura; Ara del Rey, Jordi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209328/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137028,63
637198,Intervention decision model to prevent spiking mortality of turkeys,1998-07-01,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive disease harboring significant morbidity and mortality despite recent advances in therapy. Regardless of disease severity acute exacerbations (IPF-AEs) may occur leading to considerable loss of function and are the leading cause of death in IPF. Histologic features of IPF-AE are very similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IPF and IPF-AE. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells were sampled from patients with IPF (n = 32), IPF-AE (n = 10), ARDS (n = 7) and healthy volunteers (HV, n = 37) and the NLRP3-inflammasome was stimulated in-vitro. We found the NLRP3 inflammasome to be hyper-inducible in IPF compared to HV with increased IL-1ß and pro-IL-1ß levels on ELISA upon stimulation as well as increased caspase-1 activity measured by caspase-1p20 immunoblotting. In IPF-AE, IL-1ß was massively elevated to an extent similar to ARDS. To evaluate potential mechanisms, we co-cultured BAL cells with radiated A549 cells (a model to simulate apoptotic alveolar epithelial cells), which led to increased NLRP3 mRNA expression and increased caspase-1 dependent IL-1ß production. In the presence of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor (diphenyleneiodonium) and a cathepsin B inhibitor (E64D), NLRP3 expression was suppressed indicating that induction of NLRP3 activation following efferocytosis of apoptotic A549 cells is mediated via ROS and cathepsin-B. In summary, we present evidence of involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome-caspase pathway in the pathogenesis of IPF-AE, similarly to ARDS, which may be mediated by efferocytosis of apoptotic alveolar epithelial cells in IPF.","Jäger, Benedikt; Seeliger, Benjamin; Terwolbeck, Oliver; Warnecke, Gregor; Welte, Tobias; Müller, Meike; Bode, Christian; Prasse, Antje",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968032/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.642855,63

There have been endless reports on the mechanism, prevention, and cure of comorbidity because of its high incidence and poor prognosis and the increased burden on the family and society. There may be a specific comorbid basis and causal relationship between depression and metabolic diseases. Depression in patients with metabolic disorders can be effectively alleviated through psychotherapy and medication. The timely and effective treatment of depression can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with metabolic disorders, reduce their psychological burden, and promote the effective treatment of metabolic diseases.

METHODS: This national Finnish register‐based study was based on laboratory‐confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infections, MIS‐C and Kawasaki disease cases. We performed a time series analysis on the occurrence of Kawasaki disease in 2016–2020. RESULTS: In 2020, there were 5170 laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 cases in children under 18 years of age and five fulfilled the MIS‐C case definition. The occurrence of MIS‐C was 0.97 per 1000 (95% confidence interval: 0.31‐2.26) laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in children. Our time series analysis showed that Kawasaki disease cases decreased during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The seasonally adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval: 0.32‐0.74) when it was compared to pre‐pandemic levels. This coincided with a reduced occurrence of respiratory infections, due to social distancing in the population. CONCLUSION: This nationwide register‐based study found that MIS‐C was a rare complication of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The occurrence of Kawasaki disease and respiratory infections decreased during the pandemic. This suggests that transmissible microbes may play an important role in Kawasaki disease and social distancing may have a protective effect.","Koskela, Ulla; Helve, Otto; Sarvikivi, Emmi; Helminen, Merja; Nieminen, Tea; Peltola, Ville; Renko, Marjo; Saxén, Harri; Pasma, Hanna; Pokka, Tytti; Honkila, Minna; Tapiainen, Terhi",Acta Paediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331326/; https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.16051,63

Pour autant, la caractérisation de l’impact de la pandémie est potentiellement biaisée par les méthodes de surveillances basées sur les données de dépistage en laboratoire et sur le nombre d’hospitalisations du fait de possible difficultés d’accès aux soins de cette population. Cette étude de cohorte a pour objectif d’estimer la prévalence et les facteurs associés à l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 chez les personnes en situation de sans-abrisme. Matériels et méthodes Les personnes adultes vivant à la rue, en squat/bidonville, hébergement d’urgence, hôtel de mise à l’abri ou centre d’hébergement et de réinsertion sociale de la ville de Marseille ont été invitées à participer à l’étude. Un questionnaire et un test rapide sérologique ont été administrés de juin à début août puis de septembre à décembre 2020. Pour chaque période les résultats incidents des PCR à SARS-CoV-2 étaient également rapportés. Une analyse de survie avec courbe de Kaplan–Meier ainsi qu’un modèle de Cox multivarié a été réalisé afin d’évaluer les facteurs associés à l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2. Résultats Au total, 1249 participants ont été inclus. La séroprévalence était de 6,01 % [4,68–7,34] entre juin et août et de 18,86 % [16,00–21,72] entre septembre et décembre (p <0,005).

641929,Outcomes of the First Virtual General Surgery Certifying Exam of the American Board of Surgery.,2021-06-24,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in renin-angiotensin system regulation and amino acid homeostasis. Human ACE2 acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is also widely expressed in epithelial cells of lungs, heart, kidney and pancreas. It is considered an important drug target for treating SARS-CoV-2, as well as pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension, renal diseases and diabetes. Despite the critical importance, the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2 receptor remains unknown. Here, we address this challenge through all-atom simulations using a novel ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) method. Microsecond LiGaMD simulations have successfully captured both binding and unbinding of the MLN-4760 inhibitor in the ACE2 receptor. In the ligand unbound state, the ACE2 receptor samples distinct Open, Partially Open and Closed conformations. Ligand binding biases the receptor conformational ensemble towards the Closed state. The LiGaMD simulations thus suggest a conformational selection mechanism for ligand recognition by the ACE2 receptor. Our simulation findings are expected to facilitate rational drug design of ACE2 against coronaviruses and other related human diseases.","Bhattarai, Apurba; Pawnikar, Shristi; Miao, Yinglong",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140043/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.362749,63

METHODS: Perfusion image was generated from EIT-based impedance–time curves caused by 10 ml 10% NaCl injection during a respiratory hold. Ventilation image was captured before the breath holding period under regular mechanical ventilation. DeadSpace(%), Shunt(%) and VQMatch(%) were calculated based on lung perfusion and ventilation images. Ventilation and perfusion maps were divided into four cross-quadrants (lower left and right, upper left and right). Regional distribution defects of each quadrant were scored as 0 (distribution% ≥ 15%), 1 (15% > distribution% ≥ 10%) and 2 (distribution% < 10%). Data percentile distributions in the control group and clinical simplicity were taken into consideration when defining the scores. Overall defect scores (Defect(V), Defect(Q) and Defect(V+Q)) were the sum of four cross-quadrants of the corresponding images. RESULTS: A total of 108 ICU patients were prospectively included: 93 with ARF and 15 without as a control. PaO(2)/FiO(2) was significantly correlated with VQMatch(%) (r = 0.324, P = 0.001). Three broad etiologies of ARF were identified based on clinical judgment: pulmonary embolism-related disease (PED, n = 14); diffuse lung involvement disease (DLD, n = 21) and focal lung involvement disease (FLD, n = 58). The PED group had a significantly higher DeadSpace(%) [40(24)% vs. 14(15)%, PED group vs. the rest of the subjects; median(interquartile range); P < 0.0001] and Defect(Q) score than the other groups [1(1) vs. 0(1), PED vs. the rest; P < 0.0001]. The DLD group had a significantly lower Defect(V+Q) score than the PED and FLD groups [0(1) vs. 2.5(2) vs. 3(3), DLD vs. PED vs. FLD; P < 0.0001]. The FLD group had a significantly higher Defect(V) score than the other groups [2(2) vs. 0(1), FLD vs. the rest; P < 0.0001]. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) for using DeadSpace(%) to identify PED was 0.894 in all ARF patients. The AUC for using the Defect(V+Q) score to identify DLD was 0.893. The AUC for using the Defect(V) score to identify FLD was 0.832.

645218,A general model for the demographic signatures of the transition from pandemic emergence to endemicity,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are potentially a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, because of physiologic immune suppression in pregnancy. However, data on the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 among pregnant women, compared to nonpregnant women, are sparse and inconclusive. We sought to assess the impact of pregnancy on COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, with particular attention to the impact of pre-existing comorbidity. METHODS: We used retrospective data from January through June 2020 on female patients aged 18–44 years old utilizing the Cerner COVID-19 de-identified cohort. We used mixed-effects logistic and exponential regression models to evaluate the risk of hospitalization, maximum hospital length of stay (LOS), moderate ventilation, invasive ventilation, and death for pregnant women while adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, insurance, Elixhauser AHRQ weighted Comorbidity Index, diabetes history, medication, and accounting for clustering of results in similar zip-code regions. RESULTS: Out of 22,493 female patients with associated COVID-19, 7.2% (n = 1609) were pregnant. Crude results indicate that pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, had higher rates of hospitalization (60.5% vs. 17.0%, P < 0.001), higher mean maximum LOS (0.15 day vs. 0.08 day, P < 0.001) among those who stayed < 1 day, lower mean maximum LOS (2.55 days vs. 3.32 days, P < 0.001) among those who stayed ≥1 day, and higher moderate ventilation use (1.7% vs. 0.7%, P < 0.001) but showed no significant differences in rates of invasive ventilation or death. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, saw higher odds in hospitalization (aOR: 12.26; 95% CI (10.69, 14.06)), moderate ventilation (aOR: 2.35; 95% CI (1.48, 3.74)), higher maximum LOS among those who stayed < 1 day, and lower maximum LOS among those who stayed ≥1 day. No significant associations were found with invasive ventilation or death. For moderate ventilation, differences were seen among age and race/ethnicity groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with COVID-19 disease, pregnancy confers substantial additional risk of morbidity, but no difference in mortality. Knowing these variabilities in the risk is essential to inform decision-makers and guide clinical recommendations for the management of COVID-19 in pregnant women.

Silent hypoxia, atypical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stroke, olfactory loss, myocarditis, and increased mortality rates in the elderly, in men, in African-Americans, and in patients with obesity, diabetes, and cancer—all bear the fingerprints of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) imbalance, suggesting that RAS is the common culprit.

Knowledge in the field has been increasing exponentially and the main allergy societies have produced guidance documents for better management of allergic patients during this period. However, few publications so far have provided real-life data from the allergy community concerning the allergy practice during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, we proposed an international survey on the management of allergic patients during the current pandemic. Methods We performed an online survey undertaken to reach out the worldwide allergy community by e-mail and social media. The web-questionnaire contained 24 questions covering demographic data from the participants, clinical practice during this period, and questions related to the new international classification and coding tools addressed for COVID-19. It was circulated for 8 weeks and had anonymous and volunteer context. Results Data are presented for 635 participants from 78 countries of all continents. Allergists with long-term professional experience were the main audience. As expected, we received many responses as “I have no data” or “I don’t know” to the questions of the survey. However, most with more experience on managing allergic patients during the pandemic agreed that patients suffering from allergic or hypersensitivity conditions have no increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing SARS CoV-2. Also, participants mentioned that none of the allergy treatments (inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy, biological agents) increased the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection including severe presentations. Conclusion The data presented are a starting point to the process of getting a feedback for all the recommendations provided by the allergy societies, it could also be the basis of new strategies to support the health professionals while new COVID-19 specific treatments and vaccines are being explored.

648284,A Need to Revise Human Exposure Limits for Ultraviolet UV‐C Radiation,2021-03-25,"Rationale: Individuals with asthma may be at higher risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19 which targets the respiratory tract and may cause asthma exacerbations. Serological testing can be useful to assess the true spread of COVID-19 and help protect vulnerable individuals. The SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins are the primary viral antigens against which antibodies are raised. We developed an efficient method for production of select SARS-CoV-2 proteins in E. coli to facilitate the development of diagnostics, research, and drug discovery. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD, full-length Nucleocapsid, and Nucleocapsid RNA binding domain (BD), were expressed in E. coli under IPTG induction. The proteins were purified using multi-step chromatography techniques. The purity of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins was assessed by LC-MS/MS, and their IgG reactivity tested using COVID-19 positive patients’ sera by ELISA. Results: The Spike-RBD and Nucleocapsid proteins were expressed with high yields. The purified proteins had a relative abundance of >95% as assessed by LC-MS/MS with only trace contamination of host cell proteins. All three proteins showed high IgG reactivity (titers >1/10,000) against COVID-19 sera (n=50), with Spike-RBD and Nucleocapsid RNA-BD exhibiting the highest sensitivity. Conclusions: Production of high quality SARS-CoV-2 proteins is feasible in E.coli and the purified proteins will provide useful tools to study the immune responses involved in COVID-19 including antibody and T cell responses, epitope mapping, diagnostics and drug discovery.","Agah, Sayeh; Thorpe, Catherine; Chapman, Martin; Wuenschmann, Sabina",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.12.264; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920320273; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920320273,63
648681,The Relation Between k-Circularity and Circularity of Codes,2020-08-04,"In this paper, we introduce a network machine learning method to identify potential bioactive anti-COVID-19 molecules in foods based on their capacity to target the SARS-CoV-2-host gene-gene (protein-protein) interactome. Our analyses were performed using a supercomputing DreamLab App platform, harnessing the idle computational power of thousands of smartphones. Machine learning models were initially calibrated by demonstrating that the proposed method can predict anti-COVID-19 candidates among experimental and clinically approved drugs (5658 in total) targeting COVID-19 interactomics with the balanced classification accuracy of 80–85% in 5-fold cross-validated settings. This identified the most promising drug candidates that can be potentially “repurposed” against COVID-19 including common drugs used to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin and metformin. A database of 7694 bioactive food-based molecules was run through the calibrated machine learning algorithm, which identified 52 biologically active molecules, from varied chemical classes, including flavonoids, terpenoids, coumarins and indoles predicted to target SARS-CoV-2-host interactome networks. This in turn was used to construct a “food map” with the theoretical anti-COVID-19 potential of each ingredient estimated based on the diversity and relative levels of candidate compounds with antiviral properties. We expect this in silico predicted food map to play an important role in future clinical studies of precision nutrition interventions against COVID-19 and other viral diseases.

We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for the prediction of severe COVID-19 outcome and identify and validate a set of blood and physiological parameters routinely collected at hospital admission to improve upon the use of NEWS2 alone for medium-term risk stratification. METHODS: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King’s College Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1 March to 30 April 2020. External validation cohorts included 6237 patients from five UK NHS Trusts (Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham), one hospital in Norway (Oslo University Hospital), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID-19 disease (transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. RESULTS: A baseline model of ‘NEWS2 + age’ had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID-19 infection at 14 days (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in training cohort = 0.700, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192, 95% CI 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI 0.715, 0.757), and these improvements were replicated across seven UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. CONCLUSIONS: NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID-19 outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of early warning scores for COVID.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a new type of screw-retained prostheses delivered on tissue-level implants with conical external vertical seal and internal hexagon connection. Implants 4.25 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length (Prama, Sweden and Martina) were placed in partially edentulous patients needing at least one implant in the healed site, having sufficient bone volume. The implant neck was positioned above the bone crest. A healing abutment was placed according to a one-stage approach. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis survival rate, any complications, marginal bone loss (MBL), periodontal parameters, and pink esthetic score (PES). Overall, 13 patients (4 women and 9 men; mean age 50 ± 22 years) with the same number of implants were treated and followed for one year after loading. At the 12-month follow up, no implant and no prosthesis failed, and no complications were experienced. The mean MBL experienced at the one year follow-up was 0.65 ± 0.48 mm. One year after loading, 2 out of 13 implants present bleeding on probing (15.4%), 4 out of 13 patients presented with plaque at the one year of follow-up (30.8%) and the PES was 10.5 ± 2.3 mm. Within the limitations of the present study, the analyzed implants seem to be a viable treatment option for the rehabilitation of a single tooth gap.","Ceruso, Francesco Mattia; Ieria, Irene; Martelli, Mirko; Lumbau, Aurea I.; Xhanari, Erta; Gargari, Marco",Dent J (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/dj9040035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804864/,63

Small islands are known to face a number of challenges but in the quest to curb the viral spread, with the absence of land boarders and small population size, these factors should have played to their advantage to minimize the spread. The aim of this article was to compare and contrast the COVID-19 situation, restrictions, preparedness, management and the healthcare systems between the small population island states of Cyprus, Iceland and Malta. Method Data were obtained from Ministry of Health websites and COVID dashboards of the three respective Island states in Europe. Comparisons were made between the reported cases, deaths, swabbing rates, restrictions and mitigation measures and healthcare system structures. Results Malta contained the COVID-19 spread better than Cyprus and Iceland during the first wave. However, a significantly higher viral spread was observed in Malta during the second wave. Similar healthcare preparedness and services, restrictions and relaxation measures were implemented across the three islands with some exceptions such as the maximum number of people permitted in one gathering, free movement restrictions and airport regulations. Conclusion The small population size and island status proved to be an asset during the first wave of COVID-19 but different governance approaches led to a different COVID-19 outcome during the transition phases and the onset of the second wave.","Cuschieri, Sarah; MEng, Elena Pallari; Hatziyiann, Amalia; Sigurvinsdottir, Rannveig; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora; Sigurðardóttir, Árún Kristín",Early Hum Dev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105261; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220307659?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220307659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213965/,63

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry factor expression showed enrichment in epithelia including the ducts and acini of the salivary glands and the suprabasal cells of the mucosae. COVID-19 autopsy tissues confirmed in vivo SARS CoV-2 infection in the salivary glands and mucosa. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples found distinct viral shedding dynamics and viral burden in saliva correlated with COVID-19 symptoms including taste loss. Upon recovery, this cohort exhibited salivary antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Collectively, the oral cavity represents a robust site for COVID-19 infection andimplicates saliva in viral transmission.","Byrd, K.

The application of internal controls to validate the entire process of these assays is necessary to prevent false-negative results caused by unexpected inhibition or inefficient extraction. In the present study, we describe a strategy to produce a stable internal control for rRT-PCR by packaging foreign RNA into influenza virions using plasmid-based reverse genetics technology. The envelope structure of influenza virus can effectively protect RNA segments from RNase digestion, which provides an advantage for its routine use as an internal control. Utilizing this approach, we successfully generated a recombinant influenza virus (rPR8-HCV) containing the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome. After inactivation and purification, the rPR8-HCV particles were demonstrated to be RNase resistant and stable at 4 °C for at least 252 days in human plasma, with no degradation even after being frozen and thawed multiple times. These results were reproducible in the COBAS TaqMan HCV test for 164 days. Moreover, the chimeric influenza virus particles could be easily produced in embryonated eggs and were noninfectious after inactivation treatment. Additionally, this strategy could also be adapted for real-time clinical applications of other RNA targets, providing a universal approach with broad clinical applications in rRT-PCR assays.","Wang, Xueliang; Liu, Fen; Jiang, Lingli; Bao, Yun; Xiao, Yanqun; Wang, Hualiang",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26474983/,63

The relationship between socioeconomic disparities and the prevalence of AO has yet to be studied in Peru. Thus, our aim was to analyze the socioeconomic inequalities in AO distribution defined using the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) cut-off points in Peruvian adults in 2018–2019. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using data from the 2018–2019 Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES) of Peru. We analyzed a representative sample of 62,138 adults over 18 years of age of both sexes from urban and rural areas. Subjects were grouped into quintiles of the wealth to calculate a concentration curve and the Erreygers Concentration Index (ECI) in order to measure the inequality of AO distribution. Finally, we performed a decomposition analysis to evaluate the major determinants of inequalities. RESULTS: The prevalence of AO among Peruvian adults was 73.8%, being higher among women than men (85.1% and 61.1% respectively, p < 0.001). Socioeconomic inequality in AO was more prominent among men (ECI = 0.342, standard error (SE) = 0.0065 vs. ECI = 0.082, SE = 0.0043). The factors that contributed most to inequality in the prevalence of AO for both sexes were having the highest wealth index (men 37.2%, women 45.6%, p < 0.001), a higher education (men 34.4%, women 41.4%, p < 0.001) and living in an urban setting (men 22.0%, women 57.5%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In Peru the wealthy concentrate a greater percentage of AO. The inequality gap is greater among men, although AO is more prevalent among women. The variables that most contributed to inequality were the wealth index, educational level and area of residence. There is a need for effective individual and community interventions to reduce these inequalities.","Farro-Maldonado, Marioli Y.; Gutiérrez-Pérez, Glenda; Hernández-Vásquez, Akram; Barrenechea-Pulache, Antonio; Santero, Marilina; Rojas-Roque, Carlos; Azañedo, Diego",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288938/,63

Mostly, the comparisons have been performed on immunocompetent children with upper respiratory tract symptoms. The results range from a relatively poor sensitivity for the swabs to an even higher sensitivity than for the NPA. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity of a flocked nasal swab (fNS) on immunocompromised adults with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: During 16 months, adults with a hematological disorder presenting with febrile neutropenia were enrolled in the study. Paired samples of the fNS and NPA were collected in the outer part of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx, respectively. The samples were analyzed regarding a panel of 15 respiratory viruses by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, as an indirect measure of cell yield by either method, the copy number of the human beta actin gene was also determined. Cohen's kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement of the results obtained from either method. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of cell yield. RESULTS: A total of 98 paired samples from a total of 89 patients were collected. Twenty of the pairs had virus detected in at least one of the specimens; 11 in both, 7 in NPA only, and 2 in fNS only. For the fNS, the overall sensitivity for any virus and for rhinovirus only was 65% and 78%, respectively. NPA was significantly superior to the fNS in collecting epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: We found the overall sensitivity of 65% to be too low to replace NPA with this sampling technique in this patient category.","Öhrmalm, Lars; Wong, Michelle; Rotzén-Östlund, Maria; Norbeck, Oscar; Broliden, Kristina; Tolfvenstam, Thomas",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21110854/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-340,63

One factor that may contribute to more rapid viral growth in the upper airways is the exponential increase in SARS‐CoV‐2 stability that occurs with reductions in temperature, as measured in vitro. Because SARS‐CoV‐2 frequently initiates infection in the upper airways before spreading through the body, increased upper airway viral growth early in the disease course may result in more rapid progression of disease and potentially contribute to more severe outcomes. Similarly, higher SARS‐CoV‐2 viral titer in the upper airways likely supports more efficient transmission. Conversely, the possible significance of air temperature to upper airway viral growth suggests that prolonged delivery of heated air might represent a preventative measure and prophylactic treatment for coronavirus disease 2019.","Kang, Dominique; Ellgen, Clifford; Kulstad, Erik",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913555/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27042,63
663773,An opportunity to incentivize innovation to increase vaccine safety in the United States by improving vaccine delivery using vaccine patches,2020-04-21,"In this paper, we want to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic according to the Retarded SEIRS model. One of the main questions in the human mind is whether the COVID-19 epidemic will happen again. Therefore, a criterion must be set for the occurrence or non-occurrence of the disease. With the Retarded SEIRS model and this criterion, we can predict whether the Covid-19 will re-emerge. So far, a large number of researches that have been presented in scientific groups or communities have been based on the SIR or SEIR model. But we assume that each recovered individual is immune to the disease for a limited time, and then will be susceptible again. As we know, this assumption was also true for SARS.","Pour Mohammad, H.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248842; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248842v1?rss=1,63

Ireland responded by shutting all non-essential shops, businesses and schools. Our healthcare system had to adapt and rapid adaptations were made to ambulatory HIV care.ApproachRecords were virtually reviewed and triaged using existing electronic patient records(EPR) prior to appointments. Antiretrovirals(ARVs) were pre-prescribed and prepared by pharmacy for those anticipated to remain on the same ARVs. We determined those for whom routine phlebotomy could be diverted. We paused cervical, STI screening and vaccination programme in the initial phase, reopening in a more streamlined manner as the pandemic went out of each wave and adapting again as it went back into a new wave. We undertook a staff survey to assess their views on the new service delivery.Outcomes/ImpactWe conducted a survey of our staff members across all disciplines. There were 34 responses out of 53 staff members. 76.47% agreed that pre reviewing EPR was better for patient care, 88.24% believed that patient flow was improved, 76.47% believed that patients time in the department was reduced due to the virtual reviews and that covid-19 risk was reduced. 80% of doctors felt that doing the virtual reviews was a valuable training experience. 50% believed that there was more time available to deal with complex cases.Innovation and SignificancePre prescribing medications has led to better patient flow and social distancing during clinic. Complex issues, in many cases can be addressed prior to clinic and discussed with senior providers. Stricter adherence to appointment times is more convenient for patients and staff. This system has allowed us to identify patients with complex medical needs and presented opportunity for education and training between senior and junior providers, whilst decreasing Covid-19 risk to provider and patient.","Keane, A.; Lyons, F.; Loy, A.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.460,63

Some mutations have defined several SARS-CoV-2 clades that seem to behave differently in terms of regional distribution and other biological features. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are used to classify the sequence variants in viruses from individual human patients. However, the cost and relative scarcity of NGS equipment and expertise in developing countries prevent studies aimed to associate specific clades and variants to clinical features and outcomes in such territories. As of March 2021, the GR clade and its derivatives, including the B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.28 variants, predominate worldwide. We implemented the post-PCR small-amplicon high-resolution melting analysis to genotype SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from the saliva of individual patients. This procedure was able to clearly distinguish two groups of samples of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples predicted, according to their melting profiles, to contain GR and non-GR viruses. This grouping of the samples was validated by means of amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) assay as well as Sanger sequencing.","Diaz-Garcia, Hector; Guzmán-Ortiz, Ana L.; Angeles-Floriano, Tania; Parra-Ortega, Israel; López-Martínez, Briceida; Martínez-Saucedo, Mirna; Aquino-Jarquin, Guillermo; Sánchez-Urbina, Rocío; Quezada, Hector; Granados-Riveron, Javier T.",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12040531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916492/,63
666446,Advances in Molecularly Imprinted Polymers Based Affinity Sensors (Review),2021-03-22,"Protein-protein interactions between virus and host are crucial for infection. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance. Importance COVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail. In addition, RBD mutations identified in this study can serve as a molecular directory for experimental biologists to perform functional validation experiments. The minimal molecular requirements for the formation of RBD-ACE2 interface predicted using in silico structure models may help precisely design neutralizing antibodies, vaccines and therapeutics. Our study also proposes the significance of understanding evolution of protein interfaces during pandemic.","Nelson-Sathi, Shijulal; Umasankar, PK; Sreekumar, E; Radhakrishnan Nair, R; Joseph, Iype; Nori, Sai Ravi Chandra; Philip, Jamiema Sara; Prasad, Roshny; Navyasree, KV; Ramesh, Shikha; Pillai, Heera; Ghosh, Sanu; Santosh Kumar, TR; Radhakrishna Pillai, M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.071811,63
666869,Application of MBR for hospital wastewater treatment in China(),2010-01-15,"From a public health perspective, nasal surgery accounts for many unused opioids. Patients undergoing septorhinoplasty require few opioids, and efforts to eliminate this need may benefit both patients and the public. METHODS: A multimodal analgesic protocol consisting of 15 components encompassing all phases of care was implemented for 42 patients. RESULTS: Median age and BMI were 34 years and 23, respectively. Most were women (79%), White (79%), primary surgeries (62%), and self-pay (52%). Comorbid conditions were present in 74% of the patients, with anxiety (33%) and depression (21%) being the most common. Septoplasties (67%) and osteotomies (45%) were common. The median operative time was 70 minutes. No patients required opioids in recovery, and median time in recovery was 63 minutes. Ten (24%) patients required an opioid prescription after discharge. In those patients, median time to requirement was 27 hours (range 3–81), and median total requirement was 20 mg morphine equivalents (range 7.5–85). Protocol compliance inversely correlated to opioid use (P = 0.007). Compliance with local and regional anesthetic (20% versus 63%, P = 0.030) as well as ketorolac (70% versus 100%, P = 0.011) was lower in patients who required opioids. Patients who required opioids were less likely to be administered a beta blocker (0% versus 34%, P = 0.041). Pain scores were higher in opioid users on postoperative days 1–5 (P < 0.05). No complications occurred in those requiring opioids, and satisfaction rates were equivalent between groups. CONCLUSION: This protocol allowed us to safely omit opioid prescriptions in 76% of patients following septorhinoplasty, without adverse effects on outcomes or patient satisfaction.","Hall, Bradley R.; Billue, Katherine L.; Hon, Heidi; Sanders, Stacey E.; Barrientos, Stephan; Flores, Laura E.; Nicholas, Thomas; Shostrom, Valerie; Meyer, Bria; Johnson, Perry J.",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425613/; https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000003305,63

668503,Little Hearts Are Affected by COVID19: Importance of the Myocardial Systolic Evaluation,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Even when resting pulse oximetry is normal in the patient with acute Covid-19, hypoxia can manifest on exertion. We summarise the literature on the performance of different rapid tests for exertional desaturation and draw on this evidence base to provide guidance in the context of acute Covid-19. MAIN RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia at home or in an ambulatory setting in the context of Covid-19 and to what extent have they been validated? 2. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia in other lung conditions, to what extent have they been validated and what is the applicability of these studies to acute Covid-19? METHOD: AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE MEDLINE, Cochrane and PubMed using LitCovid, Scholar and Google databases were searched to September 2020. Studies where participants had Covid-19 or another lung disease and underwent any form of exercise test which was compared to a reference standard were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS 2. A protocol for the review was published on the Medrxiv database. RESULTS: Of 47 relevant papers, 15 were empirical studies, of which 11 described an attempt to validate one or more exercise desaturation tests in lung diseases other than Covid-19. In all but one of these, methodological quality was poor or impossible to fully assess. None had been designed as a formal validation study (most used simple tests of correlation). Only one validation study (comparing a 1-min sit-to-stand test [1MSTST] with reference to the 6-min walk test [6MWT] in 107 patients with interstitial lung disease) contained sufficient raw data for us to calculate the sensitivity (88%), specificity (81%) and positive and negative predictive value (79% and 89% respectively) of the 1MSTST. The other 4 empirical studies included two predictive studies on patients with Covid-19, and two on HIV-positive patients with suspected pneumocystis pneumonia. We found no studies on the 40-step walk test (a less demanding test that is widely used in clinical practice to assess Covid-19 patients). Heterogeneity of study design precluded meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: Exertional desaturation tests have not yet been validated in patients with (or suspected of having) Covid-19. A stronger evidence base exists for the diagnostic accuracy of the 1MSTST in chronic long-term pulmonary disease; the relative intensity of this test may raise safety concerns in remote consultations or unstable patients. The less strenuous 40-step walk test should be urgently evaluated.

668808,The Role of CoLab and GAITS in Enabling the RADx Tech Program,2021-04-28,"Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the commonest cause of early onset sepsis in newborns in developed high-income countries. Intrapartum antimicrobial (antibiotic) prophylaxis (IAP) is recognized to be highly effective in preventing early onset Group B sepsis (EOGBS) in newborns. The key controversy is about the strategy that should be used to identify mothers who should receive IAP. There are two strategies that are followed in developed countries: screening-based or risk-factor-based identification of women requiring IAP. The debate regarding which of the two approaches is better has intensified in the recent years with concerns about antimicrobial resistance, effect on newborn’s microbiome and other adverse effects. In this review, we have discussed some of the key research papers published in the period 2015–2019 that have addressed the relative merits and disadvantages of screening versus risk-factor-based identification of women requiring IAP. Although screening-based IAP appears to be more efficacious than risk-based IAP, IAP-based prevention has several limitations including ineffectiveness in prevention of late-onset GBS infection in babies, premature and still births, impact of IAP on neonatal microbiota, emergence of antimicrobial resistance and difficulties in implementing IAP-based strategies in middle and low income countries. Alternative strategies, principally maternal immunization against GBS would circumvent use of IAP. However, no licensed vaccines are currently available for use.","Rao, Guduru Gopal; Khanna, Priya",Ther Adv Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32704370/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2049936120942424,63

At present, limited data are available on GBS in LMIC and the true incidence of GBS in many LMIC remains unknown. Increased understanding of GBS in LMIC is needed because poor hygiene and high exposure to infections render populations in LMIC vulnerable to GBS outbreaks. Furthermore, insufficient diagnostic and health-care facilities in LMIC contribute to delayed diagnosis in patients with severe presentations of GBS. In addition, the lack of national clinical guidelines and absence of affordable, effective treatments contribute to worse outcomes and higher mortality in LMIC than HIC. Systematic population-based surveillance studies, cohort and case–control studies are required to understand the incidence and risk factors for GBS. Novel, targeted and cost-effective treatment strategies need to be developed in the context of health system challenges in LMIC. To ensure integrative rehabilitation services in LMIC, existing prognostic models must be validated, and responsive outcome measures that are cross-culturally applicable must be developed. Therefore, fundamental and applied research to improve the clinical management of GBS in LMIC should become a critical focus of future research programmes.","Papri, Nowshin; Islam, Zhahirul; Leonhard, Sonja E.; Mohammad, Quazi D.; Endtz, Hubert P.; Jacobs, Bart C.",Nat Rev Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649531/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-021-00467-y,63

Aims: We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 SCZ patients with those of non-SCZ patients. Method: This was a case-control study of COVID-19 patients admitted to 4 APHM/AMU acute care hospitals in Marseille, southern France. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample and/or on chest computed scan among patients requiring hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Results: A total of 1092 patients were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9.0%. The SCZ patients had an increased mortality compared to the non-SCZ patients (26.7% vs. 8.7%, p=0.039), which was confirmed by the multivariable analysis after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, obesity and comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio 4.36 [95% CI 1.09-17.44]; p=0.038). In contrast, the SCZ patients were not more frequently admitted to the ICU than the non-SCZ patients. Importantly, the SCZ patients were mostly institutionalized (63.6%, 100% of those who died), and they were more likely to have cancers and respiratory comorbidities. Conclusions: This study suggests that SCZ is not overrepresented among COVID-19 hospitalized patients, but SCZ is associated with excess COVID-19 mortality, confirming the existence of health disparities described in other somatic diseases.","Fond, Guillaume; Pauly, Vanessa; Orleans, Veronica; Antonini, François; Fabre, Cyprien; Sanz, Michel; Klay, Sophie; Jimeno, Marie-Thérèse; Leone, Marc; Lancon, Christophe; Auquier, Pascal; Boyer, Laurent",Encephale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620301883?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620301883; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933762/,63
672761,STS Advocacy Concerning CMS Reduction in the 2021 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule to Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons.,2021-03-15,"Glucocorticoid (GC) usage is the most common non-traumatic cause of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ON). Despite the strong association of GC with ON, the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. Investigators have proposed both direct and indirect effects of GC on cells. Indirect and direct mechanisms remain intimately related and often result in positive feedback loops to potentiate the disease processes. However, the direct effects, in particular apoptosis, have recently been shown to be increasingly important. Suppression of osteoblast and osteoclast precursor production, increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes, prolongation of the lifespan of osteoclasts and apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC) are all direct effects of GC usage. Elevated blood pressure through several pathways may raise the risk of clot formation. High-dose GC also decreases tissue plasminogen activator activity (t-PA) and increases plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels increasing the procoagulant potential of GC. Inhibited angiogenesis, altered bone repair and nitric oxide metabolism can also result. Also, GC treatment modulates other vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1, noradrenalin and bradykinin. Thus, GCs act as a regulator of local blood flow by modulating vascular responsiveness to vasoactive substances. Vasoconstriction induced in intraosseous femoral head arteries causes femoral head ischemia. GCs also cause ischemia through increased intraosseous pressure, which subsequently decreases the blood flow to the femoral head by apoptosis of ECs as well as elevating the level of adipogenesis and fat hypertrophy in the bone marrow. It is difficult to predict which patients receiving a specific dose of GC will develop ON, indicating individual differences in steroid sensitivity and the potential of additional mechanisms. The textbook model of ON is a multiple hit theory in which, with a greater number of risk factors, the risk of ON increases. While more effort is needed to better comprehend the role of GC in ON, newer data on GC action upon the endothelial cell and the regional endothelial bed dysfunction theory sheds new light on particular GC mechanisms. Better understanding of GC pathomechanisms can lead to better treatment options.","Kerachian, Mohammad Amin; Séguin, Chantal; Harvey, Edward J.",J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076009000624; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960076009000624; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19429441/,63

In this study, we explore a possible county-level association between influenza vaccination coverage in people aged 65 years and older and the number of deaths from COVID-19. To this end, we used COVID-19 data up to 14 December 2020 and US population health data at the county level. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models using influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population as the independent variable and the COVID-19 mortality rate as the outcome variable. We adjusted for an array of potential confounders using different propensity score regression methods. Results show that, on the county level, influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19, using different methodologies for confounding adjustment.

This has been attributed to the ability of PRRSV to influence the induction of cytokine responses. In this study, we investigated the cytokine transcriptional profiles in different compartments of the mediastinal lymph node of pigs infected with three genotype 1 PRRSV strains of differing pathogenicity: the low virulence prototype Lelystad virus (LV), and UK field strain 215–06 and the highly virulent subtype 3 SU1-Bel isolate from Belarus. We have used a combination of laser capture micro-dissection (LCM) followed by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of immune cell markers (CD3, CD79a and MAC387) and RT-qPCR quantification of PRRSV and cytokine transcripts. Compared to mock infected pigs, we found a significant downregulation of TNF-α and IFN-α in follicular and interfollicular areas of the mediastinal lymph node from 3 days post-infection (dpi) in animals infected with all three strains. This was accompanied by a transient B cell depletion and T cell and macrophage infiltration in the follicles together with T cell depletion in the interfollicular areas. A delayed upregulation of IFN-γ and IL-23p19 was observed mainly in the follicles. The PRRSV load was higher in all areas and time-points studied in the animals infected with the SU1-Bel strain.

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a single center, open label, randomized, controlled, parallel group, clinical trial that will be conducted at Loghman Hakim Medical Education Center in conjunction with Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty COVID-19 confirmed cases (using the RT-PCR test) will be enrolled in the trial between April 9(th) to April 14(th) 2020. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention groups or the control group with the following eligibility criteria: ≥ 18 years of age AND (oxygen saturation (SPO2) ≤ 93% OR respiratory rate ≥ 24) AND at least one of the following: Contactless infrared forehead thermometer temperature of ≥37.8, cough, sputum production, nasal discharge, myalgia, headache or fatigue on admission, and time of onset of the symptoms should be acute (Days ≤ 14). Although Hydroxychloroquine will be administered in a single dose, patients with heart problems (prolonged QT or PR intervals, second- or third-degree heart block, and arrhythmias including torsade de pointes) will be excluded. Other exclusion criteria include using drugs with potential interaction with Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Interferon-β 1a, Interferon-β 1b, pregnant or lactating women, history of alcohol or drug addiction in the past 5 years, blood ALT/AST levels > 5 times the upper limit of normal on laboratory results and refusal to participate. This study will be undertaken at the Loghman Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: COVID-19 confirmed patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, with 20 patients in each. The first group (Arm 1) will receive Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir / Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Interferon-β 1a (Recigen), the second group (Arm 2) will be administered Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir / Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Interferon-β 1b (Ziferon), and the control group (Arm 3) will be treated by Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir / Ritonavir (Kaletra). MAIN OUTCOMES: Time to clinical improvement is our primary outcome measure. This is an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale (recommended by the World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) R&D. Geneva: World Health Organization) or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first. Secondary outcomes include mortality from the date of randomization until the last day of the study which will be the day all of the patients have had at least one of the following outcomes: 1) Improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale. 2) Discharge from the hospital 3) Death. If any patient dies, we have reached an important secondary outcome. SpO2 Improvement between the last and first day of hospitalization, using pulse-oximetry. Duration of hospitalization from date of randomization until the date of hospital discharge or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Incidence of new mechanical ventilation uses from date of randomization until the last day of the study. Please note that we are trying to add further secondary outcomes and this section of the protocol is still evolving. Statistical analysis will be performed by R version 3.6.1 software. We will use Kaplan–Meier to analyze the time to clinical improvement (compared with a log-rank test). Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the Cox proportional-hazards model in crude and adjusted analysis. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either Interferon Beta 1a, Interferon Beta 1b or standard care only. Patients will be randomly allocated to three therapeutic arms using permuted, block-randomization to balance the number of patients allocated to each group. The permuted block (three or six patients per block) randomization sequence will be generated, using Package ‘randomizeR’ in R software version 3.6.1. and placed in individual sealed and opaque envelopes by the statistician. The investigator will enroll the patients and only then open envelopes to assign patients to the different treatment groups. This method of allocation concealment will result in minimum selection and confounding biases.

675714,Public antibodies to malaria antigens generated by two LAIR1 insertion modalities,2017-08-23,"BACKGROUND: The support of student wellbeing features highly in all higher education institutional agendas. For medical students good physical and mental health can help prevent burnout, equip students for their future healthcare setting and indirectly improve patient care. At the University of Nottingham (UK), we were keen to explore undergraduate medical students perceived wellbeing before, during, and after an early years’ (years 1-3) curriculum change. A restructure of the curriculum enabled personal wellbeing sessions to be embedded and directly linked to the pastoral support system. METHODS: Students’ perceived wellbeing was assessed through a questionnaire distributed to three cohorts of first year students at the start and end of the autumn semester. RESULTS: The data showed a clear improvement of perceived physical health at the end of the first semester following the curriculum change, alongside increased mood and ability to relax. A surprising outcome of this study was that students reported increased stress levels at the end of the semester, which we believe may be attributed to the change in assessment within the new curriculum. Our medical students are now facing end of year summative examinations, but are acutely aware of their progress as they undertake frequent formative assessments during the year. We propose that comparison of performance with peers is having a direct impact on perceived stress in these cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The study has shown that embedding wellbeing in the curriculum can have positive effects even within a changing curriculum. The importance of evolving wellbeing provision and support based on the needs of the student population is essential and probably never more in need than at this moment in time.

A prospective observational study was conducted in eight HD facilities in Alsace, France, to identify clinical characteristics of HD patients with COVID-19 and to assess the determinants of the risk of death. METHODS: All HD patients tested positive for COVID-19 from 5 March to 28 April 2020 were included. Collected data included patient characteristics, clinical features at diagnosis, laboratory data, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 1346 HD patients, 123 tested positive for COVID-19. Patients had a median age of 77 years (interquartile range 66–83), with a high number of comorbidities (3.2 ± 1.6 per patient). Symptoms were compatible in 63% of patients. Asthenia (77%), diarrhoea (34%) and anorexia (32%) were frequent at diagnosis. The delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, death or complete recovery was 2 (0–5), 7 (4–11) and 32 (26.5–35) days, respectively. Treatment, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids, was administered in 23% of patients. The median C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte count at diagnosis was 55 mg/L (IQR 25–106) and 690 Ly/µL (IQR 450–960), respectively. The case fatality rate was 24% and determinants associated with the risk of death were body temperature {hazard ratio [HR] 1.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11–3.44]; P = 0.02} and CRP at diagnosis [HR 1.01 (95% CI 1.005–1.017); P < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: HD patients were found to be at high risk of developing COVID-19 and exhibited a high rate of mortality. While patients presented severe forms of the disease, they often displayed atypical symptoms, with the CRP level being highly associated with the risk of death.","Keller, Nicolas; Chantrel, François; Krummel, Thierry; Bazin-Kara, Dorothée; Faller, Anne Laure; Muller, Clotilde; Nussbaumer, Thimothée; Ismer, Manfred; Benmoussa, Abdellatif; Brahim-Bouna, Mohamed; Beier, Stéphanie; Perrin, Peggy; Hannedouche, Theirry",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871594/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfaa170,63
677727,The Impacts of Low Diversity Sequence Data on Phylodynamic Inference during an Emerging Epidemic,2021-01-08,"Abstract This paper incorporates deflation in an analysis of the relationship between the exchange rate pass-through and inflation. Using a nonlinear model based on monthly data of Taiwan's import prices from 1981 to 2008, we find that the degree of exchange rate pass-through is increasing in deflation. The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms. Poor profits in deflation cause firms to pass through most of the cost of exchange rate changes to their products to avoid exiting the market.","Lin, Po-Chun; Wu, Chung-Shu",International Review of Economics & Finance,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1059056011001237; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059056011001237,63
678460,Organic–Inorganic Hybrid Materials,2020-12-28,"ABSTRACT: Currently there are no effective anti-viral drugs for SARS-CoV-2, so the primary line of defense is to detect infected cases as soon as possible. The high rate of contagion for this virus and the highly nonspecific symptoms of the disease (Coronovirus disease 2019, (Covid-19)) that it causes, such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia, require the urgent establishment of precise and fast diagnostic tests to verify suspected cases, screen patients, and conduct virus surveillance. Nowadays, several virus detection methods are available for viral diseases, which act on specific properties of each virus or virus family, therefore, further investigations and trials are needed to find a highly efficient and accurate detection method to detect and prevent the outcomes of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need for more and precise studies in this field. In this review, we discussed the properties of a new generation of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) following routine virus detection methods and proposed new strategies and the use of potential samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed to reduce infection rates, pregnant and postnatal women have experienced disruption not just to their daily lives but also to their pregnancy healthcare experience and their motherhood journey with their new infant. This has included substantial changes in how, when and why they have engaged with physical activity. While some of these changes undoubtedly increased the challenge of being sufficiently active as a pregnant or postnatal woman, they have also revealed new opportunities to reach and support women and their families. This commentary details these challenges and opportunities, and highlights how researchers and practitioners can, and arguably must, harness these short-term changes for long-term benefit. This includes a call for a fresh focus on how we can engage and support those individuals and groups who are both hardest hit by COVID-19 and have previously been under-represented and under-served by antenatal and postnatal physical activity research and interventions.","Atkinson, Lou; De Vivo, Marlize; Hayes, Louise; Hesketh, Kathryn R.; Mills, Hayley; Newham, James J.; Olander, Ellinor K.; Smith, Debbie M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036326/,63

The roles of various mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, bradykinin, and, more recently, chemokines and cytokines, in the pathophysiology and development of complications of the common cold are the subject of previous and current investigations. Establishing causality of a mediator in the common cold has been difficult for a number of reasons, including the limitations of our research tools and protocols and the complexity of the inflammatory and immune pathways that participate during the common cold.

680741,Science during lockdown – from virtual seminars to sustainable online communities,2020-08-14,"Background: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, demand for diagnostic testing has increased drastically, resulting in shortages of necessary materials to conduct the tests and overwhelming the capacity of testing laboratories. The supply scarcity and capacity limits affect test administration: priority must be given to hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals, which can prevent the identification of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals and hence effective tracking and tracing policies. We describe optimized group testing strategies applicable to SARS-CoV-2 tests in scenarios tailored to the current COVID-19 pandemic and assess significant gains compared to individual testing. Methods: We account for biochemically realistic scenarios in the context of dilution effects on SARS-CoV-2 samples and consider evidence on specificity and sensitivity of PCR-based tests for the novel coronavirus. Because of the current uncertainty and the temporal and spatial changes in the prevalence regime, we provide analysis for several realistic scenarios and propose fast and reliable strategies for massive testing procedures. Key Findings: We find significant efficiency gaps between different group testing strategies in realistic scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 testing, highlighting the need for an informed decision of the pooling protocol depending on estimated prevalence, target specificity, and high- vs. low-risk population. For example, using one of the presented methods, all 1.47 million inhabitants of Munich, Germany, could be tested using only around 141 thousand tests if the infection rate is below 0.4% is assumed. Using 1 million tests, the 6.69 million inhabitants from the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, could be tested as long as the infection rate does not exceed 1%. Moreover, we provide an interactive web application, available at www.grouptexting.com, for visualizing the different strategies and designing pooling schemes according to specific prevalence scenarios and test configurations. Interpretation: Altogether, this work may help provide a basis for an efficient upscaling of current testing procedures, which takes the population heterogeneity into account and is fine-grained towards the desired study populations, e.g., mild/asymptomatic individuals vs. symptomatic ones but also mixtures thereof.

We analyzed the skin characteristics that changed for about three months from mid-June to mid-September, and compared to skin changes caused by wearing a mask during the day. Measured areas were divided into two groups. Cheeks, perioral area and chin were mask-wearing area and forehead was non-mask-wearing area. Skin temperature, redness, hydration, keratin, elasticity, pore, color and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured. Skin changes caused by long-term wearing of mask were shown in TEWL, skin hydration and keratin. Compared to June, TEWL was increased significantly on the cheeks, perioral area and chin. There was significant difference in TEWL increase in the cheeks and perioral area compared to the forehead. Also, skin hydration was significantly decreased on the cheeks. Skin hydration of perioral area was also decrease. There was significant difference in skin hydration decrease in the cheeks compared to the forehead. Compared to June, skin keratin was significantly increased on the cheeks. Skin keratin of perioral area was also increase on the perioral area and chin. There was significant difference in skin keratin increase in the cheeks and chin compared to the forehead. In previous studies, skin characteristics that were quickly affected by wearing a mask were skin temperature and redness. On the other hand, TEWL, skin hydration and keratin were more affected by wearing a mask for a long time so there was difference short-term and long-term effect of mask in changed skin characteristics. In this study, we identified the effect of long-term wearing a mask on the face skin. This result is meaningful in that we studied the effect of wearing a mask in daily life for ordinary people, not those who wear mask in the occupational environment.","Park, S.; Han, J.; Yeong, Y.; Kang, N.; SUH, B.; Kim, E.",Journal of Investigative Dermatology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X21015153; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022202X21015153; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2021.07.016,63

685177,Emerging pathogens: the epidemiology and evolution of species jumps,2005-03-10,"After four months of dealing with the pandemic, the city of Sao Paulo entered a phase of relaxed social-distancing measures in July 2020, and saw its social isolation rate fall at the same time as the number of cases, deaths, and hospital bed occupation declined. We use a calibrated multi-agent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the city's sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the virus's spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the virus's spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the population's transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.","Pinto, J. P. G.; Magalhaes, P.

Given dramatic changes to personal decisions and behaviors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed recreational anglers across the US to understand how the pandemic may have affected their fishing motivations and subsequent activities. Nearly a quarter million anglers from 10 US states were invited to participate in the survey, and almost 18,000 responded. Anglers reported numerous effects of the pandemic, including fishing access restrictions. Despite these barriers, we found that the amount of fishing in the spring of 2020 was significantly greater—by about 0.2 trips per angler—than in non-pandemic springs. Increased fishing is likely associated with our result that most respondents considered recreational angling to be a COVID-19 safe activity. Nearly a third of anglers reported changing their motivation for fishing during the pandemic, with stress relief being more popular during the pandemic than before. Driven partly by the perceived safety of social fishtancing, recreational angling remained a popular activity for many US anglers during spring 2020.","Midway, Stephen R.; Lynch, Abigail J.; Peoples, Brandon K.; Dance, Michael; Caffey, Rex",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407076/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254652,63

The purpose of this study is to explain the reasons for not maintaining health guidelines to prevent COVID-19 in high-risk jobs in Iran. METHODS: The present study was conducted with a qualitative approach among people with high-risk jobs in Tehran during March and April of 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 31 people with high-risk occupations selected by purposeful sampling and snowballing. The data were analyzed using the conventional qualitative content analysis method and MAXQDA-18 software. Guba and Lincoln’s criteria were also used to evaluate the quality of the research results. RESULTS: 4 main categories and 13 sub-categories were obtained, including individual factors (personality traits, lack of self-efficacy, little knowledge of the disease and how to observe health norms related to it, misconceptions about health), structural factors (difficulty of access to health supplies, lack of supportive environment, weak laws and supervision, the poor performance of officials and national media), economic factors (economic costs of living, lack of government economic support), Socio-cultural factors (learning, cultural beliefs, social customs, and rituals). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 prevention requires intervention at different levels. At the individual level: increasing people’s awareness and understanding about how to prevent COVID-19 and strengthening self-efficacy in observing health norms, at the social level: highlighting positive patterns of observing health issues and training people about the consequences of social interactions during the outbreak of the virus, and at the macro level: strengthening regulatory rules and increasing people’s access to hygienic products and support for the vulnerable must be taken into account.

These responsibilities, however, appear to be much more for pharmacists in low-resource settings where they are the most accessible healthcare professional. Some of these responsibilities include patient confidentiality as well as counseling patients on medication use, lifestyle as well as other personal matters that may arise in relation to their health. Mental health services including psychotherapy provide a range of therapeutic techniques that enable the patients (individual or groups) to develop effective coping strategies towards emotional and psychological difficulties, via methodic interactions with a mental health expert. In this commentary, we share suggestions on how to improve community pharmacy-based mental health services in Nigeria. With the expanding roles and responsibility for pharmacists beyond medication-related concerns comes the challenge of matching up the training of pharmacists with the broadening scope of practice in Nigeria. However, as pertinent as that might be, there are existing knowledge and competency gaps in keeping up with this trend. To correct these shortfalls, we contend that the training curricula for pharmacists in Nigeria be reviewed and/or expanded to provide adequate knowledge for pharmacy undergraduates and pharmacists about non-drug mental health care which will also impact psychotherapy services during their practice especially in the community settings.","Bamgboye, Adeboye Olakunle; Hassan, Ibrahim Adebayo; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Farayola, Rachael Oluwatoyosi; Uwizeyimana, Theogene",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827697/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-021-00316-9,63

This study aimed to evaluate the neurologic manifestations and their correlated factors in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted from March 17, 2020 to June 20, 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Iran. The study population consisted of adult patients with a positive result for COVID-19 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasopharyngeal swabs. Both written and electronic data regarding baseline characteristic, laboratory findings, and neurological manifestations were evaluated and reported. RESULTS: 727 COVID-19 patients with the mean age of 49.94 ± 17.49 years were studied (56.9% male). At least one neurological symptom was observed in 403 (55.4%) cases. Headache (29.0%), and smell (22.3%) and taste (22.0%) impairment were the most prevalent neurological symptoms, while seizure (1.1%) and stroke (2.3%) were the least common ones. Patients with neurological manifestations were significantly older (p = 0.04), had greater body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.02), longer first symptom to admission duration (p < 0.001) and were more frequently opium users (p = 0.03) compared to COVID-19 patients without neurological symptoms. O(2 )saturation was significantly lower in patients with neurological manifestations (p = 0.04). In addition, medians of neutrophil count (p = 0.006), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p = 0.02) and c-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.001) were significantly higher and the median of lymphocyte count (p = 0.03) was significantly lower in patients with neurological manifestations.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine a large number of patients’ experiences of, use of, and attitudes toward telepsychiatry. METHODS: An anonymous 11-question survey was delivered electronically to 14,000 patients receiving telepsychiatry care at 18 participating centers across 11 US states between the months of April and June 2020, including questions about their age and length of service use, as well as experience and satisfaction with telepsychiatry on a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and report data. RESULTS: In total, 3070 patients with different age ranges participated. The overall experience using telepsychiatry was either excellent or good for 1189 (82.2%) participants using video and 2312 (81.5%) using telephone. In addition, 1922 (63.6%) patients either agreed or strongly agreed that remote treatment sessions (telephone or video) have been just as helpful as in-person treatment. Lack of commute (n=1406, 46.1%) and flexible scheduling/rescheduling (n=1389, 45.5%) were frequently reported advantages of telepsychiatry, whereas missing the clinic/hospital (n=936, 30.7%) and not feeling as connected to their doctor/nurse/therapist (n=752, 24.6%) were the most frequently reported challenges. After the current pandemic resolves, 1937 (64.2%) respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that they would consider using remote treatment sessions in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry is very well perceived among a large sample of patients. After the current pandemic resolves, some patients may benefit from continued telepsychiatry, but longitudinal studies are needed to assess impact on clinical outcomes and determine whether patients’ perceptions change over time.","Guinart, Daniel; Marcy, Patricia; Hauser, Marta; Dwyer, Michael; Kane, John M",JMIR Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.2196/24761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302254/,63
