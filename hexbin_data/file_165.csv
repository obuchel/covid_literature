365,Mortality among patients with tuberculosis requiring intensive care: a retrospective cohort study,2010-03-07,"BACKGROUND: To describe the characteristics of patients with tuberculosis (TB) requiring intensive care and to identify the factors that predicts in-hospital mortality in a city of a developing country with intermediate-to-high TB endemicity. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cohort study, between November 2005 and November 2007. The patients with TB requiring intensive care were included. Predictors of mortality were assessed. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 67 patients with TB required intensive care. Of them, 62 (92.5%) had acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Forty-four (65.7%) patients died. Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus was present in 46 (68.7%) patients. Early intensive care unit admission and ventilator-associated pneumonia were independently associated with the in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found a high mortality rate in TB patients requiring intensive care, especially in those with an early ICU admission.","Silva, Denise R; Menegotto, Diego M; Schulz, Luis F; Gazzana, Marcelo B; Dalcin, Paulo TR",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843613/,165
2485,The performance of interferon-gamma release assay in nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases: a retrospective study in China,2016-11-25,"BACKGROUND: The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is more specific than the tuberculin skin test to discriminate between tuberculosis (TB) and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases. Here we performed a retrospective study to evaluate the performance of the T-SPOT.TB in patients with NTM diseases. METHODS: Between March, 2013 and Nov, 2015, a total of 58 patients with NTM diseases had a T-SPOT.TB performed were enrolled, 30 patients had definite NTM diseases, 28 had probable diseases. Their clinicopathological characteristics were reviewed and analyzed. Cultures for mycobacteria were performed. The indirect proportion method with Löwenstein–Jensen (L-J) medium was used for first-line drug susceptibility test. T-SPOT.TB assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (continuous variables) and as numbers and percentages (categorical variables). The χ (2) test was used for comparisons between proportions. RESULTS: The average age was 51.8 ± 16.1 years (range 10 to 77 years), 58.6% (34/58) were male. 16.4% (9/55) were TB-PCR positive. 34 (58.6%) isolates were Mycobacterium intracellulare, ten (17.2%) were Mycobacterium chelonae and seven (12.1%) were Mycobacterium fortuitum. Fifty-two (89.7%) patients were NTM lung disease, five (8.6%) were pleural disease, and one (1.7%) lymphadenitis. The total positivity of T-SPOT.TB was 53.4% (31/58) among the whole group (probable and definite). For probable cases, the T-SPOT.TB assay was positive in 53.5% (15/28); for definite cases, 16 (53.3%) of 30 definite cases were positive. There was no statistical difference in the positivity rate between them (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, we showed that a significant portion of NTM diseases were T-SPOT.TB positive in China. Although T-SPOT.TB is useful diagnostic method for differentiating TB from NTM diseases, in China, the IGRA assay show limited value in the discrimination. In addition, further research is needed to investigate the association between TB infection and treatment for NTM patients.","Wang, Mao-Shui; Wang, Jun-Li; Wang, Xin-Feng",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124224/,165
6453,Low C-reactive protein values at admission predict mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae that require intensive care management,2015-03-03,"We investigated the proportion of patients with laboratory-confirmed type A influenza who visited an outpatient clinic and who were suitable for receiving treatment with anti-influenza viral agents. Between December 1999 and March 2000, in a community hospital, 40 patients were diagnosed as having type A influenza by specific antigen detection (n = 39) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (n = 1). These patients with laboratory-confirmed type A influenza were enrolled in the study. We investigated the time interval between the onset of illness and visit to the outpatient clinic at the community hospital. The results indicated that 57.5% of the patients with type A influenza visited the hospital within 1 day of the onset of illness, and 77.5% visited the hospital within 2 days. The body temperature (mean ± SD) during the initial consultation was 38.9 ± 0.8°C (n = 40). Seventeen of the 40 patients (42.5%) were hospitalized. In conclusion, in the majority of patients, the time from onset of symptoms to consultation was appropriate for treatment with anti-influenza viral agents. A rapid antigen-detection assay, such as Directigen Flu A, is useful for early diagnosis and allows for early treatment with anti-influenza viral agents.","Miyara, Takayuki; Tokashiki, Kaori; Shimoji, Tsutomu; Tamaki, Kazunori; Saito, Atsushi",J Infect Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101556/,165
6465,Prospective Observational Study on the Association Between Serum Mannose-Binding Lectin Levels and Severe Outcome in Critically Ill Patients with Pandemic Influenza Type A (H1N1) Infection,2017-12-22,"How circulating inflammatory mediators change upon sepsis progression has not been studied. We studied the follow-up changes of circulating vasoactive peptides and cytokines until the improvement or the worsening of a patient and progression into specific organ dysfunctions. In a prospective study, concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFNγ), endocan and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) were measured in serum by an enzyme immunoassay in 175 patients at baseline; this was repeated within 24 h upon progression into new organ dysfunction (n = 141) or improvement (n = 34). Endocan and Ang-2 were the only parameters that were significantly increased among patients who worsened. Any increase of endocan was associated with worsening with odds ratio 16.65 (p < 0.0001). This increase was independently associated with progression into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as shown after logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 2.91, p: 0.002). Changes of circulating cytokines do not mediate worsening of the critically ill patients. Instead endocan and Ang2 are increased and this may be interpreted as a key-playing role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and septic shock. Any increase of endocan is a surrogate of worsening of the clinical course.","Ioakeimidou, A.; Pagalou, E.; Kontogiorgi, M.; Antoniadou, E.; Kaziani, K.; Psaroulis, K.; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E.

10486,Clinical efficacy and safety of polymyxins based versus non-polymyxins based therapies in the infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-04-21,"BACKGROUND: Patients with oncologic diseases, particularly those with hematologic malignancies, are at an increased risk of common infections and unique treatment-related complications with high mortality and morbidity. The annual incidence and prevalence of cancer in Germany is rising. Although modern treatments have generally led to improved survival, increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty of the patients require multidisciplinary strategies for handling complex therapeutic concepts and treatment of the associated complications. METHODS: A selective literature search and guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hämatologie und Medizinische Onkologie, DGHO), the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the DGHO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Infektionen in der Hämatologie und Onkologie, AGIHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) formed the basis of this study. CONCLUSION: Recognition of severe infections in cancer patients and their discrimination from treatment-associated complications is a challenge. Neutropenic fever is the most frequent infectious emergency in oncology. Early empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and escalated diagnostic strategies are needed to successfully treat this vulnerable patient group. In this article, a range of potentially life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients are discussed.","Juarso, Andreas Edwin; Kiehl, Malte; Buchholz, Markus; Weißinger, Florian",Wien Klin Mag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175641/,165
10559,Retinopathy of prematurity in Rwanda: a prospective multi-centre study following introduction of screening and treatment services,2019-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV), compared to spontaneous breathing (SB), has been found to increase abdominal edema and inflammation in experimental sepsis. Our hypothesis was that in primary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) MV would enhance inflammation and edema in the abdomen. METHODS: Thirteen piglets were randomized into two groups (SB and MV) after the induction of ARDS by lung lavage and 1 h of injurious ventilation. 1. SB: continuous positive airway pressure 15 cmH(2)O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) 0.5 and respiratory rate (RR) maintained at about 40 cycles min(− 1) by titrating remifentanil infusion. 2. MV: volume control, tidal volume 6 ml kg(− 1), positive end-expiratory pressure 15 cmH(2)O, RR 40 cycles min(− 1), FIO(2) 0.5. Main outcomes: abdominal edema, assessed by tissues histopathology and wet-dry weight; abdominal inflammation, assessed by cytokine concentration in tissues, blood and ascites, and tissue histopathology. RESULTS: The groups did not show significant differences in hemodynamic or respiratory parameters. Moreover, edema and inflammation in the abdominal organs were similar. However, blood IL6 increased in the MV group in all vascular beds (p < 0.001). In addition, TNFα ratio in blood increased through the lungs in MV group (+ 26% ± 3) but decreased in the SB group (− 17% ± 3). CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between the MV and SB group for abdominal edema or inflammation. However, the systemic increase in IL6 and the TNFα increase through the lungs suggest that MV, in this model, was harmful to the lungs.","Marchesi, Silvia; Hedenstierna, Göran; Hata, Aki; Feinstein, Ricardo; Larsson, Anders; Larsson, Anders Olof; Lipcsey, Miklós",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7183610/,165

10835,Coronavirus disease: challenges for psychiatry,2020-04-15,"ABSTRACT: Morus genus plants are mainly distributed in the temperate to tropical areas over the world and include 17 species and two subspecies. Due to their excellent pharmacological activity, security in food additives and high value in the national economy, Morus genus plants have drawn more and more attention in recent years. In the light of the references published over the last few decades, flavonoids, benzofurans, stilbenes, and Diels–Alder adducts have been reported to be the main bioactive constituents of Morus genus plants. This review summarizes the compounds with excellent bioactivities isolated from Morus genus plants as well as their structure–activity relationships (SARs), which might be useful for the further research and development of Morus genus plants.

12650,Experience with Temporary Centrifugal Pump Bi-ventricular Assist Device for Pediatric Acute Heart Failure: Comparison with ECMO,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND: Sheeppox and goatpox are both economically important animal diseases in which pathogens are goatpox virus (GTPV) and sheeppox virus (SPPV). They can’t cause cross-species infection between sheep and goats in general. But in recent decades, the infection of sheep by goatpox or goats by sheeppox has been reported. The literature has indicated that the occurrence of these cases has a significant and direct relationship with mutations of ankyrin genes families (ANK genes 010,138,140,141.2,145) located in two-terminal regions of capripoxvirus genomes. So it is very important to decipher these nucleotides and their coding amino acid sequences of the five genes regarded as host range and virulence factors for effective prevention and control of capripoxvirus diseases. METHODS: In this study, all the ankyrin genes of three goatpox virus, two sheeppox virus, and one GTPV vaccine strains from Nanjiang areas of Xinjiang province of China during 2010–2011 were collected, amplified, cloned and sequenced. The sequence of every ankyrin genes has been compared with not only sequences from six viruses but also all sequences from three species of capripoxvirus genus from Gene bank, and every ANK gene’s mutated nucleotides and amino acids have been screened, and the relationship of genetic evolution among different virus strains has been analyzed, as well as the domain architecture of these genes was forecasted and analyzed. RESULTS: The six capripoxvirus strains can be well-distinguished GTPV and SPPV based on five ANK genes’ sequence identicalness except for GTPV-SS strain, which showed higher identicalness with SPPV. The ANK gene sequence of the GTPV-SS strain was 100% identical with SPPV-M1 (ANK138,140,145) and SPPV-M2 (ANK138,145), respectively. Phylogenetically, these six capripoxvirus strains were also grouped into the same cluster of India reference strains in lineages and showed extreme identical conservative or variable regions with India capripoxvirus isolates by sequence alignment. Moreover, for the functional domains, these ANK genes of capripoxvirus except for ANK gene 145, are identical in size, and ANK genes 145 of SPPV are usually 100 bp (approximately 30 aa) longer than those of GTPV and eventually form a PRANC domain at C-terminus. CONCLUSIONS: The isolated strain of GTPV-SS may be a cross-species infection or the collected material was contaminated, and the inferred Capripox outbreak in Xinjiang in 2010 can be introduced from India. ANK genes 138,140,141.2 and 145 of capripoxvirus can be used as the target genes to identify GTPV and SPPV. Moreover, the four ANK genes determining the host range are more significant than the ANK gene 010. These ANK genes play combining roles for their function.","He, Chuanchuan; Tong, Jianjun; Zhang, Xueping; Tuohetiniyazi, Milikaimu; Zhang, Yu; Li, Youwen",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453672/,165
14182,Saturation oxygenation pressure index: a non-invasive bedside measure for severity of respiratory disease in neonates on CPAP,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal conditions are managed within primary care, but patients can be referred to secondary care if a specialist opinion is required. The ever-increasing demand for health care resources emphasizes the need to streamline care pathways with the ultimate aim of ensuring that patients receive timely and optimal care. Information contained in referral letters underpins the referral decision-making process but is yet to be explored systematically for the purposes of treatment prioritization for musculoskeletal conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the feasibility of using natural language processing and machine learning to automate the triage of patients with musculoskeletal conditions by analyzing information from referral letters. Specifically, we aim to determine whether referral letters can be automatically assorted into latent topics that are clinically relevant, that is, considered relevant when prescribing treatments. Here, clinical relevance is assessed by posing 2 research questions. Can latent topics be used to automatically predict treatment? Can clinicians interpret latent topics as cohorts of patients who share common characteristics or experiences such as medical history, demographics, and possible treatments? METHODS: We used latent Dirichlet allocation to model each referral letter as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics and model each topic as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. The topic model was evaluated in the context of automating patient triage. Given a set of treatment outcomes, a binary classifier was trained for each outcome using previously extracted topics as the input features of the machine learning algorithm. In addition, a qualitative evaluation was performed to assess the human interpretability of topics. RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of binary classifiers outperformed the stratified random classifier by a large margin, indicating that topic modeling could be used to predict the treatment, thus effectively supporting patient triage. The qualitative evaluation confirmed the high clinical interpretability of the topic model. CONCLUSIONS: The results established the feasibility of using natural language processing and machine learning to automate triage of patients with knee or hip pain by analyzing information from their referral letters.","Spasic, Irena; Button, Kate",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7679210/,165
15148,Bacterial contamination of neonatal intensive care units: How safe are the neonates?,2021-01-30,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, many CRC patients are still being diagnosed at an advanced stage of the cancer, and the 5-year survival rate is only ~30%. Effective prognostic markers of CRC are therefore urgently needed. To address this issue, we performed a detailed bioinformatics analysis based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to identify prognostic biomarkers for CRC, which in turn help in exploring potential drug-repurposing. We identified five hub genes (PGM2, PODXL, RHNO1, SCD, and SEPHS1), which had good performance in survival prediction and might be involved in CRC through three key pathways (“Cell cycle,” “Purine metabolism,” and “Spliceosome” KEGG pathways) identified by a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. What is more, we performed a co-expression analysis between five hub genes and transcription factors to explore the upstream regulatory region. Furthermore, we screened the potential drug-repurposing for the five hub genes in CRC according to the Binding DB and ZINC15 databases. Taking together, we constructed a five-gene signature to predict overall survival of CRC and found the potential drug-repurposing, which may improve the outcome of CRC in the future.","Yang, Feng; Cai, Shaoyi; Ling, Li; Zhang, Haiji; Tao, Liang; Wang, Qin",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7848190/,165
16449,Early extubation after left ventricular assist device implantation in a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a case report,2021-03-29,"BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a major complication in stroke survivors, especially in elderly stroke survivors. But there are still no objective methods to diagnose depression in elderly stroke survivors. Thus, this study was conducted to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing elderly PSD subjects. METHODS: Elderly (60 years or older) stroke survivors with depression were assigned into the PSD group, and elderly stroke survivors without depression and elderly healthy controls (HCs) were assigned into the non-depressed group. Urinary metabolite signatures obtained from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic platform were collected. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were used to find the differential urinary metabolites between the two groups. RESULTS: The 78 elderly HCs, 122 elderly stroke survivors without depression and 124 elderly PSD subjects were included. A set of 13 differential urinary metabolites responsible for distinguishing PSD subjects from non-depressed subjects were found. The Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism and Galactose metabolism were found to be significantly changed in elderly PSD subjects. The phenylalanine was significantly negatively correlated with age and depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, a biomarker panel consisting of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, sucrose, palmitic acid, glyceric acid, azelaic acid and α-aminobutyric acid was identified. CONCLUSION: These results provided candidate molecules for developing objective methods to diagnose depression in elderly stroke survivors, suggested that taking supplements of phenylalanine might be an effective method to prevent depression in elderly stroke survivors, and would be helpful for future revealing the pathophysiological mechanism of PSD.","Chen, Jin; Lv, Yan-ni; Li, Xiao-bing; Xiong, Jia-jun; Liang, Hui-ting; Xie, Liang; Wan, Chen-yi; Chen, Yun-qing; Wang, Han-sen; Liu, Pan; zheng, He-qing",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8007561/,165
17926,A systematic review of biomarkers in Takotsubo syndrome: A focus on better understanding the pathophysiology,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience significant medical and psychological stressors that affect their mental health, well-being, and disease outcomes. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used in other patient populations and has demonstrated clinical benefits. Although evidence-based, nonpharmacological interventions for pain management are widely used in other populations, these treatments have not been well studied in SCD. Currently, there are no adequately powered large-scale clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and dissemination potential of behavioral pain management for adults with SCD. Furthermore, some important details regarding behavioral therapies in SCD remain unclear—in particular, what works best for whom and when. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of two smartphone–delivered programs for reducing SCD pain symptoms: digital CBT versus pain and SCD education (Education). Our secondary goal is to assess whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain outcomes. We hypothesize that digital CBT will confer greater benefits on pain outcomes and depressive symptoms at 6 months and a greater reduction in health care use (eg, opioid prescriptions or refills or acute care visits) over 12 months. METHODS: The CaRISMA (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real-time Pain Management Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications) study is a multisite comparative effectiveness trial funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. CaRISMA is conducted at six clinical academic sites, in partnership with four community-based organizations. CaRISMA will evaluate the effectiveness of two 12-week health coach–supported digital health programs with a total of 350 participants in two groups: CBT (n=175) and Education (n=175). Participants will complete a series of questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome will be the change in pain interference between the study arms. We will also evaluate changes in pain intensity, depressive symptoms, other patient-reported outcomes, and health care use as secondary outcomes. We have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.37 SDs between study arms on 6-month changes in the outcomes with 15% expected attrition at 6 months. An exploratory analysis will examine whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of the intervention on pain interference. RESULTS: This study will be conducted from March 2021 through February 2022, with results expected to be available in February 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCD experience significant disease burden, psychosocial stress, and impairment of their quality of life. CaRISMA proposes to leverage digital technology and overcome barriers to the routine use of behavioral treatments for pain and depressive symptoms in the treatment of adults with SCD. The study will provide data on the comparative effectiveness of digital CBT and Education approaches and evaluate the potential for implementing evidence-based behavioral interventions to manage SCD pain.

18300,Risk factors for acute kidney injury in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia,2021-06-12,"Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are vital regulators of biological activities, and aberrant levels of small ncRNAs are commonly found in precancerous lesions and cancer. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a novel type of small ncRNA initially discovered in germ cells that have a specific length (24–31 nucleotides), bind to PIWI proteins, and show 2′-O-methyl modification at the 3′-end. Numerous studies have revealed that piRNAs can play important roles in tumorigenesis via multiple biological regulatory mechanisms, including silencing transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene processes and accelerating multiprotein interactions. piRNAs are emerging players in the malignant transformation of normal cells and participate in the regulation of cancer hallmarks. Most of the specific cancer hallmarks regulated by piRNAs are involved in sustaining proliferative signaling, resistance to cell death or apoptosis, and activation of invasion and metastasis. Additionally, piRNAs have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and have great potential for clinical utility. However, research on the underlying mechanisms of piRNAs in cancer is limited. Here, we systematically reviewed recent advances in the biogenesis and biological functions of piRNAs and relevant bioinformatics databases with the aim of providing insights into cancer diagnosis and clinical applications. We also focused on some cancer hallmarks rarely reported to be related to piRNAs, which can promote in-depth research of piRNAs in molecular biology and facilitate their clinical translation into cancer treatment.","Chen, Silu; Ben, Shuai; Xin, Junyi; Li, Shuwei; Zheng, Rui; Wang, Hao; Fan, Lulu; Du, Mulong; Zhang, Zhengdong; Wang, Meilin",J Hematol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199808/,165

21104,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio predict length of hospital stay in myocarditis,2021-09-13,"Objective: The study aims to establish an magnetic resonance imaging radiomics signature-based nomogram for predicting the progression-free survival of intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus radiofrequency ablation Materials and Methods: A total of 113 intermediate and advanced HCC patients treated with TACE and RFA were eligible for this study. Patients were classified into a training cohort (n = 78 cases) and a validation cohort (n = 35 cases). Radiomics features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1W images by analysis kit software. Dimension reduction was conducted to select optimal features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A rad-score was calculated and used to classify the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups and further integrated into multivariate Cox analysis. Two prediction models based on radiomics signature combined with or without clinical factors and a clinical model based on clinical factors were developed. A nomogram comcined radiomics signature and clinical factors were established and the concordance index (C-index) was used for measuring discrimination ability of the model, calibration curve was used for measuring calibration ability, and decision curve and clinical impact curve are used for measuring clinical utility. Results: Eight radiomics features were selected by LASSO, and the cut-off of the Rad-score was 1.62. The C-index of the radiomics signature for PFS was 0.646 (95%: 0.582–0.71) in the training cohort and 0.669 (95% CI:0.572–0.766) in validation cohort. The median PFS of the low-risk group [30.4 (95% CI: 19.41–41.38)] months was higher than that of the high-risk group [8.1 (95% CI: 4.41–11.79)] months in the training cohort (log rank test, z = 16.58, p < 0.001) and was verified in the validation cohort. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that BCLC stage [hazard ratio (HR): 2.52, 95% CI: 1.42–4.47, p = 0.002], AFP level (HR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.01–3.99 p = 0.046), time interval (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26–0.87, p = 0.016) and radiomics signature (HR 2.98, 95% CI: 1.60–5.51, p = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors of PFS in the training cohort. The C-index of the combined model in the training cohort was higher than that of clinical model for PFS prediction [0.722 (95% CI: 0.657–0.786) vs. 0.669 (95% CI: 0.657–0.786), p＜0.001]. Similarly, The C-index of the combined model in the validation cohort, was higher than that of clinical model [0.821 (95% CI: 0.726–0.915) vs. 0.76 (95% CI: 0.667–0.851), p = 0.004]. The calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to accurately predict the PFS of patients. Conclusion: The radiomics signature was a prognostic risk factor, and a nomogram combined radiomics and clinical factors acts as a new strategy for predicted the PFS of intermediate and advanced HCC treated with TACE plus RFA.","Fang, Shiji; Lai, Linqiang; Zhu, Jinyu; Zheng, Liyun; Xu, Yuanyuan; Chen, Weiqian; Wu, Fazong; Wu, Xulu; Chen, Minjiang; Weng, Qiaoyou; Ji, Jiansong; Zhao, Zhongwei; Tu, Jianfei",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8439353/,165

25154,Innate Immune Responses in Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia,2012-10-26,"It has been well established that human pathogenic viruses may be transmitted through the marine environment due to the release of sewage by polluted rivers, outfalls, or release from vessels. These wastes contain human enteric viruses, which if ingested, or in some cases inhaled, can cause a wide variety of illnesses. Their ability to be transmitted by this route is because of their capability to remain infectious long enough in the marine environment to come in contact with a susceptible host. Transmission routes may be fairly direct, such as ingested of contaminated seawater by a swimmer, or more complex by prolonged survival in sediments which are later resuspended and accumulated in shellfish during feeding. The virus is then transmitted during consumption of the shellfish. To understand the potential for human enteric virus transmission through the marine environment numerous studies have been conducted on factors which influence their persistence in this environment (Table 6.1). This reviewfocuses on factors that could play a role in the survival of human pathogenic viruses in the marine environment.","Gerba, Charles P.",Oceans and Health: Pathogens in the Marine Environment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121678/,165

32126,Reappraisal on pharmacological and mechanical treatments of heart failure,2020-05-06,"A new genus of monostiliferous hoplonemerteans, Pantinonemertes gen. nov., provides evidence for the separate evolution of terrestrial nemerteans. The genus is established for two new species found in Australia, P. enalios sp. nov., an intertidal form, and P. winsori sp. nov., which lives in fallen timber in the supralittoral brackish water regions of mangrove swamps. One only of the known species of land nemerteans, Geonemertes agricola from Bermuda, closely resembles these two species morphologically and is transferred to the new genus as Pantinonemertes agricola. A re‐examination of all the known species of Geonemertes has shown that two major groups can be distinguished on the basis of morphological characters. In one group the rhynchocoel musculature is in two distinct layers, a frontal organ is present, the mid‐dorsal blood vessel has a single vascular plug, and the flame cells are binucleate and reinforced with cuticular support bars. It comprises the genus Pantinonemertes gen, nov, and the Pelaensis or Indopacific group of terrestrial nemerteans, for which the generic name Geonemertes is retained. In the second major group the rhynchocoel musculature is composed of interwoven longitudinal and circular fibres, there is no frontal organ, the mid‐dorsal blood vessel bears two vascular plugs, and the flame cells are mononucleate and lack support bars. Five genera, three of which are new, are distinguished in this group. Australian species are united in the genus Argonemertes gen. nov., and New Zealand forms comprise the genus Antiponemertes gen. nov., while Acteonemertes bathamae from New Zealand and the Auckland and Ocean Islands remains in a separate genus. Geonemertes nightingaleensis is transferred to a new genus, Katechonemertes gen. nov., and for Geonemertes chalicophora a previously used generic name, Leptonemertes, is adopted. A key to the terrestrial, brackish‐water and marine nemertean species described in the present paper is provided.","Moore, Janet; Gibson, Ray",J Zool (1987),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194227/,165

On top of today’s comprehensive eScience infrastructure, it enables the automated generation of possible workflows for a given specification. However, functionality for automated workflow composition tends to be integrated with one of the many available workflow management systems, and is thus difficult or impossible to apply in other environments. Therefore we have developed APE (the Automated Pipeline Explorer) as a command-line tool and API for automated composition of scientific workflows. APE is easily configured to a new application domain by providing it with a domain ontology and semantically annotated tools. It can then be used to synthesize purpose-specific workflows based on a specification of the available workflow inputs, desired outputs and possibly additional constraints. The workflows can further be transformed into executable implementations and/or exported into standard workflow formats. In this paper we describe APE v1.0 and discuss lessons learned from applications in bioinformatics and geosciences.","Kasalica, Vedran; Lamprecht, Anna-Lena",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304703/,165

41738,O04 Large vessel vasculitis related to COVID-19 infection,2020-11-03,"Existing literature recognizes the possible role of trade policy and firms’ exposure to international trade as determinants of productivity. A strand of the literature sheds light on the effects of trade policy changes on firm-level productivity. Another strand studies the relationship between firms’ trade status (exporting production or importing intermediates, but usually not both simultaneously) and firm-level TFP dynamics. However, the analyses that integrate both strands are scarce. This paper aims to disentangle the impact of input and output tariffs on firms’ productivity. Further, it analyses whether the impact of changes in tariffs is conditioned by the trade status of the firm (exporting and/or importing). At difference to most previous papers, we carry out our analysis for a large developing country in a period of slow trade liberalization. Thus, in the empirical part, we use data from firms belonging to Brazilian industrial sectors (manufacturing and mining) during 2000–2008. After estimating total factor productivity (TFP) at the firm level using updated methodologies, we estimate both the impact of trade policy and firms’ trade status on TFP dynamics. Our results suggest that trade liberalization (through reductions in input or output tariffs) increases TFP, being the effect associated to a reduction in input tariffs greater. Furthermore, the impact of trade policy on TFP spreads among all firms, which could be consistent with the existence of spillovers from trading firms to non-trading firms or with the notion that trade liberalization exerts competitive pressure on all firms, regardless of their initial exposure to international trade. Finally, we also find evidence of a positive effect of both the import and export statuses on TFP.","Cirera, Xavier; Lederman, Daniel; Máñez Castillejo, Juan A.; Rochina Barrachina, María E.; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.",Econ Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7641872/,165

Crucial mechanisms involved in sarcopenia-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) interplay are based on effects of insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and crosstalk between organs by secretion of cytokines (hepatokines, adipokines, and myokines). Currently, published studies confirm the association of sarcopenia with the degree of NAFLD defined by liver histology. However, prospective studies that will give us information regarding the causal effect of NAFLD and sarcopenia are still needed. Furthermore, there is a need for a patient-friendly, noninvasive, low-cost method for detection of loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in the context of NAFLD. Moreover, potential treatment strategies such as physical exercise and nutritional supplementation, that are usually a part of management of sarcopenia, should also be investigated in NAFLD patients, especially given the fact that for now, we do not have a good treatment option for NAFLD. Therefore, future investigations should combine studies on NAFLD and sarcopenia in terms of physical activity and nutritional interventions such as vitamin D supplementation. This review aims to report recent evidence concerning the links between sarcopenia and NAFLD and methods to assess sarcopenia.","Mikolasevic, Ivana; Pavic, Tajana; Kanizaj, Tajana Filipec; Bender, Darija Vranesic; Domislovic, Viktor; Krznaric, Zeljko",Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7652636/,165

Advancements in information technologies and the availability of affordable electronic devices have brought forth the ability to use virtual platforms to host funeral services for those unable to be with their loved ones. The aim of this study was to identify existing and potential online platforms for hosting a virtual funeral, explore the safety considerations of hosting a service during the pandemic and share the experiences of individuals who have previously hosted a virtual service. To conduct the research, an environmental scan was undertaken searching academic, grey literature and online websites. The results showed that there are currently several online platforms made specifically for virtual services and many free public platforms that can be used. Death services must ensure staff who are in direct contact with the deceased have proper Personal Protective Equipment and companies must adhere to regulations regarding group gatherings, screening for symptoms and physical distancing. Some individuals expressed having a positive experience, stating that the virtual service felt more intimate, while others expressed difficulty in navigating the technology, particularly the older adult attendees. Virtual funeral services may prove to be a practical and safer alternative during COVID-19 and may provide some comfort for those facing such challenging times. By examining existing platforms and their use, an opportunity exists to generate recommendations for additional supports, particularly for older adults.","Muturi, Ivy; Freeman, Shannon; Banner-Lukaris, Davina",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741923/,165

Incorrect feature associations result in faulty position estimates and risk integrity of vehicle localization. Depending on the number and kind of available localization landmarks, there is only a limited guarantee for correct data association due to various ambiguities. In this work, a new data association approach is introduced for feature-based vehicle localization which relies on the extraction and use of unique geometric patterns of localization features. In a preprocessing step, the map is searched for unique patterns that are formed by localization landmarks. These are stored in a so called codebook, which is then used online for data association. By predetermining constellations that are unique in a given map section, an online guarantee for reliable data association can be given under certain assumptions on sensor faults. The approach is demonstrated on a map containing cylindrical objects which were extracted from LiDAR data. The evaluation of a localization drive of about 10 min using various codebooks both demonstrates the feasibility as well as limitations of the approach.","Hofstetter, Isabell; Springer, Malte; Ries, Florian; Haueis, Martin",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972683/,165

METHODS: This retrospective study includede caregivers of children ages 2–18 years old with Cystic Fibrosis who had Ohio residency, a Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) above 30% and consumed at least half of nutrient needs by mouth. After contacting all eligible households by phone, 30 subjects (50% response) enrolled. The validated 18 item Food Security survey module along with several supplemental questions was used to assess household food security status before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A medical chart review collected demographics as well as weight (kg) and FEV(1)(%) for the visit closest to the start of the pandemic (Jan-Mar 2020) and the most current visit (July-Dec 2020). Change in weight was categorized as desirable/undesirable based on clinic standards for using the fiftieth percentile as desirable. A paired t-test was used to determine change in FEV(1) since the pandemic. Changes in food security status in relation to change in weight and change in FEV(1) were determined using Fisher's test and Welch's t-test, respectively. RESULTS: Participants were caregivers of children who were 9.96 ± 5.02 years old, 56% female, and 83% Caucasian. Ten % of participants (n = 3) reported household food insecurity before the pandemic, which increased to thirty % (n = 9) after the pandemic. Fifty percent of participants (n = 15) experienced an undesirable weight gain (2.71 kg ± 6.32 kg; mean ± std dev). There was no change in FEV(1) during the pandemic (−0.6% ± 9.02; P = .74). Changes in weight and FEV(1) were not related to change in household food security status (P = 0.287 and P = .088 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, it was not related to undesirable weight change or decrease in FEV(1).

Video visits are preferred over phone visits but determinants of video visit uptake in HIV care settings have not been well described. METHODS: Trends in type of encounter (face-to-face, video, and phone) before and during the pandemic were reviewed for persons with HIV (PWH) at an urban, academic, outpatient HIV clinic in Seattle, WA. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with video visit use including sociodemographic characteristics (age, race, ethnicity, language, insurance status, housing status) and electronic patient portal login. RESULTS: After an initial increase in video visits to 30% of all completed encounters, the proportion declined and plateaued at approximately 10%. A substantial proportion of face-to-face visits were replaced by phone visits (approximately 50% of all visits were by phone early in the pandemic, now stable at 10 to 20%). Logistic regression demonstrated that older age (>50 or >65 years old compared to 18 to 35 years old), Black, Asian, or Pacific Islander race (compared to White race), and Medicaid insurance (compared to private insurance) were significantly associated with never completing a video visit, whereas history of patient portal login was significantly associated with completing a video visit. CONCLUSIONS: Since the pandemic began, an unexpectedly high proportion of telemedicine visits have been by phone instead of video. Several social determinants of health and patient portal usage are associated with video visit uptake.","Wood, Brian R; Lan, Kristine F; Tao, Yuan; Mose, Eric Y; Aas, Erin; Budak, Jehan Z; Dhanireddy, Shireesha; Kim, H Nina",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500015/,165

To assess whether the ES has contributed to reconcile economic and social objectives, we measured, through the distance to frontier (DTF) score methodology, the distance of each member country from a benchmark based on EU aims and values defined in the EU treaties. Results show that EU member countries are far from the benchmark and CSRs have not prevented a progressive deterioration of stability and cohesion from an economic, political and social perspective. A content analysis of the CSRs issued from 2011 to 2018 and a comparison with the DTF scores reveal a weak connection between member countries’ performance and CSRs. Despite the social content of many CSRs, we actually observe a “commodification” of their goals. CSRs promote a society functional to flexible and competitive markets, and compatible with the requirements of fiscal discipline and sustainability. This neoliberal approach apparently played a role in the EU deterioration and makes the “socialization” of the ES a process with ambiguous implications for European citizens.

This process affects over 1 million patients annually within the specialty of family medicine. The purpose of this project was to implement a structured, year-end reassignment system in a family medicine residency program. METHODS Our structured reassignment process took place from December 2017 through June 2020. Panel lists of current, active patients were generated and residents were responsible for reassigning their own panels during a panel reassignment night. We created a tip sheet that addressed patient complexity and continuity, a risk stratification algorithm based on patients' medical and social complexity, and a tool that tracked the number of patients assigned to each future provider. Outcome measures included a resident satisfaction survey administered in 2018-2020 and patient-provider continuity measured with a run chart from December 2016 through August 2020. RESULTS The resident survey response rate was 75%. Seventy-three percent felt the panel reassignment night was very helpful; 87% thought the reassignment timeline was extremely reasonable, and 87% indicated that they had the necessary information to reassign their patients. Residents also felt confident that their patients were reassigned appropriately (33% extremely confident, 67% somewhat confident). Patient continuity improved with a 13-point run above the median, indicating nonrandom variation. Patient continuity remained above the median until the impact of COVID-19 in April 2020.

Dermatology is a field that especially lends itself to this method of care, as many common dermatological diagnoses can be made upon visual inspection. With social distancing becoming the new standard in this age of COVID-19, telemedicine emerges as a key tool in continuing patient care without interruption. In this pilot study, we examine the reliability of acne vulgaris diagnostic assessments made via patient-taken photos compared to in-office assessments in patients between the ages of 16 and 23 with mild to moderate acne. Fourteen patient encounters were clinically examined for three outcomes: inflammatory lesions, noninflammatory acne lesions, and facial nodules. On the same day patient outcomes were counted and recorded in-person, patients were instructed to photograph their faces.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the third bariatric procedure after previous attempts resulted in inadequate results. METHODS We retrospectively identified patients who underwent a third bariatric procedure for inadequate weight loss or significant weight regain after the second operation. Data were analyzed to establish patient demographic characteristics, perioperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS A total of 12 patients were identified. Before the first, second, and third procedures, patients had a mean body mass index of 67.1±29.3 kg/m2, 60.9±28.3 kg/m2, and 49.4±19.8 kg/m2, respectively. The third operations (laparoscopic in 10 and open in 2) included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n=5), revision of pouch and/or stoma of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n=3), limb lengthening after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n=3), and sleeve gastrectomy (n=1). We encountered 5 early complications in 4 patients, and early reoperative intervention was needed in 2 patients. At 1-year follow-up, the excess weight loss of the cohort was 49.4%±33.8%. After a mean follow-up time of 43.0±28.6 months, the body mass index of the cohort reached 39.9±20.8 kg/m2, which corresponded to a mean excess weight loss of 54.4%±44.0% from the third operation. At the latest follow-up, 64% of patients had excess weight loss>50% and 45% had excess weight loss>80%. CONCLUSION Reoperative bariatric surgery can be carried out successfully (often laparoscopically), even after 2 previous weight loss procedures.","Daigle, Christopher R; Aminian, Ali; Romero-Talamás, Héctor; Corcelles, Ricard; Mackey, Jennifer; Rogula, Tomasz; Brethauer, Stacy A; Schauer, Philip R",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392664/,165

Utilizing principles of single-incision laparoscopic surgery, this novel minimally invasive approach optimizes access for safe and complete removal of these lesions without the need for a formal rectal resection. We describe our technique and early outcomes with TEVA excision. METHODS Between March 2010 and September 2011, TEVA excision was performed for patients presenting for management of rectal lesions not amenable to colonoscopic or standard transanal removal. Patients were selected if they presented with benign disease or superficial adenocarcinoma, and the proximal extent of the lesion extended beyond 8 cm from the anal verge. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were assessed. A SILS™ port was placed in the anal canal for access in all cases. Standard laparoscopic instruments were utilized for visualization, full-thickness transanal excision, and primary closure. RESULTS Twenty patients (50% male) with a mean age of 64.6 ± 10.9 years, mean body mass index of 28.2 ± 4.9 kg/m(2), and median American Society of Anesthesiologist score of 2 underwent TEVA excision. Fourteen patients (70%) presented with benign disease and six patients (30%) presented with malignant disease. The mean size of the lesions was 3.0 ± 1.4 cm, and the mean distance from the anal verge was 10.6 ± 2.4 cm. All excisions were successfully completed with a mean operative time of 79.8 ± 25.1 (range, 45-135) min. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.1 ± 0.7 (range, 0-3) days. CONCLUSIONS TEVA excision is a safe and feasible approach for local excision of rectal lesions not otherwise amenable to standard techniques. Continued investigation and development will be important to establish its role in minimally invasive colorectal surgery.","Ragupathi, Madhu; Vande Maele, Dominique; Nieto, Javier; Pickron, T Bartley; Haas, Eric M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2399-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22729706/,165

Data from independent groups have identified that platelets are hyperreactive during COVID-19. Platelet hyperreactivity is accompanied by changes in platelet gene expression, and enhanced interactions between platelets and leukocytes. In some patients, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA has been detected in platelets. Together, this suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with platelets. However, controversy remains on which receptors mediate SARS-CoV-2 platelet interactions. Most, but not all, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses fail to observe the putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme-2, or the cellular serine protease necessary for viral entry, TMPRSS2, on platelets and megakaryocytes. Interestingly, platelets express other known SARS-CoV-2 receptors, which induce similar patterns of activation to those observed when platelets are incubated with SARS-CoV-2. This Forum Article explores these findings, and discusses ongoing areas of controversy and uncertainty with regards to SARS-CoV-2 platelet interactions.","Campbell, Robert A; Boilard, Eric; Rondina, Matthew T",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119197/,165

METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Food and Technology Abstracts databases were searched until 24 September 2018. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after studies or interrupted time studies comparing deworming with no intervention or placebo in non-pregnant adolescent girls and women 10 to 49 years old. Outcomes of interest included parasite load, reinfection, anaemia, severe anaemia, iron deficiency, diarrhoea or all-cause morbidity. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS We included four RCTs of mass deworming involving 1086 participants, in the analyses. Mass deworming probably reduces the prevalence of roundworm infection (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.62; 2 trials; 1498 participants, moderate certainty evidence), prevalence of hookworm infection (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.59; 2 trials; 1498 participants, moderate certainty evidence), prevalence of whipworm infection (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; 2 trials; 1498 participants, moderate certainty evidence) compared to the control group. Deworming may make little or no difference in prevalence of anaemia (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.11, 3 studies, 683 participants, low certainty evidence) and prevalence of iron-deficiency (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.23, 1 study, 186 participants, low certainty evidence) compared to control. We are uncertain whether deworming reduces the prevalence of severe anaemia compared to control as the certainty of evidence was very low. None of the included studies assessed screen and treat deworming or reported reinfection, diarrhoea or adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Mass deworming probably reduces the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections but may have little or no effect on anaemia and iron-deficiency in adolescent girls and non-pregnant women in comparison to no intervention or placebo. We are uncertain about the effect on severe anaemia. These results are limited by sparse data and the moderate to very low quality of evidence available.

It includes many new laparoscopic techniques (LESS, SILS, hybrid NOTES), but data concerning common bile duct (CBD) lesions are unavailable. AIM To establish the new technique of minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy (MCh): non-visible scar intervention without increasing the risk of CBD lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty consecutive patients with symptomatic gallbladder lithiasis were qualified for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCh) using one 10/11 mm umbilical port, one 5 mm right suprapubic port and two minilaparoscopic, disposable, no-port graspers. There were 26 women and 14 men, with the mean age 56 (17-72) years and with the average body mass index 28 (18-33) kg/m(2). CO2 Veress 15 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum was performed after transumbilical incision, and the first 10/11 mm port was inserted at the beginning for the 5 mm laparoscope and finally for typical instruments. Next under camera control, a 5 mm trocar was inserted in the right 'bikini line'. To this port the laparoscope was relocated from the umbilicus, and under its control two minilaparoscopic, disposable, non-port graspers were introduced after small, 2 mm skin incisions in the right anterior axillary line and in the right mesogastrium to catch the gallbladder. Next through the umbilical port, using typical instruments, the cystic duct and artery were dissected, clipped and cut. The gallbladder was removed through the umbilical port whole. RESULTS There was no conversion to open cholecystectomy. In 5 cases drainage of the gallbladder lodge was necessary through a 5 mm port in the right bikini line. The time of the intervention ranged from 90 min during the introduction of the new method to 50 min for the last procedures. No postoperative complications were observed, and all patients were discharged at the same time as after conventional LCh. CONCLUSIONS Two-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed with two minilaparoscopic no-port graspers does not increase the risk of CBD lesions. It provides an excellent cosmetic effect and is very convenient for the surgeon like typical LCh.","Wróblewski, Tadeusz M; Kobryń, Konrad; Nazarewski, Łukasz; Dec, Marta; Ziarkiewicz-Wróblewska, Bogna; Krawczyk, Marek",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2015.52706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26240613/,165

Restrictive measures included social distancing, home confinement and the closure of all public structures like gyms and swimming pools. The impact of these limitations on health and lifestyle was inevitably negative. The purpose of this study was to establish the level of physical activity (PA), expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) in a Southern Italian population before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was published on the official website of the National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS S. de Bellis, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy and on several social media in May 2020. RESULTS Three hundred ten replies (72% women) from Apulia (60%), Calabria (28%), Campania (11%) and Sicily (1%) were included in the study. The COVID-19 lockdown had a negative effect on the vigorous PA intensity level and on walking, but not on the moderate PA intensity level. Additionally, daily time spent sitting down increased by more than 12% during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS Isolation changed PA behaviors. The decreased energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) during the lockdown had a negative impact in both genders, especially on the young adults and adults' groups.","Franco, Isabella; Bianco, Antonella; Bonfiglio, Caterina; Sorino, Paolo; Mirizzi, Antonella; Campanella, Angelo; Buongiorno, Claudia; Liuzzi, Rosalba; Osella, Alberto R",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.20.11536-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570347/,165
85164,Response to dopamine in prematurity: a biomarker for brain injury?,2016,"INTRODUCTION Children, with their specific vulnerabilities and needs, make up to more than 20% of society, so they are at risk of getting involved in disasters. Are the specialists treating them for medical problems in daily life also capable to deal with them in disaster situations? HYPOTHESIS/PROBLEM The goals of this study were to evaluate perceived knowledge and capability of tertiary pediatricians to deal with disasters, to identify promoting factors, and to evaluate education need and willingness to work. METHODS A survey looking for demographics, hospital disaster planning, estimated risk and capability for disasters, training, and willingness to work, and a set of six content assessment questions to evaluate knowledge, were presented to emergency pediatricians and pediatric emergency physicians in specialized tertiary centers. RESULTS The response rate was 51%. Thirty-five percent had disaster training and 53% felt that disaster education should be obligatory in their curriculum. Risk for disasters was estimated from 2.4/10 for nuclear incidents to 7.6/10 for major trauma. Self-estimated capability for these situations ranged from 1.8/10 in nuclear incidents to 7.6/10 in major trauma. Unconditional willingness to work ranged from 37% in nuclear situations to 68% in pandemics. Mean score on the questions was 2.06/6. Training, knowledge of antidote and personal protective equipment (PPE) use, self-estimated capability, and exposure were significant predictors for higher scores. Willingness to work correlated significantly with age, self-estimated capability, and risk estimation. In case of chemical and nuclear incidents, there was correlation with knowledge on the use of decontamination, PPE, and radio-detection devices. CONCLUSION Despite a clear perception of the risks and a high willingness to work, preparedness is limited. The major conclusion is that basics of disaster management should be included in pediatric training.","Mortelmans, Luc J M; Maebe, Sofie; Dieltiens, Greet; Anseeuw, Kurt; Sabbe, Marc B; Van de Voorde, Patrick",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x16000078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26857167/,165

As no published data exists regarding robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS), we conducted a survey to investigate its current status. Methods We performed a nationwide survey of all centers active in RATS, using a standardized questionnaire. The annual number of operations, mean duration of surgery, docking time, length of hospital stay(s), conversions, chest tube duration, the RATS program start date, robot system used, operating room capacity, and staplers and instruments used were recorded. Results Of the 22 centers contacted, 14 responded. In total, 786 RATS interventions were recorded. Most were anatomical lung resections, comprising 372 (bi-) lobectomies and 80 segmentectomies. During the study period, eight bronchoplastic procedures were performed robotically. There were 93 wedge lung resections, 148 thymectomies, 26 sympathectomies, and 59 other RATS procedures, and a single-center series of around 1,000 RATS thymectomies (excluded from statistical analysis). The average incision-suture time of the RATS lobectomy was 245 (range, 80-419) minutes, average residence time seven days. The conversion rate was 6.7% across all interventions, with significant inter-intervention differences. All surveyed centers plan to further expand RATS, with OR capacity being a frequent impediment. Five RATS interventions were performed in Germany in 2013, versus 320 in 2018. Conclusions Overall, RATS is becoming more established in everyday clinical practice in Germany. The number of operations, active centers, and trained RATS surgeons has increased steadily since 2013. A German-speaking operation course for entry into RATS already exists. Even extended resections can be carried out safely, and RATS has become standard procedure in some centers.","Möller, Thorben; Egberts, Jan-Hendrik; Eichhorn, Martin; Hofmann, Hans-Stefan; Krüger, Ingo; Rückert, Jens-C; Sandhaus, Tim; Steinert, Matthias",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2019.10.48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903271/,165
89469,Models for plasma kinetics during simultaneous therapeutic plasma exchange and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,2021-02-25,"OBJECTIVES Patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) is a method for providing antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of an index patient with an STI by means of a prescription or medication that the index patient gives to their sexual partner(s). Qualitative research regarding barriers and enablers to PDPT has largely focused on the views of healthcare providers. In this study, we sought to investigate the views of young people (as potential health consumers) regarding PDPT for chlamydia. METHODS Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with young Australian men and women. Participants were asked to provide their views regarding PDPT from the perspective of both an index patient and partner. Purposive and snowball sampling was used. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS We interviewed 22 people (13 women, 9 men) aged 18-30 years, 15 of whom had previously been tested for chlamydia. Despite none having previous knowledge of or experience using PDPT, all viewed it positively and thought it should be widely available. Participants reported that they would be willing to give PDPT to their sexual partners in situations where trust and comfort had been established, regardless of the relationship type. Protecting their partners' privacy was essential, with participants expressing reluctance to provide their partners' contact details to a doctor without consent. Beyond logistical benefits, PDPT was viewed as a facilitator to partner notification conversations by offering partners a potential solution. However, most interviewees indicated a preference to consult with a healthcare provider (GP or pharmacist) before taking PDPT medication. Participants indicated that legitimacy of information when navigating a chlamydia diagnosis was crucial and was preferably offered by healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS Though PDPT is unlikely to fully replace partners' interactions with healthcare providers, it may facilitate partner notification conversations and provide partners greater choice on how, when and where they are treated.","Layton, Elly; Goller, Jane L; Coombe, Jacqueline; Temple-Smith, Meredith; Tomnay, Jane; Vaisey, Alaina; Hocking, Jane S",Sexually transmitted infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2020-054820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441448/,165

This can be explained partly by intratumor heterogeneity. Objectives To define the prevalence and clinical significance of Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 overexpression in primary breast tumors ER positive, while highlighting the existence of intratumor heterogeneity in this type of cancer. Materials and methods 51 ER positive breast cancer tumors were used to evaluate the intratumoral distribution of Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 expression. Image acquisition and visualization of the markers were performed by optical microscopy and stereology sampling method. Results The mean Ki-67 labeling index was distributed heterogeneously in the same tumor, from 20.67±6.87 to 45.10±10.65. The coefficient of variation (COV) revealed dispersion values between 13.4% and 42.9%. Associated with positive ER status, all the tumors presented a Cyclin D1 expression with a COV varying between 19% and 28.5% and a mean labeling index fluctuating between 19.40±4.42 and 41.64±10.08 within the same patient showing important intratumor heterogeneous distribution. Conclusion In this study, we have adopted a strictly quantitative approach to evaluate and demonstrate intratumor heterogeneity. This establishes one of the main factors for poor response to cancer therapy. To achieve this, intratumor heterogeneity should be usually definable and quantifiable but this domain awaits future progress and methods need to move towards a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms that initiate and maintain this tumor heterogeneity.","Latifa, Mohammedi; Fatima, Djillali Doula; Farida, Mesli; Rachid, Senhadji",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394279/,165
93998,Metabolism as Disease Tolerance: Implications for Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury.,2021-06-23,"Contrasting to the established role of the hypothalamic agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in feeding regulation, the neural circuit and signaling mechanisms by which they control energy expenditure remains unclear. Here, we report that energy expenditure is regulated by a subgroup of AgRP neurons that send non-collateral projections to neurons within the dorsal lateral part of dorsal raphe nucleus (dlDRN) expressing the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), which in turn innervate nearby serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. Genetic manipulations reveal a bi-directional control of energy expenditure by this circuit without affecting food intake. Fiber photometry and electrophysiological results indicate that the thermo-sensing MC4RdlDRN neurons integrate pre-synaptic AgRP signaling, thereby modulating the post-synaptic serotonergic pathway. Specifically, the MC4RdlDRN signaling elicits profound, bi-directional, regulation of body weight mainly through sympathetic outflow that reprograms mitochondrial bioenergetics within brown and beige fat while feeding remains intact. Together, we suggest that this AgRP neural circuit plays a unique role in persistent control of energy expenditure and body weight, hinting next-generation therapeutic approaches for obesity and metabolic disorders.","Han, Yong; Xia, Guobin; Srisai, Dollada; Meng, Fantao; He, Yanlin; Ran, Yali; He, Yang; Farias, Monica; Hoang, Giang; Tóth, István; Dietrich, Marcelo O; Chen, Miao-Hsueh; Xu, Yong; Wu, Qi",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23846-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112797/,165

However, there are few prospective studies evaluating the use of a direct aspiration first pass technique in distal vessel occlusions. This post hoc analysis of the PROMISE study examines the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System with the ACE68 and ACE64 Reperfusion Catheters for aspiration thrombectomy in the M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery. METHODS PROMISE is a prospective, multicenter study that enrolled 204 patients with anterior circulation LVO AIS-treated frontline with ACE68/ACE64 catheters. We compared clinical and angiographic outcomes, complications, and mortality in patients with M1 and M2 occlusions. The association of M1 and M2 location and functional independence or mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion was described in univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS One hundred sixty-one patients (124 M1 and 37 M2 locations) met the study criteria. Post procedure mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion (93% vs. 92%, p = 1.00), functional independence (57% vs. 70%, p = 0.18), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (1.6% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.55), device- or procedure-related serious adverse events at 30 days (4.0% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.39), and mortality at 90 days (6.6% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.69) were comparable between M1 and M2 occlusions. In multivariable analysis, lower age, lower baseline NIHSS, and shorter time from onset to admission were independent predictors of functional independence. CONCLUSIONS For frontline aspiration thrombectomy of stroke, use of large-bore ACE68/ACE64 catheters for treatment of M2 occlusions appeared as safe and effective as for M1 occlusions.","Navia, Pedro; Schramm, Peter; Fiehler, Jens","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919894800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31847643/,165

The TRIP database provided a data set of questions to guide prioritization for the acute respiratory infections (ARIs) CRG. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We extracted the ARI searches from the TRIP database (2010 to 2017) that contained at least one disease and one clinical management term, (defined as a ""search""), and tabulated these by frequency. RESULTS There were 314,346 ARI searches from which we inferred 45,497 clinical questions, covering 365 topics. Two-thirds (30,541) of these addressed 20 clinical questions, of which treatment were the most frequent, followed by diagnosis, mortality, and prognosis. The five most frequent clinical questions were ""Influenza + Vaccination"" 4,989 (12.1%), ""acute otitis media + antibiotics"" 3,578 (8.7%), ""common cold + vitamin C"" 3,528 (8.6%), ""meningitis + corticosteroids"" 1,910 (4.6%), and ""pneumonia + general treatment"" 1,765 (4.3%).

Then estimate what the daily new infection rate would have been in Wuhan from January 24 to January 30th if the lockdown measure had been delayed for 7 days，assuming that the daily new infection in Wuhan after January 23 increased in a high，moderate and low trend respectively (using exponential, linear and logarithm growth models). Based on that，calculate the number of infection cases imported from Wuhan during this period. Finally，predict the possible impact of 7-day delayed lockdown in Wuhan on the epidemic situation in China using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model. : The daily new infection rate in Wuhan was estimated to be 0.021%，0.026%，0.029%，0.033% and 0.070% respectively from January 19 to January 23. And there were at least 20 066 infection cases in Wuhan by January 23，2020. If Wuhan lockdown measure had been delayed for 7 days，the daily new infection rate on January 30 would have been 0.335% in the exponential growth model，0.129% in the linear growth model，and 0.070% in the logarithm growth model. Correspondingly，there would have been 32 075，24 819 and 20 334 infection cases travelling from Wuhan to other areas of Mainland China，and the number of cumulative confirmed cases as of March 19 in Mainland China would have been 3.3-3.9 times of the officially reported number.

In a previous work, by using model membranes we studied P6, a peptide that shows no antimicrobial activity, and P6.2, which exhibits antibacterial activity. In the present work we aimed to unravel the mode of action of these peptides by studying their interaction in vivo with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In order to unravel the interactions with bacterial cells and their effect on the bacterial surface, zeta potential, spectroscopic, and microscopic methodologies were applied. P6.2 exhibits a higher affinity toward both bacterial envelopes. The ability of both peptides to disrupt afterwards the bacterial membrane was also studied. Both peptides were able to induce bacterial membrane damage, but higher concentrations of P6 were needed to obtain results comparable to those obtained for P6.2. Additionally, P6.2 exhibited faster damage kinetics. Altogether, these data allow postulating, in a physiologic model, that the lower affinity of P6 for bacterial envelope results in a minor final concentration of the peptide in the bacterial membrane unable to trigger the antimicrobial activity. Finally, the fact that the active P6.2 has the same MIC value for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested, but not the same profile in the permeabilization assays, reinforces the question of whether cell wall components act as electrostatic barriers preventing or minimizing membrane-active AMPs lethal action at the membrane level.","Maturana, Patricia; Gonçalves, Sónia; Martinez, Melina; Espeche, Juan C; Santos, Nuno C; Semorile, Liliana; Maffia, Paulo C; Hollmann, Axel",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

However, its weaning has never been investigated and could lead to unnecessary prolonged intensive-care unit (ICU) stay. The aim of this study is to assess predictors of successful separation from HFOT in critically ill patients. We performed a retrospective monocenter observational study over a 2-year period including all patients treated with HFOT for acute respiratory failure in the ICU. Those who died or were intubated without prior HFOT separation attempt, who were treated with non-invasive ventilation at the time of HFOT separation, or who received HFOT as a preventive treatment during the post-extubation period were excluded. RESULTS From the 190 patients analyzed, 168 (88%) were successfully separated from HFOT at the first attempt. Patients who failed separation from HFOT at the first attempt had longer ICU length of stay than those who succeeded: 10 days (7-12) vs. 5 (4-8), p < 0.0001. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 40% and a respiratory rate-oxygenation (ROX) index (calculated as the ratio of SpO2/FiO2 to the respiratory rate) ≥ 9.2 predicted successful separation from HFOT with sensitivity of 85% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS FiO2 ≤ 40% and ROX index ≥ 9.2 were two predictors of successful separation from HFOT at the bedside. Prospective multicenter studies are needed to confirm these results.","Rodriguez, Maeva; Thille, Arnaud W; Boissier, Florence; Veinstein, Anne; Chatellier, Delphine; Robert, René; Le Pape, Sylvain; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Coudroy, Remi",Annals of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-019-0578-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511996/,165

AIM OF THE STUDY The identification and quantification of compounds responsible for antiplasmodial activity in different parts (leaf, stem and root) of C. pareira is the target of current study. MATERIAL AND METHODS The hydro ethanolic parent extracts of different parts of C. pareira, fractions prepared from these extracts were evaluated against Pf3D7 (chloroquine sensitive) and PfINDO (chloroquine resistance) strains in culture to quantify the IC50 for extracts and fractions. Promising fractions of root part of plant were subjected to silica gel column chromatography to obtain pure compounds and their structures were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis. Pure compounds were also tested against Pf3D7 and PfINDO strains. A rapid and simple UPLC-DAD method was developed for the identification and quantification of pharmaceutically important metabolites of C. pareira. RESULTS Among different extracts, the hydro ethanolic extract of root part of C. pareira was found most active with IC50 values (μg/ml) of 1.42 and 1.15 against Pf 3D7 and Pf INDO, respectively. Tested against Pf 3D7 the most potent fractions were root ethyl acetate fraction (IC50 4.0 μg/ml), stem water fraction (IC50 4.4 μg/ml), and root water fraction (IC50 8.5 μg/ml). Further, phytochemical investigation of active fractions of root part led to the isolation and characterization of a new isoquinoline alkaloid, namely pareirarine (8), along with five known compounds magnoflorine (5), magnocurarine (10), saluateridine (11), cissamine (13) and hayatinine (15). Hayatinine (15), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, isolated from root ethyl acetate fraction was most promising compound with IC50 of 0.41 μM (Pf INDO) and 0.509 μM (Pf 3D7). Magnocurarine (10) and cissamine (13) were also found active with IC50 values of 12.51 and 47.34 μM against Pf INDO and 12.54 and 8.76 μM against Pf 3D7, respectively. A total of thirty compounds were detected in studied extracts and fractions, structures were assigned to 15 of these and five of these biologically important compounds were quantified. Isolation of saluteridine (11) from C. pareira and the evaluation of antiplasmodial activity of pure compound from C. pariera is disclosed for the first time. CONCLUSION This study concludes that the antimalarial potential of C. pareira may be attributed to isoquinoline type alkaloids present in this plant and also provides the scientific evidence for the traditional use of this plant in treatment of malaria.","Bhatt, Vinod; Kumari, Surekha; Upadhyay, Pooja; Agrawal, Prakhar; Anmol,; Sahal, Dinkar; Sharma, Upendra",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726676/,165

Here, we focus on geographic disparities in incidence within Portugal for three age groups of women (30-49; 50-69; 70-84 years). METHODS Age-period-cohort (APC) models are widely used in cancer surveillance, and these models have recently been extended to allow spatially-varying effects. We apply novel spatial APC models to estimate relative risk and age-adjusted temporal trends at the district level for the 20 districts in Portugal. Our model allows us to report on country-wide trends, but also to investigate geographic disparities between districts and trends within districts. RESULTS Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence was increasing over 1998-2011 for all three age groups and in every district in Portugal. However, we detect spatially-structured between-district heterogeneity in relative risk and age-adjusted trends (Net Drifts) for each of the three age groups, which is most pronounced in the highly-screened (50-69yo) and late-onset (70-84yo) groups of women. CONCLUSIONS We present evidence of disparities in breast cancer incidence at a more granular geographic level than previously reported. Some disparities may be due to latent risk factors, which cannot be accounted for by age, birth year, and geographic location alone.

Here, we present a case series of professional and semiprofessional ice hockey players to demonstrate the mechanism and nature of laryngeal injuries they sustain during play, and to recommend best practices for treatment, prevention, and return to the ice. Methods A retrospective case review was done of hockey-related laryngeal injuries between 2016 and 2019 at a tertiary laryngology practice. Only semiprofessional and professional hockey players were included. Results In total, four cases were included. All cases involved trauma from a hockey puck to the neck. No cases were the result of punching, fighting, high sticks or routine checking. Notably, 1 of 4 presented with severe airway compromise, requiring urgent intubation, whereas most presented with pain or a significant voice complaint. Two patients required operative intervention with open reduction and internal fixation of significantly displaced fractures. One patient experienced significant mucosal disruption with cartilaginous exposure at the posterior vocal complex requiring microflap. The average return to ice was 6 weeks for those who required operative intervention and 4 weeks for those who were managed conservatively. One patient had persistent mild dysphonia and all others had a return to baseline phonation. None were wearing neck guards or other protective equipment at the time of injury.

125334,Covert Subclinical Neurocognitive Sequelae during the Rehabilitation Course of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Case Report.,2020-10-26,"Background and Aims Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a poorly understood complication particularly observed in elderly patients, with long-term poor outcome. The randomised study was to compare the incidence of POCD in elderly with bispectral index (BIS)-guided intra-operative use of either dexmedetomidine or propofol with sevoflurane. Methods Eighty-seven patients, planned for non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia, were included between June 2017 and March 2018. After exclusion of 7 patients, remaining 80 patients were randomised into dexmedetomidine group and propofol group with 40 patients each. In both the groups, BIS-guided anaesthesia was provided. Cognitive function was assessed by an anaesthesiologist using a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline pre-operatively, third and seventh day after surgery. The data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. Results Propofol group had a non-significant lower incidence of POCD on third day and dexmedetomidine group showed decreased incidence of POCD on seventh day, accompanied by lower anaesthetic requirement (inhalational as well as intravenous) concomitant with delayed emergence with an acceptable BIS value. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine appeared to be anaesthetic sparing as compared to propofol. BIS monitoring for titrating depth of anaesthesia and hence the anaesthetic exposure is an invaluable tool as compared to routine care anaesthesia for reducing POCD. The patients in both groups did not develop significant POCD until the seventh post-operative day.","Chawdhary, Abrar A; Kulkarni, Anita; Nozari, Ala",Indian journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.4103/ija.ija_365_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437077/,165

In this study, we tested if these models would remain stable with increasing sample size, and investigated sample sizes required for various confidence levels (CIs). METHODS We augmented our previous dataset of 119 aneurysms into a new dataset of 204 samples by collecting an additional 85 consecutive aneurysms, on which we performed flow simulation and calculated morphological and hemodynamic parameters, as done previously. We performed univariate significance tests on these parameters, and multivariate logistic regression on significant parameters. The new regression models were compared against the original models. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was applied to compare the performance of regression models. Furthermore, we performed regression analysis based on bootstrapping resampling statistical simulations to explore how many aneurysm cases were required to generate stable models. RESULTS Univariate tests of the 204 aneurysms generated an identical list of significant morphological and hemodynamic parameters as previously (from the analysis of 119 cases). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis produced three parsimonious predictive models that were almost identical to the previous ones, with model coefficients that had narrower CIs than the original ones. Bootstrapping showed that 10%, 5%, 2%, and 1% convergence levels of CI required 120, 200, 500, and 900 aneurysms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our original hemodynamic-morphological rupture prediction models are stable and improve with increasing sample size.

Amniotic fluid is a biofluid with great potential for insights into the feto-maternal milieu. It is rich in metabolites, and metabolic consequences of inflammation is yet researched only to a limited extent. Metabolomic profiling provides opportunities to identify potential biomarkers of inflammatory conditioned pregnancy complications such as spontaneous preterm delivery.Objective: The aim of this study was to perform metabolomic profiling of amniotic fluid from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies in the mid-trimester to identify potential biomarkers associated with spontaneous preterm delivery and gestational duration at delivery. A secondary aim was to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers of spontaneous preterm delivery in asymptomatic women.Method: A nested case-control study was performed within a larger cohort study of asymptomatic pregnant women undergoing mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis at 14-19 gestational weeks in Gothenburg, Sweden. Medical records were used to obtain clinical data and delivery outcome variables. Amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery (n = 37) were matched with amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous delivery at term (n = 37). Amniotic fluid samples underwent untargeted metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate random forest analyses were used for data processing. A secondary targeted analysis was performed, aiming to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers in women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery.Results: Multivariate analysis did not distinguish the samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery from those with a subsequent term delivery. Neither was the metabolic profile associated with gestational duration at delivery. Potential metabolic biomarker candidates were identified from four publications by two different research groups relating mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolomes to spontaneous PTD, of which fifteen markers were included in the secondary analysis. None of these were replicated.Conclusions: Metabolomic profiles of early mid-trimester amniotic fluid were not associated with spontaneous preterm delivery or gestational duration at delivery in this cohort.","Hallingström, Maria; Barman, Malin; Savolainen, Otto; Viklund, Felicia; Kacerovsky, Marian; Brunius, Carl; Jacobsson, Bo","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1777271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32543931/,165

Here we give an overview of clinical treatment studies and discuss potential mechanisms and molecular targets for in-vitro testing of drug resistance. RECENT FINDINGS Giardia is a cause of disease both in diarrheal and nondiarrheal cases. The prevalence of treatment refractory giardiasis is increasing. Recent studies reveal 5-nitroimidazole refractory infection occurs in up to 50% of cases. Mechanisms of drug resistance are not known. Placebo controlled studies of drug efficacy, taking the self-limiting course of giardiasis into account, has not been reported. No randomized controlled trials of treatment of refractory infection have been performed the last 25 years. Based on the clinical studies reported, combination treatment with a 5-nitroimidazole and a benzimidazole is more effective than repeated courses of 5-nitroimidazole or monotherapies in refractory cases. Quinacrine is effective in refractory cases, but potentially severe side effects limit its use. SUMMARY A combination of a 5-nitroimidazole and albendazole or mebendazole, and quinacrine monotherapy, are rational choices in nitroimidazole refractory infections, but randomized controlled studies are needed. Further research into more recent clinical isolates is necessary to uncover mechanisms for the increase in metronidazole refractory giardiasis observed during the last decade.","Mørch, Kristine; Hanevik, Kurt",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773501/,165

Temporary changes to the diagnostic testing for GDM have been recommended for the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to identify what proportion of women with GDM would be missed by the COVID-19 GDM screening criteria. Secondly an analysis of the relationship between HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and pregnancy outcomes will be completed. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of all GDM patients at an Australian secondary hospital between January 2019 and February 2020. The proportion of women with GDM who would have been missed using the COVID-19 guidelines was assessed. Patients were divided into groups according to how their GDM was managed during the pregnancy: Diet, Metformin (MF), Insulin and MF + Insulin groups. Differences between the groups were compared using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analysis was completed using the Bonferroni test. Logistic regression was employed to further compare the differences between the groups. RESULTS The study group comprised 237 patients. Sixty patients (25.3%) would not have had GDM detected in their pregnancy using the COVID-19 guidelines. FBG was the most significant predictor for intervention with medication for GDM (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION HbA1c and FBG are poor screening tests for GDM. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the OGTT should be given clinical priority in high risk patients. Elevated FBG is a significant predictor for needing medical management and could be used in the future to better enable individualised treatment.","Zhu, Stephanie; Meehan, Tom; Veerasingham, Mayooran; Sivanesan, Kanapathippillai",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.01.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571889/,165

In this study, we expand the functional correlation between vital force and chromosomes, describing the mechanism of action of the telomere-telomerase complex in the context of physiological balance. AIMS The aim of the work is to study the role of the telomere-telomerase complex in cell vitality, biological aging, and the health-disease process, with the goal of proposing the use of telomere length as a biomarker of the vital force state and the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment. RESULTS Similar to the vital force, telomere length and telomerase enzyme activity play an important role in maintaining cellular vitality, biological longevity, and physiological homeostasis. Telomere shortening functions as a biomarker of vital imbalance and is associated with numerous diseases and health disorders. On the other hand, health-promotion practices neutralize the pathological shortening of the telomeres, acting therapeutically in diseases or age-dependent health disorders. CONCLUSIONS As a hypothetical biomarker of the vital force state, an intra-individual analysis of the mean leukocyte telomere length before, during, and after homeopathic treatment can be used as a biomarker of therapeutic effectiveness.","Teixeira, Marcus Zulian",Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000743/,165

This unique organelle plays a critical role in restricting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which is essential for quiescent cells to maintain their quiescence. Multiple mechanisms have been identified that mediate the inhibitory effect of primary cilia on mTORC1 signaling. These mechanisms depend on several tumor suppressor proteins localized within the ciliary compartment, including liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), polycystin-1, and polycystin-2. Conversely, changes in mTORC1 activity are able to affect ciliogenesis and stability indirectly through autophagy. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the reciprocal regulation of mTORC1 and primary cilia.","Lai, Yandong; Jiang, Yu",Genes,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11060711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604881/,165

X-ray scattering in combination with heavy-atom labeling is a powerful and highly appropriate method to reveal the position of a certain amino acid residue within a lipid bilayer with respect to the membrane normal axis up to a resolution of several Angstrøm. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new iodine-labeled amino acid building block. This building block is intended for peptide incorporation to provide high intensities for electron density difference analysis of X-ray reflectivity data and improve the labeling potential for the lipid bilayer head-group and water region. The novel building block as well as the commercially available non-iodinated analogue, required for X-ray scattering, was implemented in a transmembrane peptide motif via manual solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) following the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-strategy. The derived peptides were reconstituted in lipid vesicles as well as in highly aligned multilamellar lipid stacks and investigated via circular dichroism (CD) and X-ray reflectivity. Thereby, it has been revealed that the bulky iodine probe neither causes conformational change of the peptide structure nor lamellar disordering of the membrane complexes.","Schneggenburger, Philipp E; Beerlink, André; Worbs, Brigitte; Salditt, Tim; Diederichsen, Ulf",Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.200900241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19565579/,165

151355,Could Cannabidiol Be a Treatment for Coronavirus Disease-19-Related Anxiety Disorders?,2021,"Mammalian aminopeptidase N (APN) plays multifunctional roles in many physiological processes, including peptide metabolism, cell motility and adhesion, and coronavirus entry. Here we determined crystal structures of porcine APN at 1.85 Å resolution and its complexes with a peptide substrate and a variety of inhibitors. APN is a cell surface-anchored and seahorse-shaped zinc-aminopeptidase that forms head-to-head dimers. Captured in a catalytically active state, these structures of APN illustrate a detailed catalytic mechanism for its aminopeptidase activity. The active site and peptide-binding channel of APN reside in cavities with wide openings, allowing easy access to peptides. The cavities can potentially open up further to bind the exposed N terminus of proteins. The active site anchors the N-terminal neutral residue of peptides/proteins, and the peptide-binding channel binds the remainder of the peptides/proteins in a sequence-independent fashion. APN also provides an exposed outer surface for coronavirus binding, without its physiological functions being affected. These structural features enable APN to function ubiquitously in peptide metabolism, interact with other proteins to mediate cell motility and adhesion, and serve as a coronavirus receptor. This study elucidates multifunctional roles of APN and can guide therapeutic efforts to treat APN-related diseases.","Chen, Lang; Lin, Yi-Lun; Peng, Guiqing; Li, Fang",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1210123109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23071329/,165
151591,Acute Kidney Injury and Fluid Resuscitation in Septic Patients: Are We Protecting the Kidney?,2019,"BACKGROUND Kidney injury is a complication among children undergoing liver transplantation (pLTx). Cystatin C serum concentration seems to be superior to creatinine-based determination of kidney injury in adults and children. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology provides non-invasive and real-time measurement of renal tissue oxygenation. Here, we compared renal tissue oximetry (rSrO₂) with conventional diagnostic criteria cystatin C and creatinine concentration in children undergoing pLTx. MATERIAL AND METHODS rSrO₂ was measured intraoperatively in children undergoing pLTx over the left kidney, and was statistically compared with pre- and postoperative serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations. RESULTS rSrO₂ was affected by hemoglobin concentration, bilirubin concentration, and FiO₂. Statistical analysis demonstrated that rSrO₂ was significantly reduced in children with preoperative pathologic increased cystatin C concentrations compared to children without (63.7±4.3 vs. 53.4±4.9, p<0.05). We did not detect a significant difference in rSrO₂ between children who developed postoperative renal impairment, either determined by increased postoperative cystatin C concentration, creatinine concentration, or the pRIFLE criteria. Intraoperative increase or decrease in rSrO₂ did not predict the development of postoperative kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS In children with liver failure undergoing pLTx, a preoperative decrease in rSrO₂ indicates compromised renal function. However, intraoperative rSrO₂ is not predictive of postoperative kidney injury.","Sinner, Barbara; Banas, Miriam; Brunete-Lorenzo, Clara; Zant, Robert; Knoppke, Birgit; Scherer, Marcus N; Graf, Bernhard M; Lunz, Dirk",Annals of transplantation,https://doi.org/10.12659/aot.919717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988274/,165

In addition, infant-parent bonding in the postpartum period is crucial for breastfeeding, health, and well-being. No national standards exist for flexible scheduling options for pregnant or new parent residents. Our project objectives are 1) to describe a policy for scheduling pregnant and new parent residents in an emergency medicine (EM) residency and 2) to report pilot outcomes to assess feasibility of implementation, resident satisfaction, and pregnancy outcomes. Methods An EM residency task force developed a proposal of scheduling options for pregnant and new parent residents based on best practice recommendations and resident input. The policy included prenatal scheduling options for pregnant residents and postpartum scheduling options for all new resident parents. Resident support for the policy was evaluated via an anonymous survey. It was piloted for 2 months in an EM residency program. Results Policy development resulted in 1) an opt-out prenatal pregnancy work hour option policy with no nights or call during the first and third trimesters, 2) a 6-week new parent flexible scheduling policy, and 3) clarified sick call options. A majority of residents approved the new policy. During the 2-month pilot period, four residents (of 73 total) utilized the policy. The chief residents reported no added burden in scheduling. Of the residents who utilized the policy, all reported high satisfaction. There were no reported pregnancy or postpartum complications. Conclusions We successfully adopted a new scheduling policy for pregnant residents and new parents in one of the largest EM residency training programs in the country. This policy can serve as a national model for other graduate medical education programs.","Chernoby, Kimberly A; Pettit, Katie E; Jansen, Jaclyn H; Welch, Julie L",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898908/,165

Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) depend on Hedgehog (Hh)/Gli signaling, but can develop mechanisms of Smoothened (SMO) inhibitor resistance. We previously identified a nuclear myocardin-related transcription factor (nMRTF) resistance pathway that amplifies noncanonical Gli1 activity, but characteristics and drivers of the nMRTF cell state remain unknown. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing of patient tumors to identify three prognostic surface markers (LYPD3, TACSTD2, and LY6D) which correlate with nMRTF and resistance to SMO inhibitors. The nMRTF cell state resembles transit-amplifying cells of the hair follicle matrix, with AP-1 and TGFß cooperativity driving nMRTF activation. JNK/AP-1 signaling commissions chromatin accessibility and Smad3 DNA binding leading to a transcriptional program of RhoGEFs that facilitate nMRTF activity. Importantly, small molecule AP-1 inhibitors selectively target LYPD3+/TACSTD2+/LY6D+ nMRTF human BCCs ex vivo, opening an avenue for improving combinatorial therapies.","Yao, Catherine D; Haensel, Daniel; Gaddam, Sadhana; Patel, Tiffany; Atwood, Scott X; Sarin, Kavita Y; Whitson, Ramon J; McKellar, Siegen; Shankar, Gautam; Aasi, Sumaira; Rieger, Kerri; Oro, Anthony E",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18762-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33033234/,165

Using the trigger-substrate model of cardiac arrhythmias in this review, we amalgamate current experimental and clinical data from both animal and human studies to explain the mechanism of adrenergic stimulation and blockade on LQT arrhythmic risk and hence assess the efficacy of β-adrenoceptor blockade in the management of LQTS. In LQTS1 and LQTS2, sympathetic stimulation increases arrhythmic risk by enhancing early afterdepolarizations and transmural dispersion of repolarization. β-Blockers successfully reduce cardiac events by reducing these triggers and substrates; however, these effects are less marked in LQTS2 compared with LQTS1. In LQTS3, clinical and experimental investigations of the effects of sympathetic stimulation and β-blocker use have produced contradictory findings, resulting in significant clinical uncertainty. We offer explanations for these contradicting results relating to study sample size, the dose of the β-blocker administered associated with its off-target Na+ channel effects, as well as the type of β-blocker used. We conclude that the antiarrhythmic efficacy of β-blockers is a genotype-specific phenomenon, and hence the use of β-blockers in clinical practice should be genotype dependent.","Saadeh, Khalil; Shivkumar, Kalyanam; Jeevaratnam, Kamalan",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901453/,165

The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine if sampling methodology was reproducible in RCTs related to musculoskeletal physical therapy (MSKPT) interventions to treat non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) and (2) establish if there was a relationship between sample reproducibility and established measures of research quality. METHODS Data were collected through a systematic review by a professional librarian. The identified RCTs were assessed for methodological quality by two blinded individual reviewers. Data analysis was performed by a third, blinded researcher; additional comparisons were made based on Journal Impact Factor and PEDro score. RESULTS Ninety-nine published peer-reviewed RCTs were identified that met inclusion criteria. Only 29% of the articles were judged to be reproducible based on the reported sampling methodology. There were meaningful correlations between two out of ten of the sampling reporting criteria and the judgement made if the sample was reported in significant detail to allow for replication. There was no relationship between sampling reporting criteria, Journal Impact Factors (JIFs), and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scores. DISCUSSION The reporting of sampling methodology needs to be considered to ensure reproducibility and avoid sampling bias. Despite the proliferation of measures of research quality, the overall reporting quality of RCTs continues to be inadequate to allow widespread reproducibility of trials.

DESIGN Baseline findings from a prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING Community-based individuals from two UK centres between 1 April and 14 September 2020. PARTICIPANTS Individuals ≥18 years with persistent symptoms following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and age-matched healthy controls. INTERVENTION Assessment of symptoms by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12) and organ-specific metrics by biochemical assessment and quantitative MRI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome defined as ongoing respiratory symptoms and/or moderate functional impairment in activities of daily living; single-organ and multiorgan impairment (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) by consensus definitions at baseline investigation. RESULTS 201 individuals (mean age 45, range 21-71 years, 71% female, 88% white, 32% healthcare workers) completed the baseline assessment (median of 141 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection, IQR 110-162). The study population was at low risk of COVID-19 mortality (obesity 20%, hypertension 7%, type 2 diabetes 2%, heart disease 5%), with only 19% hospitalised with COVID-19. 42% of individuals had 10 or more symptoms and 60% had severe post-COVID-19 syndrome. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (87%), breathlessness (88%) and headaches (83%) were most frequently reported. Mild organ impairment was present in the heart (26%), lungs (11%), kidneys (4%), liver (28%), pancreas (40%) and spleen (4%), with single-organ and multiorgan impairment in 70% and 29%, respectively. Hospitalisation was associated with older age (p=0.001), non-white ethnicity (p=0.016), increased liver volume (p<0.0001), pancreatic inflammation (p<0.01), and fat accumulation in the liver (p<0.05) and pancreas (p<0.01). Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with radiological evidence of cardiac damage (myocarditis) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS In individuals at low risk of COVID-19 mortality with ongoing symptoms, 70% have impairment in one or more organs 4 months after initial COVID-19 symptoms, with implications for healthcare and public health, which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.

This randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated trial compared clinical outcomes during and after RFA using propofol and midazolam, respectively, in patients with HCC. Methods Few- and small-nodule HCC patients (≤3 nodules and ≤3 cm) were randomly assigned to either propofol or midazolam. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) (1 mm = not at all satisfied, 100 mm = completely satisfied). Sedation recovery rates 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after RFA were evaluated based on Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores; full recovery was defined as a MOAA/S score of 5. Results Between July 2013 and September 2017, 143 patients with HCC were enrolled, and 135 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group. Compared with midazolam, propofol exhibited similar median procedural satisfaction (propofol: 73.1 mm, midazolam: 76.9 mm, P = 0.574). Recovery rates 1 and 2 h after RFA were higher in the propofol group than in the midazolam group. Meanwhile, recovery rates observed 3 and 4 h after RFA were similar in the two groups. The safety profiles during and after RFA were almost identical in the two groups. Conclusion Patient satisfaction was almost identical in patients receiving propofol and midazolam sedation during RFA. Propofol sedation resulted in reduced recovery time compared with midazolam sedation in patients with HCC. The safety profiles of both propofol and midazolam sedation during and after RFA were acceptable.","Kanogawa, Naoya; Ogasawara, Sadahisa; Ooka, Yoshihiko; Inoue, Masanori; Wakamatsu, Toru; Yokoyama, Masayuki; Maruta, Susumu; Unozawa, Hidemi; Iwanaga, Terunao; Sakuma, Takafumi; Fujita, Naoto; Koroki, Keisuke; Kanzaki, Hiroaki; Maeda, Takahiro; Kobayashi, Kazufumi; Kiyono, Soichiro; Nakamura, Masato; Kondo, Takayuki; Saito, Tomoko; Motoyama, Tenyu; Suzuki, Eiichiro; Nakamoto, Shingo; Tawada, Akinobu; Chiba, Tetsuhiro; Arai, Makoto; Kanda, Tatsuo; Maruyama, Hitoshi; Kato, Jun; Takemura, Ryo; Nozaki-Taguchi, Natsuko; Shiroh, Isono; Yokosuka, Osamu; Kato, Naoya",JGH open : an open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553667/,165

No specialized instrumentation is required and the single access platform is established table-side using the 'glove port' technique. RESULTS The approach has the intra-operative advantage of excellent visualization of the correct intestinal segment for exteriorization along with direct visual control of its extraction to avoid twisting. Postoperatively, abdominal wall trauma has been minimal allowing convalescence and stoma care education with only one parietal incision.

During the time of data collection, Romania registered the largest number of daily COVID-19 cases, therefore, citizens' compliance with preventive measures was crucial to contain the spread of the virus. Citizens reported high levels of compliance with preventive measures. However, even though people were recommended to avoid meetings with relatives and friends, and participation to private events with large number of people, respondents reported that they did not fury comply with social distancing requirements. Citizens have the highest level of trust in public institutions at the local level, medical institutions and County Committees for Emergency Situations.

A mixed research design was used to understand the nature of SP techniques used by managers and employees from the banking sector. A qualitative approach was first employed to assess the types of SP techniques used through a set of interviews conducted with 11 bank managers. This was followed by a quantitative method to develop and validate an SP scale for use in the banking sector. Items for the assessment of SP were developed with a dataset comprising 415 people, and statistical analyses supported both the validity and reliability of this measurement instrument. This instrument consists of 39 items designed as a 5-point Likert scale. The study is restricted to the investigation that was conducted in certain banks operating in North Cyprus. The implications of the study suggest that managers and researchers could use SP to improve the firm performance of their organizations. This study makes a strong contribution by filling a gap in the literature. It focuses on assessing the SP performance of banks to understand their level of competitiveness.","Karpuz, F.; Guryay, E.; Kirikkaleli, D.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147809,165

Informal accounts of anecdotal use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, in COVID-19 patients has raised concern about potential toxicity, but also raises the question that ClO2 might elicit antiviral effects, a possibility that has never been examined in vivo in any animal model. Here, we challenged the hypothesis that ClO2 decreases the viral load and virus-induced mortality in a vertebrate model. For this, we determined viral load, virus-induced lesions and mortality in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated with 104 mean EID50/mL of attenuated Massachusetts and Connecticut avian coronavirus (IBV) strains. Results The ClO2 treatment had a marked impact on IBV infection. Namely, viral titres were 2.4-fold lower and mortality was reduced by half in infected embryos that were treated with ClO2. Infection led to developmental abnormalities regardless of treatment. Lesions typical of IBV infections were observed in all inoculated embryos, but severity tended to be significantly lower in ClO2-treated embryos. We found no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the doses used herein. Conclusions Our study shows that ClO2 could be a safe and viable way of treating and mitigating the effects of avian coronavirus infections, and raises the possibility that similar effects could be observed in other organisms.

The severity and characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic IMID (R-IMID) remain unknown. Objectives: To analyze the severity of COVID-19 infection in R-IMID. Methods: Cross-sectional study in a single University Hospital. We included all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of a R-IMID and a positive test for COVID-19 up to November 6th, 2020. Confirmed infection was defined if the patient had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Medical records of 11,199 patients with COVID-19 in our region, and 6891 with R-IMID from our hospital were reviewed. COVID-19 case severity was divided into mild, moderate, severe and critical according to the United States National Institute of Health (NIH) COVID-19 guidelines (1). Mild/moderate COVID19 was compared with critical. Results: We included 147 patients (96 women/51 men), mean age 60±18 years. Most cases were mild to moderate (n=123, 83.7%), 30 of them (20.4%) were asymptomatic. The remaining patients presented severe (n=5, 3.4%) or critical (n=19, 12.9%) disease (Table 1). Fatal outcome occurred in 12 patients (8.2%). More frequent underlying R-IMID were Rheumatoid Arthritis (n=36;24.5%), Psoriatic Arthritis (n=30;20.4%), axial spondyloarthritis (n=24;16.3%), conectivopathies (n=19;12.9%), polymyalgia rheumatica (n=16;10.9%) and vasculitis (n=9;6.1%) (Figure 1). Main comorbidities were hypertension (n=65, 44.2%), dyslipidemia (n=64, 43.5%), age higher than 65 years old (n=55, 37.4%), obesity (n=35, 23.8%), coronary vascular disease (CVD) (n=27, 18.4%) and diabetes mellitus (n=22, 15%). Comorbidities and R-IMID associated with critical disease (p<0.05) were hypertension, age higher than 65 years,CVD and Polymyalgia Rheumatica. Critical compared with mild/moderate disease showed significantly higher levels of creatinine and D-dimer, and lower level of lymphocytes and platelets (Table 1) and received more frequently systemic glucocorticoids. Tocilizumab and Anakinra were used only in critical patients, 2 cases each. Conclusion: Although most cases are mild, COVID-19 can be a severe life threatening disease in patients with R-IMID.

Existing methods (such as peak flow meter, smart spirometer) requires special equipment and are not always used by the patient. Using voice recording as surrogate measures of lung function can be used to assess asthma, which has good potential to self-monitor asthma and could be integrated into telehealth platforms. This study aims to apply machine learning approach to predict lung functions from recorded voice for asthma patients. A threshold-based mechanism was designed to separate speech and breathing from recordings (323 recordings from 26 participants) and features extracted from these were combined with biological attributes and lung function (percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1%). Three predictive models were developed: (a) regression models to predict lung function, (b) multi-class classification models to predict the severity, and (c) binary classification models to predict abnormality. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Regression (LR) algorithms were implemented to develop these predictive models. Training and test samples were separated (70%:30% using balanced portioning). Features were normalised and 10-fold cross-validation used to measure the model's training performances on the training samples. Models were then run on the test samples to measure the final performances. The RF based regression model performed better with lowest root mean square error = 10.86, and mean absolute score = 11.47, as compared to other models. In predicting the severity of lung function, the SVM based model performed better with 73.20% accuracy. The RF based model performed better in binary classification models for predicting abnormality of lung function (accuracy = 0.85, F1-score = 0.84, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88). The proposed machine learning approach can predict lung function (in terms of FEV1%), from the recorded voice files, better than other published approaches. These models can be extended to predict both the severity and abnormality of lung function with reasonable accuracies. This technique could be used to develop future telehealth solutions including smartphone-based applications which have potential to aid decision making and self-monitoring in asthma.","Alam, M.

183096,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pediatric gastroenterology,2020,"BACKGROUND. Long COVID, defined as presence of COVID-19 related symptoms 28 days or more after the onset of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, is an emerging challenge to healthcare systems. The objective of this study was to phenotype recovery trajectories of non-hospitalized COVID-19 individuals. METHODS. We performed an international, multi-center, exploratory online survey study on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and recovery status of non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected adults (Austria: n=1157), and Italy: n= 893). RESULTS. Working age subjects (Austria median: 43 yrs (IQR: 31 - 53), Italy: 45 yrs (IQR: 35 - 55)) and females (65.1% and 68.3%) predominated the study cohorts. Course of acute COVID-19 was characterized by a high symptom burden (median 13 (IQR: 9 - 18) and 13 (7 - 18) out of 44 features queried), a 47.6 - 49.3% rate of symptom persistence beyond 28 days and 20.9 - 31.9% relapse rate. By cluster analysis, two acute symptom phenotypes could be discerned: the non-specific infection phenotype and the multi-organ phenotype (MOP), the latter encompassing multiple neurological, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal and dermatological features. Clustering of long COVID subjects yielded three distinct subgroups, with a subset of 48.7 - 55 % long COVID individuals particularly affected by post-acute MOP symptoms. The number and presence of specific acute MOP symptoms and pre-existing multi-morbidity was linked to elevated risk of long COVID. CONCLUSION. The consistent findings of two independent cohorts further delineate patterns of acute and post-acute COVID-19 and emphasize the importance of symptom phenotyping of home-isolated COVID-19 patients to predict protracted convalescence and to allocate medical resources.","Sahanic, S.; Tymoszuk, P.; Ausserhofer, D.; Rass, V.; Pizzini, A.; Nordmeyer, G.; Hampuumlfner, K.; Kurz, K.; Weber, P.

187002,Chinese herbal medicine for severe acute respiratory syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2004,"CONTEXT Immune response in elderly individuals has been reported to improve after micronutrient supplementation. However, efficacy trials evaluating infectious diseases as outcomes are scarce and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of daily multivitamin-mineral and vitamin E supplementation on incidence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections in elderly individuals. DESIGN A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 652 noninstitutionalized individuals aged 60 years or older enrolled from 2 community-based sampling strategies in the Wageningen area of the Netherlands, conducted from 1998 to 2000. At baseline, 6% of participants had suboptimal ascorbic acid and 1.3% had suboptimal alpha-tocopherol plasma concentration. INTERVENTION Physiological doses of multivitamin-minerals, 200 mg of vitamin E, both, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence and severity of self-reported acute respiratory tract infections at 15 months, as assessed by a nurse (telephone contact), home visits, and microbiological and serological testing in subsets of patients. RESULTS During a median observation period of 441 days, 443 (68%) of 652 participants recorded 1024 respiratory tract infection episodes. The incidence rate ratio of acute respiratory tract infection for multivitamin-mineral supplementation was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.15; P =.58) and for vitamin E supplementation, 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.25; P =.21). Severity of infections was not influenced by multivitamin-mineral supplementation. For vitamin E vs no vitamin E, severity was worse: median (interquartile range) for illness-duration was 19 (9-37) vs 14 (6-29) days, P =.02; number of symptoms, 6 (3-8) vs 4 (3-8), P =.03; presence of fever, 36.7% vs 25.2%, P =.009; and restriction of activity, 52.3% vs 41.1%, P =.02. CONCLUSIONS Neither daily multivitamin-mineral supplementation at physiological dose nor 200 mg of vitamin E showed a favorable effect on incidence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections in well-nourished noninstitutionalized elderly individuals. Instead we observed adverse effects of vitamin E on illness severity.","Graat, Judith M; Schouten, Evert G; Kok, Frans J",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12169075/,165
192387,[Acute kidney injury in COVID-19: clinical and morphological comparisons based on autopsy data].,2020-12-01,"A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has recently been identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-CoV appears similar to other coronaviruses in both virion structure and genome organization. It is known for other coronaviruses that the spike (S) glycoprotein is required for both viral attachment to permissive cells and for fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. Here we describe the construction and expression of a soluble codon-optimized SARS-CoV S glycoprotein comprising the first 1,190 amino acids of the native S glycoprotein (S(1190)). The codon-optimized and native S glycoproteins exhibit similar molecular weight as determined by Western blot analysis, indicating that synthetic S glycoprotein is modified correctly in a mammalian expression system. S(1190) binds to the surface of Vero E6 cells, a cell permissive to infection, as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, suggesting that S(1190) maintains the biologic activity present in native S glycoprotein. This interaction is blocked with serum obtained from recovering SARS patients, indicating that the binding is specific. In an effort to map the ligand-binding domain of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, carboxy- and amino-terminal truncations of the S(1190) glycoprotein were constructed. Amino acids 270 to 510 were the minimal receptor-binding region of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein as determined by flow cytometry. We speculate that amino acids 1 to 510 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein represent a unique domain containing the receptor-binding site (amino acids 270 to 510), analogous to the S1 subunit of other coronavirus S glycoproteins.","Babcock, Gregory J; Esshaki, Diana J; Thomas, William D; Ambrosino, Donna M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15078936/,165
193083,[A Practical Approach to the Management of Patients with Gastrointestinal Cancer during the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19)Pandemic-What Can Medical Oncologists Do?],2021-08-01,"studies in our laboratory showed that the Arkansas-Delmarva Poultry Industry (Ark-DPI) vaccine given to 1-day-old chickens by hatchery spray cabinet replicated poorly and failed to adequately protect broilers against homologous virus challenge, whereas the same vaccine given by eye-drop did replicate and the birds were protected following homologous virus challenge. To determine if mechanical damage following spray application plays a role in failure of the Ark-DPI vaccine, we examined the morphology of three Ark-DPI vaccines from different manufacturers using an electron microscope and included a Massachusetts (Mass) vaccine as control. One of the Ark-DPI vaccines (vaccine A) and the Mass vaccine had significantly (P < 0.005) fewer spikes than the other two Ark-DPI vaccines. We also found that the Ark-DPI and Mass vaccines had significantly (P < 0.005) fewer spike proteins per virus particle when compared to their respective challenge viruses. This observation is interesting and may provide some insight into the mechanism behind infectious bronchitis virus attenuation. No obvious differences were observed in virus morphology and no consistent trend in the number of spikes per virion was found in before- and after-spray samples. We also determined the vaccine titer before and after spray in embryonated eggs and found that both Ark-DPI and Mass vaccines had a similar drop in titer, 0.40 logi and 0.310 logi, respec10ively. Based on these data, it appears that mechanical damage to the Ark-DPI vaccine is not occurring when delivered by a hatchery spray cabinet, suggesting that some other factor is contributing to the failure of that vaccine when given by that method.","Roh, Ha-Jung; Jordan, Brian J; Hilt, Deborah A; Ard, Mary B; Jackwood, Mark W",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26292549/,165
200008,Acromegaly management in a tertiary referral center after 1 year of the coronavirus 2019 pandemic: a double challenge,2021,"Since the outbreak of a SARS epidemic last year, significant advances have been made on our understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between the SARS coronavirus (CoV) and the immune system. Strong humoral responses have been found in most patients following SARS-CoV infection, with high titers of neutralizing Abs present in their convalescent sera. The nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV appear to be the dominant antigens recognized by serum Abs. CD4+ T cell responses against the N protein have been observed in SARS patients and an HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope in the S protein has been identified. It is likely that the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV infection could also cause pathological damage to the host, especially in the case of proinflammatory cytokines. There is also evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV might be able to directly invade cells of the immune system. Our understanding on the interaction between SARS-CoV, the immune system and local tissues is essential to future diagnosis, control and treatment of this very contagious disease.","Xu, Xiaojun; Gao, Xiaoming",Cellular & molecular immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16212898/,165

The device exhibited optimal sample pre-concentration of 6.7x at a stock value of 10(3) cfu/ml and at a flow rate of 250 microl/h. Electro-disruption experiments showed that on-chip-based electroporation is an effective solution for lysis of B. pertussis cells that is easily integrated with dielectrophoresis assisted pre-concentration procedures. Pulsed voltage applied, number of pulses, and presence of potassium chloride in a B. pertussis suspension showed a reduction in B. pertussis cell viability by electroporation; and transmission electron microscopy confirmed B. pertussis cell disruption by electroporation.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the factors affecting occupational burnout among health care center staff during the pandemic of coronavirus infection. Methods: The present study was a case-control study carried out in the first half of the year 2020 on medical staff working in hospitals in Tehran. The sample size was 324 individuals, including 175 employees working in general (non-COVID) wards and 149 people working in COVID-19 wards. Demographic characteristics questionnaire and two standard questionnaires of Maslach Burnout Inventory and Parker and DeCotiis Job Stress Scale were distributed. Results: Total score of job stress and its two dimensions (time and pressure) had a significant relationship with different levels of occupational burnout. Logistic regression analyses showed significant relations between job stress with emotional exhaustion (95% CI, 1.11-1.19, OR=1.15) and depersonalization. Participants in both wards experienced statistically significant increasing trends given the different components of occupational burnout concurrently by increasing their total stress score. Conclusion: Hospital staff’s levels of stress and occupational burnout regardless of where they worked (COVID-19 wards or general wards) were not significantly different and existed among the members of both groups. On the other hand, job stress and its dimensions (time pressure and anxiety) had a significant relationship with the main dimensions of occupational burnout. © 2021 Etesam et al.","Etesam, F.; Akhlaghi, M.; Vahabi, Z.; Akbarpour, S.; Sadeghian, M.

203066,Pos-655 Risk Factors for In-hospital Mortality in Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis Patients Admitted with Covid-19 at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute of the Philippines,2021,"Although not widely studied, behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented. Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (Ro) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.","Barton, Michael C; Bennett, Kaylee V; Cook, John R; Gallup, Gordon G; Platek, Steven M",Med Hypotheses,,165

210764,Predicting of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Epidemic Using Estimation of Parameters in the Logistic Growth Model,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be mostly transmitted by medium- to large-sized respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission may be possible in healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures. Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naive hamsters into closed system units each comprising 2 different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Noncontact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naive hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naive hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P = .018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P = .019) of exposed naive hamsters. Unlike the severe manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected naive hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei which could be reduced by surgical mask partition in the hamster model. This is the first in vivo experimental evidence to support the possible benefit of surgical mask in prevention of COVID-19 transmission, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals.","Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuan, Shuofeng; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Fan, Zhimeng; Li, Can; Liang, Ronghui; Cao, Jianli; Tang, Kaiming; Luo, Cuiting; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chu, Hin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Sridhar, Siddharth; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin Infect Dis,,165

This study investigated the dynamic vagal modulation of cardiac output in response to shifts in environmental demands in children and adolescents with ADHD, with and without a comorbid anxiety disorder. High-frequency HRV (HF-HRV) measures were obtained from 46 children and adolescents ranging from 6 to 17 (M = 9.38; SD = 2.31) years old, during three successive experimental conditions: a baseline recording followed by a sustained attention task, and a post-task recovery period. Findings support the reliability of the d2 Test, a cancelation test of attention and concentration, to induce parasympathetic withdrawal and extend prior work on ""vagal flexibility"". Further, these findings suggest a pattern of group differences in ANS functioning in children with ADHD, with and without a comorbid anxiety disorder. Only the ADHD without comorbid anxiety group showed a normative autonomic response to the cognitive challenge (reduced HF-HRV). The participants did not display an adaptive process of restoration following the cognitive challenge; the HRV suppression was prolonged during post-task recovery period, suggesting that ANS responded as if the cognitive stressor was still present.

TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases. In this regard, they may have considerable positive impact as a modality for improving global health. In this article, we introduce the possible role and summarize the current literature regarding TDDS applications for fighting common cutaneous or systemic viral infectious diseases, including herpes simplex, varicella or herpes zoster, warts, influenza, measles, and COVID-19.","Wang, Fang-Ying; Chen, Yunching; Huang, Yi-You; Cheng, Chao-Min",Drug Deliv Transl Res,,165

Using national data from over a million U.S. respondents to a Facebook-Carnegie Mellon University survey administered from September 2020 to March 2021, we estimated the likelihoods of frontline workers, compared to non-frontline workers, 1) to ever test positive for SARs-Cov-2 and 2) to test positive for SARs-Cov-2 within the past two weeks. Net of other covariates including education level, county-level political environment, and rural residence, both healthcare and non-healthcare frontline workers had higher odds of having ever tested positive for SARs-Cov-2 across the study time period. Similarly, non-healthcare frontline workers were more likely to test positive in the previous 14 days. Conversely, healthcare frontline workers were less likely to have recently tested positive. Our findings suggest that occupational exposure has played an independent role in the uneven spread of the virus. In particular, non-healthcare frontline workers have experienced sustained higher risk of testing positive for SARs-Cov-2 compared to non-frontline workers. Alongside more worker protections, future COVID-19 and other highly infectious disease response strategies must be augmented by a more robust recognition of the role that structural factors, such as the highly stratified U.S. occupational landscape, have played in the uneven toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Do, D.

Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb, CV07-209, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 3.1 ng/mL. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 Å revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss, and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy.","Kreye, Jakob; Reincke, S Momsen; Kornau, Hans-Christian; Sánchez-Sendin, Elisa; Corman, Victor Max; Liu, Hejun; Yuan, Meng; Wu, Nicholas C; Zhu, Xueyong; Lee, Chang-Chun D; Trimpert, Jakob; Höltje, Markus; Dietert, Kristina; Stöffler, Laura; von Wardenburg, Niels; van Hoof, Scott; Homeyer, Marie A; Hoffmann, Julius; Abdelgawad, Azza; Gruber, Achim D; Bertzbach, Luca D; Vladimirova, Daria; Li, Lucie Y; Barthel, Paula Charlotte; Skriner, Karl; Hocke, Andreas C; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Witzenrath, Martin; Suttorp, Norbert; Kurth, Florian; Franke, Christiana; Endres, Matthias; Schmitz, Dietmar; Jeworowski, Lara Maria; Richter, Anja; Schmidt, Marie Luisa; Schwarz, Tatjana; Müller, Marcel Alexander; Drosten, Christian; Wendisch, Daniel; Sander, Leif E; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Wilson, Ian A; Prüss, Harald",Cell,,165

The purpose of this study was to examine the content of news segments covering COVID-19 posted on-line. METHODS: Using the Google Videos function on a cleared browser, all videos identified from January and February, 2020 were archived by URL for analysis. After applying exclusion criteria, a total of 401 remained, comprising the sample. Content categories derived from trusted sources were applied to assess the content of broadcast news segments pertaining to COVID-19 on Google Videos. RESULTS: The most common topic mentioned across all videos was death and the death rate (43.6%) and many connoted anxieties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak (37.4%). Critically important information about the prevention of COVID-19 spread received little attention. For example, only 3.0% of videos discussed coughing into or blowing one's nose into a tissue and throwing the tissue away, 6.2% talked about wearing a facemask when caring for the ill, and 8.8% covered disinfecting highly touched objects and surfaces. International videos more often presented captions and English subtitles (with and without narration) (7.8% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.018) and even more frequently discussed death and the death rate associated with COVID-19 (56.9% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Coupled with the resultant increase in negative emotion, the majority of videos missed an opportunity to reframe messages to encourage and promote coping strategies and health sustaining behaviors. Future videos should avoid contributing to negative emotion.","Basch, Corey H; Hillyer, Grace Clarke; Erwin, Zoe Meleo-; Mohlman, Jan; Cosgrove, Alison; Quinones, Nasia",Infect Dis Health,,165

Controversy exists on the vulnerability of thoracic cancer patients. We describe the characteristics and sequelae of patients with thoracic cancer treated at a UK cancer centre infected with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients undergoing care for thoracic cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 (RT-PCR/radiology/clinically) between March-June 2020 were included. Data were extracted from patient records. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included: 14 (43%) diagnosed by RT-PCR, 18 (57%) by radiology and/or convincing symptoms. 88% had advanced thoracic malignancies. Eleven of 14 (79%) patients diagnosed by RT-PCR and 12 of 18 (56%) patients diagnosed by radiology/clinically were hospitalised, of which four (29%) and 2 (11%) patients required high-dependency/intensive care respectively. Three (21%) patients diagnosed by RT-PCR and 2 (11%) patients diagnosed by radiology/clinically required non-invasive ventilation; none were intubated. Complications included pneumonia and sepsis (43% and 14% respectively in patients diagnosed by RT-PCR; 17% and 11% respectively in patients diagnosed by radiology/clinically). In patients receiving active cancer treatment, therapy was delayed/ceased in 10/12 (83%) and 7/11 (64%) patients diagnosed by RT-PCR and radiology/clinically respectively. Nine (28%) patients died; all were smokers. Median time from symptom onset to death was 7 days (range 3-37). CONCLUSIONS: The immediate morbidity from COVID-19 is high in thoracic cancer patients. Hospitalisation and treatment interruption rates were high. Improved risk-stratification models for UK cancer patients are urgently needed to guide safe cancer-care delivery without compromising efficacy.","Cui, Wanyuan; Yousaf, Nadia; Bhosle, Jaishree; Minchom, Anna; Nicholson, Andrew G; Ahmed, Merina; McDonald, Fiona; Locke, Imogen; Lee, Richard; O039,; Brien, Mary; Popat, Sanjay",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,165
238618,Enlightenment from clinical trials on Chinese medicine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Takiwasi is a therapeutic community for the treatment of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) that combines traditional Amazonian medicine (TAM) with modern psychotherapy. One of the plant medicines from TAM used in this protocol is purgahuasca. It is a decoction of the vine Banisteriopsis caapi alone, whose use is traditional among the Awajún and other ethnic groups in Peru. The research began with a field trip to Awajún territory to explore the indigenous use of purgahuasca as an initiation rite. Then, analysis of its application was conducted in the clinical context of Takiwasi. Open-ended and semi-structured interviews with Awajún informants and Takiwasi's therapeutic staff were performed and analyzed following the narrative methodological approach. Further clinical data on the ingestion of purgahuasca by Takiwasi's SUD patients were obtained from the internal repository. These indicate that 359 (92.1%) patients reported having had the so-called mareación (dizziness), 299 (76.7%) experienced physical sensations, and 208 (53.3%) had visions. These effects can be related to the psychoactivity of ß-Carbolines alkaloids from B. caapi, a medicinal plant that seems to have potential benefits also for SUD, especially giving a key contribution to the patients' therapeutic process of becoming aware of the personal reasons behind addictive behaviors.","Politi, Matteo; Friso, Fabio; Saucedo, Gary; Torres, Jaime",J Psychoactive Drugs,,165

While the main organ targeted in this disease is the lungs, other vital organs, such as the heart and kidney, may be implicated. The main host receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a major component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The ACE2 is also involved in testicular male regulation of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. As the SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to infect the testis via ACE2 and adversely affect male reproductive system, it is essential to commence with targeted studies to learn from the current pandemic, with the possibility of preemptive intervention, depending on the findings and time course of the continuing pandemic.","Younis, Johnny S; Abassi, Zaid; Skorecki, Karl",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,,165

Its mortality rate is higher in individuals over 80 years of age and in people with comorbidities, so these constitute the risk group for severe forms of the disease. We analyzed the factors associated with death in confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state of Rio de Janeiro. This cross-sectional study evaluated the association between individual demographic, clinical, and epidemiological variables and the outcome (death) using data from the Unified Health System information systems. METHODS: We used the extreme boosting gradient (XGBoost) model to analyze the data, which uses decision trees weighted by the estimation difficulty. To evaluate the relevance of each independent variable, we used the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) metric. From the probabilities generated by the XGBoost model, we transformed the data to the logarithm of odds to estimate the odds ratio for each independent variable. RESULTS: This study showed that older individuals of black race/skin color with heart disease or diabetes who had dyspnea or fever were more likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The early identification of patients who may progress to a more severe form of the disease can help improve the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and is thus essential to reduce the lethality of the disease.","Cini Oliveira, Marcella; de Araujo Eleuterio, Tatiana; de Andrade Corrêa, Allan Bruno; da Silva, Lucas Dalsenter Romano; Rodrigues, Renata Coelho; de Oliveira, Bruna Andrade; Martins, Marlos Melo; Raymundo, Carlos Eduardo; de Andrade Medronho, Roberto",BMC Infect Dis,,165

Open reading frame 10 (ORF10) is a unique SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein, which contains eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes each of nine amino acids in length. Twenty-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants have been identified based on missense mutations found in sequence databases. Some of these mutations are predicted to decrease the stability of ORF10 in silico physicochemical and structural comparative analyses were carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid (aa) homology. Though there is a high degree of ORF10 protein similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV, there are differences of these two ORF10 proteins related to their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and shift from strand to coil at aa position 26 (tyrosine).

242166,Pos-534 Trajectories of Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics Associated with Covid-19 in Hemodialysis Patients by Survival,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, causing a severe outbreak. Because the disease is easily transmitted, face masks are a vital tool to slow the spread. The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of face mask use on standard automated perimetry (SAP) results in glaucoma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All follow-up glaucoma patients who underwent SAP between May and October 2020 were enrolled in this study. In patients with low test reliability and/or visual field changes, SAP was repeated after repositioning and taping patients' face masks. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients (59 female and 68 male) with a mean age of 59.8±10.3 years were included in the study. While 101 patients (79.5%) wore surgical face masks, 26 patients (20.5%) wore cloth face masks. Low SAP reliability appeared in 23 patients (18.1%), and inferior visual field defects were present in 3 patients (2.4%). The main effects of poorly-fitting face masks on SAP reliability were increased fixation losses and false-positive errors (for both, P=0.001). Low SAP reliability was significantly higher in patients wearing cloth face masks than in those wearing surgical face masks (47.8% vs. 9.9%; P=0.0001). The face mask-related fogging of eyeglasses before SAP is a strong predictor of fogging of the trial lenses-related low SAP reliability (odds ratio: 27, 95% confidence interval: 5.48-132.92, P=0.0001). In all repeated SAPs, the patients' reliability parameters improved, and inferior visual field artifacts disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Unsuitable face masks can cause either visual field artifacts, which may be interpreted as glaucoma progression or low test reliability. Taping the face masks' upper edges is an effective technique to prevent visual field artifacts and obtain good test reliability.","Bayram, Nurettin; Gundogan, Medine; Ozsaygili, Cemal; Vural, Esra; Cicek, Ayse",J. glaucoma,,165
242205,Primary stratification and identification of suspected Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from clinical perspective by a simple scoring proposal,2020,"Background: This rapid evidence review identifies and integrates evidence from epidemiology, microbiology and fluid dynamics on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments. Methods: Searches were conducted in May 2020 in PubMed, medRxiv, arXiv, Scopus, WHO COVID-19 database, Compendex & Inspec. We included studies reporting data on any indoor setting except schools, any indoor activities and any potential means of transmission. Articles were screened by a single reviewer, with rejections assessed by a second reviewer. We used Joanna Briggs Institute and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools for evaluating epidemiological studies and developed bespoke tools for the evaluation of study types not covered by these instruments. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by a single reviewer. We conducted a meta-analysis of secondary attack rates in household transmission. Otherwise, data were synthesised narratively. Results: We identified 1573 unique articles. After screening and quality assessment, fifty-eight articles were retained for analysis. Experimental evidence from fluid mechanics and microbiological studies demonstrates that aerosolised transmission is theoretically possible; however, we found no conclusive epidemiological evidence of this occurring. The evidence suggests that ventilation systems have the potential to decrease virus transmission near the source through dilution but to increase transmission further away from the source through dispersal. We found no evidence for faecal-oral transmission. Laboratory studies suggest that the virus survives for longer on smooth surfaces and at lower temperatures. Environmental sampling studies have recovered small amounts of viral RNA from a wide range of frequently touched objects and surfaces; however, epidemiological studies are inconclusive on the extent of fomite transmission. We found many examples of transmission in settings characterised by close and prolonged indoor contact. We estimate a pooled secondary attack rate within households of 11% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9, 13). There were insufficient data to evaluate the transmission risks associated with specific activities. Workplace challenges related to poverty warrant further investigation as potential risk factors for workplace transmission. Fluid mechanics evidence on the physical properties of droplets generated by coughing, speaking and breathing reinforce the importance of maintaining 2 m social distance to reduce droplet transmission. Conclusions: This review provides a snap-shot of evidence on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments from the early months of the pandemic. The overall quality of the evidence was low. As the quality and quantity of available evidence grows, it will be possible to reach firmer conclusions on the risk factors for and mechanisms of indoor transmission.","Goodwin, Lara; Hayward, Toneka; Krishan, Prerna; Nolan, Gemma; Nundy, Madhurima; Ostrishko, Kayla; Attili, Antonio; Cárceles, Salva Barranco; Epelle, Emmanuel I; Gabl, Roman; Pappa, Evanthia J; Stajuda, Mateusz; Zen, Simone; Dozier, Marshall; Anderson, Niall; Viola, Ignazio M; McQuillan, Ruth",J Glob Health,,165

244086,"The spectrum of kidney biopsies in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, acute kidney injury, and/or proteinuria",2021,"Several studies indicate that semen quality has strongly declined in the last decades worldwide. Air pollution represents a significant co-factor with the COVID-19 impact and has negative effects on the male reproductive system, through pro-oxidant, inflammatory and immune-dysregulating mechanisms. It has recently been reported that chronic exposure to PM2.5 causes overexpression of the alveolar ACE2 receptor, the entry route of SARS-CoV-2 into the organism shared by the lungs and testis where expression is highest in the body. In the testis, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR pathway plays an important role in the regulation of spermatogenesis and an indirect mechanism of testicular damage could be due to the blockade of the ACE2 receptor by SARS-CoV-2. This prevents the conversion of specific angiotensins, and their excess causes inflammation with the overproduction of cytokines. PM2.5-induced overexpression of the alveolar ACE2 receptor, in turn, could increase local viral load in patients exposed to pollutants, producing ACE2 receptor depletion and compromising host defenses. By presenting an overall view of epidemiological data and molecular mechanisms, this manuscript aims to interpret the possible synergistic effects of both air pollution and COVID-19 on male reproductive function, warning that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the fertile years may represent a significant threat to global reproductive health. All of this should be of great concern, especially for men of the age of maximum reproductive capacity, and an important topic of debate for policy makers. Altered environmental conditions, together with the direct and indirect short- and long-term effects of viral infection could cause a worsening of semen quality with important consequences for male fertility, especially in those areas with higher environmental impact.","Montano, Luigi; Donato, Francesco; Bianco, Pietro Massimiliano; Lettieri, Gennaro; Guglielmino, Antonino; Motta, Oriana; Bonapace, Ian Marc; Piscopo, Marina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,165

We conducted a survey to study the changes in the clubfoot treatment practices, Achilles tenotomy methods, and the role along with the possible impact of teleconsultation during this pandemic. Methods: A web-based survey was conducted using a questionnaire prepared on Google forms. The link for this questionnaire was sent to Indian Orthopaedic specialists with a special interest in clubfoot management via a social messaging platform. Results: 127 eligible responses were analysed. Of them, 67% respondents were in practice for more than 10 years. During the study period, 30.7% of doctors did not perform any casting; 66.9% performed casting in 1-5 cases per week and only 2.4% performed casting in more than five cases per week. A statistically significant difference was noted in the number of doctors who performed casting in less than five cases per week and the doctors who performed casting in more than five cases per week, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 30.7% of doctors deferred doing Achilles tenotomy during the study period, and among those who performed one, a significant number of them avoided tenotomy under general anaesthesia. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted clubfoot treatment practices during the lockdown period in India. Significant reductions in the number of cases, and a reduction with changes in Achilles tenotomy practices were noted too. However, whether this had any adverse influence on the eventual outcome in these feet is yet to be determined.","Rangasamy, Karthick; Mehta, Rujuta; Gopinathan, Nirmal Raj; Aroojis, Alaric; Behera, Prateek; Dhillon, Mandeep S",Indian J Orthop,,165

The results are based on a novel data set collected by the World Bank Group and several partner institutions in 51 countries covering more than 100,000 businesses. The paper provides several stylized facts. First, the COVID-19 shock has been severe and widespread across firms, with persistent negative impact on sales. Second, the employment adjustment has operated mostly along the intensive margin (that is leave of absence and reduction in hours), with a small share of firms laying off workers. Third, smaller firms are disproportionately facing greater financial constraints. Fourth, firms are increasingly relying on digital solutions as a response to the shock. Fifth, there is great uncertainty about the future, especially among firms that have experienced a larger drop in sales, which is associated with job losses. These findings provide a better understanding of the magnitude and distribution of the shock, the main channels affecting businesses, and how firms are adjusting. The paper concludes by discussing some avenues for future research.","Apedo-Amah, M. C.; Avdiu, B.; Cirera, X.; Cruz, M.; Davies, E.; Grover, A.; Iacovone, L.; Kilinc, U.; Medvedev, D.; Maduko, F.

SARS-CoV-2, or widely known as COVID-19, has proved to be a hazardous virus severely affecting the health of people. It causes respiratory illness, especially in people who already suffer from other diseases. Limited availability of test kits as well as symptoms similar to other diseases such as pneumonia has made this disease deadly, claiming the lives of millions of people. Artificial intelligence models are found to be very successful in the diagnosis of various diseases in the biomedical field In this paper, an integrated stacked deep convolution network InstaCovNet-19 is proposed. The proposed model makes use of various pre-trained models such as ResNet101, Xception, InceptionV3, MobileNet, and NASNet to compensate for a relatively small amount of training data. The proposed model detects COVID-19 and pneumonia by identifying the abnormalities caused by such diseases in Chest X-ray images of the person infected. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.08% on 3 class (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal) classification while achieving an accuracy of 99.53% on 2 class (COVID, NON-COVID) classification. The proposed model achieves an average recall, F1 score, and precision of 99%, 99%, and 99%, respectively on ternary classification, while achieving a 100% precision and a recall of 99% on the binary class., while achieving a 100% precision and a recall of 99% on the COVID class.

We focused on methotrexate, a broadly used drug unrelated to COVID‐19, and (hydroxy)chloroquine, another broadly used drug implicated in COVID‐19 treatment. Using descriptive statistics, we compared reporting characteristics before and after the COVID‐19 outbreak.ResultsDuring the study period, 366 998 cases (60% female, median age: 59 years) were submitted to FAERS. The daily median number of reports (1796 in the pre‐pandemic, 1810 in the second pandemic time interval) and other characteristics remained stable. The daily median number of reports for methotrexate decreased from 28 in the pre‐pandemic to 15 in the second pandemic time interval, with no considerable differences in other characteristics. The daily median number of reports for (hydroxy)chloroquine increased slightly from 1 in the pre‐pandemic to 3 in the second pandemic time interval, while there were also changes in the demographics of cases and an increase in the proportion of cases reported by health professionals.ConclusionsThe overall reporting to FAERS did not change after the outbreak of the COVID‐19 pandemic. However, some stimulated reporting was observed for (hydroxy)chloroquine, highlighting the need for caution when conducting pharmacovigilance analyses with substances related to COVID‐19.","Dörks, Michael Jobski Kathrin Hoffmann Falk Douros Antonios",Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety,,165

Sarawak, the largest state in Malaysia has consistently recorded the highest cervical cancer rate in the country where nearly half of its population still live in the rural areas and is at increased risk of the disease due to inequitable access to healthcare. The countrywide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic had halted the accessibility to cervical cancer screening programme. The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of providing primary HPV DNA test using the selfsampling method to the hard-to-reach population in the interior of Sarawak during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study where women aged between 20-80 years were recruited via convenient sampling from villages in Long Banga, Sarawak over a five-day outreach programme. Cervicovaginal selfsamples were obtained and screened for the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (HR-HPV) using the careHPVTM Test. A self-administered questionnaire was also administered to determine the sociodemographic and perception towards the self-sampling method. RESULTS: The 55 women recruited consist of ethnic backgrounds of Penan (58.18%), Kenyah (25.45%), Iban (5.45%), Saban (3.64%), Kelabit (3.64%), Malay (1.82%) and Chinese (1.82%). The prevalence of HR-HPV was 1.85% (n=1/55). Nearly 80% of the women were unemployed, and more than half have had attended primary education. Nine (16.4%) have heard about HPV, and seven (13%) knew HPV infection could cause cervical cancer. Three of them had HPV vaccination, and only one (1.85%) knew the brand of the HPV vaccine. Although 40% preferred self-sampling over clinician-collection, only ten (18.2%) women have completed the self-collection perception questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Primary HPV DNA screening using the selfsampling method can be carried out in the remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising mobility restriction.","Tan, C.

Lateral flow assay (LFA) has been widely deployed in remote settings as a rapid and reliable approach for point-of-care detection of infectious pathogens. However, it still remains challenging to detect IAV virions using LFA from clinical samples such as nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, because their various components and high viscosity can decrease flow velocity and lead to the nonspecific adsorption of nanoparticle labels on the sensing membrane. Herein, we demonstrated a magnetic quantum dot nanobeads (MQBs) based LFA for magnetic enrichment and fluorescent detection of IAV virions in clinical specimens. In this study, MQBs were synthesized and then conjugated with IAV-specific antibody to efficiently enrich IAV virions from complex biological matrix, but also serve as highly bright fluorescent probes in lateral flow strips. This assay can achieve quantitative detection of IAV virions with a low limit of detection down to 22 pfu mL-1 within 35 minutes, and show good specificity between influenza B virus and two adenovirus strains. Furthermore, the presented platform was able to directly detect IAV virions spiked in nasopharyngeal swab dilution, indicating its stability and feasibility in clinical applications. Thus, this point-of-care detection platform holds great promise as a broadly applicable approach for the rapid diagnosis of influenza A.","Bai, Zikun; Wei, Hongjuan; Yang, Xingsheng; Zhu, Yanhui; Peng, Yongjin; Yang, Jing; Wang, Chongwen; Rong, Zhen; Wang, Shengqi",Sens Actuators B Chem,,165
259367,Inpatient care for urological patients in a pandemic of the coronavirus disease infection COVID-19,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a formidable threat to global health and economy. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 is known to spread by human-to-human transmission, and in about 40% cases, the exposed individuals are asymptomatic which makes it difficult to contain the virus. Methods: This paper presents a modified SEIR epidemiological model and uses concepts of optimal control theory for analysis of the effects of intervention methods of the COVID19. Fundamentally the pandemic intervention problem can be viewed as a mathematical optimization problem as there are contradictory outcomes in terms of reduced infection and fatalities but with serious economic downturns. Results: Concepts of optimal control theory have been used to determine the optimal control (intervention) levels of i) social contact mitigation and suppression, and ii) pharmaceutical intervention modalities, with minimum impacts on the economy. Numerical results show that with optimal intervention policies, there is a significant reduction in the number of infections and fatalities. The computed optimum intervention policy also provides a timeline of systematic enforcement and relaxation of stay-at-home regulations, and an estimate of the peak time and number of hospitalized critical care patients. Conclusion: The proposed method could be used by local and state governments in planning effective strategies in combating the pandemic. The optimum intervention policy provides the necessary lead time to establish necessary field hospitals before getting overwhelmed by new patient arrivals. Our results also allow the local and state governments to relax social contact suppression guidelines in an orderly manner without triggering a second wave.","Biswas, S. K.; Ahmed, N.

Unfortunately, there are no large clinical trial available to reliably document the efficacy of delivering videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP) for people with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) and whether basic psychotherapeutic processes are altered. Methods: This 2-arm intent-to-treat non-inferiority study reports on a clinical trial on VCP and documents how therapeutic working alliance and motivation toward psychotherapy are associated to treatment outcome. We hypothesized that VCP would not be inferior to standard face-to-face (FF) cognitive behavior therapy for PDA. No specific hypothesis was stated to address working alliance and treatment mechanisms. VCP was compared to a gold-standard psychotherapy treatment for PDA, which was delivered either in person or in videoconference, with a strict tolerance criterion of about 2 points on the primary outcome measure. Seventy one adult patients were recruited. Measures of working alliance were collected after the first, fifth, and last session. Motivation toward therapy at pre-treatment and working alliance after the fifth therapy session were used as predictors of treatment outcome and compared with change in dysfunctional beliefs toward bodily sensations. Results: Panic disorder, agoraphobia, fear of sensations and depressed mood all showed significant improvements and large effect-sizes from pre to post-treatment. Gains were maintained at follow-up. No significant differences were found between VCP and FF, and effect sizes were trivial for three of the four outcome measures. Non-inferiority tests confirmed that VCP was no less effective than FF therapy on the primary outcome measure and two of the three secondary outcome measures. Working alliance was very strong in VCP and did not statistically differ from FF. Working alliance and motivation did not predict treatment outcome, which was significantly predicted by the reduction in dysfunctional beliefs. The strength of the therapeutic bond was correlated with change in dysfunctional beliefs. Conclusion: Mental health professionals can use VCP to provide services to patients with PDA. Building and maintaining a sound working alliance should not be a source concern. Practical recommendations are formulated.

The resulting reduction in demand for imaging services had an abrupt and substantial impact on private radiology practices, which are heavily dependent on examination volumes for practice revenues. The goal of this article is to describe the specific experiences of radiologists working in various types of private radiology practices during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, the authors describe factors determining the impact of the pandemic on private practices, the challenges these practices have faced, the cost levers leaders adjusted, and the government subsidies sought. In addition, the authors describe adjustments practices are making to their mid- and long-term strategic plans to pivot for long-term success while managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Private practices have crafted tiered strategies to respond to the impact of the pandemic by pulling various cost levers to adjust service availability, staffing, compensation, benefits, time off, and expense reductions. In addition, they have sought additional revenues, within the boundaries of their practice, to mitigate ongoing financial losses. The longer-term impact of the pandemic will alter existing practices, making some of them more likely than others to succeed in the years ahead. This report synthesizes the collective experience of private practice radiologists shared with members of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 Task Force, including discussions with colleagues and leaders of private practice radiology groups from across the United States.","Sharpe, Richard E; Kuszyk, Brian S; Mossa-Basha, Mahmud",Radiology,,165

Its use is associated with a significant hemostatic challenge, especially in COVID- 19 patients who have been demonstrated to otherwise present a COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. The systematic use of unfractionated heparin therapy to prevent circuit thrombosis is warranted during ECMO support. The clinical presentation and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a rare but life-threatening complication of heparin therapy, has not been described in those patients yet. We report herein two cases of laboratory-confirmed HIT in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS admitted to our intensive care unit for VV-ECMO support and the successful use of argatroban as an alternative therapy. We also provide a brief literature review of best evidence for managing such patients. The diagnosis and management of HIT is particularly challenging in COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support. An increased awareness is warranted in those patients who already present a procoagulant state leading to higher rates of thrombotic events which can confuse the issues. Argatroban seems to be an appropriate and safe therapeutic option in COVID-19 patients with HIT while on VV-ECMO.","Bidar, Frank; Hékimian, Guillaume; Martin-Toutain, Isabelle; Lebreton, Guillaume; Combes, Alain; Frère, Corinne",J. artif. organs,,165

Evidence of how this health crisis affected common conditions like blood pressure (BP) control is uncertain. METHODS: We used longitudinal BP data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial to examine variations in home BP monitored via a smartphone-based application (app) in a total of 7394 elderly patients with hypertension aged 60 to 80 years stratified by their location in Wuhan (n=283) compared with other provinces of China (n=7111). Change in morning systolic BP (SBP) was analyzed for 5 30-day phases during the pandemic, including preepidemic (October 21 to November 20, 2019), incubation (November 21 to December 20, 2019), developing (December 21, 2019 to January 20, 2020), outbreak (January 21 to February 20, 2020), and plateau (February 21 to March 21, 2020). RESULTS: Compared with non-Wuhan areas of China, average morning SBP (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index) in Wuhan patients was significantly higher during the epidemic growth phases, which returned to normal at the plateau. Between-group differences in &#916;SBP were +2.5, +3.0, and +2.1 mm Hg at the incubation, developing, and outbreak phases of COVID-19 (P<0.001), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed a similar trend in trajectory pattern of SBP in both the intensive and standard BP control groups of the trial. Patients in Wuhan also had an increased regimen change in antihypertensive drugs during the outbreak compared with non-Wuhan patients. Expectedly, Wuhan patients were more likely to check their BP via the app, while doctors were less likely to monitor the app for BP control during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a short-term increase in morning SBP among elderly patients with hypertension in Wuhan but not other parts of China. Further study will be needed to understand if these findings extended to other parts of the world substantially affected by the virus. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Healthcare professionals directly involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the prevalence of PTSD among nurses working in a COVID hospital and evaluated associated factors. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Crema Hospital and the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) was administered. Data collection took place from July to September 2020, during which 275 questionnaires were distributed. RESULTS: Of the total sample, 39.88% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis deserving of further analysis. Nurses stated that they were predominantly overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts (M = 1.55). Working in the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR=2.40; p=0.02), irregular work shifts (OR=5.41; p=0.01) and coming from a mental health ward (OR=3.80; p=0.02) increased the risk of receiving a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Our findings showed significantly higher IES-R scores among women than among men (p = 0.01). The activities that caused the most distress were related to technical skills required for managing ventilation and intubation devices. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study highlighted the presence of considerable psychological distress in the sample. There is an urgent need to monitor the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and implement early intervention measures.","Marcomini, Ilaria; Agus, Cristina; Milani, Laura; Sfogliarini, Roberto; Bona, Annamaria; Castagna, Marco",Med Lav,,165

278152,Emergency nursing management of PICC catheterization in outbreak of corona virus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the imminent collapse of health care systems following the exhaustion of financial, hospital, and medicinal resources, the World Health Organization changed the alert level of the COVID-19 pandemic from high to very high. Meanwhile, more cost-effective and precise COVID-19 detection methods are being preferred worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Machine vision-based COVID-19 detection methods, especially deep learning as a diagnostic method in the early stages of the pandemic, have been assigned great importance during the pandemic. This study aimed to design a highly efficient computer-aided detection (CAD) system for COVID-19 by using a neural search architecture network (NASNet)-based algorithm. METHODS: NASNet, a state-of-the-art pretrained convolutional neural network for image feature extraction, was adopted to identify patients with COVID-19 in their early stages of the disease. A local data set, comprising 10,153 computed tomography scans of 190 patients with and 59 without COVID-19 was used. RESULTS: After fitting on the training data set, hyperparameter tuning, and topological alterations of the classifier block, the proposed NASNet-based model was evaluated on the test data set and yielded remarkable results. The proposed model's performance achieved a detection sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.999, 0.986, and 0.996, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model achieved acceptable results in the categorization of 2 data classes. Therefore, a CAD system was designed on the basis of this model for COVID-19 detection using multiple lung computed tomography scans. The system differentiated all COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 ones without any error in the application phase. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based CAD system can greatly help radiologists detect COVID-19 in its early stages. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of a CAD system as a screening tool would accelerate disease detection and prevent the loss of health care resources.","Ghaderzadeh, Mustafa; Asadi, Farkhondeh; Jafari, Ramezan; Bashash, Davood; Abolghasemi, Hassan; Aria, Mehrad",J Med Internet Res,,165

Part of this includes patients skipping well-child visits to reduce risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Published estimates of the duration of whole-body aluminum (Al) toxicity from vaccines in infants from birth to six months indicate that CDC's recommended vaccination schedule leads to unacceptably long periods of time in which infants are in aluminum toxicity (as measured by %AlumTox). METHODS: We utilize these established clearance and accumulation models to calculate expected per-body-weight whole-body toxicity of aluminum from vaccines considering for children of all ages under CDC's Catch-Up schedule from birth to ten years, assuming social distancing for 6 months. Our updated Pediatric Dose Limit (PDL) model assumes a linear improvement in renal function from birth to two years. RESULTS: Our results indicate that due diligence in considering alternative spacing and use of non-aluminum containing vaccines when possible will reduce whole body toxicity and may reduce risk of morbidity associated with exposure to aluminum. CONCLUSIONS: While reduction or elimination of aluminum exposure from all sources is always a good idea, our results indicate that careful consideration of expected aluminum exposures during regular and Catch-Up vaccination is found to be especially important for infants and children below 2 years of age. We urge caution in the mass re-starting of vaccination under CDC's Catch-Up schedule for children under 12 months and offer alternative strategies to minimize per-day/week/month exposure to aluminum hydroxide following the COVID-19 period of isolation.","Lyons-Weiler, James; McFarland, Grant; La Joie, Elaine",J Trace Elem Med Biol,,165

Median pairwise single-measure ICC for status were 0.58-0.65 (WIPE-osteitis), 0.10-0.88 (HIMRISS-osteitis) and for status/change 0.38-0.72/0.52-0.60 (WIPE-synovitis/effusion) and 0.68-0.89/0.78-0.85 (HIMRISS-synovitis/effusion). SRM was 1.23 for WIPE-osteitis, while lower for WIPE-synovitis/effusion and HIMRISS. CONCLUSION: MRI-WIPE and HIMRISS may after further validation be useful in future spondyloarthritis trials.","Wetterslev, Marie; Lambert, Robert Gw; Maksymowych, Walter P; Eshed, Iris; Pedersen, Susanne J; Bird, Paul; Stoenoiu, Maria S; Krabbe, Simon; Mathew, Ashish J; Foltz, Violaine; Gandjbakhch, Frédérique; Paschke, Joel; De Marco, Gabriele; Marzo-Ortega, Helena; Carron, Philippe; Poulsen, Anna Ef; Jaremko, Jacob L; Conaghan, Philip G; Østergaard, Mikkel",Semin. arthritis rheum,,165

We present an architecture to convert segmentation models to classification models. We compare and contrast dense vs sparse segmentation labeling and study its impact on diagnostic classification. We compare the performance of U-Net trained with dense and sparse labels to segment A-lines, B-lines, and Pleural lines on a custom dataset of lung ultrasound scans from 4 patients. Our experiments show that dense labels help reduce false positive detection. We study the classification capability of the dense and sparse trained U-Net and contrast it with a non-pretrained U-Net, to detect and differentiate COVID-19 and Pneumonia on a large ultrasound dataset of about 40k curvilinear and linear probe images. Our segmentation-based models perform better classification when using pretrained segmentation weights, with the dense-label pretrained U-Net performing the best. © 2021 IEEE.","Gare, G.

Several health-related strategies have been successfully developed to contain the rapidly-spreading virus across the globe, towards reduction of both disease burden and infection rates. Particularly, attention has been focused on either the development of novel drugs and vaccines, or by adapting already-existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment, which mobilized huge efforts to block disease progression and overcome the shortage of effective measures available at this point.Areas covered: This perspective covers the breakthrough of multifunctional and biomimetic cell membrane-based nanoparticles as next-generation nanosystems for cutting-edge COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccination, specifically cell membrane-derived nanovesicles and cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, both tailorable cell membrane-based nanosystems enriched with the surface repertoire of native cell membranes, towards maximized biointerfacing, immune evasion, cell targeting and cell-mimicking properties.Expert opinion: Nano-based approaches have received widespread interest regarding enhanced antigen delivery, prolonged blood circulation half-life and controlled release of drugs. Cell membrane-based nanoparticles comprise interesting antiviral multifunctional nanoplatforms for blocking SARS-CoV-2 binding to host cells, reducing inflammation through cytokine neutralization and improving drug delivery toward COVID-19 treatment.","Pereira-Silva, Miguel; Chauhan, Gaurav; Shin, Matthew D; Hoskins, Clare; Madou, Marc J; Martinez-Chapa, Sergio O; Steinmetz, Nicole F; Veiga, Francisco; Santos, Ana Cláudia",Expert opin. drug deliv.

Since then, the virus has stretched its grip to almost all the countries in the world, affecting millions of people and causing enormous casualties. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2019. As of June 12, 2020, almost 7.30 million people have already been infected globally, with 413,000 reported casualties. In the United States alone, 2.06 million people have been infected and 115,000 have succumbed to this pandemic. A multipronged approach has been launched toward combating this pandemic, with the main focus on exhaustive screening, developing efficacious therapies, and vaccines for long-term immunity. Several pharmaceutical companies in collaboration with various academic institutions and governmental organizations have started investigating new therapeutics and repurposing approved drugs so as to find fast and affordable treatments against this disease. The present communication is aimed at highlighting the efforts that are currently underway to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, with details on the science, clinical status, and timeline for selected investigational drugs and vaccines. This article is going to be of immense help to the scientific community and researchers as it brings forth all the necessary clinical information of the most-talked-about therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.

Due to intrinsic instability typical of class I fusion proteins, S tends to prematurely refold to the post-fusion conformation, compromising immunogenic properties and prefusion trimer yields. To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify regions critical for stability: the heptad repeat region 1, the SD1 domain and position 614 in SD2. We combine a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation. Highly stable and well producing S protein and the increased understanding of S protein structure will support vaccine development and serological diagnostics.","Juraszek, Jarek; Rutten, Lucy; Blokland, Sven; Bouchier, Pascale; Voorzaat, Richard; Ritschel, Tina; Bakkers, Mark J G; Renault, Ludovic L R; Langedijk, Johannes P M",Nat Commun,,165

These sudden control measures led to radical changes in human activities in the Greater London Area (GLA). During this lockdown, transportation use was significantly reduced and non-key workers were required to work from home. This study aims to understand how population exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 changed spatially and temporally across London, in different microenvironments, following the lockdown period relative to the previous three-year average in the same calendar period. Our research shows that population exposure to NO2 declined significantly (52.3% ± 6.1%), while population exposure to PM2.5 showed a smaller relative reduction (15.7% ± 4.1%). Changes in population activity had the strongest relative influence on exposure levels during morning rush hours, when prior to the lockdown a large percentage of people would normally commute or be at the workplace. In particular, a very high exposure decrease was observed for both pollutants (approximately 66% for NO2 and 19% for PM2.5) at 08:00am, consistent with the radical changes in population commuting. The infiltration of outdoor air pollution into housing modifies the degree of exposure change both temporally and spatially. Moreover, this study shows that the impacts on air pollution exposure vary across groups with different socioeconomic status (SES), with a disproportionate positive effect on the areas of the city home to more economically deprived communities.","Kazakos, Vasilis; Taylor, Jonathon; Luo, Zhiwen",Environ Res,,165

It is widely accepted that healthcare workers should have high priority. However, questions have been raised about what we ought to do if members of priority groups refuse vaccination. Using the case of influenza vaccination as a comparison, we know that coercive approaches to vaccination uptake effectively increase vaccination rates among healthcare workers and reduce patient morbidity if properly implemented. Using the principle of least restrictive alternative, we have developed an intervention ladder for COVID-19 vaccination policies among healthcare workers. We argue that healthcare workers refusing vaccination without a medical reason should be temporarily redeployed and, if their refusal persists after the redeployment period, eventually suspended, in order to reduce the risk to their colleagues and patients. This 'conditional' policy is a compromise between entirely voluntary or entirely mandatory policies for healthcare workers, and is consistent with healthcare workers' established professional, legal and ethical obligations to their patients and to society at large.","Bradfield, Owen M; Giubilini, Alberto",J. med. ethics,,165

Infection is associated with development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity that can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be called upon to produce antibodies upon re-infection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titres decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 4 months after the onset of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), using immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers. We conclude that the memory B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection in a manner that is consistent with antigen persistence.","Gaebler, Christian; Wang, Zijun; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Muecksch, Frauke; Finkin, Shlomo; Tokuyama, Minami; Cho, Alice; Jankovic, Mila; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Cipolla, Melissa; Viant, Charlotte; Barnes, Christopher O; Bram, Yaron; Breton, Gaëlle; Hägglöf, Thomas; Mendoza, Pilar; Hurley, Arlene; Turroja, Martina; Gordon, Kristie; Millard, Katrina G; Ramos, Victor; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Jha, Divya; Tankelevich, Michael; Martinez-Delgado, Gustavo; Yee, Jim; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Unson-O039,; Brien, Cecille; Shimeliovich, Irina; Robbiani, Davide F; Zhao, Zhen; Gazumyan, Anna; Schwartz, Robert E; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Mehandru, Saurabh; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature (Lond.),,165

METHODS: Data of 350 COVID-19 positive patients, admitted to Al Kuwait Hospital in Dubai, UAE, from February to May 2020 was collected retrospectively, including demographic data, clinical symptoms, blood tests, as well as radiographical assessments, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The design of the study is a retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with diabetes belong to an older age group, had a higher percentage of male patients, exhibited more lymphopenia and neutrophilia, and higher ferritin levels. Additionally, patients with diabetes presented fever and shortness of breath (SOB), displayed more bilateral airspace consolidation and opacities in their chest x-ray and CT scans, compared to non-diabetics. A higher percentage of critical, ICU-admitted, and death of COVID-19 cases in the diabetic group was also reported. This was along with a concomitant increase in C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is considered a comorbidity as diabetic patients showed more severe COVID-19 symptoms that led to critical clinical outcomes such as ICU admission and death.","Elemam, Noha M; Hannawi, Haifa; Salmi, Issa Al; Naeem, Kashif Bin; Alokaily, Fahdah; Hannawi, Suad",Saudi Med J,,165

OPEs were detected in all mask samples, although in highly variable amounts which ranged from 0.02 to a maximum of 27.7 µg/mask, with the highest mean concentrations obtained for KN95 masks (11.6 µg/mask) and the lowest for surgical masks (0.24 µg/mask). Twelve out of 16 tested analytes were detected, with TEP, TPHP, TNBP, TEHP and TClPP being the most common OPEs as well as present at the highest concentrations. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of OPE inhalation were calculated as being always several orders of magnitude lower than threshold levels, indicating that the use of face masks is safe with regard to OPE contamination. However, given the wide range of OPEs observed in different masks, it can be concluded that some masks (e.g. reusable) are less OPE-contaminated than others (e.g. KN95). With regard to environmental pollution, the disposal of billions of face masks is adding to the already substantial levels of microplastics and associated toxic additives worldwide, an impact that is lessened by use of reusable masks, which also have the lowest economic cost per user. However, in situations of relatively high risk of viral inhalation, such as poorly ventilated indoor public spaces, we recommend the use of FFP2 masks.","Fernández-Arribas, J; Moreno, T; Bartrolí, R; Eljarrat, E",Environ Int,,165

A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature. SOURCES: We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects. CONTENT: We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options. IMPLICATIONS: The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density. However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians. For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.","Cevik, M; Bamford, C G G; Ho, A",Clin Microbiol Infect,,165

299786,Updated APLAR consensus statements on care for patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Due to its high transmission potential, COVID-19 disease has turned out to be a worldwide public health threat. As of May 2020, over 5M infections and 300,000 deaths had been reported globally. At the moment, there is limited research evidence from RCTs recommending certain drugs for the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. However, a number of studies have proposed numerous antiviral agents as a potential treatment option based on experiments done on animal models infected with other viral dis-eases. One such drug is favipiravir. The purpose of this review, therefore, was to examine recent updates about favipiravir and its likely role in the treatment of coronavirus disease. As has been previously reported in literature, favipi-ravir acts as a broad-spectrum medication that prevents the multiplication of flavivirus, filovirus, poliovirus, arenaviruses, and rhinovirus. The drug has recently been reported in some studies as useful in shortening the time of clinical recovery for COVID-19 patients. The study guaranteeing the usefulness of favipiravir in the treatment of the virus has since been withdrawn temporarily. The analysis in the study was largely open-label and non-randomized. Even with its adverse pharmacokinetic profile and the inconclusive data regarding its usefulness in the management of COVID-19, China has authorized the drug as a suitable treatment of COVID-19 patients as of March 2020. Still, favipiravir has been included in a number of ongoing trials, together with other antiviral drugs, such as lopinavir/ ritonavir.","Alshammari, Elham",Int. J. Res. Pharm. Sci.,,165

In this paper we undertake an ethical analysis of the supply of sweatshop-produced surgical goods to healthcare providers, with a specific focus on the National Health Service of the United Kingdom. We contend that while labour abuses and occupational health deficiencies are morally unacceptable in the production of any commodity, an additional wrong is incurred when the health of certain populations is secured in ways that endanger the health and well-being of people working and living elsewhere. While some measures have been taken to better regulate the supply chain to healthcare providers in the UK, further action is needed to ensure that surgical goods are sourced from suppliers who protect the labour and occupational health rights of their workers.","Trueba, Mei L; Bhutta, Mahmood F; Shahvisi, Arianne",J. med. ethics,,165

This study which is a cross-sectional one gives the idea about awareness and alertness of dentists about COVID-19 in Kerala, India. Materials and Methods: The survey comprised 25 closed-ended questions. The survey was separated into two sections. The initial segment of the poll was identified with the socio-segment qualities that were researched, while the subsequent part was worried about dental practitioners' perspectives toward the management of COVID-19 and the apparent danger of defilement in dental facilities. Results: Coronavirus management in dental clinics differs regarding adherence to the rules. An aggregate of 750 respondents finished the form, out of which 686 (91.46%) complete reactions were incorporated. The majority of the respondents concurred on inquiries regarding the knowledge, practice, and mentality of dental specialists toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The feedback of most dental specialists with respect to the readiness and view of disease control measures against the COVID-19 pandemic was positive. Dental facilities need to adhere more to the central and state government suggestions in alertness of their facilities or by tutoring their dental specialists and staff.","Aravind, A.; Nair, Samyukta Aparna T.; Thomas, Arun Sajna Oommen Vijayan Aravind",Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,,165
303093,The Fast Literature Assessment and Review (FLARE) Initiative. A Collaborative Effort for Timely Literature Appraisal during the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic,2020,"Although primarily a respiratory illness, several studies have shown that COVID-19 causes elevation of liver enzymes and various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms contributed toward COVID-19 severity, and identify the GI symptoms characteristic of severe COVID-19. We conducted a literature search of PubMed from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, and identified all reports with GI symptoms reported. A meta-analysis comparing the severity of COVID-19 with the presence of liver enzyme elevation and GI symptoms was performed using RevMan version 5.4. Pooled data from 15,305 unique reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive COVID-19 patients from 44 studies were analyzed. We found that the severe COVID-19 patients significantly had abdominal pain compared to the non-severe COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.17-6.27, Z = 2.32, p = 0.02, I2 = 0%) by analyzed 609 patients of 4 studies who reported both abdominal pain and COVID-19 severity. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting between the two groups. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that abdominal pain could be characteristic of severe COVID-19 infections. Compared with other viral infections that primarily infect the respiratory system, patients with COVID-19 have a slightly lower frequency of diarrheal symptoms with abdominal pain. However, to confirm this, further studies with COVID-19 patients across various countries and ethnicities are required.","Hayashi, Yuki; Wagatsuma, Kohei; Nojima, Masanori; Yamakawa, Tsukasa; Ichimiya, Tadashi; Yokoyama, Yoshihiro; Kazama, Tomoe; Hirayama, Daisuke; Nakase, Hiroshi",J Gastroenterol,,165

309100,Alteration of spatial pollution compounds to eutrophication phenomenon of small-scale area under corona virus disease circumstances,2021,"PURPOSE: Leishmania subgenus Leishmania causes leishmaniosis, which is a chronic systemic disease in humans and animals, in which the skin and visceral organs can be affected. The disease generally consists of three different clinical types in humans: visceral (kala-azar, VL), cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniosis (MCL). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), leishmaniosis is still one of the world's most neglected diseases. It has been nearly 13-14 years since the completion of the first complete genome sequence of a Leishmania parasite. However, much information about these parasites remains to be elucidated, such as the causes of differences in tissue tropism. The aim of this study is to perform the whole-genome sequencing of Leishmania infantum causing cutaneous leishmaniosis from a Turkish isolate with next-generation sequencing technology. METHODS: Genomic sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The TruSeq Nano DNA Low Throughput Library Prep Kit, compatible with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, was used to generate the library. Synthesis sequencing (SBS) was performed with a HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 to generate single-fragment reads (2 × 150 bp; PE) with two fragment end-to-end assemblies. Bioinformatics analyses were performed on the Geneious 11.0.5. ( www.genius.com ) platform. RESULTS: In our study, a high-quality whole-genome sequence (WGS) of L. infantum was successfully generated, and a total of 32,009,137 base pairs of genomic DNA from 36 chromosomes were obtained. The resulting genomic DNA sequence was submitted to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) database and registered under the name Leishmania infantum_TR01 (Lin_TR01). The following accession numbers were assigned by NCBI to the 36 chromosomes of the Lin_TR01 genome: CP027807, CP027810, CP027808, CP027811, CP027809, CP027812, CP027813, CP027814, CP027817, CP027818, CP027819, CP027815, CP027821, CP027816, CP027823, CP027820, CP027822, CP027824, CP027825, CP027826, CP027827, CP027828, CP027829, CP027830, CP027831, CP027832, CP027833, CP027834, CP027835, CP027836, CP027837, CP027838, CP027839, CP027840, CP027841, CP027842. As a result of the annotation of the Lin_TR01 genome, 3153 polymorphisms, 8324 genes, 8199 CDSs, 8109 mRNAs, 67 tRNAs, 11 rRNAs and 58 ncRNA were identified. Among the 8199 CDS obtained, 5278 encode hypothetical proteins. CONCLUSION: In this study, a high-quality WGS of Leishmania infantum was successfully obtained for the first time in Turkey. According to a review of WGS studies on this subject, the Lin_TR01 strain is the first strain to be isolated from cutaneous leishmaniosis. The reference genome of L. infantum JPCM5 (Peacock et al., 2007) was obtained from a visceral leishmaniosis case, in accordance with the classical tissue and organ tropism of the species. Lin_TR01 is the second whole-genome-sequenced strain in the world after the JPCM5 strain. The Lin_TR01 genome is the only L. infantum whole-genome sequence that is completed assembly level from 36 chromosomes among the genomes obtained thus far ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/249 ).","Guldemir, Dilek; Usluca, Selma; Nalbantoglu, Ayse Serpil",Acta parasitol,,165

A structure-based de novo drug design tool LIGANN was used to produce complementary ligand shapes to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (6M0J). The obtained ligand structures - potential drug candidates – were optimized and virtually screened. Hit ligands were considered all that showed initial binding energy scores ≤ -9.0 kcal.mol-1 for the protein. These compounds were tested for drug-likeness (Lipinski’s rule and BOILED Permeation Predictive Model). All satisfying the criteria were re-optimized (geometry & frequencies) at the HF-3c33 level of theory and virtually screened against 6M0J. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to assess the structural stability of selected 6M0J/novel compound complexes.

318732,Management of COVID-19 in a durable left ventricular assist device recipient: A continuity of care perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spinal Cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCII) is one of the most destructive complications in thoracic-abdominal aortic surgery, which can cause physical abnormalities, paralysis and even brain death. Evidence has shown that perillaldehyde (PAH) can ameliorate rat's cerebra ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the effect of PAH on SCII remains unknown. METHODS: The current study established SCII rat models and oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced BV2 microglia models to explore whether PAH could alleviate SCII symptoms and to investigate underlying mechanism. RESULTS: SCII rats underwent severe neurologic motor dysfunction and histopathologic injury compared with the normal rats, which are exhibited by loss of motor neurons and decrease of nissl bodies. Treatment with PAH significantly ameliorated motor dysfunction and neuron damage. PAH downregulated the expression of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, cleaved/pro caspase-1, interleukin-1ß and interleukin-18 in spinal cord tissues of SCII rats. Besides, the contents of oxidative stress-related factors superoxide dismutase, manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were significantly increased and malondialdehyde content was decreased after PAH treatment. PAH treatment upregulated the expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 in spinal cord tissues of SCII rats. Our in vitro study confirmed that PAH inhibited microglial activation by activating the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway, exhibited by alleviated inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates that PAH has the potential value for treating SCII, which provides an experimental basis for clinical trials in the future.","Zheng, Wenjun; Liu, Bing; Shi, Enyi",J Surg Res,,165
320440,Construction of the joint prevention and control management system in the general ward under corona virus disease 2019,2021,"Much of the attention from COVID-19 has been on the impacts on tourism and other service sectors; but there has been a growing interest in some agricultural and food topics, such as the decline in food away from home (FAFH) expenditures. Our work considers the importance of FAFH in the overall economy, and we also consider changes in agricultural production and trade that have occurred because of COVID-19. We gather data on actual changes to these components, as well as similar shocks to non-agricultural sectors, and employ a simulation model to estimate the impacts on gross domestic product (GDP). Results indicate that changes from agriculture due to COVID-19 have had a larger effect on the overall U.S. economy than the share of agriculture in the economy at the beginning of COVID-19. But the non-agricultural shocks still outweigh the impacts from agriculture by a magnitude of 3. Breaking the results down along the components, we find that the loss in FAFH expenditures is the largest contributor to the change in GDP resulting from shocks to agricultural markets and conclude that agricultural production/trade markets have been very resilient during the pandemic. Our results also indicate that our model (computable general equilibrium) does reasonably well in estimating GDP compared to actual changes due to the inclusion of data on actual demand, supply, and fiscal responses to COVID-19.","Beckman, Jayson; Countryman, Amanda M",American journal of agricultural economics,,165

Timely, credible, reliable and actionable data are key to ensuring that political decisions are data driven and facilitate understanding, monitoring and forecasting. To ensure that critical decisions related to the wider health and socioeconomic effects of this pandemic are data driven, each country needs to develop or enhance a national data governance plan that includes a clear coordination mechanism, well-defined and documented data processes (manual or electronic), the exchange of data, and a data culture to empower users. In addition, countries should now more than ever invest and enhance their data and health information systems to ensure that all decisions are data driven and that they are prepared for what is next.","Azzopardi-Muscat, Natasha; Kluge, Hans Henri P; Asma, Samira; Novillo-Ortiz, David",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,165

But it's likely that, once disruption and uncertainty fade, the rebound in activity will be strong. It's important for firms to position themselves for such a recovery. ▪ Historical evidence supports this view. In the past 200 years, short recessions have typically been followed by robust recovery. Long-term impacts from natural disasters have generally only been evident for specific hazards. Except for AIDS, longer-term pandemic effects also appear to have been contained. ▪ Surveys during the 2003 SARS and 2009 influenza outbreaks highlight one explanation for time-limited impacts. Public fears increased alongside rising infection rates, but they dissipated promptly as outbreaks came under control. ▪ Our modelling is consistent with these stylised facts. In our coronavirus pandemic scenario, global growth grinds to a halt in Q2 2020 but then rebounds to a rapid pace within a year. With much of the initial output loss recovered in a relatively short period of time, long-term impacts are limited. ▪ But there are risks to this view. The period of disruption could be longer than anticipated, depending on the potential spread and seasonality of COVID-19 and policy actions to mitigate the fallout. Opinion polls also highlight the potential risk of larger, more persistent effects for some countries. ▪ Moreover, coronavirus-related weakness and associated financial distress could expose other key vulnerabilities - for example related to deteriorating corporate sector balance sheets and fragile trade relations. These would be expected to have persistent effects on global activity over the coming years.",,Econ. Outlook,,165

The learning health system (LHS) was created with rapid uptake of the newest evidence in mind, making it essential in the face of a pandemic. The goal of this review is to gain knowledge on the initial impact of the LHS on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and the Duke University library search tool were used to identify current literature regarding the intersection of the LHS and the COIVD-19 pandemic. Articles were reviewed for their purpose, findings and relation to each component of the LHS. RESULTS: Twelve articles were included in the review. All stages of the LHS were addressed from this sample. Most articles addressed some component of interoperability. Articles that interpreted data unique to COVID-19 and demonstrated specific tools and interventions were least common. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps in interoperability are well known and unlikely to be solved in the coming months. Collaboration between health systems, researchers, governments and professional societies is needed to support a robust LHS which grants the ability to rapidly adapt to global emergencies.","Douthit, Brian J",Int. j. health plann. manage,,165

To this end, we describe structural binding-site insights for facilitating COVID-19 drug design when targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), a common conserved component of RNA viruses. We combined an RDRP structure data set, including 384 RDRP PDB structures and all corresponding RDRP-ligand interaction fingerprints, thereby revealing the structural characteristics of the active sites for application to RDRP-targeted drug discovery. Specifically, we revealed the intrinsic ligand-binding modes and associated RDRP structural characteristics. Four types of binding modes with corresponding binding pockets were determined, suggesting two major subpockets available for drug discovery. We screened a drug data set of 7894 compounds against these binding pockets and presented the top-10 small molecules as a starting point in further exploring the prevention of virus replication. In summary, the binding characteristics determined here help rationalize RDRP-targeted drug discovery and provide insights into the specific binding mechanisms important for containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Zhao, Zheng; Bourne, Philip E",J Proteome Res,,165
323343,Covid-19 and acute kidney injury,2021,"BACKGROUND: Though a large number of pregnant females have been affected by COVID-19, there is a dearth of information on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on trophoblast function. We explored in silico, the potential interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and proteins involved in the key functions of placenta. METHODS: Human proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified by Gordon et al. (2020). Genes that are upregulated in trophoblast sub-types and stages were obtained by gene-expression data from NCBI-GEO and by text-mining. Genes altered in pathological states like pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus were also identified. Genes crucial in placental functions thus identified were compared to the SARS-CoV-2 interactome for overlaps. Proteins recurring across multiple study scenarios were analyzed using text mining and network analysis for their biological functions. RESULTS: The entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 - ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in placenta. Other proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 like LOX, Fibulins-2 and 5, NUP98, GDF15, RBX1, CUL3, HMOX1, PLAT, MFGE8, and MRPs are vital in placental functions like trophoblast invasion and migration, syncytium formation, differentiation, and implantation. TLE3, expressed across first trimester placental tissues and cell lines, is involved in formation of placental vasculature, and is important in SARS-CoV (2003) budding and exit from the cells by COPI vesicles. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 can potentially interact with proteins having crucial roles in the placental function. Whether these potential interactions identified in silico have effects on trophoblast functions in biological settings needs to be addressed by further in vitro and clinical studies.","Seethy, Ashikh A; Singh, Sunil; Mukherjee, Indrani; Pethusamy, Karthikeyan; Purkayastha, Kakali; Sharma, Jai Bhagwan; Sharma, Radhey S; Dhar, Ruby; Karmakar, Subhradip",Placenta,,165
323926,Epidemiology and control strategies of novel coronavirus disease in the context of India,2021,"Clinical decision-making in kidney transplant (KT) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is understandably a conundrum: both candidates and recipients may face increased acquisition risks and case fatality rates (CFRs). Given our poor understanding of these risks, many centers have paused or reduced KT activity, yet data to inform such decisions are lacking. To quantify the benefit/harm of KT in this context, we conducted a simulation study of immediate-KT vs delay-until-after-pandemic for different patient phenotypes under a variety of potential COVID-19 scenarios. A calculator was implemented (http://www.transplantmodels.com/covid_sim), and machine learning approaches were used to evaluate the important aspects of our modeling. Characteristics of the pandemic (acquisition risk, CFR) and length of delay (length of pandemic, waitlist priority when modeling deceased donor KT) had greatest influence on benefit/harm. In most scenarios of COVID-19 dynamics and patient characteristics, immediate KT provided survival benefit; KT only began showing evidence of harm in scenarios where CFRs were substantially higher for KT recipients (eg, &#8805;50% fatality) than for waitlist registrants. Our simulations suggest that KT could be beneficial in many centers if local resources allow, and our calculator can help identify patients who would benefit most. Furthermore, as the pandemic evolves, our calculator can update these predictions.","Massie, Allan B; Boyarsky, Brian J; Werbel, William A; Bae, Sunjae; Chow, Eric K H; Avery, Robin K; Durand, Christine M; Desai, Niraj; Brennan, Daniel; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M; Segev, Dorry L",Am. j. transplant,,165

Pre-symptomatic spread and high false negative rates for testing may make it difficult to stop viral spread. Here, we develop a stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 in a university sized population, considering the dynamics of both viral load and false negative rate of tests on the ability of testing to combat viral spread. Reported dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an apparent false negative rate from ~ 17 to ~ 48%. Nonuniform distributions of viral load and false negative rate lead to higher requirements for frequency and fraction of population tested in order to bring the apparent Reproduction number (Rt) below 1. Thus, it is important to consider non-uniform dynamics of viral spread and false negative rate in order to model effective testing plans.","Jarvis, Katherine F; Kelley, Joshua B",Sci Rep,,165
324260,Navigating Early Careers in Heart Failure in the Era of Novel Coronavirus Disease-2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: We studied the safety and reactogenicity SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in transplant recipients because immunosuppressed patients were excluded from vaccine trials. METHODS: US transplant recipients were recruited into this prospective cohort study through social media; those who completed the full vaccine series between 12/9/2020-3/1/2021 were included. We collected demographics, medical history, and safety information within 7 days after doses 1 and 2 (D1, D2). Associations between characteristics and reactions were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: We studied 741 transplant recipients who underwent BNT162b2 (54%) or mRNA-1273 (46%) vaccination. Median (IQR) age was 60 (44-69) years, 57% were female, and 10% were nonwhite. While local site reactions decreased after D2 (85% D1 vs. 78% D2, p<0.001), systemic reactions increased (49% D1 vs. 69% D2, p<0.001). Younger participants were more likely to develop systemic symptoms after D1 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] per 10 years= 0.850.900.94, p<0.001) and D2 (aIRR per 10 years= 0.910.930.96, p<0.001). Participants who experienced pain (aIRR= 1.111.662.47, p=0.01) or redness (aIRR= 1.833.928.41, p<0.01) were more likely to develop an antibody response to D1 of mRNA vaccines. No anaphylaxis, neurologic diagnoses, or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. Infections were minimal (3% after D1, <0.01% after D2). One patient reported incident acute rejection post D2. CONCLUSIONS: In SOTRs undergoing mRNA vaccination, reactogenicity was similar to that reported in the original trials. Severe reactions were rare. These early safety data may help address vaccine hesitancy in transplant recipients.","Ou, Michael T; Boyarsky, Brian J; Motter, Jennifer D; Greenberg, Ross S; Teles, Aura T; Ruddy, Jake A; Krach, Michelle R; Jain, Vedant S; Werbel, William A; Avery, Robin K; Massie, Allan B; Segev, Dorry L; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M",Transplantation,,165
324606,COVID 19 and acute kidney injury,2020,"The development of biometric applications, such as facial recognition (FR), has recently become important in smart cities. Many scientists and engineers around the world have focused on establishing increasingly robust and accurate algorithms and methods for these types of systems and their applications in everyday life. FR is developing technology with multiple real-time applications. The goal of this paper is to develop a complete FR system using transfer learning in fog computing and cloud computing. The developed system uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) because of the dominant representation; there are some conditions including occlusions, expressions, illuminations, and pose, which can affect the deep FR performance. DCNN is used to extract relevant facial features. These features allow us to compare faces between them in an efficient way. The system can be trained to recognize a set of people and to learn via an online method, by integrating the new people it processes and improving its predictions on the ones it already has. The proposed recognition method was tested with different three standard machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). The proposed system has been evaluated using three datasets of face images (SDUMLA-HMT, 113, and CASIA) via performance metrics of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and time. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superiority over other algorithms according to all parameters. The suggested algorithm results in higher accuracy (99.06%), higher precision (99.12%), higher recall (99.07%), and higher specificity (99.10%) than the comparison algorithms.","Salama AbdELminaam, Diaa; Almansori, Abdulrhman M; Taha, Mohamed; Badr, Elsayed",PLoS One,,165

Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.","Tundo, G R; Sbardella, D; Santoro, A M; Coletta, A; Oddone, F; Grasso, G; Milardi, D; Lacal, P M; Marini, S; Purrello, R; Graziani, G; Coletta, M",Pharmacol Ther,,165

In addition to the value of improving yields, quality is also important for breeders and consumers, but it pays less attention in arid regions. During two successive summer growing seasons, the experimental material focused on 34 genotypes developed from different crosses on Fn generation after fixation as well as six of the most recent commercial cultivars used for comparisons. The results showed that a high yield of grain followed by high milling and grain quality characteristics were observed among the 34 genotypes used in this analysis. Highly important and positive correlations between the percentage of hulling and the percentage of milling (0.424) and the yield ability could be accomplished by choosing the number of panicles per plant and the weight of the panicles. Selection criteria for good quality should be met by the percentage of head rice and many mineral elements, particularly zinc and iron. As a consequence, the genotypes M.J 5460S/SK105-1, M.J 5460S/GZ7768-1, M.J 5460S/G177-1, M.J 5460S/SK105-3 and M.J 5460S/SK106-4 had desirable high yield and quality characteristics and could be used as promising accessions to the rice breeding program in arid regions.

METHODS: National online longitudinal survey. As part of a June 2020 survey, participants (n = 1370) were asked 'In your life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic' (yes/no) and also completed the World Health Organisation-Five well-being index. Differences were explored by demographic variables. Free-text responses were thematically coded. RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty participants (70%) reported experiencing at least one positive effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living with others (P = .045) and employment situation (P < .001) at baseline (April) were associated with experiencing positive effects. Individuals working for pay from home were more likely to experience positive effects compared to those who were not working for pay (aOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.63, P < .001) or who were working for pay outside the home (aOR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.58, P < .001). 54.2% of participants reported a sufficient level of well-being, 23.2% low well-being and a further 22.6% very low well-being.

A Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, consisting of semi-structured interviews and focus group and steering group discussions, was utilized to design the mental health and well-being interventions. Study efficacy was evaluated via a pre- and post-intervention survey and post-intervention semi-structured interviews. Interventions developed were psycho-educational, improved top-down and bottom-up communication, and provided access to a Vocational Rehabilitation Assistant for those struggling and at risk of sickness absence. Six months following dissemination, surveys demonstrated significant improvements in communication, and mean score improvements in four other working conditions. This project, therefore, demonstrates that co-developed initiatives can be positively impactful, despite post-intervention data collection being impacted by COVID-19. Future studies should build upon these findings and broaden the PAR approach nationally while taking a robust approach to evaluation.","Ravalier, Jermaine M; Wainwright, Elaine; Smyth, Nina; Clabburn, Oliver; Wegrzynek, Paulina; Loon, Mark",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,165
332466,Hump day for blocking coronavirus,2020,"The purpose of the study was to obtain an external coating based on nanoparticles of ZnO, carvacrol, and geraniol that could be active against viruses such as SARS-Co-V2. Additionally, the synergistic effect of the chosen substances in coatings was analyzed. The goal of the study was to measure the possible antibacterial activity of the coatings obtained. Testing antiviral activity with human pathogen viruses, such as SARS-Co-V2, requires immense safety measures. Bacteriophages such as phi 6 phage represent good surrogates for the study of airborne viruses. The results of the study indicated that the ZC1 and ZG1 coatings containing an increased amount of geraniol or carvacrol and a very small amount of nanoZnO were found to be active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is also important that a synergistic effect between these active substances was noted. This explains why polyethylene (PE) films covered with the ZC1 or ZG1 coatings (as internal coatings) were found to be the best packaging materials to extend the quality and freshness of food products. The same coatings may be used as the external coatings with antiviral properties. The ZC1 and ZG1 coatings showed moderate activity against the phi 6 phage that has been selected as a surrogate for viruses such as coronaviruses. It can be assumed that coatings ZG1 and ZC1 will also be active against SARS-CoV-2 that is transmitted via respiratory droplets.","Mizielinska, Malgorzata; Nawrotek, Pawel; Stachurska, Xymena; Ordon, Magdalena; Bartkowiak, Artur",Int. j. mol. sci.

METHODS: Increase in domestic conflict (verbal or physical fights) since the beginning of the pandemic was assessed in 1196 partnered and cohabitating respondents, drawn from a nationally representative sample, in May 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics and financial worry with domestic conflict. RESULTS: An increase in domestic conflict was reported by 10.6% (95% CI 7.7-13.4) of the sample. Domestic conflict increase was significantly associated with younger age, lower education, and financial worry. CONCLUSION: Increases in domestic conflict were seen in certain vulnerable groups and in those who report financial worry. Policies ensuring financial stability, particularly early in the disaster conditions, could reduce domestic conflict during continued COVID-19 conditions or other disasters.","Locker, Alicia R; Finucane, Melissa L; Roth, Elizabeth; Carman, Katherine G; Breslau, Joshua",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,165
337009,Penyakit Stroke Dan Infeksi Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Sebuah Tinjauan Literatur,2020,"Black aspergilli are distributed worldwide and represent one of the most prolific sources of metabolites with biomedical and agrochemical interests. However, due to their similar morphological characteristics and insufficient molecular identification, the taxonomic classification of black aspergilli remains ill-defined. The production of specialised metabolites is often unique for species among black aspergilli and could be used as diagnostic chemical markers for species identification. In this study, chemical investigation of Aspergillus tubingensis OUCMBIII 143291 led to the discovery of the diagnostic chemical marker asperazine, a complex diketopiperazine heterodimer, as well as two previously undescribed analogues, asperazine B and C. In addition, an undescribed 2-benzylpyridin-4(1H)-one-containing amide, pestalamide D, along with four known related metabolites were isolated. Their chemical structures, including their absolute configurations, were established on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis and chiral HPLC analysis of the acidic hydrolysates. Asperazines B and C can serve as potential chemical markers for distinguishing A. tubingensis from A. niger, two representative species of black aspergilli that are usually incorrectly identified. Moreover, the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity against eight phytopathogenic fungi including Alternaria alternata, A. brassicae, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum lagenarium, Fusarium oxysporum, Gaeumannomyces graminis, Penicillium digitatum, and Valsa mali. Pestalamide D exhibited significant activities against B. cinerea, C. lagenarium, and V. mali, with MIC values of 4, 8, and 8 µg/mL, respectively, compared with the positive controls carbendazim (MICs = 8, 4, and 4 µg/mL) and prochloraz (MICs = 8, 8, and 4 µg/mL). The results of this study reveal two additional chemical markers and provide a powerful tool for the rapid identification of black aspergilli.","Xu, Ce; Xu, Kuo; Yuan, Xiao-Long; Ren, Guang-Wei; Wang, Xiao-Qiang; Li, Wei; Deng, Ning; Wang, Xiu-Fang; Zhang, Peng",Phytochemistry,,165

In the presence of rats rendered incompetent to help through pharmacological treatment, rats were less likely to help due to a reduction in reinforcement rather than to a lack of initial interest. Only incompetent helpers of a strain familiar to the helper rat exerted a detrimental effect on helping; rats helped at near control levels in the presence of incompetent helpers from an unfamiliar strain. Duos and trios of potential helper rats helped at superadditive rates, demonstrating that rats act nonindependently with helping facilitated by the presence of competent-to-help bystanders. Furthermore, helping was facilitated in rats that had previously observed other rats' helping and were then tested individually. In sum, the influence of bystanders on helping behavior in rats features characteristics that closely resemble those observed in humans.","Havlik, John L; Vieira Sugano, Yuri Y; Jacobi, Maura Clement; Kukreja, Rahul R; Jacobi, John H Clement; Mason, Peggy",Sci.

338242,Tocilizumab in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia: real-world data from a case series,2021,"BACKGROUND: Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, imposed citywide lockdown measures on January 23, 2020. Neighboring cities in Hubei Province followed suit with the government enforcing social distancing measures to restrict the spread of the disease throughout the province. Few studies have examined the emotional attitudes of citizens as expressed on social media toward the imposed social distancing measures and the factors that affected their emotions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to detect the emotional attitudes of different groups of users on Sina Weibo toward the social distancing measures imposed by the People's Government of Hubei Province. Second, the influencing factors of their emotions, as well as the impact of the imposed measures on users' emotions, was studied. METHODS: Sina Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, was chosen as the primary data source. The time span of selected data was from January 21, 2020, to March 24, 2020, while analysis was completed in late June 2020. Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) was used to analyze users' emotions, while logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the influence of explanatory variables on users' emotions, such as age and spatial location. Further, the moderating effects of social distancing measures on the relationship between user characteristics and users' emotions were assessed by observing the interaction effects between the measures and explanatory variables. RESULTS: Based on the 63,169 comments obtained, we identified six topics of discussion-(1) delaying the resumption of work and school, (2) travel restrictions, (3) traffic restrictions, (4) extending the Lunar New Year holiday, (5) closing public spaces, and (6) community containment. There was no multicollinearity in the data during statistical analysis; the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was 0.24 (&#967;28=10.34, P>.24). The main emotions shown by citizens were negative, including anger and fear. Users located in Hubei Province showed the highest amount of negative emotions in Mainland China. There are statistically significant differences in the distribution of emotional polarity between social distancing measures (&#967;220=19,084.73, P<.001), as well as emotional polarity between genders (&#967;24=1784.59, P<.001) and emotional polarity between spatial locations (&#967;24=1659.67, P<.001). Compared with other types of social distancing measures, the measures of delaying the resumption of work and school or travel restrictions mainly had a positive moderating effect on public emotion, while traffic restrictions or community containment had a negative moderating effect on public emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide a reference point for the adoption of epidemic prevention and control measures, and are considered helpful for government agencies to take timely actions to alleviate negative emotions during public health emergencies.","Shen, Lining; Yao, Rui; Zhang, Wenli; Evans, Richard; Cao, Guang; Zhang, Zhiguo",JMIR Med Inform,,165

OBJECTIVE: Here we describe the rapid rollout of capabilities by UW Medicine Information Technology Services (ITS) to support our clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide recommendations for health systems to urgently consider, as they plan their own response to this and potentially other future pandemics. METHODS: Our recommendations include establishing a hospital incident command structure that includes tight integration with IT, creating automated dashboards for incident command, optimizing emergency communication to staff and patients, and preparing human resources, security, other policies, and equipment to support the transition of all nonessential staff to telework.We describe how UW Medicine quickly expanded telemedicine capabilities to include most primary care providers and increasing numbers of specialty providers. We look at how we managed expedited change control processes to quickly update electronic health records (EHR) with new COVID-19 laboratory and clinical workflows. We also examine the integration of new technology such as tele-intensive care (ICU) equipment and improved integration with teleconferencing software into our EHR. To support the rapid preparation for COVID-19 at other health systems, we include samples of the UW Medicine's COVID-19 order set, COVID-19 documentation template, dashboard metric categories, and a list of the top 10 things your health care IT organization can do now to prepare. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 response requires new and expedited ways of approaching ITS support to clinical needs.

The infection causes COVID-19, a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. No treatment exists. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major component of green tea, has several beneficial properties, including antiviral activities. Therefore, we examined whether EGCG has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. EGCG blocked not only the entry of SARS-CoV-2, but also MERS- and SARS-CoV pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and inhibited virus infections in vitro. Mechanistically, inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-receptor interaction was observed. Thus, EGCG might be suitable for use as a lead structure to develop more effective anti-COVID-19 drugs.","Henss, Lisa; Auste, Arne; Schürmann, Christoph; Schmidt, Christin; von Rhein, Christine; Mühlebach, Michael D; Schnierle, Barbara S",J. gen. virol,,165

349176,Advance in the studies of the bidirectional effects of corona virus disease 2019 and cardiovascular disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: The state of Queensland, Australia, is large (1.85 million km2). The provision of bariatric care across the state is difficult as most major hospitals are concentrated in the capital city of Brisbane. We implemented a state-wide telehealth service to improve access for rural patients in a public bariatric service. We report our early experiences with this service. METHODS: We reviewed all patients seen in the Bariatric Telehealth Clinic from 2017 to 2019. Patients underwent consultation through video-link software at their local hospital with the multidisciplinary team in Brisbane (surgeon, dietician and clinical nurse). Distances from Brisbane and number of visits were calculated. Telehealth patients were contacted by phone to complete a survey regarding their experiences. This was a 17-question Likert-style survey with scores from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). RESULTS: A total of 85 new patients underwent their initial consultation via telehealth. Each patient had a variable number of in-person as well as telehealth consultations both before and after surgery. Mean distance from telehealth consultation site to Brisbane was 614 km (range 149-2472 km). In total, 41 (48%) completed the survey. With regard to telehealth saving time and money, improving access to bariatric care, and desire to use telehealth again, the mean score was 4 out of 5 or higher for all questions (i.e., agree or strongly agree). There was no identifiable post-operative complication that was caused or exacerbated by telehealth. CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgical telehealth appointments are feasible and preferred by most patients residing in rural and remote locations. Each consultation avoids significant travel time and cost for the patient and health service, with no obvious adverse outcomes. Telehealth improves equity and access to specialist services for rural and remote patients.","Maurice, Andrew Phillip; Punnasseril, Jaisil Eldo Joseph; King, Sarah Emily; Dodd, Benjamin Rees",Obes. surg,,165

The aim of this study is to find the changes of protein that can be helpful in understanding blast-induced lung injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A quantitative analysis of their global proteome was conducted in lung from mice with blast injury using LC-MS/MS. Protein annotation, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, functional classification, functional enrichment and cluster, and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed. Furthermore, western blotting was used to validate the changed protein levels. RESULTS: A total of 6498 proteins were identified, of which 5520 proteins were quantified. The fold-change cutoff was set at 1.2; 132 proteins were upregulated, and 104 proteins were downregulated. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in the cholesterol metabolism, asthma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Remarkably, the processes related to the change of oxidative phosphorylation including the NADH dehydrogenase, Cytochrome C reductase, Cytochrome C oxidase and F-type ATPase were significantly upregulated, which were further verified by western blotting. CONCLUSION: These results confirmed that the oxidative phosphorylation is critical to blast-induced lung injury. LC/MS-based profiling presented candidate target/pathways that could be explored for future therapeutic development.","Liu, Ying; Liu, Yunen; Tong, Changci; Cong, Peifang; Shi, Xiuyun; Shi, Lin; Hou, Mingxiao; Jin, Hongxu; Bao, Yongli",Exp Lung Res,,165

354232,Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 and αKlotho in Acute Kidney Injury: Current Status in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to gain in-depth knowledge and an increased understanding on how isolation from close relatives and carers, during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted older patients during hospitalisation in a Geriatric department. METHOD: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach, to get an understanding of the older participants' perspectives and lived experiences. Complete interviews were available for 11 patients-six men and five women, between 69 and 91 years of age. RESULTS: The participants' narratives identified several themes. Feeling isolated from and having no contact with close relatives or carers was prominent. The COVID-19 pandemic created fear and anxiety among hospitalized patients. Relationships with family members and some staff became strained. The transformation from being ""a person"" to being ""a patient"" and loss of dignity, autonomy and a ""sense of self"" were themes identified in the analysis. Although virtual contact can't replace the real world, the use of technology to maintain contact with family and carers, and the need for help from hospital staff in facilitating this contact was deemed important. The environment of care was a prominent theme. The attitude of staff made a difference to how patients felt and some patients expressed a loss of decision-making capability. The interviews were challenging in some cases because the interviews had to be interrupted or shortened due to ethical considerations around the individual person's needs and condition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Our study provided in-depth knowledge on how older patients experienced hospitalisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Danish hospital. The results emphasise that compassionate care includes a willingness to listen to older patients' narratives and to imagine life as depicted by them. This can lead to better understanding of an individual person's needs and increase the quality of care provided.","Nielsen, Dorthe Susanne; Hansen, Rikke Frøslev; Beck, Sanne Have; Wensien, Jette; Masud, Tahir; Ryg, Jesper",Int J Older People Nurs,,165
355439,Dandelion and focal crazy paving signs: the lung CT based predictors for evaluation of the severity of coronavirus disease,2020,"Background: COVID-19 mortality disproportionally affects nursing homes, creating enormous pressures to deliver high-quality end-of-life care. Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID- 19 response plans. Aims: To identify, review and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Methods: We performed a directed documentary and content analysis of newly developed or adapted COVID-19 guidance documents from across the world. Documents were collected via expert consultation and independently screened against prespecified eligibility criteria. We applied thematic analysis and narrative synthesis techniques. Results: We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care;from the World Health Organisation (n = 3), and 8 individual countries: United States (n = 6), Canada (n = 1), the Netherlands (n = 2), Ireland (n = 1), United Kingdom (n = 3), Switzerland (n = 3), New Zealand (n = 1), Belgium (n = 1). International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative-care-related topics. Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision- making towards the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers). Conclusion: There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes. Most have a limited focus both regarding breadth of topics and recommendations made. Key aspects of palliative care, that is, symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.","Gilissen, J.; Pivodic, L.; Unroe, K.

357965,Potential Hazards of Concern in the Walk-Through Screening System for the Corona Virus Disease 2019 from the Perspective of Infection Preventionists,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused the COVID-19 global pandemic. In response, the Australian and New Zealand governments activated their respective emergency plans and hospital frameworks to deal with the potential increased demand on scarce resources. Surgical triage formed an important part of this response to protect the healthcare system's capacity to respond to COVID-19. METHOD: A rapid review methodology was adapted to search for all levels of evidence on triaging surgery during the current COVID-19 outbreak. Searches were limited to PubMed (inception to 10 April 2020) and supplemented with grey literature searches using the Google search engine. Further, relevant articles were also sourced through the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons COVID-19 Working Group. Recent government advice (May 2020) is also included. RESULTS: This rapid review is a summary of advice from Australian, New Zealand and international speciality groups regarding triaging of surgical cases, as well as the peer-reviewed literature. The key theme across all jurisdictions was to not compromise clinical judgement and to enable individualized, ethical and patient-centred care. The topics reported on include implications of COVID-19 on surgical triage, competing demands on healthcare resources (surgery versus COVID-19 cases), and the low incidence of COVID-19 resulting in a possibility to increase surgical caseloads over time. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent and emergency surgery must continue. A carefully staged return of elective surgery should align with a decrease in COVID-19 caseload. Combining evidence and expert opinion, schemas and recommendations have been proposed to guide this process in Australia and New Zealand.","Babidge, Wendy J; Tivey, David R; Kovoor, Joshua G; Weidenbach, Kristin; Collinson, Trevor G; Hewett, Peter J; Hugh, Thomas J; Padbury, Robert T A; Hill, Nicola M; Maddern, Guy J",ANZ J Surg,,165

362241,Coronavirus Disease-19 and Otology/Neurotology,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America where obesity is highly prevalent. The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been fully documented. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including BMI, and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 in a single French center. RESULTS: Obesity (BMI > 30) and severe obesity (BMI > 35) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (P < 0.01, &#967;2 test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI > 35 (85.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (P < 0.05) and BMI (P < 0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI > 35 versus patients with BMI < 25 was 7.36 (1.63-33.14; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2. Disease severity increased with BMI. Obesity is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 severity, requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.","Simonnet, Arthur; Chetboun, Mikael; Poissy, Julien; Raverdy, Violeta; Noulette, Jerome; Duhamel, Alain; Labreuche, Julien; Mathieu, Daniel; Pattou, Francois; Jourdain, Merce",Obesity (Silver Spring),,165
362242,Coronavirus Disease-19 and Otology/Neurotology,2020,"The legal responsibility of the vaccinating doctor is one of the central issues in the current setting of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this statement is to outline the profiles of the medical legal liability, with a focus on the figure of the vaccinating physician, in criminal, civil, and disciplinary terms, based on the Italian legislation in force. The vaccinating doctor responds for his work in the field of vaccination in the same way as any other health service should perform (diagnostic, therapeutic, etc.). Helpful in this context is the adoption of the L. 76/2021;it was developed to find a balance between safeguarding the person privacy and greater guarantees for the doctor. This law introduces a criminal shield that can put a limit to litigation, curbing the phenomenon of so-called defensive medicine. The climate of uncertainty and fear of legal repercussions for the doctors, and the constant updating and redefinition of the indications of operability in the vaccination campaigns, underline the need to focus on the knowledge of the responsibilities and the safeguard of the vaccinating doctors. In addition to the regulatory cornerstones, the statement also addresses the issue of informed consent and the role of the occupational doctor as a central figure in the vaccination campaign in the workplace.","Beccia, F.; Amantea, C.; Rossi, M.

This protein has significant role in pathogenesis and it is considered a probably major virulence factor. As it is absent in humans, it becomes an interesting target of study, especially when it comes to the rational search for drugs, since it increases the specificity of the target and reduces possible adverse effects that may be caused to the patient. Using approaches in silico we seek to study the behavior of nsp1 in solution to obtain its most stable conformation and find possible drugs with affinity to all of them. For this purpose, complete model of nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted and its stability analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations in five different replicas. After main pocket validation using two control drugs and the main conformations of nsp1, molecular docking based on virtual screening were performed to identify novel potential inhibitors from DrugBank database. It has been found 16 molecules in common to all five nsp1 replica conformations. Three of them was ranked as the best compounds among them and showed better energy score than control molecules that have in vitro activity against nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2.

Since COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system and to a lesser degree the cardiovascular system, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of COVID-19-caused detraining on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of recently recovered volleyball athletes. Sixteen experienced volleyball athletes (age 24 ± 4.5 years) who were recently diagnosed and recovered from a COVID-19 infection volunteered to participate in this study and were tested for CRF and spirometry. Given that participants had only mild symptoms of infection, the primary focus of this study was on the effects of detraining on CRF. On average, the time to exhaustion was 9.4 ± 1.4 min. VE, VCO2, RER and oxygen pulse increased, heart rate exceeded 90% of predicted values, and peak VO2 values were typical for this level of athlete (44.1 ± 3.4 mL/kg). Pulmonary function reflected in FVC, FEV1/FVC and MVV values were well above 80% of predicted values for each of the participants while electrocardiography revealed no ischemia, arrythmias or conduction and repolarization abnormalities were found in the tested subjects. Therefore, it can be concluded that participants experienced typical consequences of detraining. Due to a lack of CRF data prior to COVID-19 infection, we were unable to estimate the magnitude detraining had on CRF. Complete CRF assessment after COVID-19 infection in athletes can be useful for screening of residual myocardial and/or respiratory system damage for safe return-to-play decisions.","Milovancev, Aleksandra; Avakumovic, Jovana; Lakicevic, Nemanja; Stajer, Valdemar; Korovljev, Darinka; Todorovic, Nikola; Bianco, Antonino; Maksimovic, Nebojsa; Ostojic, Sergej; Drid, Patrik",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,165

Therapeutic benefits of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been demonstrated in wide range of diseases. The present study is conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia. METHODS: An open-label, multicenter, comparative, randomized study was conducted on COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia. One hundred eligible patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio either to receive IVIG + standard of care (SOC) or SOC. RESULTS: Duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the IVIG group compared with that of SOC alone (7.7 vs 17.5 days). Duration for normalization of body temperature, oxygen saturation, and mechanical ventilation were significantly shorter in IVIG compared with SOC. Percentages of patients on mechanical ventilation in 2 groups were not significantly different (24% vs 38%). Median time to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction negativity was significantly shorter with IVIG than SOC (7 vs 18 days). There were only mild to moderate adverse events in both groups except for 1 patient (2%), who died in SOC.

Based on the real-time COVID-19 datasets by prefecture-level cities and date, this paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling in spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese mainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract spatial data and the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal parameters. The results show multifractal distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in China. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped curves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean dimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal dimension growth curves are shown as quasi S-shaped curves. From these spectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows. First, self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic, which seem be dominated by multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 across China can be characterized by global clustering with local disordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19 in China experienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the hierarchical diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage. This study suggests that multifractal theory can be utilized to characterize spatio-temporal diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic, and the case analyses may be instructive for further exploring natural laws of spatial diffusion.","Long, Yuqing; Chen, Yanguang; Li, Yajing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02747v1.pdf,165

367570,SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the school setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Currently, more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with over 2.4 million mortalities. The pandemic affects people of all ages but older individuals and those with severe chronic illnesses, including cancer patients, are at higher risk. PATIENT CONCERNS: The impact of cancer treatment on the progression of COVID-19 is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the effects of chemotherapy on COVID-19 outcomes for 2 cancer patients. On January 24, 2020, a level I response to a major public health emergency was initiated in Hubei Province, China, which includes Enshi Autonomous Prefecture that has a population of 4.026 million people. As of April 30, 2020, 252 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 11 asymptomatic carriers were identified in Enshi. DIAGNOSIS: Among the confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers, 2 patients were identified who were previously diagnosed with malignant tumors, including one with hepatocellular carcinoma and the other with cardia carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: These 2 patients were receiving or just completed chemotherapy at the time of their COVID-19 diagnosis. OUTCOMES: Both patients were followed and presented favorable outcomes. The positive outcomes for these 2 patients could be partially explained by their recent chemotherapy that impacted their immune status. Also, their relatively younger ages and lack of comorbidities were likely factors in their successful recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Anticancer treatment might enhance a patient's ability to respond favorably to COVID-19 infection. However, anticancer treatment is likely to impact immune function differently in different individuals, which can influence disease outcomes.","Ju, Zhaoqing; Yang, Jun; Lu, Gang; Li, Jian; Wu, Yun; Wu, Xiaofeng; Huang, Yanjie; Ai, Yi; Xiang, Dongfeng; Zeng, Bo; Yang, Zuwang; Gong, Nianqiao",Medicine (Baltimore),,165

We provide a roadmap for educators to start their transformation from an analog to a digital approach by harnessing existing tools including podcasts, social media, and videoconferencing. Teachers will need to enhance the same pedagogical and interpersonal practices that underpin effective in-person education while they learn new skills as they become curators, creators, and moderators in the digital space.

It is important to identify severe cases as early as possible, such that resources can be mobilized and treatment can be escalated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a machine learning approach for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 based on clinical and imaging data. METHODS: Clinical data-including demographics, signs, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood test results-and chest computed tomography scans of 346 patients from 2 hospitals in the Hubei Province, China, were used to develop machine learning models for automated severity assessment in diagnosed COVID-19 cases. We compared the predictive power of the clinical and imaging data from multiple machine learning models and further explored the use of four oversampling methods to address the imbalanced classification issue. Features with the highest predictive power were identified using the Shapley Additive Explanations framework. RESULTS: Imaging features had the strongest impact on the model output, while a combination of clinical and imaging features yielded the best performance overall. The identified predictive features were consistent with those reported previously. Although oversampling yielded mixed results, it achieved the best model performance in our study. Logistic regression models differentiating between mild and severe cases achieved the best performance for clinical features (area under the curve [AUC] 0.848; sensitivity 0.455; specificity 0.906), imaging features (AUC 0.926; sensitivity 0.818; specificity 0.901), and a combination of clinical and imaging features (AUC 0.950; sensitivity 0.764; specificity 0.919). The synthetic minority oversampling method further improved the performance of the model using combined features (AUC 0.960; sensitivity 0.845; specificity 0.929). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and imaging features can be used for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 and can potentially help triage patients with COVID-19 and prioritize care delivery to those at a higher risk of severe disease.","Quiroz, Juan Carlos; Feng, You-Zhen; Cheng, Zhong-Yuan; Rezazadegan, Dana; Chen, Ping-Kang; Lin, Qi-Ting; Qian, Long; Liu, Xiao-Fang; Berkovsky, Shlomo; Coiera, Enrico; Song, Lei; Qiu, Xiaoming; Liu, Sidong; Cai, Xiang-Ran",JMIR Med Inform,,165

It is, therefore, crucial that service providers and carriers participating in the OTT market analyze consumer traffic for pricing, service delivery, infrastructure investments, etc. The OTT market has many consumer groups, but the proportion of users is not consistent in each. Furthermore, as multimedia consumption has increased owing to the COVID-19 epidemic, the OTT market has changed rapidly. If this is not reflected, the analysis will not be accurate. Therefore, we propose a framework that can classify consumers well based on actual OTT market environment conditions. First, by applying our proposed conditional probability-based method to basic machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree, we can improve the classification performance, even for an imbalanced OTT consumer distribution. Then, it is possible to analyze the changing consumer trends by dynamically retraining the incoming OTT consumer data. Conventional methods result in low classification accuracy in low-number classes, but our method shows an improvement of 5.3–19.2% based on recall.

375387,Severe acute kidney injury associated with progression of chronic kidney disease after critical COVID-19,2021,"Objective: To evaluate the experiences and preferences of ophthalmology residency applicants and program directors (PDs), with emphasis on the effect of COVID-19 as well as recent changes on the application process.Design: Cross-sectional, online surveyParticipants: All applicants to the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute ophthalmology residency program, and all United States ophthalmology residency PDs, during the 2020-2021 application cycle.Methods: An online survey was distributed to applicants and program directors of the 2020-2021 ophthalmology residency application cycle.Main Outcome Measures: Applicant demographics, application submissions, interview experiences, financial considerations, match results, and suggestions for improvement of the application process.Results: Responses were obtained from 205 applicants (34.9% response rate) and 37 PDs (30.3%). A successful match into an ophthalmology residency was achieved by 144 (83.7%) applicants. Applicants applied to (mean ± SD) 79.7 ± 22.8 ophthalmology residency programs, received 13.1 ± 8.9 invitations to interview, and attended 11.1 ± 5.8 interviews. Most applicants (N = 126; 71.2%) and PDs (N = 22; 78.6%) expressed a preference for in-person interviews over virtual interviews. If given a choice regarding the future direction for interviews, most applicants were unsure (N = 68; 38.4%) or would prefer to hold interviews virtually (N = 62; 35.0%); PDs felt that interviews should go back to being in-person (39.3%) or were unsure (28.6%). Most PDs (N = 21; 72.4%) reported an increased number of applications received by their respective programs this year compared to previous years. While applicants (N = 108; 61.0%) mostly felt that there should not be a cap on the number of applications, 19 (67.9%) PDs supported a limit on application numbers. Applicants spent an average (SD) of $2320.96 ($1172.86) on the application process this year, which is significantly less than 2018-2019 data.Conclusions: The ophthalmology residency application process was especially complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many applicants and PDs were glad that interviews were held virtually this year, they were less certain regarding future years. The virtual format led to a significantly lower financial burden for applicants and may lead some to prefer this format in the future; if a hybrid model is offered for virtual/in-person interviews, these two interview modes should be compared equally.","Venincasa, Michael J; Steren, Benjamin; Young, Benjamin K; Parikh, Ankur; Ahmed, Bilal; Sridhar, Jayanth; Kombo, Ninani",Semin Ophthalmol,,165

Evidence suggests that the s2m motif plays a key role in replication and recombination of the virus. In SARS-CoV-2 we see slight differences in the s2m sequence from SARS-CoV-1, and the functional result of this mutation is unknown. We have also observed other mutations in the s2m motif commonly reported in COVID-19 patients in positions previously thought to be invariant. To better understand dimerization in the s2m region we used molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the folding of the mutant as monomers. Using AmberTools and NAMD, systems for the sequences were created, minimized, equilibrated, and then submitted for production. The results were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence using VMD and analyzed to find changes in thermodynamics, positions of the bases, and RSMD between the reference sequence and the mutants.","Mackenstein, Nicole Pellegrene Kendy Shine Morgan Lackey Patrick Mihailescu Mihaela-Rita Evanseck Jeffery",The FASEB Journal,,165

Since the treatments and outcomes of these infections are different, the early detection and accurate differentiation of the viruses are clinically important for the prevention and treatment of the diseases. We previously demonstrated that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) could rapidly and precisely detect SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to develop CRISPR as a test for simultaneously detecting and accurately distinguishing the viruses. The CRISPR assay with an RNA guide against each virus was performed in the reference standards of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV. The CRISPR assay had a limit of detection of 1–100 copies/µL for specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV without cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses. The validation of the test in nasopharyngeal specimens showed that it had a 90–100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV. The CRISPR assay could potentially be used for sensitive detection and specific differentiation of the respiratory viruses.","Zhou, Huifen Tsou Jen-Hui Chinthalapally Molangur Liu Hongjie Jiang Feng",Diagnostics,,165

Most measures taken to reduce the impact of COVID-19 (quarantine, visit ban in nursing home, etc.) significantly influenced the lives of older adults. Yet they were rarely consulted about their implementation. Exclusion of and discrimination against older adults has been accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many articles discussing COVID-19 also mention ageism, few actually incorporate the perspectives and opinions of older adults. Our research aims to assess the ageism experienced by older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted interviews with older adults (63-92 years, mean age = 76 years) in an urban area of France. Participants reported experiencing more ageism during the COVID-19 pandemic, including hostile and benevolent ageism from older adults' families. Despite reports of experiencing ageist attitudes and behaviors from others, however, older adults also identified positive signs of intergenerational solidarity during this COVID-19 crisis.","Barth, Nathalie; Guyot, Jessica; Fraser, Sarah Anne; Lagacé, Martine; Adam, Stéphane; Gouttefarde, Pauline; Goethals, Luc; Bechard, Lauren; Bongue, Bienvenu; Fundenberger, Hervé; Célarier, Thomas",Front Public Health,,165
387532,"Predictive factors of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in previously healthy young adults: a single-center, retrospective study",2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the association between severe obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and severe disease. METHODS: The incidence of hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was evaluated in a prospective population-based cohort of 433,995 persons aged 25 to 79 years in Spain during March and April of 2020. Persons with and without class 3 obesity were compared using Poisson regression to estimate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) from class 3 obesity of COVID-19 hospitalization and of severe disease (intensive care unit admission or death). Differences in the effect by age, sex, and chronic conditions were evaluated. RESULTS: Individuals with class 3 obesity had a higher risk of hospitalization (aRR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.66-2.93) and developing severe COVID-19 (aRR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.20-4.40). In people younger than 50 years, these effects were more pronounced (aRR = 5.02, 95% CI: 3.19-7.90 and aRR = 13.80, 95% CI: 3.11-61.17, respectively), whereas no significant effects were observed in those aged 65 to 79 years (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.70-2.12 and aRR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.52-3.88, respectively). Sex and chronic conditions did not modify the effect of class 3 obesity in any of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Severe obesity is a relevant risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization and severity in young adults, having a magnitude similar to that of aging. Tackling the current obesity pandemic could alleviate the impact of chronic and infectious diseases.","Fresán, Ujué; Guevara, Marcela; Elía, Fernando; Albéniz, Esther; Burgui, Cristina; Castilla, Jesús",Obesity (Silver Spring),,165

We conducted a systematic search of databases between December 2019 and 28th June 2020. Studies were included if they reported or allowed estimation of an odds ratio (OR) for unfavourable outcome in obese compared to non-obese patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Twenty cohort studies of 28 355 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection were included. Meta-analysis estimated a pooled OR of 2.02 (1.41-2.89, p<0.001) for an unfavourable outcome in obese versus non-obese patients when adjusted for age, sex and co-morbidities. When unadjusted for confounders, the OR for unfavourable outcomes was 1.25 (CI 1.07-1.45, p=0.005). An increased adjusted OR was also seen for death (OR 1.51; CI 1.13-2.21, p=0.006) and severe illness (OR 2.26; CI 1.47-3.48, p<0.001). Compared to a normal BMI, the risk of an unfavourable outcome was increased even in overweight patients, with severe obesity having an escalated risk.Obesity is independently associated with an unfavourable outcome of COVID-19 illness, with obese patients having twice the risk of a composite outcome of severe disease or mortality, and a 50% increased risk of death.","Hoong, Caroline Wei Shan; Hussain, Ikram; Aravamudan, Veeraraghavan Meyyur; Phyu, Ei Ei; Lin, Jaime Hui Xian; Koh, Huilin",Horm Metab Res,,165
388884,Coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with Fontan circulation,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the quarantine in orthodontic appointments, and patients' anxiety and concerns about their ongoing orthodontic treatment. SETTINGS AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Patients from private dental clinics of two orthodontists that were undergoing active orthodontic treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online anonymous questionnaire regarding their anxiety about the coronavirus situation, availability/acceptance to attend an appointment, among others, was answered by orthodontic patients. Descriptive statistics with percentages was performed and responses were compared between sexes, cities, and association of the feelings/level of anxiety of patients and willingness to attend an appointment were performed with chi-square, independent t test, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 354 patients (231 female; 123 male) with mean age of 35.49 years. Most patients are respecting the quarantine, 44.7% related to be calm and 46.3% afraid or anxious. The level of anxiety was greater for females than males. There was significant association of the level of anxiety and the willingness to attend an appointment. The greatest concern of patients was delay in the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: The quarantine and coronavirus pandemic showed to have impact on orthodontic appointments and patients' anxiety. Patients willing to attend an orthodontic appointment presented significantly lower level of anxiety than patients that would not go or would go only in urgency/emergency. Females were more anxious than males about coronavirus pandemic, quarantine and impact on their orthodontic treatments. Delay in treatment was the greatest concern of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.","Cotrin, Paula; Peloso, Renan Morais; Oliveira, Renata Cristina; de Oliveira, Ricardo César Gobbi; Pini, Nubia Inocencya Pavesi; Valarelli, Fabrício Pinelli; Freitas, Karina Maria Salvatore",Orthod Craniofac Res,,165

While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching two electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.81-3.90), male sex (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.39-3.04) and severe obesity (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.31-5.05). Active cancer (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04-2.04) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, a range of easily assessed parameters are valuable to predict elevated risk of severe illness and mortality as a result of COVID-19, including patient characteristics and detailed comorbidities, alongside the novel inclusion of real-time symptoms and vital measurements.","Booth, Adam; Reed, Angus Bruno; Ponzo, Sonia; Yassaee, Arrash; Aral, Mert; Plans, David; Labrique, Alain; Mohan, Diwakar",PLoS One,,165

391723,"Lung involvement in macrophage activation syndrome and severe COVID-19: results from a cross-sectional study to assess clinical, laboratory and artificial intelligence-radiological differences",2020,"AimsThis audit was carried out in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many teams to review how they provide care to their patients. Due to attempting to reduce the spead of COVID-19, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service within the Northern Health and Social Care Trust largely switched to telephone reviews instead of face-to-face reviews for non-urgent outpatient appointments from March 2020 onwards. The aim of this audit was to establish whether or not service users found telephone reviews to be as useful and therapeutic as the previous standard face-to-face reviews.MethodA questionnaire was used to assess opinions on telephone reviews. Those who were answering the questions were asked to rate their answers on the following scale: “not at all”, “a little”, “somewhat” or “a great deal”. There was an “any other comments” section at the end where service users could give detailed opinions on how successful they thought telephone reviews were. A sample of twenty patients was involved. This cohort of twenty patients was a mixture of ten ADHD reviews and ten medication reviews. The audit was conducted by one person and this was done via the telephone.ResultFor questions one to four (which will be fully outlined in the poster), the most popular category chosen was “somewhat” and this indicates that the majority of patients found telephone reviews somewhat better than face-to-face appointments. For question five (which was- “Overall, was the help you received good?”), 80% of service users stated that the help that they received was “a great deal” better than the help that they had received at previous face-to-face appointments. Lastly, for question six (which was- “If a friend or family member needed similar help, would you recommend that they are phoned by our service?”), 80% of service users said that they would recommend our service “a great deal” to family members or friends.ConclusionGenerally the feedback was positive for the telephone reviews. However, some still outlined a preference for face-to-face reviews. There may have been bias in this audit as it was the same doctor who did the telephone reviews as conducted the audit. To conclude, telemedicine is likely to become more popular in the future especially as the Coronavirus pandemic is still currently a worldwide problem therefore it is important to explore how service users feel about this as a way of communicating with the clinicians who are treating them.","Moss, Eileen",BJPsych Open,,165

393526,"COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury: after the tubule and the glomerulus, now the vessel?",2020,"BACKGROUND: The highly contagious nature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), besides the fact that dental procedures commonly generate blood and saliva droplets that could lead to the contagion have resulted in the closure of many dental clinics. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on dental practice by conducting an online questionnaire among the Iranian dental practitioners and finding their perspectives on the subject. METHODS: This report is based on a questionnaire that was conducted among Iranian dentists. The survey included questions that evaluate the dentists' perceptions and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on their personal life, financial status, and the quality of dental services for patients. RESULTS: Overall, 240 dentists contributed to this study (214 general dentists and 26 specialists). The majority of the participants (n = 170, 70%) did not perform non-emergency procedures during the pandemic. The dental practitioners have suggested several strategies to decrease the risk of contagion, such as reducing treatment sessions (n = 90, 37%), strict triage of patients (n = 156, 64%), and using personal protective equipment (n = 108, 45%). However, most of the dentists (n = 210, 87%) had problems, providing personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Moreover, 97% (n = 234) of the participants reported that they encountered a decrease in their financial income since the eruption of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Dental health care workers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, dental practitioners ought to execute the standard protocols more cautiously during the pandemic. They could also lower their work hours and limit dental procedures to emergency treatments to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Besides, the public organizations should provide proper equipment for the dental practitioners to decrease the risk of contagion.","Ahmadi, Hanie; Ebrahimi, Alireza; Ghorbani, Farhad",BMC Oral Health,,165

However, it is unclear whether there has been cryptic transmission before these early officially confirmed cases, we therefore retrospectively screened for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 1271 nasopharyngeal swab samples, as well as the prevalence of IgM, IgG, and total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 357 matched serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness between 1 December 2018 and 31 March 2020 in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. The onset date of the earliest COVID-19 case in this study was 25 January 2020. Before this time point, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed, which limited the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has already spread among the population before the large-scale outbreak. Additionally, among 6662 patients with influenza-like illness from 1 December 2017 to 31 March 2020, the overall number of patients positive for influenza and other respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 period decreased significantly when compared with that in the same period of the last two years, reflecting that public health interventions can effectively control the spread of common respiratory viruses.","Yu, Xiaoqi; Wei, Dong; Chen, Yongyan; Zhang, Donghua; Zhang, Xinxin",Emerg Microbes Infect,,165

METHODS: We undertook a longitudinal study of 20 of 51 consecutive CVD patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who met the study criteria. We used the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) tool to evaluate Life-space mobility and assessed QoL with the five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) in Japanese. RESULTS: The LSA scores and EQ-5D-5L QoL score decreased significantly from the pre- to post-nationwide state of emergency in Japan (p < 0.01). &#916;LSA was significantly positively associated with body mass index and significantly negatively associated with knee extensor muscle strength and pre-LSA score (p < 0.05). There were no significant relationships between &#916;LSA and &#916;EQ-5D-5L QoL scores and between &#916;EQ-5D-5L QoL scores and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: The policies promoted to address the state of emergency in Japan might affect life-space mobility and QoL of CAD patients. Moreover, CAD patients in Japan who were not obese and maintained their physical function and activity tended to refrain from activity during the period between the pre- and post-nationwide state of emergency. Clarification of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship between living space motility and QoL in CAD patients will require further study.","Ishihara, Kodai; Izawa, Kazuhiro P; Noto, Shinichi; Shimizu, Ikki",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),,165

The SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, and with its cofactor nsp10, is responsible for RNA cap formation. This study aimed to identify small molecules binding to the SAM-binding site of the nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer for potential inhibition of methyltransferase activity. By screening a library of 300 compounds, 30 compounds were selected based on binding scores, side-effects, and availability. Following more advanced docking, six potential lead compounds were further investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. This revealed the dietary compound oleuropein as a potential methyltransferase inhibitor.","Liang, Julia; Pitsillou, Eleni; Burbury, Lucy; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C",Chem Phys Lett,,165

408845,IGF-1 Deficiency Rescue and Intracellular Calcium Blockade Improves Survival and Corresponding Mechanisms in a Mouse Model of Acute Kidney Injury,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Droplets and contacts serve as the main route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The characteristic of the disease is rather heterogeneous, ranging from no symptoms to critical illness. The factors associated with the outcome of COVID-19 have not been completely characterized to date. Inspired by previous studies on the relevance of infectious diseases, viral and host factors related to clinical outcomes have been identified. The severity of COVID-19 is mainly related to host factors, especially cellular immune responses in patients. Patients with mild COVID-19 and improved patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a normal immune response to effectively eliminate the virus. The immune response in patients with fatal severe COVID-19 includes three stages: normal or hypofunction, hyperactivation, and anergy. Eventually, the patients were unable to resist viral infection and died. Based on our understanding of the kinetics of immune responses during COVID-19, we suggest that type I interferon (IFN) could be administered to patients with severe COVID-19 in the hypofunctional stage, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoid therapy could be administered in the immune hyperactivation stage. In addition, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulation therapy and anti-infective therapy with antibiotics are recommended in the hyperactivation stage.","Zhou, Xi; Ye, Qing",Front Immunol,,165

409218,Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers and the Risk of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led many jurisdictions to close in-person school instruction. METHODS: We collected data about COVID-19 cases associated with New York City (NYC) public schools from polymerase chain reaction testing performed in each school on a sample of asymptomatic students and staff and from routine reporting. We compared prevalence from testing done in schools to community prevalence estimates from statistical models. We compared cumulative incidence for school-associated cases to all cases reported to the city. School-based contacts were monitored to estimate the secondary attack rate and possible direction of transmission. RESULTS: To assess prevalence, we analyzed data from 234 132 persons tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in 1594 NYC public schools during October 9 to December 18, 2020;986 (0.4%) tested positive. COVID-19 prevalence in schools was similar to or less than estimates of prevalence in the community for all weeks. To assess cumulative incidence, we analyzed data for 2231 COVID-19 cases that occurred in students and staff compared with the 86 576 persons in NYC diagnosed with COVID-19 during the same period;the overall incidence was lower for persons in public schools compared with the general community. Of 36 423 school-based close contacts, 191 (0.5%) subsequently tested positive for COVID-19;the likely index case was an adult for 78.0% of secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: We found that in-person learning in NYC public schools was not associated with increased prevalence or incidence overall of COVID-19 infection compared with the general community.","Varma, J.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected the clinical and imaging data of 96 patients in Yunnan Province, China, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 22 and March 15, 2020. Based on disease severity, the COVID-19 patients were classified into four types: mild (n=15), moderate (n=59), severe (n=19), and critical (n=3). Based on hospital stay and number of computed tomography (CT) scans, the clinical/disease course was divided into four stages, including stage 1 (days 0-4), stage 2 (days 5-9), stage 3 (days 10-14), and stage 4 (days 15-19). The HRCT findings, CT value, and lesion volume were analyzed for each stage and compared among the four stages of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: CT findings were negative over the four stages for all mild COVID-19 patients. More lesions were found in the peripheral lung fields than in peripheral + central fields (P<0.05), and the number of negative patients in stage 4 were more than those in stages 1-3 (P<0.05). The left and right lower lobe were the most frequently affected lobes (P<0.05). In moderate patients, round ground glass opacities (GGOs) decreased from stage 1 to stage 4; partial consolidation peaked in stage 2 and then decreased in stages 3-4; fibrous stripes and subpleural lines increased from stage 1 and peaked in stage 4. Partial consolidation and consolidation were more common in severe patients than in moderate patients over the disease course (P<0.05). Critical patients showed significant partial consolidation and consolidation; The CT value, lesion volume and lesion volume percentage significantly decreased from stages 1-2 to stage 4 (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic changes in lung HRCT images are clinically related to the disease course of COVID-19.","Huang, Yilong; Li, Zhipeng; Guo, Honglei; Han, Dan; Yuan, Feng; Xie, Ying; Li, Zhi; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Peng; Yang, Yan; Li, Yudan; Ma, Jiyao; Hu, Chunzhang; Wang, Haolei; Zhao, Wei; Yi, Wenfang; Peng, Yan; Jiang, Yuanming; Li, Zhanfeng; Yang, Duiming; Wu, Kaiming; Li, Yuchang; Feng, Zaihui; Liu, Chaohai; Zhu, Guangkun; Han, Yongyun; He, Shaofei; He, Bo; Zhang, Zhenguang; Pi, Jiangyuan",Ann Palliat Med,,165
412241,Possible formation of pulmonary microthrombi in the early puerperium of pregnant women critically ill with COVID-19: Two case reports,2020,"OBJECTIVE: With hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) emerging as potential therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), shortages have been reported. We aimed to understand how rheumatologists, one of the most common prescribers of HCQ/CQ, prescribed these medications to manage COVID-19 and to understand if their patients are affected by shortages. METHODS: Between April 8 and April 27, 2020, an online survey was distributed to a convenience sample of rheumatologists who practice medicine in a diverse range of settings globally, resulting in 506 responses. Adjusted Poisson regression models were calculated. RESULTS: Only 6% of respondents prescribed HCQ/CQ for COVID-19 prophylaxis, and only 12% for outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Compared to the United States, the likelihood of prescribing HCQ/CQ for prophylaxis was higher in India (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-16.8; p < 0.001). Further, compared to the United States and those with 1 to 5 years of experience, rheumatologists in Europe (aRR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6-5.3; p < 0.001) and those with 10+ years of experience (11-20 years: aRR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.3; p = 0.015; 21+ years: aRR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.4; p = 0.004) had a higher likelihood of prescribing HCQ/CQ for outpatient treatment. Of note, 71% of all rheumatologists reported that their patients were directly affected by HCQ/CQ shortages. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that only a small percentage of rheumatologists are prescribing HCQ/CQ for prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Medication shortages experienced by large numbers of autoimmune disease patients are concerning and should play a role in decisions, especially given poor efficacy data for HCQ/CQ in COVID-19.","Mehta, Bella; Moezinia, Carine J; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Gibofsky, Allan; Tornberg, Haley; Pearce-Fisher, Diyu; Goodman, Susan M; Salmon, Jane E; Ibrahim, Said",J Clin Rheumatol,,165
412860,Understanding and Interpretation of Case Fatality Rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"OBJECTIVE: There is limited information on the severity of COVID-19 infection in children with comorbidities. We investigated the effects of pediatric comorbidities on COVID-19 severity by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases were searched for publications on pediatric COVID-19 infections published January 1st to October 5th, 2020. Articles describing at least one child with and without comorbidities, COVID-19 infection, and reported outcomes, were included. RESULTS: 42 studies containing 275,661 children without comorbidities and 9,353 children with comorbidities were included. Severe COVID-19 was present in 5.1% of children with comorbidities, and in 0.2% without comorbidities. Random-effects analysis revealed a higher risk of severe COVID-19 among children with comorbidities than for healthy children; relative risk ratio 1.79 (95% CI 1.27 - 2.51;I2 = 94%). Children with underlying conditions also had a higher risk of COVID-19-associated mortality; relative risk ratio 2.81 (95% CI 1.31 - 6.02; I2 = 82%). Children with obesity had a relative risk ratio of 2.87 (95% CI 1.16 - 7.07 I2 = 36%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with comorbidities have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and associated mortality than children without underlying disease. Additional studies are required to further evaluate this relationship.","Tsankov, Boyan K; Allaire, Joannie M; Irvine, Michael A; Lopez, Alison A; Sauvé, Laura J; Vallance, Bruce A; Jacobson, Kevan",Int. j. infect. dis,,165

Older adults may be at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes since opportunities to remain socially connected have diminished. Research is needed to better understand the impact of pandemic-related stress on mental health. The purpose of this study is three-fold: 1) to examine the influences of COVID-19 pandemic-related stress on depression, anxiety, and loneliness, 2) to assess the mediating role of coping style and social support, and 3) to investigate whether these relationships vary across age. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (N = 1,318) aged 18-92 years completed an online survey assessing pandemic-related stress, mental health, social support, coping, and their experiences with social distancing, during the initial implementation of social distancing measures in the United States. RESULTS: Social support and coping style were found to relate to psychosocial outcomes. Avoidant coping was the strongest mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychosocial outcomes, particularly depression. Avoidant coping more strongly mediated the relationship between stress and depression in younger adults compared to older adults. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Results were consistent with the stress and coping framework and recent work highlighting older adults' resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the associations between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Minahan, Jillian; Falzarano, Francesca; Yazdani, Neshat; Siedlecki, Karen L",GerontologistGerontologist,,165

In the midst of the pandemic, covering our faces with a mask has become a new normal, as face masks are active in preventing the spread of the virus. Other precautionary measures are also advocated by the government apart from covering faces, to ensure protection and hygiene. In addition, because of the limited supply of masks in the industry, millions of people are learning to make their face masks. On the opposite, identifying faces with masks on any surveillance devices would be demanding while ensuring less access control in buildings. Face coverage with masks is a problem for algorithms and success in face detection. Currently, the authorities have to manually ask people to wear masks even then they tend to fool the authorities, to avoid that we are proposing a face Machine learning-based model of recognition. In the field of computer vision, this is a common research direction by extracting features directly from the detection region and then using machine detection learning algorithms to identify and recognize. In this Face mask detection-based attendance System, people will be only able to mark their attendance only if they wear a mask, besides if they do not wear a mask, they are given an alert and they would have to wear a mask. © 2021 IEEE.","Kumar, R.

423298,Computed Tomography in Radiation Oncology During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which mandatory Guidelines to improve the school food environment were being implemented in Costa Rican high schools and to explore the perspectives of key policy actors towards the Guidelines. DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews and site observations. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and imported to NVivo 12 for analysis. Inductive and deductive themes were identified, and elements of the RE-AIM framework and the social process framework were used when classifying these themes. SETTING: Sixteen public high schools in San José, Costa Rica. PARTICIPANTS: High school principal and kiosk concessionaires. RESULTS: Products that did not adhere to the Guidelines were still widely available in schools, and amongst the most prevalent challenges to implementation that emerged from our interviews, were a lack of understanding of the policy content, a lack of monitoring and accountability, and competing values amongst actors which affected their views on the role that the school must have in offering a healthy food environment. CONCLUSION: Most products offered in high schools did not meet the criteria required by the mandatory Guidelines, and several contextual factors were found to influence implementation. Strengthening the implementation of the Costa Rican Guidelines will require further actions at the governmental and school levels.","Jensen, Melissa L; Gonzalez, Wendy; Bolaños-Palmieri, Carolina; Monge-Rojas, Rafael; Frongillo, Edward A",Public Health Nutr,,165

The diagnosis of these diseases could be difficult and require func-tional tests such as high-resolution manometry (HRM) of the esophagus, anorectal manometry and H2-Breathtests. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and the fear of infections there was a marked reduction in the number of performed exams in the last months - nevertheless some exams are necessary, in order to exclude or to diagnose important and dangerous diseases like Achalasia. Goal of this article is to present some new and relevant developments in the field.

427878,Bibliometric analysis of researches on traditional Chinese medicine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"The main objective of this paper is to address the following question: are the containment measures imposed by most of the world governments effective and sufficient to stop the epidemic of COVID-19 beyond the lock-down period? In this paper, we propose a mathematical model which allows us to investigate and analyse this problem. We show by means of the reproductive number, ${cal R}_0$ that the containment measures appear to have slowed the growth of the outbreak. Nevertheless, these measures remain only effective as long as a very large fraction of population, p, greater than the critical value $1-1/{cal R}_0$ remains confined. Using French current data, we give some simulation experiments with five scenarios including: (i) the validation of model with p estimated to 93%, (ii) the study of the effectiveness of containment measures, (iii) the study of the effectiveness of the large-scale testing, (iv) the study of the social distancing and wearing masks measures and (v) the study taking into account the combination of the large-scale test of detection of infected individuals and the social distancing with linear progressive easing of restrictions. The latter scenario was shown to be effective at overcoming the outbreak if the transmission rate decreases to 75% and the number of tests of detection is multiplied by three. We also noticed that if the measures studied in our five scenarios are taken separately then the second wave might occur at least as far as the parameter values remain unchanged.","Zongo, P; Zorom, M; Mophou, G; Dorville, R; Beaumont, C",Epidemiol Infect,,165

To maximize the efficiency and productivity of drug development, the world has adopted disruptive technologies and approaches in various drug development areas. Telehealth, characterized by the heavy use of digital technologies; drug repositioning strategies, aided by computational breakthroughs; and data tracking tool hubs, enabling real-time information sharing, have received much attention. Moreover, drug developers have engaged in open innovation by establishing various types of collaborations, many of which have been carried out across nations and enterprises. Finally, regulatory agencies have attempted to operate on a more flexible review basis than before. Although such disruptive approaches have partly reshaped drug development practices, issues and challenges remain before the completion of this paradigm shift in conventional drug development practices for the post-pandemic era. In this review, we have highlighted the role of a collaborative community of experts in order to figure out how disruptive technologies can be fully integrated into the current drug development practices and improve drug development efficiency for the post-pandemic era.","Won, Jung-Hyun; Lee, Howard",Int. j. mol. sci.

Although the infectious risk to the pediatric population appears low, the effects on children with congenital heart disease (CHD) remain poorly understood. The closure of congenital heart surgery programs worldwide to address the growing number of infected individuals could have an unintended impact on future health for COVID-19-negative patients with CHD. Pediatric and congenital heart surgeons, given their small numbers and close relationships, are uniquely positioned to collectively assess the impact of the pandemic on surgical practice and care of children with CHD.

432643,Autophagy inhibition by chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could adversely affect acute kidney injury and other organ injury in critically ill patients with COVID-19,2020,"Human hearing adapts to background noise, as evidenced by the fact that listeners recognize more isolated words when words are presented later rather than earlier in noise. This adaptation is likely due to the leading noise shifting ('adapting') the dynamic range of auditory neurons, which can improve the neural encoding of speech spectral and temporal cues. Because neural dynamic range adaptation depends on stimulus level statistics, here we investigated the importance of 'statistical' adaptation for improving speech recognition in noisy backgrounds. We compared the recognition of noised-masked words in the presence and in the absence of adapting noise precursors whose level was either constant or was changing every 50 ms according to different statistical distributions. Adaptation was measured for 28 listeners (9 men) and was quantified as the recognition improvement in the precursor relative to the no-precursor condition. Adaptation was largest for constant-level precursors and did not occur for highly fluctuating precursors, even when the two types of precursors had the same mean level and both activated the medial olivocochlear reflex. Instantaneous amplitude compression of the highly fluctuating precursor produced as much adaptation as the constant-level precursor did without compression. Altogether, results suggest that noise adaptation in speech recognition is probably mediated by neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent sound level. Further, they suggest that auditory peripheral compression per se, rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex, could facilitate noise adaptation by reducing the level fluctuations in the noise.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecognizing speech in noise is challenging but can be facilitated by noise adaptation. The neural mechanisms underlying this adaptation remain unclear. Here, we report some benefits of adaptation for word-in-noise recognition and show that (1) adaptation occurs for stationary but not for highly fluctuating precursors with equal mean level; (2) both stationary and highly fluctuating noises activate the medial olivocochlear reflex; and (3) adaptation occurs even in highly fluctuating noise when the stimulus is passed through a fast amplitude compressor. These findings suggest that noise adaptation reflects neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent noise level and that auditory peripheral compression rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex could facilitate noise adaptation.","Marrufo-Pérez, Miriam I; Sturla Carreto, Dora Del Pilar; Eustaquio-Martín, Almudena; Lopez-Poveda, Enrique A",J. neurosci,,165
432884,Increased risk for severe COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases treated with rituximab,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The disease presents with symptoms such as shortness of breath, fever, dry cough, and chronic fatigue, amongst others. The disease may be asymptomatic in some patients in the early stages, which can lead to increased transmission of the disease to others. This study attempts to review papers on the role of imaging and medical image computing in COVID-19 diagnosis. For this purpose, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched to find related studies until the middle of 2021. The contribution of this study is four-fold: 1) to use as a tutorial of the field for both clinicians and technologists, 2) to comprehensively review the characteristics of COVID-19 as presented in medical images, 3) to examine automated artificial intelligence-based approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis, 4) to express the research limitations in this field and the methods used to overcome them. Using machine learning-based methods can diagnose the disease with high accuracy from medical images and reduce time, cost and error of diagnostic procedure. It is recommended to collect bulk imaging data from patients in the shortest possible time to improve the performance of COVID-19 automated diagnostic methods.","Nabavi, Shahabedin; Ejmalian, Azar; Moghaddam, Mohsen Ebrahimi; Abin, Ahmad Ali; Frangi, Alejandro F; Mohammadi, Mohammad; Rad, Hamidreza Saligheh",Comput Biol Med,,165

Thus, the current study explored the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and aspects of mental health, namely anxiety and depression, and will consider whether this relationship can be mediated by mindfulness. Data were collected from a student sample of 355 participants (71.5% female and 28.5% male) ranging between 18 and 41 years of age (M = 22.41 ± 3.27), with participants completing a fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS), and the anxiety and depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). In terms of the results, correlational analyses indicated that fear of COVID-19 is inversely associated with mindfulness, while positive correlations were found with anxiety and depression. Structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that mindfulness mediated the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and depression and anxiety.

This study investigates boat-based recreational fishing in Western Australia from March to August 2020, where COVID-19 measures relevant to recreational fishers included various travel restrictions, and social and physical distancing measures. Information from surveys of licensed recreational fishers and fisheries compliance officers and camera footage from key boat ramps is presented. A lower proportion of Perth metropolitan fishers went fishing compared with regional fishers. Metropolitan fishers also reported fewer days fished and lower participation in demersal and shore-based line fishing than regional fishers. In contrast, compliance officers observed more fishing activity in both metropolitan and regional locations. Fishing plans were mostly affected by travel restrictions with more metropolitan fishers (57%) affected compared with regional fishers (49%). Daily recreational vessel retrievals at key boat ramps varied between locations, with metropolitan fishers initially unable to travel to regional centres. There was no decline in vessel retrievals at metropolitan boat ramps during the most rigid restrictions and northern regional boat ramps experienced substantial increases in recreational vessel activity once travel restrictions eased. Studies of this kind highlight the value of utilising established recreational monitoring programs to provide a responsive and scientific basis for policymakers to address societal behavioural changes associated with atypical events such as COVID-19.","Ryan, Karina L.; Desfosses, Cameron J.; Denham, Ainslie M.; Taylor, Stephen M.; Jackson, Gary",Marine Policy,,165

Observations: Prior to the pandemic, many countries were engaging in suicide prevention strategies, and although the overall global burden of suicide deaths has increased, some national efforts were beginning to see positive results. Additionally, the gap between mental health needs and services has been increasing in many nations. With the added physical and mental health, social, and economic burdens imposed by the pandemic, many populations worldwide may experience increased suicide risk. Data and recent events during the first 6 months of the pandemic reveal specific effects on suicide risk.

In the systematic review, we systematically reviewed the structural basis of different target proteins of SARS-corona virus (CoV2) from a viral life cycle and from drug design perspective. We searched four literature (PubMed, EMBASE, NATURE, and Willey online library) databases and one structural database (RCSB.org) with appropriate keywords till April 18, and finally, 26 articles were included in the systematic review. The published literature mainly centered upon the structural details of ""spike protein,"" ""main protease/M Pro/3CL pro,"" ""RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"" and ""nonstructural protein 15 Endoribonuclease"" of SARS-CoV-2. However, inhibitor bound structures were very less. We need better structures elucidating the interactions between different targets and their inhibitors which will help us in understanding the atomic level importance of different amino acid residues in the functionality of the target structures. To summarize, we need structures with fine resolution, co-crystallized structures with biologically validated inhibitors, and functional characterization of different target proteins. Some other routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 are also mentioned (e.g., CD147); however, these findings are not structurally validated. This review may pave way for better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle from structural biology perspective.","Prajapat, Manisha; Sarma, Phulen; Shekhar, Nishant; Prakash, Ajay; Avti, Pramod; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kaur, Hardeep; Kumar, Subodh; Bansal, Seema; Sharma, Amit Raj; Medhi, Bikash",Indian J Pharmacol,,165

This research will begin to examine the relative influence of relevant psychological, social, and situational factors on intent to engage with a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine among key workers and non-key workers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: The study utilized a sample of UK adults who completed the 1-month follow-up of The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study during April/May 2020 and indicated having not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (key workers n = 584; not key workers n = 1,021). These groups were compared in relation to their intentions to vaccinate, perceived risk of infection, and symptom severity. Binary logistic regression was used to examine predictors of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the sample (76.2% key workers, 73.1% non-key workers) indicated they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine in future. Key workers (in particular health and social care workers) had a higher perceived risk of becoming infected in the coming months. For key workers, being female and perceiving oneself as having relatively low infection risk in the next 6 months was associated with increased likelihood of vaccine hesitancy. For non-key workers, however, being aged 25-54, having a low or average income and not knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of individuals willing to accept a vaccine is encouraging but there is much room for improvement. Given the unique predictors of vaccine hesitancy in each group, public health campaigns may benefit from targeted messaging.","Butter, Sarah; McGlinchey, Emily; Berry, Emma; Armour, Cherie",Br. j. health psychol,,165

An emerging popular technique, which adopts improvements made in mobile ultrasound technology, allows for healthcare professionals to conduct rapid screenings on a large scale. We present an image-based solution that aims at automating the testing process which allows for rapid mass testing to be conducted with or without a trained medical professional that can be applied to rural environments and third world countries. Our contributions towards rapid large-scale testing include a novel deep learning architecture capable of analyzing ultrasound data that can run in real-time and significantly improve the current state-of-the-art detection accuracies using image-based COVID-19 detection.","Perera, Shehan; Adhikari, Srikar; Yilmaz, Alper",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09913v1.pdf,165
450027,Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Case-Control Study From the United States,2020,"To date, there is no definitive treatment for the new SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Three evolutionary stages in SARS-CoV-2 infection are recognized (early infection, pulmonary phase, and systemic hyper inflammation), with characteristic clinical signs and symptoms. There are 80 international experimental trials underway seeking effective treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, there are only three that consider ozone therapy (major auto hemotherapy) as an alternative option. There is no study that evaluates rectal ozone insufflation, despite being a safe, cheap, risk-free technique. That technique is a systemic route of ozone administration (95-96%) and that could be extrapolated to the use of SARS-CoV-2, given the excellent results observed in the management of Ebola. Ozone has four proven biological properties that could allow its use as an alternative therapy in the different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ozone could inactivate the virus by direct (O3) or indirect oxidation (ROS and LOPs) and could stimulate the cellular and humoral immune systems, being useful in the early COVID-19 infection phase (stages 1 and 2a). Ozone improves gas exchange, reduces inflammation, and modulates the antioxidant system, so it would be useful in the hyper inflammation or ""cytokine storm"" phase, and in the hypoxemia and/or multi-organ failure phase (stage 2b and stage 3). Given the current pandemic, it is urgent to carry out an experimental study that confirms or rules out the biological properties of ozone and thus allows it to be an alternative or compassionate therapy for the effective management of SARS-Cov-2 infection. The Ethical Committee at our Hospital has authorized the use of this technique for compassionate management of SARS-CoV-2 infection, considering the four biological Ozone properties exposed previously.","Fernández-Cuadros, Marcos Edgar; Albaladejo-Florín, María Jesús; Peña-Lora, Daiana; Álava-Rabasa, Sandra; Pérez-Moro, Olga Susana",SN Compr Clin Med,,165

METHODS: This study adopted a repeated cross-sectional design and surveyed unionized nurses in British Columbia (BC), Canada on three occasions: September 2019 (Time 1, pre-pandemic), April 2020 (Time 2, early-pandemic) and June 2020 (Time 3). RESULTS: A total of 10,117 responses were collected across three timepoints. This study found a significant increase of 10% to 15% in anxiety and depression between Time 1 and 2, and relative stability between Time 2 and 3, with Time 3 levels still higher than Time 1 levels. Cross-sector analyses showed similar patterns of findings for acute care and community nurses. Long-term care nurses showed a two-fold increase in the prevalence of anxiety early pandemic, followed by a sharper decline mid pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had short- and mid-term mental health implications for BC nurses particularly among those in the long-term care sector. Future research should evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of health workers in different contexts, such as jurisdictional analyses, and better understand the long-term health and labour market consequences of elevated mental health symptoms over an extended time period.","Havaei, Farinaz; Smith, Peter; Oudyk, John; Potter, Guy G",Ann. epidemiol,,165

This issue has become even more relevant since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the necessity for minimum distances between passengers. We propose an approach that allows to dynamically navigate passengers around dangerously crowded stations to better distribute the passenger load across an entire urban public transport network. This is achieved through the introduction of new constraints into routing requests, that enable the avoidance of specific nodes in a network. These requests consider walks, bikes, metros, subways, trams and buses as possible modes of transportation. An implementation of the approach is provided in cooperation with the Munich Travel Corporation (MVG) for the city of Munich, to simulate the effects on a real city's urban traffic flow. Among other factors, the impact on the travel time was simulated given that the two major exchange points in the network were to be avoided. With an increase from 26.5 to 26.8 minutes on the average travel time, the simulation suggests that the time penalty might be worth the safety benefits.","Klinker, Jens; Selmi, Mohamed Hechem; Avezum, Mariana; Jonas, Stephan",Stud Health Technol Inform,,165

SARS-CoV-2 infections of feline and canine species have also been reported. However, it is not entirely clear to what extent natural SARS-CoV-2 infection of pet dogs and cats is in households. We have developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neutralization assay to screen serum samples of 239 pet cats and 510 pet dogs in Minnesota in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-April to early June 2020 for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposures. A cutoff value was used to identify the seropositive samples in each experiment. The average seroprevalence of N- and RBD-specific antibodies in pet cats were 8% and 3%, respectively. Among nineteen (19) N-seropositive cat sera, fifteen (15) exhibited neutralizing activity and seven (7) were also RBD-seropositive. The N-based ELISA is also specific and does not cross react with antigens of common feline coronaviruses. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected at a very low percentage in pet dogs (~ 1%) and were limited to IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N protein with no neutralizing activities. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 seropositive rates are higher in pet cats than in pet dogs in MN early in the pandemic and that SARS-CoV-2 N-specific IgG antibodies can detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in companion animals with higher levels of specificity and sensitivity than RBD-specific IgG antibodies in ELISA-based assays.","Dileepan, Mythili; Di, Da; Huang, Qinfeng; Ahmed, Shamim; Heinrich, Daniel; Ly, Hinh; Liang, Yuying",Virulence,,165

The aim of the study was to explore the lifestyle changes of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania, the changes in prenatal care and delivery during the pandemic and the psychological impact on women and to determine how healthcare providers can help them to overcome this period. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted anonymously and distributed among pregnancy-related groups from Romania, recruiting 559 study participants, between May and October 2020. A total of 559 pregnant women completed an online 26-item questionnaire but we only validated 557 responses for study. The survey included basic demographic questions, pregnancy-related questions, questions regarding the pregnant women’s lifestyle changes during the pandemic and their perception of the COVID-19 pandemic and questions which evaluated the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and delivery in Romania. Results: The pandemic restrictions affected women’s routine activities regarding professional, familial and social life. Therefore, for pregnant women who were emotionally vulnerable, these restrictions had a great impact on their mental health. The majority of the study participants (78.8%, N = 439) were emotionally affected by the pandemic. The fear related to the possibility of having their pregnancy affected by the virus was dominant in the group (45.8%). A high number of women (69.5%) felt safe when they accessed health services, but private hospitals were considered safer (53.1%) compared to public hospitals (14.4%). The majority of participants (53.7%) used to have prenatal care in a private healthcare system. During the pandemic, preventive measures were associated with low confidence in the healthcare system. Of the total group of participants, 123 women (22.1%) gave birth during the pandemic. Of these, a majority of the study participants considered that it was very difficult for them to cope without their partner during the hospitalization and labor period. Conclusions: The main anxiety of pregnant women were related to threats to their lives and their baby’s health because of the uncertainty caused by pandemic. It is important to know that the restrictions and the changes in maternity care had a negative impact on them. This conclusion must be taken into account when preventive measures will be decided for helping them to get through such a period. Additionally, psychological support will be essential for improving the mental health of pregnant women and for preventing a negative outcome of the pregnancy. These feelings must be taken into account when preventive measures will be established during pandemic and a psychological support will be essential for improving their mental health for preventing negative outcome of pregnancy.","Cigăran, Ruxandra-Gabriela Botezatu Radu Mînecan Elma-Maria Gică Corina Panaitescu Anca Maria Peltecu Gheorghe Gică Nicolae",Healthcare,,165

Motivated by this question, we quantify the implications of an opinion formation mechanism whereby an uninformed observer gradually forms opinions about a world composed of subjects interrelated by a signed network of mutual trust and distrust. We show numerically and analytically that the observer's resulting opinions are highly inconsistent (they tend to be independent of the observer's initial opinions) and unstable (they exhibit wide stochastic variations). Opinion inconsistency and instability increase with the world complexity represented by the number of subjects, which can be prevented by suitably expanding the observer's initial amount of information. Our findings imply that even an individual who initially trusts credible information sources may end up trusting the deceptive ones if at least a small number of trust relations exist between the credible and deceptive sources.","Medo, Mat'uvs; Mariani, Manuel S.; Lu, Linyuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12355v1.pdf,165

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.0%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.8%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%). The low CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment enables public health response and reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.",,,,165

It is urgent to distinguish COVID-19 from common pneumonia. In this study, we reported multiple clinical feature analyses on COVID-19 in Inner Mongolia for the first time. We dynamically monitored multiple clinical features of all 75 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 219 pneumonia patients, and 68 matched healthy people in Inner Mongolia. Then, we studied the association between COVID-19 and clinical characteristics, based on which to construct a novel logistic regression model for predicting COVID-19. As a result, among the tested clinical characteristics, WBC, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), ALT, and Cr were significantly different between COVID-19 patients and patients in other groups. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.869 for the logistic regression model using multiple factors associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, the CRP reaction showed five different time-series patterns with one-peak and double-peak modes. In conclusion, our study identified a few clinical characteristics significantly different between COVID-19 patients and others in Inner Mongolia. The features can be used to establish a reliable logistic regression model for predicting COVID-19.","Yu, Lan; Li, Tianbao; Gao, Li; Wang, Bo; Chai, Jun; Shi, Xiaoli; Su, Rina; Tian, Geng; Yang, Jialiang; Sun, Dejun",Biomed Res Int,,165

METHODS: All confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Wenzhou from January 19 to February 20, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Of the 116 patients with COVID-19, 27 were diagnosed as severe cases. Among severe cases, 9 were treated in ICU. The data of blood routine examination were analyzed and compared among common patients (as common group), severe patients admitted to intensive care unit (as severe ICU group) and severe patients not admitted to ICU (as severe non-ICU group). The blood routine examination results were dynamically observed in the above groups after admission. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (P < 0.001). In severe ICU group, patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes, but the highest neutrophil count and NLR among the above three groups (all P values < 0.05); NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and its area under the curve reached 0.925. The odds ratio of the delay in days to the start of the increase of eosinophil count for predicting the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 was 2.291 after age adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have abnormal peripheral blood routine examination results. Dynamic surveillance of peripheral blood system especially eosinophils is helpful in the prediction of severe COVID-19 cases.","Sun, Suyu; Cai, Xuejiao; Wang, Huaguo; He, Guiqing; Lin, Yin; Lu, Bibi; Chen, Chaoyue; Pan, Yong; Hu, Xingzhong",Clin Chim Acta,,165

500329,Mass Screening Is Associated with Low Rates of Acute Kidney Injury among COVID-19 Patients in Hong Kong,2021,"RATIONALE: Cigarette smoking is associated with COVID-19 prevalence and severity, but the mechanistic basis for how smoking alters SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is unknown. A potential explanation is that smoking could alter expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which functions as the cellular receptor and point of entry. Here we investigated the severity of SARS CoV-2 infection ex vivo and in vitro and using tissue samples and primary ferret and human airway epithelial cells with and without antecedent exposure to cigarette smoke. Methods: ACE2 expression measured by Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) of ferret lungs exposed to 6 months of cigarette smoke, and findings validated by immunofluorescence (IF). Primary airway cells isolated from airways of ferrets or human non-smokers or COPD subjects were grown until terminally differentiated at air liquid interface. Cells were then exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or vehicle control, then infected with SARS CoV-2 (3 MOI) or mock control. Viral copy was measured by Q-PCR. Viral infection was quantified by foci forming assay (FFU/mL) using VeroE6 cells. Results: Ferret lungs following 6 months of smoke exposure had increased ACE2 as compared to air controls by Q-PCR (&gt;1.5 fold, P&lt;0.05, N=6), and IF staining. Higher ACE2 expression was also observed in normal ferret airway cells exposed to CSE (&gt;1.5 fold, P&lt;0.05, N=3), normal Human Bronchial Epithelial (HBE) cells exposed to CSE (&gt;2 fold, P&lt;0.001, N=4), and HBE cells from COPD donors as compared to healthy controls (&gt;2 fold, P&lt;0.001, N=4). When ferret airway cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, intracellular viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was increased in CSE exposed cells as compared to vehicle controls (103-104 vehicle Vs CSE 105 106 copy/μL). Viral infection was also increased &gt;2 fold (P&lt;0.01, N=5). Likewise, CSE exposed (105-107 copy/μL, P&lt;0.0001, N=4) and COPD (106-108 copy/μL, P&lt;0.0001, N=4) HBE had increased viral load as compared to controls (103-104 copy/μL, P &lt;0.001, N=4), and 2 to 3-fold increase in viral infection, respectively. TUNEL staining was increased in infected cells, indicating apoptosis. Transcript analysis of HBE cells with and without SARS-CoV-2 by RNASeq to identify differentially expressed genes in CSE exposed cells as compared to controls is in progress. Conclusion: Cigarette smoke and CSE increased ACE2 expression in ferrets, and ferret and human cells respectively. CSE-induction increased viral replication and infection severity, resulting in increased apoptosis. Cigarette smoking likely influences the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection by altering expression of ACE2, inducing airway cell apoptosis upon infection.","Hussain, S. S.; Tipper, J.

BACKGROUND: Acute care providers may be exposed to an increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection since many patients present to the emergency department without complete screening measures. However, it is not known which patients present with the highest incidence. METHODS: All acute care surgery (ACS) patients who presented to our level I trauma center between March 19, 2020, and September 20, 2020 and were tested for COVID-19 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two cohorts: COVID positive (+) and COVID negative (-). Patient demographics, type of consultation (emergency general surgery consults [EGS], interpersonal violence trauma consults [IPV], and non-interpersonal violence trauma consults [NIPV]), clinical data and outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare differences between the groups. RESULTS: In total, 2177 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 116 were COVID+ (5.3%) and 2061 were COVID- (94.7%). COVID+ patients were more frequently Latinos (64.7% versus 61.7%, P = 0.043) and African Americans (18.1% versus 11.2%, P < 0.001) and less frequently Caucasian (6.0% versus 14.1%, P < 0.001). Asian/Filipino/Pacific Islander (7.8% versus 7.2%, P = 0.059) and Native American/Other/Unknown (3.4% versus 5.8%, P = 0.078) groups showed no statistical difference in COVID incidence. Mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay were similar between the groups and across patient populations stratified by the type of consultation. Logistic regression demonstrated higher odds of COVID+ infection amongst IPV patients (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.62-7.56, P < 0.001) compared to other ACS consultation types.

502934,Starting Kidney Replacement Therapy in Critically III Patients with Acute Kidney Injury,2021,"With the spiraling pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has becoming inherently important to disseminate accurate and timely information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for future work in CovidSens.","Rashid, Md Tahmid; Wang, Dong",Artif Intell Rev,,165

METHODS: We report a case series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 39 HT recipients from 3 French heart transplant centers (mean age 54.4±14.8 years; 66.7% males). RESULTS: Hospital admission was required for 35 (89.7%) cases including 14/39 (35.9%) cases being admitted in intensive care unit. Immunosuppressive medications were reduced or discontinued in 74.4% of the patients. After a median follow-up of 54 (19 - 80) days, death and death or need for mechanical ventilation occurred in 25.6% and 33.3% of patients, respectively. Elevated C-reactive protein and lung involvement &#8805;50% on chest computed tomography (CT) at admission were associated with an increased risk of death or need for mechanical ventilation. Mortality rate from March to June in the entire 3-center HT recipient cohort was 56% higher in 2020 compared to the time-matched 2019 cohort (2% versus 1.28%, p=0.15). In a meta-analysis including 4 studies, preexisting diabetes mellitus (OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.43 - 9.06, I2 =0%, p=0.006) and chronic kidney disease stage III or higher (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.39 - 10.31, I2 = 0%, p=0.009) were associated with increased mortality.

503918,Clinical features of liver injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: an analysis of 201 cases,2020,"PURPOSE: TikTok, the fastest growing social media application worldwide, has been infrequently studied in medicine. We analyzed the top radiology-related posts on TikTok in order to describe opportunities for radiology engagement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved the top 300 posts meeting the search criteria ""radiology."" User- and post-related data were categorized based on a prespecified coding system. Descriptive statistics were reported. Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to assess for differences in followers, plays, likes, and comments among posts and users. RESULTS: 284 working posts were broadcast by 187 unique users with median 119 followers (interquartile range [IQR]: 31-1,206) and 20 posts (IQR: 7-49). Most (81%, 151/187) were nonphysician radiology personnel, while only 5% (9/187) were radiologists. Posts by radiologists had more plays than those by nonphysician radiology personnel (median 3643 vs 1282, P = 0.001). The 284 posts had median 1520 plays (IQR 429-4374), 60 likes (IQR 18-272), and 2 comments (IQR 0-9). Most posts were work-related (184/284, 65%), followed by clinical (68/284, 24%), personal (30/284, 11%), or promotional (2/284, 1%). However, posts by radiologists were mostly clinical (65%, 31/48) and represented a large majority of posted imaging cases (29/33, 88%). Posts about COVID-19 represented 38% (107/284) of the study sample and 48% (93/193) of posts after the first U.S. COVID-19 case COVID-19 posts had significantly more comments (3 vs. 2, P = 0.034) and more likes approaching significance (89 vs 51, P = 0.134) than non-COVID-19 posts. CONCLUSIONS: Though radiologists represent a minority of TikTok users their post represent the majority of this platform's clinical content. This presents an important opportunity for radiologists to utilize TikTok for contemporary, unique content creation and engagement with nonphysician radiology personnel.","Lovett, Jessica T; Munawar, Kamran; Mohammed, Sharon; Prabhu, Vinay",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,,165

Mass spectrometry provided site-specific compositions of densely distributed high-mannose and complex-type N-glycans that account for 1/4 of the total molecular mass; most of the N-glycans could be visualized by cryo-EM. Specifically, the N-glycans that wedge between 2 galectin-like domains within the S1 subunit of FIPV S protein result in a unique propeller-like conformation, underscoring the importance of glycosylation in maintaining protein structures. The cleavage site within the S2 subunit responsible for activation also showed distinct structural features and glycosylation.

507818,A Simplified Comorbidity Evaluation Predicting Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"The objectives are to present an updated synopsis on osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA) syndrome and evaluate the roles of selected micronutrients in its prevention and management. OSA refers to the concurrent deterioration of bone (osteopenia/osteoporosis), muscle (sarcopenia) and adipose tissue expansion. It portrays the most advanced stage in a continuum of body composition disorders. Although OSA has been widely studied involving the populations of different backgrounds, its prevalence is hard to collate because different methodologies and criteria were used for its diagnosis. Another critical health aspect is the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI) which contributes to OSA and vice versa. Nutrition is important in the prevention and management of both OSA and LGCI. Although micronutrients act in numerous metabolic and physiological processes, their roles here are presented in relation to OSA (and its components) and LGCI in general and relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and vitamins D and K; their interactions, physiological ratios and synergism/antagonism are discussed as well. In conclusion, calcium, magnesium and vitamin D have a profound impact on OSA and its components, and the latter two also on LGCI. Potassium and vitamin K are vital in bone, muscle functioning and possibly adipose tissue modification. Both, but particularly vitamin D, surfaced as important modulators of immune system with application in COVID-19 infections. While both phosphorus and sodium have important roles in bone, muscle and can impact adiposity, due to their abundance in food, their intake should be curbed to prevent possible damaging effects.","Ilich, Jasminka Z",Proc Nutr Soc,,165

Greatly, there are limited studies concerned with the effect of airborne pollutants on COVID-19 infection, while exposure to airborne pollutants may harm human health. This paper aimed to examine the associations of acute exposure to ambient atmospheric pollutants to daily newly COVID-19 confirmed cases in 41 Chinese cities. Using a generalized additive model with Poisson distribution controlling for temperature and relative humidity, we evaluated the association between pollutant concentrations and daily COVID-19 confirmation at single-city level and multicity levels. We observed a 10-µg/m3 rise in levels of PM2.5 (lag 0-14), O3 (lag 0-1), SO2 (lag 0), and NO2 (lag 0-14) were positively associated with relative risks of 1.050 (95% CI: 1.028, 1.073), 1.011 (1.007, 1.015), 1.052 (1.022, 1.083), and 1.094 (1.028, 1.164) of daily newly confirmed cases, respectively. Further adjustment for other pollutants did not change the associations materially (excepting in the model for SO2). Our results indicated that COVID-19 incidence may be susceptible to airborne pollutants such as PM2.5, O3, SO2, and NO2, and mitigation strategies of environmental factors are required to prevent spreading.","Lu, Bingqing; Wu, Na; Jiang, Jiakui; Li, Xiang",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations by analyzing the host miRNA binding and virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, five host miRNAs which lost their affinity for targeting the viral genome, and another five can target the mutated viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","Islam, Abul Bashar Mir Md Khademul; Khan, Md Abdullah-Al-Kamran",Gene Rep,,165

512030,Be aware of acute kidney injury in critically ill children with COVID-19,2020,"In India, the breakthrough infections during second wave of COVID-19 pandemic was due to SARS-COV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2). It was reported that majority of the infections were caused by the delta variant and only 9.8% percent cases required hospitalization whereas, only 0.4% fatality was observed. Sudden dropdown in COVID-19 infections was observed within a short timeframe, suggesting better host adaptation with evolved delta variant. Down regulation of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 by ORF8 induced MHC-I degradation has been reported earlier. The Delta variant carried mutations (deletion) at Asp119 and Phe120 amino acids which are critical for ORF8 dimerization. The deletions of amino acids Asp119 and Phe120 in ORF8 of delta variant results in structural instability of ORF8 dimer caused by disruption of hydrogen bonding and salt bridges as revealed by structural analysis and MD simulation studies of ORF8 dimer. Further, flexible docking of wild type and mutant ORF8 dimer revealed reduced interaction of mutant ORF8 dimer with MHC-I as compared to wild type ORF8 dimer with MHC-1, thus implicating its possible role in MHC-I expression and host immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We thus propose that mutant ORF8 may not hindering the MHC-I expression thereby resulting in better immune response against SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, which partly explains the sudden drop of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 predominated by delta variant in India Graphical Abstract O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=""FIGDIR/small/457457v1_ufig1.gif"" ALT=""Figure 1""> View larger version (40K): org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@751eeaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140b5b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@159a3a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6c206_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP M_FIG C_FIG","Chaudhari, Armi; Singh, Dr. Indira; Joshi, Dr. Madhvi; PATEL, Dr. AMRUTLAL; Joshi, Proff.

There were significantly more individuals who were infected without symptoms in the second wave (59 of 118 individuals [50.0%]) and third wave (94 of 265 individuals [35.5%]) than in the first wave (1 of 14 individuals [7.1%]) (P = .001). Significantly fewer individuals who were infected in the second and third waves, compared with the first wave, had fever (first wave: 10 individuals [71.4%]; second wave: 22 individuals [18.5%]; third wave: 98 individuals [37.0%]; P < .001) or cough (first wave: 6 individuals [42.9%]; second wave: 15 individuals [12.7%]; third wave: 52 individuals [19.6%]; P = .02). Among all individuals, 394 individuals (99.2%) had mild illness. One patient developed chilblains (ie, COVID toes), 1 patient developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 1 patient developed post-COVID-19 autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In all 3 waves, 204 patients with COVID-19 (51.4%) had domestic infections. Among these individuals, 186 (91.2%) reported having a contact history with another individual with COVID-19, of which most (183 individuals [90.0%]) were family members. In the third wave, 18 individuals with domestic infections had unknown contact histories. Three schoolmates were confirmed with COVID-19 on the same day and were reported to be close contacts. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that nearly all children and youths with COVID-19 in Hong Kong had mild illness. These findings suggest that household transmission was the main source of infection for children and youths with domestic infections and that the risk of being infected at school was small.","Chua, Gilbert T; Wong, Joshua Sung Chih; Lam, Ivan; Ho, Polly Po Ki; Chan, Wai Hung; Yau, Felix Yat Sun; Rosa Duque, Jaime S; Ho, Alvin Chi Chung; Siu, Ka Ka; Cheung, Tammy W Y; Lam, David Shu Yan; Chan, Victor Chi Man; Lee, Kwok Piu; Tsui, Kwing Wan; Wong, Tak Wai; Yau, Man Mut; Yau, Tsz Yan; Chan, Kate Ching Ching; Yu, Michelle Wai Ling; Chow, Chit Kwong; Chiu, Wah Keung; Chan, Kwok Chiu; Wong, Wilfred H S; Ho, Marco Hok Kung; Tso, Winnie W Y; Tung, Keith T S; Wong, Christina S; Kwok, Janette; Leung, Wing Hang; Yam, Jason C; Wong, Ian C K; Tam, Paul Kwong Hang; Chan, Godfrey Chi Fung; Chow, Chun Bong; To, Kelvin K W; Lau, Yu Lung; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Ip, Patrick; Kwan, Mike Yat Wah",JAMA Netw Open,,165

515374,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients Receiving Compassionate Use Leronlimab,2020,"Although SARS-CoV-2 can invade the intestine, though its effect on digestion and absorption is not fully understood. In the present study, 56 COVID-19 patients and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were divided into a discovery cohort and a validation cohort. Blood, faeces and clinical information were collected from the patients in the hospital and at discharge. The faecal metabolome was analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and Spearman's correlation analyses of clinical features, the serum metabolome, and the faecal micro- and mycobiota were conducted. The results showed that, the faeces of COVID-19 patients were enriched with important nutrients that should be metabolized or absorbed, such as sucrose and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol; diet-related components that cannot be synthesized by humans, such as 1,5-anhydroglucitol and D-pinitol; and harmful metabolites, such as oxalate, were also detected. In contrast, purine metabolites such as deoxyinosine and hypoxanthine, low-water-soluble long-chain fatty alcohols/acids such as behenic acid, compounds rarely occurring in nature such as D-allose and D-arabinose, and microbe-related compounds such as 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol were depleted in the faeces of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these metabolites significantly correlated with altered serum metabolites such as oxalate and gut microbesincluding Ruminococcaceae, Actinomyces, Sphingomonas and Aspergillus. Although levels of several faecal metabolites, such as sucrose, 1,5-anhydroglucitol and D-pinitol, of discharged patients were not different from those of healthy controls (HCs), those of oxalate and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol did differ. Therefore, alterations in the faecal metabolome of COVID-19 patients may reflect malnutrition and intestinal inflammation and warrant greater attention. The results of present study provide new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of COVID-19.","Lv, Longxian; Jiang, Huiyong; Chen, Yanfei; Gu, Silan; Xia, Jiafeng; Zhang, Hua; Lu, Yingfeng; Yan, Ren; Li, Lanjuan",Anal Chim Acta,,165

Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require a deeper understanding of the molecular processes involved in the healthy heart. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle. Our human cardiac cell atlas improves our understanding of the human heart and provides a valuable reference for future studies.","Litvinuková, Monika; Talavera-López, Carlos; Maatz, Henrike; Reichart, Daniel; Worth, Catherine L; Lindberg, Eric L; Kanda, Masatoshi; Polanski, Krzysztof; Heinig, Matthias; Lee, Michael; Nadelmann, Emily R; Roberts, Kenny; Tuck, Liz; Fasouli, Eirini S; DeLaughter, Daniel M; McDonough, Barbara; Wakimoto, Hiroko; Gorham, Joshua M; Samari, Sara; Mahbubani, Krishnaa T; Saeb-Parsy, Kourosh; Patone, Giannino; Boyle, Joseph J; Zhang, Hongbo; Zhang, Hao; Viveiros, Anissa; Oudit, Gavin Y; Bayraktar, Omer Ali; Seidman, J G; Seidman, Christine E; Noseda, Michela; Hubner, Norbert; Teichmann, Sarah A",Nature (Lond.),,165

519778,A rationale for targeting the P2X7 receptor in Coronavirus disease 19,2020,"Niclosamide (NIC) has demonstrated promising in vitro antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though NIC is already FDA-approved, administration of the currently available oral formulation results in systemic drug levels that are too low for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the co-formulation of NIC with an endogenous protein, human lysozyme (hLYS), could enable the direct aerosol delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract as an alternative to oral delivery, thereby effectively treating COVID-19 by targeting the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread. To test this hypothesis, we engineered and optimized composite particles containing NIC and hLYS suitable for delivery to the upper and lower airways via dry powder inhaler, nebulizer, and nasal spray. The novel formulation demonstrates potent in vitro and in vivo activity against two coronavirus strains, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and may offer protection against methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and inflammatory lung damage occurring secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The suitability of the formulation for all stages of the disease and low-cost development approach will ensure rapid clinical development and wide-spread utilization.","Brunaugh, Ashlee D; Seo, Hyojong; Warnken, Zachary; Ding, Li; Seo, Sang Heui; Smyth, Hugh D C",PLoS One,,165

But failures during the e-retailing process, specially when the business is under pressure, is a severe challenge with deteriorative impacts on customers' attitude and behavioral intention. While the majority of failures during e-retail process takes place at the ‘product delivery phase’ (the last phase of e-commerce process), little attention has been paid towards investigating how e-retailers can effectively recover from service failure encounters during the delivery phase. Seeking to address this gap, the present study draws on cognitive dissonance theory to examine the determinants of effective recovery from service failure encounters during the delivery phase of e-retailing. In doing so, a scenario-based experiment was conducted to collect data from 320 online customers. The findings provide empirical insights on how perceived recovery endeavor interacts with criticality of situation and brand equity to mitigate the negative consequences of service failure at delivery phase. The theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed along with avenues for future research.","Jafarzadeh, Hamed Tafti Mahdi Intezari Ali Sohrabi Babak",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,,165

The changing global environment may further increase the exposure to these toxins, posing a serious threat to humans and animals. Recently, coronavirus has become one of the most important pathogens threatening human and animal health. It is not clear whether environmental toxins, such as mycotoxins, will affect coronavirus infection. Given that pigs are among the animals most affected by coronavirus and highly homologous to humans, weaned piglets and IPEC-J2 cells were respectively chosen as in vivo and in vitro model to explore the impacts of deoxynivalenol (DON), the most abundant trichothecene mycotoxin in feed, on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 µg/kg DON, respectively. Significant increases in the diarrhea rates, gut barrier injury and PEDV proliferation of piglets' small intestine were observed in experimental groups compared with the control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like vesicles and the autophagy-related proteins expression were also increased in experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 µM DON significantly promoted the entry and replication of PEDV in IPEC-J2 cells, along with the induction of a complete autophagy. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy in the promotion. Pretreatment with p38 signaling inhibitor could significantly block the induction of autophagy, indicating that DON could promote the PEDV infection by triggering p38-mediated autophagy. Our findings suggest that mycotoxin could influence the prevalence of coronavirus and provide new ideas for the prevention and control of coronavirus.","Liu, Dandan; Ge, Lei; Wang, Qing; Su, Jiarui; Chen, Xingxiang; Wang, Chunfeng; Huang, Kehe",Environ Int,,165

Firstly, SWT is used to decompose the data into approximation and detail coefficients. After decomposition, data of Crude Oil price and stock market indexes along with COVID-19 confirmed cases were used as input variables for future price movement forecasting. As a result, the proposed system BDLSTM+WT-ADA achieved satisfactory results in terms of five-day Crude Oil price forecast.","vStifani'c, Daniel; Musulin, Jelena; Miovcevi'c, Adrijana; vSegota, Sandi Baressi; vSubi'c, Roman; Car, Zlatan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02673v1.pdf,165

For a subset of localities, the net effect on mortality is negative. However, for the average locality, the effect is positive and large, suggesting that the role of migrants as information providers is trumped by their role as virus carriers.

Drawing expectations from resilience theory, this paper explores how the trajectory of and research community around the coronavirus research was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Characterizing epistemic clusters and pathways of knowledge through extracting terms featured in articles in early COVID-19 research, combined with evolutionary pathways and statistical analysis, the results reveal that the pandemic disrupted existing lines of coronavirus research to a large degree. While some communities of coronavirus research are similar pre- and during COVID-19, topics themselves change significantly and there is less cohesion amongst early COVID-19 research compared to that before the pandemic. We find that some lines of research revert to basic research pursued almost a decade earlier, whilst others pursue brand new trajectories. The epidemiology topic is the most resilient among the many subjects related to COVID-19 research. Chinese researchers in particular appear to be driving more novel research approaches in the early months of the pandemic. The findings raise questions about whether shifts are advantageous for global scientific progress, and whether the research community will return to the original equilibrium or reorganize into a different knowledge configuration.","Zhang, Yi; Cai, Xiaojing; Fry, Caroline V.; Wu, Mengjia; Wagner, Caroline S.",Scientometrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-03946-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776163/,165

PURPOSE: To conduct meta-analysis of the study-level incidence of PE and DVT and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE from multicenter individual patient data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search identified studies evaluating the incidence of PE or DVT in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. These outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and were further evaluated using metaregression analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE was estimated on the basis of individual patient data using the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies with 3342 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The pooled incidence rates of PE and DVT were 16.5% (95% CI: 11.6, 22.9; I(2) = 0.93) and 14.8% (95% CI: 8.5, 24.5; I(2) = 0.94), respectively. PE was more frequently found in patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (24.7% [95% CI: 18.6, 32.1] vs 10.5% [95% CI: 5.1, 20.2] in those not admitted to the ICU) and in studies with universal screening using CT pulmonary angiography. DVT was present in 42.4% of patients with PE. D-dimer tests had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.737 for PE, and D-dimer levels of 500 and 1000 μg/L showed high sensitivity (96% and 91%, respectively) but low specificity (10% and 24%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 16.5% and 14.8% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively, and more than half of patients with PE lacked DVT. The cutoffs of D-dimer levels used to exclude PE in preexisting guidelines seem applicable to patients with COVID-19. © RSNA, 2020 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Methods We performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases. Definition of cardiac injury follows that of the included studies, which includes highly sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnl) >99th percentile.The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were ARDS, the need for ICU care, and severe COVID-19. ARDS and severe COVID-19 were defined per the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) of COVID-19. Results There were a total of 2389 patients from 13 studies. This meta-analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (RR 7.95 [5.12, 12.34], p < 0.001; I2: 65%). Cardiac injury was associated with higher need for ICU care (RR 7.94 [1.51, 41.78], p = 0.01; I2: 79%), and severe COVID-19 (RR 13.81 [5.52, 34.52], p < 0.001; I2: 0%). The cardiac injury was not significant for increased risk of ARDS (RR 2.57 [0.96, 6.85], p = 0.06; I2: 84%). The level of hs-cTnI was higher in patients with primary + secondary outcome (mean difference 10.38 pg/mL [4.44, 16.32], p = 0.002; I2: 0%).

To reduce carbon dioxide emissions, it is essential to recognize different emission sources and key driving factors. Three main carbon emission sources from the period between 1990 and 2017 were identified in China: the energy industry, fuel combustion in other industries, and industrial process.

599919,Combining initial chest CT with clinical variables in differentiating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from influenza pneumonia,2021-03-19,"Remote consultations are likely to grow in importance in the following years, especially if the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic continues. Patients’ opinions on teledermatology have already been analyzed, but a current analysis during the COVID‐19 pandemic is lacking. The purpose of this survey was to investigate the satisfaction of patients who had received dermatological advice via telephone during the COVID‐19 pandemic and to analyze their general opinion about eHealth as well as possible limitations for a broad implementation. Ninety‐one patients managed in the dermatology department using telephone consultation during the COVID‐19 pandemic were interviewed. An anonymous questionnaire, including the established quality of life questionnaire (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]), was used. It was found that men were more satisfied with telephone consultations than women (p = 0.029), educational level and age did not correlate with satisfaction (p = 0.186 and 388, respectively), and the longer the waiting time for a telephone consultation, the lower the satisfaction (p = 0.001). Grouped analysis of all participants showed that the majority (54.0% n = 38/71) were “very happy” with the telephone consultation. Higher disease burden (DLQI) was associated with lower satisfaction (p = 0.042). The main stated reasons for using telemedicine were shorter waiting times (51.6% n = 47/91) and no travel requirement (57.1% n = 47/91). Almost one‐quarter (23.1% n = 21/89) of patients would use teledermatology in the future, 17.6% (n = 16/89) would not, and 57.1% (n = 51/89) would only use it in addition to a traditional consultation with personal contact. In conclusion, most patients in the study group still preferred traditional face‐to‐face medical consultations to telephone consultations, but also desired an add‐on telemedical tool. Dermatological care using more modern telemedicine technologies than telephone conferencing is needed to better address patients’ desires, especially in times of the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Stadler, Pia‐Charlotte; Senner, Sonja; Frey, Surina; Clanner‐Engelshofen, Benjamin M.; H.

599996,POS-524 MORTALITY AMONG NEW HAEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Given the magnitude and speed of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, achieving timely and effective manual contact tracing has been a challenging task. Early in the pandemic, contact tracing apps generated substantial enthusiasm due to their potential for automating tracing and reducing transmission rates while enabling targeted confinement strategies. However, although surveys demonstrate public interest in using such apps, their actual uptake remains limited. Their social acceptability is challenged by issues around privacy, fairness, and effectiveness, among other concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the extent to which design and implementation considerations for contact tracing apps are detailed in the available literature, focusing on aspects related to participatory and responsible eHealth innovation, and synthesize recommendations that support the development of successful COVID-19 contact tracing apps and related eHealth technologies. METHODS: Searches were performed on five databases, and articles were selected based on eligibility criteria. Papers pertaining to the design, implementation, or acceptability of contact tracing apps were included. Articles published since 2019, written in English or French, and for which the full articles were available were considered eligible for analysis. To assess the scope of the knowledge found in the current literature, we used three complementary frameworks: (1) the Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies, (2) the Montreal model, and (3) the Responsible Innovation in Health Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 63 articles qualified for the final analysis. Less than half of the selected articles cited the need for a participatory process (n=25, 40%), which nonetheless was the most frequently referenced item of the Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies. Regarding the Montreal model, stakeholder consultation was the most frequently described level of engagement in the development of contact tracing apps (n=24, 38%), while collaboration and partnership were cited the least (n=2, 3%). As for the Responsible Innovation in Health framework, all the articles (n=63, 100%) addressed population health, whereas only 2% (n=1) covered environmental considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies lacked fundamental aspects of eHealth development and implementation. Our results demonstrate that stakeholders of COVID-19 contact tracing apps lack important information to be able to critically appraise this eHealth innovation. This may have contributed to the modest uptake of contact tracing apps worldwide. We make evidence-informed recommendations regarding data management, communication, stakeholder engagement, user experience, and implementation strategies for the successful and responsible development of contact tracing apps.","Osmanlliu, Esli; Rafie, Edmond; Bédard, Sylvain; Paquette, Jesseca; Gore, Genevieve; Pomey, Marie-Pascale",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038376/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27102,165
600358,CARDIAC MARKERS AS EVIDENCE OF CARDIAC INJURY IN THE SETTING OF MULTI-SYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME IN CHILDREN ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19,2021-05-11,"Background Between 25%-50% of patients hospitalized with (COVID-19) suffer cardiovascular events. Limited information is available to identify those at greatest risk for cardiac complications. Objectives Objectives were to analyze risk factors associated with cardiovascular events (CE); analyze whether risk factors and outcomes were influenced by race; and analyze survival differences among various groups. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 700 inpatients with COVID-19 was conducted at nine hospitals within a large urban midwestern city. Data was collected from March 9, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria included all COVID-19 inpatients and excluded non-inpatients. Predictor variables included demographics, comorbidities, and current clinical data. The outcomes were heart failure (HF), deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlation between different variables. Multiple logistics regression analyses were conducted to examine which variables predict cardiovascular events for the entire cohort, African American patients, and white patients, respectively. Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine differences in groups with and without CE and Kaplan-Meier was conducted for survival comparisons between groups. Results Of 700 COVID-19 positive inpatients, 126 experienced cardiovascular events and 574 did not. The incidence of cardiovascular events in our sample population was 18%. As shown in Table 1, we found the following factors were highly associated with the odds of new-onset of CEs: advanced age in years, males, non-Hispanic African American, presence of comorbidities, and decreased saturation levels. Numerous laboratory values were significantly associated with the risk of CEs (Table 1). African Americans had greater odds of CEs in the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities (p=0.008, p=0.014, respectively). However, multiple logistics analysis was used to examine the joint effect of the risk factors which suggested that lower serum albumin and neoplastic/immune compromised diseases count were highly associated with CEs for African American COVID-19 inpatients (p=0.001, p=0.044, respectively). SaO2/FiO2 ratio and cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly associated with CEs for white inpatients (p=<0.001, p=0.007, respectively). As shown in Figure 1, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed inpatients with CEs had a much higher mortality rate than those without CEs (45.2% vs. 8.7%). Median survival for patients with CEs was 18 days as opposed to 100 days for those that did not experience CEs. African Americans with CEs experienced higher mortality than those without CEs (43.9% vs. 7.8%). White COVID-19 inpatients' mortality rates were 46.3% and 9.0% for those with and without CEs, respectively. Of the 126 COVID-19 inpatients who had a CE, 14.3% had cardiac arrhythmias and 8.7% had new onset of HF diagnoses, and 4.8% had acute myocardial infarctions. Conclusion Multiple risk factors for CEs and death were identified in this sample of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and mortality was increased significantly in those inpatients who had CEs. HF, cardiac arrhythmia, and acute myocardial infarction were the most frequently cited CEs implicating the need for long-term follow-up.","Roser, Lynn; Huang, Jiapeng; Kong, Maiying; McGuffin, Trevor; Nathala, Pavani; Salunkhe, Vidyulata; Samanapelly, Harideep; Xu, Qian",Heart & Lung,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956321001266; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956321001266,165
600791,Human beta-defensins 2 and 4 are dysregulated in patients with coronavirus disease 19,2021-09-20,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 as an emerging novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had progressed as a worldwide pandemic since the end of 2019. COVID-19 affects firstly lungs tissues which are known for their very slow regeneration. Afterwards, enormous cytokine stimulation occurs in the infected cells immediately after a lung infection which necessitates good management to save patients. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles of nanometric size released by reticulocytes on maturation and are known to mediate intercellular communications. The exosomal cargo serves as biomarkers in diagnosing various diseases; moreover, exosomes could be employed as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems. Exosomes look promising to combat the current pandemic since they contribute to the immune response against several viral pathogens. Many studies have proved the potential of using exosomes either as viral elements or host systems that acquire immune-stimulatory effects and could be used as a vaccine or drug delivery tool. It is essential to stop viral replication, prevent and reverse the massive storm of cytokine that worsens the infected patients’ situations for the management of COVID-19. The main benefits of exosomes could be; no cells will be introduced, no chance of mutation, lack of immunogenicity and the damaged genetic material that could negatively affect the recipient is avoided. Additionally, it was found that exosomes are static with no ability for in vivo reproduction. The current review article discusses the possibilities of using exosomes for detecting novel coronavirus and summarizes state of the art concerning the clinical trials initiated for examining the use of COVID-19 specific T cells derived exosomes and mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes in managing COVID-19.","Dubey, Akhilesh; Lobo, Cynthia Lizzie; GS, Ravi; Shetty, Amitha; Hebbar, Srinivas; El-Zahaby, Sally A.",Asian J Pharm Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1818087621000738?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630723/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1818087621000738; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajps.2021.08.004,165

The capacity of enveloped viruses to infect host cells depends on a precise thiol/disulfide balance in their surface glycoprotein complexes. To determine if cystines in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein maintain a native binding interface that can be disrupted by drugs that cleave cystines, we tested if thiol-based drugs have efficacy in receptor binding and cell infection assays. We found that thiol-based drugs, cysteamine and WR-1065 (the active metabolite of amifostine) in particular, decrease binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to its receptor, decrease the entry efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus, and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 live virus infection. Our findings uncover a vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to thiol-based drugs and provide rationale to test thiol-based drugs, especially cysteamine and amifostine, as novel treatments for COVID-19.","Khanna, Kritika; Raymond, Wilfred; Charbit, Annabelle R.; Jin, Jing; Gitlin, Irina; Tang, Monica; Sperber, Hannah S.; Franz, Sergej; Pillai, Satish; Simmons, Graham; Fahy, John V.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330868/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.415505,165

The collected data were analyzed on the basis of situational analysis. RESULTS: The article examines the policy success by showing how this policy was assembled and by exposing the frictions and adjustments during its formation and implementation. Inter-departmental conflicts within or without the government and the efforts to coordinate them are addressed, and the transnational dimensions of this harm reduction policy are also discussed. The article then reflects on the effects of the policy and asks where the line should be drawn between what is harm reduction and what is not.

The Coronavirus disease pandemic has had an effect on the mental health of health care workers. Health care workers are facing challenges that can be stressful, overwhelming, and cause strong emotions, may put them at higher risk to develop depression. There is limited evidence that assesses health care workers' depression and its associated factors in the study area during the Coronavirus disease pandemic. Therefore this study aimed to assess depression and associated factors among health care workers in eastern Ethiopia. Method: The cross-sectional study design was conducted from October 26th to November 15, 2020. A total of 265 health care workers from 10 health facilities participated. Patient Health Questionnaire was used for the collection of depressive symptoms. The data were analyzed by using STATA version 14 software. To assess the association between depression and the predictors Adjusted Odds Ratio along with a 95% confidence interval was estimated by using logistic regression analysis. A statistical significance was declared at p-value ≤ 0.05. Results: Of the total 265 study participant, 176 (66.4%) and 95% CI: 60.4%, 71.8% of them reported depressive symptoms. Of 176 reported symptoms of depression 27.9, 24.1, 9.4, 3.7, and 1.1% were had minimal, mild, moderate, moderate-severe, and severe depressive symptoms respectively. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the odds of depression were 2.34 times higher among female participants compared to male participants (AOR: 2.34, 95%CI: 1.09-5.02).

The classification of angina is rather arbitrary, as angina presents various clinical aspects. Conversely, the same clinical aspects can also be due to different infectious agents. Clinical examination will define some aspects follows: erythematous angina of the oropharynx or erthematopultaceous tonsillitis, pseudomembranous, ulcerous and ulcero-necrotic or vesiculose angina. The etiology of angina is only partially understood and only very few studies have been reported. Viruses make up the main etiology. Group A streptococci is the main cause of angina. Group A streptococcus, particularly in children, is considered as a predominant factor, with a peak occuring between 5 and 10 years of age, while 30 % to 50 % of angina infections appear to be of viral origin in adults.

RESULTS: At >14 days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from 6 patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike protein antibodies appearing between days 8 and 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, compared with immunocompetent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples with a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Burbelo, Peter D; Riedo, Francis X; Morishima, Chihiro; Rawlings, Stephen; Smith, Davey; Das, Sanchita; Strich, Jeffrey R; Chertow, Daniel S; Davey, Richard T; Cohen, Jeffrey I",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427334/,165

615938,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant interferon-armed RBD dimer vaccine (V-01) for COVID-19 in healthy adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase I trial",2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND: Orthorexia nervosa (OrNe) is a pattern of disordered eating behavior characterized by excessive preoccupation with overvalued ideas about healthy eating. Healthy orthorexia (HeOr) refers to a non-pathological interest in healthy eating and nutrition. Despite converging evidence that OrNe is correlated with measures of psychopathology and personality traits, there is relatively little empirical data relating OrNe and HeOr to eating and health-promoting behavior. METHODS: Aim 1: exploratory structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the factor structure of an English-language version of the Teruel Orthorexia Scale, the only measure of OrNe that also assesses HeOr in two samples (Yoga practitioners, N = 469, and Mechanical Turk workers, N = 453). Aim 2: conducted in the Mechanical Turk sample, partial correlation and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationships of OrNe and HeOr with other symptoms of, and clinical impairment from, disordered eating, food choices, diet quality, body mass index (BMI), nutrition knowledge, alcohol/tobacco/vaping use, and sedentary behavior. RESULTS: The two-factor structure of the TOS was replicated. HeOr and OrNe had opposing relationships with measures of disordered eating behavior and distress, food choices, diet quality, and nutrition knowledge. HeOr was negatively related to BMI, whereas OrNe was positively related to substance use and sedentary behavior. CONCLUSIONS: OrNe and HeOr are distinct latent constructs, with the latter reflecting non-pathological behavior. Only OrNe is related to elevated disordered eating and clinical impairment. Despite involving obsessions and compulsions related to healthy eating, OrNe was associated with relatively unhealthy eating and other lifestyle behaviors.

Current models suggest that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will have a similar incidence but substantially lower mortality rate than high-income countries. However, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are prevalent in LMICs, and coinfections are likely. Both malaria and parasitic NTDs can alter immunologic responses to other infectious agents. Malaria can induce a cytokine storm and pro-coagulant state similar to that seen in severe COVID-19. Consequently, coinfections with malaria parasites and SARS-CoV-2 could result in substantially worse outcomes than mono-infections with either pathogen, and could shift the age pattern of severe COVID-19 to younger age-groups. Enhancing surveillance platforms could provide signals that indicate whether malaria, NTDs, and COVID-19 are syndemics (synergistic epidemics). Based on the prevalence of malaria and NTDs in specific localities, efforts to characterize COVID-19 in LMICs could be expanded by adding testing for malaria and NTDs. Such additional testing would allow the determination of the rates of coinfection and comparison of severity of outcomes by infection status, greatly improving the understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19 in LMICs and potentially helping to mitigate its impact.","Gutman, Julie R.; Lucchi, Naomi W.; Cantey, Paul T.; Steinhardt, Laura C.; Samuels, Aaron M.; Kamb, Mary L.; Kapella, Bryan K.; McElroy, Peter D.; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam; Lindblade, Kim A.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32484155/,165

The present study investigated the genetic and biological specifications of new isolates of torque teno mini virus (TTMV) detected in pleural effusion samples from children hospitalised for severe pneumonia with PPE. A pathogen discovery protocol was applied in undiagnosed pleural effusion samples and led to the identification of three new isolates of TTMV (TTMV-LY). Isolated TTMV-LY genomes were transfected into A549 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells and viral replication was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and full-length genome amplification. A549 cells were further infected with released TTMV-LY virions and the induced-innate immune response was measured by multiplex immunoassays. Genetic analyses of the three TTMV-LY genomes revealed a classic genomic organisation but a weak identity (<64%) with known sequences. We demonstrated the in vitro replication of TTMV-LY in alveolar epithelial cells and the effective release of infectious viral particles. We also showed a selective production of inflammatory mediators in response to TTMV infection. This study reports the description of replicative TTMV-LY isolated from parapneumonic effusions of children hospitalised with PPE, suggesting a potential role of the virus in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.","Galmès, Johanna; Li, Yongjun; Rajoharison, Alain; Ren, Lili; Dollet, Sandra; Richard, Nathalie; Vernet, Guy; Javouhey, Etienne; Wang, Jianwei; Telles, Jean-Noël; Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia",Eur Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060626/; https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00107212,165

A 36-year-old male patient was admitted with chronic limb threatening ischemia of the left lower limb. The duplex ultrasound and computer tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a fusiform popliteal artery aneurism with a maximal diameter of 14 mm and distal occlusion of peroneal and both tibial arteries. Urgent hybrid intervention was performed, starting with an open thrombectomy from the distal posterior tibial artery via a retromalleolar access followed by percutaneous deployment of the DLM Roadsaver® stent (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) for the exclusion of the popliteal artery aneurism. The flow diverting effect was observed immediately with contrast stagnation in the asymmetrical part of the aneurism sac (grade C2 of the O'Kelly-Marotta flow diversion scale). The procedure was uneventful, with the regaining of an adequate foot perfusion and palpable pulse at the posterior tibial artery. On the 2(nd) postoperative day, the patient was diagnosed with a symptomatic form of COVID-19 infection and transferred to a dedicated facility. At a one-month follow-up, the patient had no symptoms of limb ischemia and CTA showed complete thrombosis of the aneurism sac, absence of endoleaks, and patency of the treated arterial segment.

This study aimed to assess dental professionals’ knowledge, preventive awareness, and attitude towards dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. STUDY SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study participants consisted of dental professionals working in government, private and academic sectors in Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire (Whatsapp and Twitter) was sent to dental professionals in July 2020. The questionnaire consisted of questions on dental professional’s demographic variables, their knowledge of the incubation period, the symptoms, mode of transmission, preventive awareness of COVID-19, and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis tests were applied to compare mean ranks and a p<0.05 is considered statistically significant. RESULTS: This study included a total of 356 dental professionals (dentists and dental students) aged 22–60 years (mean±SD, 32.14±7.48 years).

Here, we describe a meta-analysis of two independent RNA-seq studies to identify lncRNAs that are differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection. Only three lncRNA genes exhibited altered expression of ≥ 2-fold in HIV-1-infected cells. Of these, the uncharacterized lncRNA LINC00173 was chosen for further study. Both transcript variants of LINC00173 (lnc173 TSV1 and 2) could be detected by qPCR, localized predominantly to the nucleus and were reproducibly up-regulated during infection. Knock-out of the LINC00173 locus did not have detectable effects on HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, however, stimulation of Jurkat T cells with PMA/ionomycin resulted in a decrease of lnc173 expression, and Jurkat cells deficient for lnc173 on average expressed higher levels of specific cytokines than control cells. These data suggest that lnc173 may have a role in the regulation of cytokines in T cells.","Postler, Thomas S.; Pantry, Shara N.; Desrosiers, Ronald C.; Ghosh, Sankar",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221730260X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28803142/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221730260X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.08.006,165

In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing. METHODS SARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing. RESULTS Over the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School-B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1200 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63(91%) were not associated with school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-Thanksgiving. In 6/7 clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28 identified cases and was traced to an off-campus party. There was no transmission from students to staff. CONCLUSIONS Although school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID-19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to re-opening.","Gillespie, D.

Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis Medline, Embase and the Cochrane library were searched up to 1 August 2020. Pooled prevalence of participant characteristics, clinical features and outcome data were calculated using random effects models. Subgroup analyses were based on geographical distribution, study type, quality assessment, sample size, end date and patient disposition Results Forty-five studies with 16561 patients from 17 countries across four continents were included. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU had a mean age of 62·6 years (95%CI 60.4-64·7). Common comorbidities included hypertension (49·5% (44·9-54·0)) and diabetes (26·6% (22·7-30·8)).

Preferences for art forms may play an important role in engagement with treatment. This survey was an initial exploration of who is interested in group arts therapies, what they would choose and why. DESIGN: An online cross-sectional survey of demographics, interest in and preferences for the arts therapies was designed in collaboration with patients. The survey took 10 min to complete, including informed consent and 14 main questions. Summary statistics, multinomial logistic regression and thematic analysis were used to analyse the data. SETTING: Thirteen National Health Service mental health trusts in the UK asked mental health patients and members of the general population to participate. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1541 participants completed the survey; 685 mental health patients and 856 members of the general population. All participants were over 18 years old, had capacity to give informed consent and sufficient understanding of English. Mental health patients had to be using secondary mental health services. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of participants would be interested in taking part in group arts therapies. Music therapy was the most frequent choice among mental health patients (41%) and art therapy was the most frequent choice in the general population (43%). Past experience of arts therapies was the most important predictor of preference for that same modality. Expectations of enjoyment, helpfulness, feeling capable, impact on mood and social interaction were most often reported as reasons for preferring one form of arts therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Large proportions of the participants expressed an interest in group arts therapies. This may justify the wide provision of arts therapies and the offer of more than one modality to interested patients. It also highlights key considerations for assessment of preferences in the arts therapies as part of shared decision-making.","Millard, Emma; Medlicott, Emma; Cardona, Jessica; Priebe, Stefan; Carr, Catherine",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373313/,165
629629,Epicardial adipose tissue and severe Coronavirus Disease 19,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: With the use of electronic health records (EHRs) increasing and causing unintended negative consequences, the medical scribe profession has burgeoned, but it has yet to be regulated. The purpose of this study was to describe scribe workflow as well as identify the threats and opportunities for the future of the scribe industry. METHODS: The first phase of the study used ethnographic methods consisting of interviews and observations by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers at five United States sites. In April 2019, a two-day conference of experts representing different stakeholder perspectives was held to discuss the results from site visits and to predict the future of medical scribing. An interpretive content analysis approach was used to discover threats and opportunities for the future of medical scribes. RESULTS: Threats facing the medical scribe industry were related to changes in the documentation model, EHR usability, different payment structures, the need to acquire disparate data during clinical encounters, and workforce-related changes relevant to the scribing model. Simultaneously, opportunities for medical scribing in the future included extension of their role to include workflow analysis, acting as EHR-related subject-matter-experts, and becoming integrated more effectively into the clinical care delivery team. Experts thought that if EHR usability increases, the need for medical scribes might decrease. Additionally, the scribe role could be expanded to allow scribes to document more or take on more informatics-related tasks. The experts also anticipated an increased use of alternative models of scribing, like tele-scribing. CONCLUSION: Threats and opportunities for medical scribing were identified. Many experts thought that if the scribe role could be expanded to allow scribes to document more or take on more informatics activities, it would be beneficial. With COVID-19 continuing to change workflows, it is critical that medical scribes receive standardized training as tele-scribing continues to grow in popularity and new roles for scribes as medical team members are identified.","Corby, Sky; Whittaker, Keaton; Ash, Joan S.; Mohan, Vishnu; Becton, James; Solberg, Nicholas; Bergstrom, Robby; Orwoll, Benjamin; Hoekstra, Christopher; Gold, Jeffrey A.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34187457/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01560-4,165

In these molecules, the protein-coding sequences of a major late structural polypeptide are preceded by long leader RNAs, which in some cases are thousands of nucleotides long. These sequences map to different regions of the viral genome and in one instance are separated from the late gene by more than 100 kb of DNA. Moreover, the leader sequences map either upstream or downstream of the late gene, are transcribed from either DNA strand, and are fused to the late gene coding sequence via a poly(A) stretch. This demonstrates that vaccinia virus produces late mRNAs by tagging the protein-coding sequences onto the 3′ end of other RNAs.","Bertholet, Christine; Van Meir, Erwin; ten Heggeler-Bordier, Béatrice; Wittek, Riccardo",Cell,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286748790211X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/009286748790211X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3036368/,165
636110,Adult patients with congenital heart disease during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemics,2020-07-11,"Objective: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with a large variety of neurological disorders. However the mechanisms underlying these neurological complications remain elusive. In this study we aimed at determining whether neurological symptoms were caused by SARS-CoV-2 direct infection of by pro-inflammatory mediators. Methods: We checked for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and for 48 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (by Luminex) in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) +/- sera of a cohort of 17 COVID-19 patients with neurological presentation and 55 neurological control patients (inflammatory [IND], non inflammatory [NIND], multiple sclerosis [MS]). Results: We found SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies specific for this virus in the CSF of 0/17 and 8/16 COVID-19 patients, respectively. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was explained by a rupture of the blood brain barrier (passive transfer) in 6/16 (38%). An intrathecal synthesis of SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies was present in 2/16 patients. Of the four categories of tested patients, the CSF of IND exhibited the highest level of chemokines (CCL4, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL12, and CXCL13), followed by the CSF of MS patients (CXCL12, and CXCL13). There was no significant difference between COVID-19 and NIND patients, even if some chemokines (CCL4, CCL5, CXCL8, andCXCL10) tended to be higher in the former. Interestingly, among COVD-19 patients, the CSF of those with a severe disease (encephalitis/encephalopathy) contained higher levels CXCL8 and CXCL10 than those with other neurological presentations. Interpretation: Our results do not show obvious SARS-CoV-2 infection of the central nervous system, but point to a mild inflammatory reaction reflecting an astrocytic reaction.

637924,A multicenter analysis of the clinical microbiology and antimicrobial usage in hospitalized patients in the US with or without COVID-19,2021-02-27,"Background Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is needed to document the community prevalence and distribution of the virus, particularly since many individuals have mild symptoms and cannot access molecular diagnostic testing of naso-pharyngeal swabs. However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected from a simple finger prick and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). Methods Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was optimized to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. DBS samples were eluted overnight and transferred to a 96-well plate coated with antigen, and anti-human IgG-HRP was used to generate signal in proportion to bound antibody. DBS samples spiked with anti-SARS IgG antibody, and samples from known positive and negative cases, were compared to evaluate assay performance. Results Analysis of samples with known concentrations of anti-SARS IgG produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Optical density (OD) values were significantly elevated for known positive cases in comparison with samples from unexposed individuals. Discussion DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection that combines the convenience of sample collection in the home or non-clinical setting with the accuracy of ELISA in the lab. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples should facilitate research across a wide range of community- and population-based settings on seroprevalence, predictors and duration of antibody responses, as well as correlates of protection from reinfection, each of which is critically important for pandemic control.","McDade, T.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has pushed countries’ health systems to the limit and had previously unknown consequences on the job performance of health professionals. In this context, what are the determinants of performance? There are numerous studies that link job performance with other variables that directly affect it, such as leadership, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work environment. However, there are no studies that jointly relate all these variables, and even less in the field of health. The main objective of this work is to analyse how these variables are configured together to generate a good level of performance of health professionals during the times of COVID-19. To do this, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is carried out, an appropriate method that will allow finding the joint causal effects of key variables in human resources to ensure a good level of job performance in health organizations. The study reveals that leadership and commitment are the two key drivers of performance. The data confirm that the “recipe” to achieve a good level of performance consists of the combination of leadership, commitment, and a good work environment. Additionally, in the case of less satisfied workers, linking leadership and commitment is a sufficient condition.","Yáñez-Araque, Benito; Gómez-Cantarino, Sagrario; Gutiérrez-Broncano, Santiago; López-Ruiz, Víctor-Raúl",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070684/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115671,165

Currently, detection of the RNA from the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 is the gold standard for establishing a COVID‐19 diagnosis. This study evaluates the characteristic performance of the analytical system in a clinical laboratory. METHODS: A commercial SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA RT‐PCR Kit used in a clinical laboratory is assessed based on ISO 15189 verification requirements. A multiple real‐time RT‐PCR assay for the RdRP, N, and E genes in SARS‐CoV‐2 is verified. RESULTS: The analytical system exhibits good analytical sensitivity (1000 copies/mL) and specificity (100%); however, the values of 86.7% and 100% for analytical accuracy deserved attention, compared with two other types of methods. Overall, the kit is potentially useful for SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnostic testing and meets the verification requirements. CONCLUSION: Compliance with international standards, such as ISO 15189, is valuable for clinical laboratories and for improving laboratory medicine quality and safety. Normalization is essential for obtaining reliable results from the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA RT‐PCR assay. This study aims to develop an improved SARS‐CoV‐2 verification framework compared with traditional molecular diagnostic methods, given the urgency of implementing new assays in clinical laboratories.","Wu, Yingping; Xu, Wei; Zhu, Zhiqiang; Xia, Xiaoping",J Clin Lab Anal,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754967/,165

The segment 7 (S7) encodes 50kDa protein which is considered as a structural protein. The expression pattern and function of p50 in the virus life cycle are still unclear. In this study, the viral structural protein 7 (VP7) polyclonal antibody was prepared with immunized mouse to explore the presence of small VP7 gene-encoded proteins in Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus. The expression pattern of vp7 gene was investigated by its overexpression in BmN cells. In addition to VP7, supplementary band was identified with western blotting technique. The virion, BmCPV infected cells and midguts were also examined using western blotting technique. 4, 2 and 5 bands were detected in the corresponding samples, respectively. The replication of BmCPV genome in the cultured cells and midgut of silkworm was decreased by reducing the expression level of vp7 gene using RNA interference. In immunoprecipitation experiments, using a polyclonal antiserum directed against the VP7, one additional shorter band in BmCPV infected midguts was detected, and then the band was analyzed with mass spectrum (MS), the MS results showed thatone candidate interacted protein (VP7 voltage-dependent anion-selective channel-like isoform, VDAC) was identified from silkworm. We concluded that the novel viral product was generated with a leaky scanning mechanism and the VDAC may be an interacted protein with VP7.","He, Lei; Hu, Xiaolong; Zhu, Min; Liang, Zi; Chen, Fei; Zhu, Liyuan; Kuang, Sulan; Cao, Guangli; Xue, Renyu; Gong, Chengliang",Gene,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111917304985; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.06.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28668346/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111917304985,165
640841,Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers: An Audit Study,2020-11-04,"BACKGROUND: With ever increasing numbers of closely related virus genomes being sequenced, it has become desirable to be able to compare two genomes at a level more detailed than gene content because two strains of an organism may share the same set of predicted genes but still differ in their pathogenicity profiles. For example, detailed comparison of multiple isolates of the smallpox virus genome (each approximately 200 kb, with 200 genes) is not feasible without new bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: A software package, Base-By-Base, has been developed that provides visualization tools to enable researchers to 1) rapidly identify and correct alignment errors in large, multiple genome alignments; and 2) generate tabular and graphical output of differences between the genomes at the nucleotide level. Base-By-Base uses detailed annotation information about the aligned genomes and can list each predicted gene with nucleotide differences, display whether variations occur within promoter regions or coding regions and whether these changes result in amino acid substitutions. Base-By-Base can connect to our mySQL database (Virus Orthologous Clusters; VOCs) to retrieve detailed annotation information about the aligned genomes or use information from text files. CONCLUSION: Base-By-Base enables users to quickly and easily compare large viral genomes; it highlights small differences that may be responsible for important phenotypic differences such as virulence. It is available via the Internet using Java Web Start and runs on Macintosh, PC and Linux operating systems with the Java 1.4 virtual machine.","Brodie, Ryan; Smith, Alex J; Roper, Rachel L; Tcherepanov, Vasily; Upton, Chris",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15253776/,165

Investigating the determinants of adherence to social distancing can inform public health strategies to improve the behaviour. However, there is a lack of data in various populations. This study investigates the degree to which South Africans complied with social distancing during the country's COVID-19 lockdown and identifies the determinants associated with being in close contact with large numbers of people. Materials and Methods: Data was collected from a South African national online survey on a data free platform, supplemented with telephone interviews. The survey was conducted from 8 to 29 April 2020. The primary outcome was the number of people that participants came into close contact with (within a 2-metre distance) the last time they were outside their home during the COVID-19 lockdown. Multivariate multinomial regression investigated the socio-demographic, psychosocial and household environmental determinants associated with being in contact with 1–10, 11–50 and more than 50 people. Results: Of the 17,563 adult participants, 20.3% reported having not left home, 50.6% were in close physical distance with 1–10 people, 21.1% with 11–50 people, and 8.0% with >50 people. Larger household size and incorrect knowledge about the importance of social distancing were associated with being in contact with >50 people. Male gender, younger age and being in the White and Coloured population groups were significantly associated with being in contact with 1–10 people but not with larger numbers of people. Employment, at least secondary school education, lack of self-efficacy in being able to protect oneself from infection, and moderate or high risk perception of becoming infected, were all associated with increased odds of close contact with 1–10, 11–50, and >50 people relative to remaining at home. Conclusion: The findings identify subgroups of individuals that are less likely to comply with social distancing regulations. Public health communication, interventions and policy can be tailored to address these determinants of social distancing.","Sewpaul, Ronel; Mabaso, Musawenkosi; Dukhi, Natisha; Naidoo, Inbarani; Vondo, Noloyiso; Davids, Adlai Steven; Mokhele, Tholang; Reddy, Sasiragha Priscilla",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.632619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109143/,165

Recently, the role of platelet activating factor (PAF) was suggested in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In the present review several micronutrients (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals), phytochemicals and Mediterranean diet compounds with potential anti-COVID activity are presented. We further underline that the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions of the investigated nutrients and/or holistic dietary schemes, such as the Mediterranean diet, are also mediated through PAF. In conclusion, there is no single food to prevent coronavirus Although the relationship between PAF and COVID-19 is not robust, a healthy diet containing PAF inhibitors may target both inflammation and thrombosis and prevent the deleterious effects of COVID-19.

However, specialty medications pose unique barriers to adherence. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether pharmacist interventions improve specialty medication adherence. METHODS: This is a single-center, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial ongoing since 10 May 2019 at an integrated health system specialty pharmacy. This study evaluates usual care compared with usual care plus patient-tailored adherence interventions. Study design and procedures were informed by focus groups with patients and specialty pharmacists. Patients at Vanderbilt Specialty Pharmacy with a proportion of days covered (PDC) < 90% in the previous 4 months are identified by a daily query of the electronic pharmacy database. A pharmacist reviews these patients’ electronic health records to identify and exclude ineligible patients. Eligible patients are randomized evenly to the control or intervention arm and stratified by historical clinic nonadherence rates. Patients randomized to the intervention arm undergo a baseline assessment to clarify reasons for nonadherence and subsequently receive patient-tailored interventions based on their specific reasons. Interventions and follow-up are provided at the discretion of the intervening pharmacist. The primary outcome is PDC calculated at 8 months post-enrollment. Enrollment of 438 participants will provide 90% power to detect a 5% difference in PDC between the two arms within each nonadherence risk stratum. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effect of patient-tailored interventions on specialty medication adherence and will inform how often and why patients are misidentified as nonadherent.

648523,Effects of coronavirus disease 2019 on the digestive system and its nutritional implications,2021,"Coronavirus pandemics have become a huge threat to the public health worldwide in the recent decades. Typically, SARS-CoV caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic recently. Both viruses have been reported to originate from bats. Thus, direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies transmission. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS-CoV-2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS-CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, pangolin CoV, another SARS-related coronavirus highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile with SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. To clarify the mechanism underlying the receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N-terminal 20th and 42nd amino acids that may determine the different receptor utilization of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV. Our studies promote the understanding of receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses, potentially contributing to the virus tracing, intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic coronaviruses.","Qiu, Ye; Wang, Qiong; Li, Jin-Yan; Liao, Ce-Heng; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Ge, Xing-Yi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.13.149930,165

To the best of our knowledge, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to the emergency hernia surgery operative workload and postoperative outcomes remains largely unknown. Methods Retrospective research of admission, operation and inpatient records of all patients who underwent emergency surgery over a 2-year period (2019-2020) was done. Results An 18% increase in terms of emergency hernia surgery operating volume, with a 23% increase of visceral resections due to unsalvageable herniated content strangulation was found. Overall morbidity did not increase during the pandemic period and there was no postoperative mortality or occurrence of COVID-19 related complications.

We used longitudinal data from Hiroshima University to investigate loneliness before and during the pandemic among older and younger people in Japan. We provide evidence that loneliness among both older and younger people increased considerably during the pandemic. Although loneliness among younger people is more pervasive, the magnitude of increase in loneliness during the pandemic is higher among older people. Our logit regression analysis shows that age, subjective health status, and feelings of depression are strongly associated with loneliness before and during the pandemic. Moreover, household income and financial satisfaction are associated with loneliness among older people during the pandemic while gender, marital status, living condition, and depression are associated with loneliness among younger people during the pandemic. The evidence of increasing loneliness during the pandemic is concerning for a traditionally well-connected and culturally collectivist society such as Japan. As loneliness has a proven connection with both physical and mental health, we suggest immediate policy interventions to provide mental health support for lonely people so they feel more cared for, secure, and socially connected.","Khan, Mostafa Saidur Rahim; Kadoya, Yoshihiko",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360164/,165
650745,Evaluating resident involvement and the 'July effect' in parotidectomy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus disease appeared at the end of 2019, and it is now a global problem over the world. There are multiple epidemiologic indicators used for discussing the spread of pandemics, one of these indicators is the basic reproductive ratio which indicates whether the pandemic is going to spread more or relax, and the aim of this work is estimating this ratio for the Middle East countries for two stages of the pandemic. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: We employ Runge–Kutta method on SEIR model to simulate the basic reproductive ratio values of SARS-CoV-2 disease by using the recorded data of the disease for two stages, up to date May 29, 2020, in the first stage and up to date September 7, 2020, in the second stage. We estimate the coefficient of exposing rate, the coefficient of infection rate, the coefficient of recovery rate and the coefficient of mortality rate of the new coronavirus disease in addition to the basic reproductive ratio values of the disease in the Middle East countries, namely Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Yemen where we apply the SEIR epidemic model. SHORT CONCLUSION: We find that the values of the basic reproductive ratio of the new coronavirus disease based on the used model in the Middle East countries start from 1.5583 to 3.0395 in the first stage and from 1.0001 to 4.5757. Besides, we find that the problem of the new coronavirus disease in Lebanon and in the Syrian Arab Republic is not good at all in the recent stage based on the values of the basic reproductive ratio comparing with other Middle East countries. Also, we find that the value of the basic reproductive ratio for the second stage is near one; however, if we apply the method for the following stages, we find that the values return to be larger because lots of people in that stage and after did not follow the governmental procedures for stopping the spreading of the disease.","Al-Raeei, Marwan",Bull Natl Res Cent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149279/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-021-00572-4,165

This study aims to perform the meta-analysis of risk factors for the exacerbation of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). PubMed, Embase and Google scholar have been searched. We included the cohort studies involving risk factors for the exacerbation of NCIP. This meta-analysis compared the risk factors of patients between intensive care (ICU) group and non-ICU group. Two cohort studies were included in this study. After comparing the patients between intensive care (ICU) group and non-ICU group, several important factors were found to significantly increase the risk of exacerbations in patients with NCIP, and they included hypertension (RR=2.34; 95% CI=1.21 to 4.51; P=0.01), cardiovascular diseases (RR=2.28; 95% CI=1.13 to 4.58; P=0.02), COPD (RR=7.65; 95% CI=1.24 to 47.13; P=0.03), dyspnea (RR=2.89; 95% CI=2.05 to 4.08; P<0.00001), myalgia or fatigue (RR=1.24; 95% CI=1.01 to 1.52; P=0.04), but several factors such as gender, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market exposure, diabetes, chronic liver disease, malignancy, fever, cough, expectoration, headache and diarrhoea appeared to have no obvious effect on the exacerbation of pneumonia. In addition, as the exacerbation of pneumonia, some complications had the high probability to occur according to the meta-analysis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (RR=13.95; 95% CI=6.20 to 31.41; P<0.00001), shock (RR=24.29; 95% CI=4.66 to 126.69; P=0.0002), acute cardiac injury (RR=10.32; 95% CI=3.05 to 34.96; P=0.0002) and acute kidney injury (RR=5.90; 95% CI=1.32 to 26.35; P=0.02) between two groups. Several risk factors were confirmed to significantly improve the risk of exacerbation in patients with NCIP, which was very important for the exacerbation prediction and treatment of these patients.","Zhao, Jinqiu; Li, Xiaosong; Gao, Yao; Huang, Wenxiang",Int J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.47052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714077/,165

This empirical study applied a multiple-methods approach to investigate the positive impacts of involvement on couchsurfing, such as P2P accommodations on the destination image, familiarity, and the behavioral intentions. The data was collected from 609 travelers who have used couchsurfing while traveling to Turkey from 2016 to 2017.

Aim: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity in the region of a major transport hub in Germany, we characterized the viral sequence diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Frankfurt am Main, the city with the largest airport in Germany, from the end of October to the end of December 2020. Methods: In total, we recovered 136 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from nasopharyngeal swab samples. We isolated 104 isolates that were grown in cell culture and RNA from the recovered viruses and subjected them to full-genome sequence analysis. In addition, 32 nasopharyngeal swab samples were directly sequenced. Results and conclusion: We found 28 different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating during the study period, including the variant of concern B.1.1.7 (Δ69/70, N501Y). Six of the lineages had not previously been observed in Germany. We detected the spike protein (S) deletion Δ69/Δ70 in 15% of all sequences, a four base pair (bp) deletion (in 2.9% of sequences) and a single bp deletion (in 0.7% of sequences) in ORF3a, leading to ORF3a truncations. In four sequences (2.9%), an amino acid deletion at position 210 in S was identified. In a single sample (0.7%), both a 9 bp deletion in ORF1ab and a 7 bp deletion in ORF7a were identified. One sequence in lineage B.1.1.70 had an N501Y substitution while lacking the Δ69/70 in S. The high diversity of sequences observed over two months in Frankfurt am Main highlights the persisting need for continuous SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using full-genome sequencing, particularly in cities with international airport connections.","Widera, Marek; Mühlemann, Barbara; Corman, Victor M.; Toptan, Tuna; Beheim-Schwarzbach, Jörn; Kohmer, Niko; Schneider, Julia; Berger, Annemarie; Veith, Talitha; Pallas, Christiane; Bleicker, Tobias; Goetsch, Udo; Tesch, Julia; Gottschalk, Rene; Jones, Terry C.; Ciesek, Sandra; Drosten, Christian",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9040748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918332/,165

Thus, fear of COVID-19 and fear of terrorism as well as the associations with coping strategies and resilience were examined among Israelis living in conflict zones as well as Israelis living in the center, where exposure to security incidents is rare. Six hundred and fifteen Israeli adults (260 men and 356 women) were interviewed via the internet while Israel was under mandatory first lockdown. Fear of COVID-19 was found to be higher than fear of terrorism among both groups. those living in the conflict zones and those living in the central Israel. In contradiction to our assumption, we found that those who were living in a conflict zone did not exhibit higher levels of resilience and did not cope better when exposed to a new threat—even though they may be more skilled at handling prolonged exposure to a threat such as terrorism. A regression analysis indicated that the best predictor of both fear of COVID-19 and of terrorism is financial concerns—more than geographical area.","Shechory Bitton, Mally; Laufer, Avital",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177711/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660777,165

The consequences of the pandemic on the care of patients with primary cutaneous lymphoma (CL) in the U.K. is unknown. Objective: To examine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on patients enrolled in the prospective registration and data collection study for newly diagnosed patients with all stages of MF/SS ‘PROCLIPI (PROspective Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic Index) Study’. Methods: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed by comparing the pre-COVID clinical stage (TNMB stage, mSWAT score, global response assessment) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL (Skindex-29) prior to and 4.5 (4.0-5.6) months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A specific COVID-19 dataset was used to capture the impact of the pandemic on study participants. Results: PROCLIPI study visit data was analysed in 75 patients with a mean (±SD) age of 65.19 (±14.31) years with a male: female ratio of 1.4:1. 61 patients had early stage (IA, n=41; IB, n=17 and IIA, n=3) and 14 had late-stage disease (IIB, n=3; IIIA, n=4; IIIB, n=1; IVA1, n=3 and IVA2, n=3) of whom 70 had MF and five SS. Global response assessment was possible in 40 patients. 17.1% (n=7) had an overall response (CR=1; PR=6), 43.9% (n=18) stable disease and 39% (n=16) progressive disease. The mean (±SEM) time to disease progression was 13.82 (±1.22) months and the median (IQR) mSWAT score increased from 7.25 (0.85–30.25) to 26.4 (2.6–41.78), p=0.08. 12 patients had missed/delayed treatments (phototherapy, n=5; radiotherapy, n=1; topical skin direct therapy, n=3; extracorporeal photopheresis, n=1; investigational medicinal product, n=2). We found no quantitative differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using Skindex-29 (n=75) however 40.6% of patients rated the pandemic as having a moderate to severe impact on their QoL.

It has become important to use clear and objective criteria for early diagnosis of patients with high-risk classification and clinical worsening risk. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic accuracy of CURB-65, ISARIC-4C, and COVID-GRAM scores in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and to compare the scoring systems in terms of predicting in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit requirement. METHODS The files of all COVID-19 patients over the age of 18 who were admitted to the emergency department and hospitalized between September 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020 were retrospectively scanned. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Youden J Index were used to compare scoring systems for predicting in-hospital mortality and intensive care requirement. RESULTS There were 481 patients included in this study. The median age of the patients was 67 (52-79). In terms of in-hospital mortality, the AUC of CURB-65, ISARIC-4C, and COVID-GRAM were 0.846, 0.784, and 0.701, respectively. In terms of intensive care requirement, the AUC of CURB-65, ISARIC-4C, and COVID-GRAM were 0.898, 0.797, and 0.684, respectively. In our study, Youden's J indexes of CURB-65, ISARIC-4C, and COVID-GRAM scores were found to be 0.59, 0.27, and 0.01, respectively, for mortality prediction of COVID-19 patients. Whereas Youden's J indexes were found to be 0.63, 0.26, and 0.01, respectively, for determining intensive care requirement. CONCLUSIONS Among the scoring systems assessed, CURB-65 score had better performance in predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU requirement in COVID-19 patients. ISARIC-4C has been found successful in identifying low-risk patients and the use of the ISARIC-4C score with CURB-65 increases the accuracy of risk assessment.","Doğanay, Fatih; Ak, Rohat",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455674/,165

This study aimed at comparing symptoms and clinical course of SARS-CoV2 infection with other respiratory infections in patients with CF. Methods: We carried out a prospective multicentre cohort study within the Italian CF Society involving 32 CF centres following 6,597 patients. CF centres were contacted to collect baseline and follow-up data of all patients who had reported symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or who had had contact with a positive/suspected case between the end of February and July 2020. Symptoms and clinical course of the infection were compared between patients who tested positive by molecular testing (cases) and those who tested negative (controls). Results: Thirty patients were reported from the centres, 16 of whom tested positive and 14 negative. Fever, cough, asthenia and dyspnea were the most frequently reported symptoms and their frequency were not significant different between groups. Eight cases (50%) were hospitalised but none required ICU admission. Two adults with a history of lung transplant required non-invasive ventilation;none required ICU admission. All patients fully recovered without short-term sequelae. Changes in FEV1 (percent of predicted) after recovery were not significantly different between groups (median, interquartile range: 3.0%, –1.5, 5.5 among cases and –3.0%, –8.5, 6.3 among controls, P = 0.48). Conclusions: Symptoms and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our patients was not significantly different from other respiratory infections.

Methods In 2.729.627 residents in Norway aged 20-70 years and born in Norway, Somalia, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey (mean [SD] age 44 (14) years and 51% men), we examined whether persons employed as taxi drivers, bus- and tram drivers, child care workers, nurses, personal care workers in health, food service counter attendants, waiters/bartenders, cleaners and shop sale persons had a higher risk of COVID-19, from April 1st 2020 to December 2nd 2020, compared to 1) Norwegian-born in the same occupational group and 2) all others with the same birth country and aged 20-70 years, using logistic regressions. Results Within each of the included occupational groups, immigrants had a greatly increased odds of COVID-19 when compared to Norwegian-born (OR ~ 1.66-12.72). However, immigrants working in the selected occupations had the same odds of COVID-19 as person with same birth country not having the same occupation (OR~1). Exceptions were Somalian- , Afghani- and Iraqi personal care workers in health services who had an increased odds of COVID-19 (OR 1.61 (95% CI 1.31, 1.98), OR 1.46 (1.06, 2.02) and OR 1.40 (1.03, 1.91), respectively) compared to others from the same country. Conclusion Immigrants holding various occupations implying close contact with others did not have higher odds of notified infection than others with the same country of birth, except for health care workers.

The precise identification of immune cell subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and their correlation with COVID-19 disease severity are currently being unraveled. Herein, we employed iterative clustering and guide-gene selection 2 (ICGS2) as well as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction computational algorithms to decipher the complex immune and cellular composition of BAL, using publicly available datasets from a total of 68,873 single cells derived from two healthy subjects, three patients with mild COVID-19, and five patients with severe COVID-19. Our analysis revealed the presence of neutrophils and macrophage cluster-1 as a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Among the identified gene signatures, IFITM2, IFITM1, H3F3B, SAT1, and S100A8 gene signatures were highly associated with neutrophils, while CCL8, CCL3, CCL2, KLF6, and SPP1 were associated with macrophage cluster-1 in severe-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, although macrophages were also present in healthy subjects and patients with mild COVID-19, they had different gene signatures, indicative of interstitial and cluster-0 macrophage (i.e., FABP4, APOC1, APOE, C1QB, and NURP1). Additionally, MALAT1, NEAT1, and SNGH25 were downregulated in patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Interferon signaling, FCγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, IL17, and Tec kinase canonical pathways were enriched in patients with severe COVID-19, while PD-1 and PDL-1 pathways were suppressed. A number of upstream regulators (IFNG, PRL, TLR7, PRL, TGM2, TLR9, IL1B, TNF, NFkB, IL1A, STAT3, CCL5, and others) were also enriched in BAL cells from severe COVID-19-affected patients compared to those from patients with mild COVID-19. Further analyses revealed genes associated with the inflammatory response and chemotaxis of myeloid cells, phagocytes, and granulocytes, among the top activated functional categories in BAL from severe COVID-19-affected patients. Transcriptome data from another cohort of COVID-19-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealed the presence of several genes common to those found in BAL from patients with severe and mild COVID-19 (IFI27, IFITM3, IFI6, IFIT3, MX1, IFIT1, OASL, IFI30, OAS1) or to those seen only in BAL from severe-COVID-19 patients (S100A8, IFI44, IFI44L, CXCL8, CCR1, PLSCR1, EPSTI1, FPR1, OAS2, OAS3, IL1RN, TYMP, BCL2A1). Taken together, our data reveal the presence of neutrophils and macrophage cluster-1 as the main immune cell subsets associated with severe COVID-19 and identify their inflammatory and chemotactic gene signatures, also partially reflected systemically in the circulation, for possible diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","Shaath, Hibah; Vishnubalaji, Radhakrishnan; Elkord, Eyad; Alajez, Nehad M.",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9112374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138195/,165

In recent years, it has expanded geographically, changing from an endemic mosquito-borne disease across equatorial Asia and Africa, to an epidemic disease causing large outbreaks in several areas of the world. With the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in the Americas, the disease has become a focus of attention of public health agencies and of the international research community, especially due to an association with neurological disorders in adults and to the severe neurological and ophthalmological abnormalities found in fetuses and newborns of mothers exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy. A large number of studies have been published in the last 3 years, revealing the structure of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it affects human cells. Many different animal models have been developed, which recapitulate several features of ZIKV disease and its neurological consequences. Moreover, several vaccine candidates are now in active preclinical development, and three of them have already entered phase I clinical trials. Likewise, many different compounds targeting viral and cellular components are being tested in in vitro and in experimental animal models.

It was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization and activated response teams at almost all Malaysian healthcare facilities. Upon activation of the National Crisis Preparedness and Response Center in January 2020, the National Institutes of Health Malaysia established a COVID-19 operation room at the facility level to address the rise in COVID-19 infection cases each day. The National Institutes of Health COVID-19 operation room committee formed a workforce mobilization team for an effective and efficient mobilization system to fulfill requests received for human resource aid within the Ministry of Health Malaysia facilities. Selected personnel would be screened for health and availability before mobilization letters and logistics arrangements if necessary. The workforce from the National Institutes of Health, consisting of various job positions, were mobilized every week, with each deployment cycle lasting 2 weeks. A total of 128 personnel from the six institutes under the National Institutes of Health were mobilized: tasks included fever screening, active case detection, health management at quarantine centers, and management of dead bodies. A well-organized data management system with a centralized online system integration could allow more rapid deployment and answer some of the key questions in managing a similar pandemic in the future.

665468,Efficacy and Safety of Bortezomib in Multiple Myeloma Patients with Hepatitis B: A Multicenter Retrospective Study,2016-02-05,"COVID-19 has spread to all countries around the world after it was first discovered in Wuhan of China at the end of 2019. It is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with much semblance to SARS-CoV including the sequence homology and disease symptoms. It is reported to be more infectious than SARS-CoV due to higher binding affinities between its spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on cell surface. Despite this, its case fatality rate is much lower compared with that of SARS-CoV although it varies in different countries. However, the case fatality rate increases steadily with age and it is reported to be the highest in aged COVID-19 male patients in almost all countries. Consistent with these, females have higher antiviral immune responses. Males and females are different in inflammatory response and aberrantly hyperactive cytokines are the main lethal causes of COVID-19. Interestingly, the gene encoding the ACE2 receptor protein and some genes encoding the immune regulatory proteins such as TLR7 are located on X chromosome which is subject to X chromosome inactivation and sex hormone regulation. These may account for some sex-dependent immune responses and lethality observed in COVID-19 patients. In general, children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and only less than 1% of pediatric COVID-19 patients may die of COVID-19. However, the most severe pediatric cases become multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is similar to Kawasiki disease with features of viral infection. Since most infected kids were boys in China, there may be sex-dependent immune response in pediatric COVID-19 cases as well.","Li, Albert Jiarui; Li, Xiajun",Stem Cell Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1873506120304177; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scr.2020.102116; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506120304177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352531/,165

Here we show that the C-terminal region of Rpn13 binds to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of SGTA, a cytosolic factor implicated in the quality control of mislocalised membrane proteins (MLPs). The overexpression of SGTA results in a substantial increase in steady-state MLP levels, consistent with an effect on proteasomal degradation. However, this effect is strongly dependent upon the interaction of SGTA with the proteasomal component Rpn13. Hence, overexpression of the SGTA-binding region of Rpn13 or point mutations within the SGTA TPR domain both inhibit SGTA binding to the proteasome and substantially reduce MLP levels. These findings suggest that SGTA can regulate the access of MLPs to the proteolytic core of the proteasome, implying that a protein quality control cycle that involves SGTA and the BAG6 complex can operate at the 19S regulatory particle. We speculate that the binding of SGTA to Rpn13 enables specific polypeptides to escape proteasomal degradation and/or selectively modulates substrate degradation.","Leznicki, Pawel; Korac-Prlic, Jelena; Kliza, Katarzyna; Husnjak, Koraljka; Nyathi, Yvonne; Dikic, Ivan; High, Stephen",J Cell Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169395/; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.165209,165

In this study, we examined whether demographics predicted the likelihood that a person would adopt these behaviours in Singapore. Materials and Methods: 1145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March - 21 April 2020. As part of the survey, we collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the outbreak. We ran regression models to predict, using demographic information: (1) the total number of behavioural changes undertaken, (2) the number of preventive changes undertaken, and (3) the number of avoidant changes undertaken. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who: (4) declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. Results: Females and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours: whereas females were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Females and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours, with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual. Females also voluntarily reduced physical contact, whereas those who were married chose outdoor venues and relied on online shopping. Conclusion: Our characterisation of behavioural changes provides a baseline for public health advisories. Moving forward, local health authorities can focus their efforts to encourage segments of the population who do not readily adopt infection control measures against COVID-19.","Long, V. J.; Liu, J.

Yet, there is lack of agreement about its precise role and, notably, whether loneliness should be included as a core symptom for diagnosis of grief complications. The ongoing threat of heightened social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic underlines the need to understand the impact of loneliness, and to accurately chart its prevalence, intensity, duration, and associated difficulties in the context of bereavement. Assessment issues are central to this endeavor. In this article, we review the scientific literature to examine how loneliness after bereavement has been operationalized and measured. Sixty-three articles analyzing 51 independent datasets were reviewed. Results show major disparities: approximately half of the projects assessed loneliness by means of one of two validated scales (spanning different versions); the remainder included only single- or few-item measures. Diverse instructions, content and answer categories were used. While one size does not fit all, awareness of assessment options and dis/advantages may aid selection of the most appropriate measure, to suit the goals of a particular study and the specific groups under investigation. Our conclusion is that, in selecting a loneliness measure, health care professionals should come to their own well-informed decision, aided by the information provided in our review.","Vedder, Anneke; Stroebe, Margeret S.; Schut, Henk A.W.; Boerner, Kathrin; Stokes, Jeffrey E.; Boelen, Paul A.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589033/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.741762,165

This study compares the safety and accuracy of two different protocols, one with and one without air‐dried slides. METHODS: Starting from 3 March 2020, we discontinued the use of air‐dried slides during breast fine needle aspiration procedures. We selected cases collected during two periods: 2 months before and 2 months after 3 March. In both groups, the number of procedures was recorded together with the distribution of the diagnostic categories and the concordance between cytological and histological results on surgical specimens for lesions suggestive of malignancy, using the chi‐squared test. RESULTS: Of the 100 procedures performed during the pre‐COVID‐19 period, 55% were negative (C2), 3% were non‐diagnostic (C1) and 40% were positive (C4 or C5). Of the 75 procedures obtained during the COVID‐19 period, 44% were negative (C2), 2.7% were non‐diagnostic (C1) and 52% were positive (C4 or C5). Despite the use of a new protocol during the COVID‐19 period, we observed concordance between cytological and histological results for lesions suggestive of malignancy. There was no statistically significant difference concerning the distribution of the diagnostic categories in the two groups.

Discharges using dry argon (0% O(2)) discharges and different wet argon discharges using admixtures with O(2)/Ar ratios ranging from 0.25% to 1.5% were studied. The combined effects of dry and wet argon discharges, direct and indirect exposure using a mesh controller, and hollow magnets were studied to reach a complete bacterial inactivation in short application times. Survival curves showed that the inactivation rate increased as the wettability increased. The application of magnetized non-thermal plasma discharge with a 1.5% wetness ratio causes a fast inactivation rate of microbes on surfaces, and a dramatic decrease of the residual survival of the bacterial ratio due to an increase in the jet width and the enhanced ability of fast transport of the charges to viable cells, especially at the edge of the Petri dish.

In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, ReCoNet (residual image-based COVID-19 detection network), is proposed for COVID-19 detection. This is achieved from chest X-ray (CXR) images shedding light on the preprocessing task considered to be very useful for enhancing the COVID-19 fingerprints. The proposed modular architecture consists of a CNN-based multi-level preprocessing filter block in cascade with a multi-layer CNN-based feature extractor and a classification block. A multi-task learning loss function is adopted for optimization of the preprocessing block trained end-to-end with the rest of the proposed network. Additionally, a data augmentation technique is applied for boosting the network performance. The whole network when pre-trained end-to-end on the CheXpert open source dataset, and trained and tested with the COVIDx dataset of 15,134 original CXR images yielded an overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.48%, 96.39%, and 97.53%, respectively.

First, reducing virus transmission will require prevention of asymptomatic and mild infections in addition to severe symptomatic infections. Second, the emergence of variants of concern with mutations in the S protein’s receptor binding domain increases the likelihood that vaccines will have to be updated because some of these mutations render variants less optimally targeted by current vaccines. This will require coordinated global SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to link genotypes to phenotypes, potentially using the WHO’s global influenza surveillance program as a guide. Third, concerns about the longevity of vaccine-induced immunity highlight the potential need for re-vaccination, depending on the extent to which the virus has been controlled and whether re-vaccination can target those at greatest risk of severe illness.

It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.","Viner, Russell M; Russell, Simon J; Croker, Helen; Packer, Jessica; Ward, Joseph; Stansfield, Claire; Mytton, Oliver; Bonell, Chris; Booy, Robert",Lancet Child Adolesc Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235246422030095X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S235246422030095X; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2352-4642(20)30095-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32272089/,165

Such approaches aim to provide rapid, accurate, cost-effective, sensitive, and high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, on multiple specimen types, and without specialized equipment and expertise. The CRISPR-Cas13 system functions as a sequence-specific RNA-sensing tool that has recently been harnessed to develop simplified and flexible testing formats. This review recapitulates technical advances in the most recent CRISPR-Cas13-based methods for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The challenges and opportunities for implementing mass testing using these novel CRISPR-Cas13 platforms are critically analyzed.","Aquino-Jarquin, Guillermo",Drug Discov Today,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644621002774; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359644621002774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147688/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2021.06.005,165

677664,Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Technology for Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 Self-Testing,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), firstly reported in China last November 2019, became a global pandemic. It has been shown that periods of isolation may induce a spike in alcohol use disorder (AUD). In addition, alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is the most common consequence of excessive alcohol consumption worldwide. Moreover, liver impairment has also been reported as a common manifestation of COVID-19. AIMS: The aim of our position paper was to consider some critical issues regarding the management of ALD in patients with AUD in the era of COVID-19. METHODS: A panel of experts of the Italian Society of Alcohology (SIA) met via “conference calls” during the lockdown period to draft the SIA’s criteria for the management of ALD in patients with COVID-19 as follows: (a) liver injury in patients with ALD and COVID-19 infection; (b) toxicity to the liver of the drugs currently tested to treat COVID-19 and the pharmacological interaction between medications used to treat AUD and to treat COVID-19; (c) reorganization of the management of compensated and decompensated ALD and liver transplantation in the COVID-19 era. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly carried us toward a new governance scenario of AUD and ALD which necessarily requires an in-depth review of the management of these diseases with a new safe approach (management of out-patients and in-patients following new rules of safety, telemedicine, telehealth, call meetings with clinicians, nurses, patients, and caregivers) without losing the therapeutic efficacy of multidisciplinary treatment.","Testino, Gianni; Vignoli, Teo; Patussi, Valentino; Allosio, Pierluigi; Amendola, Maria Francesca; Aricò, Sarino; Baselice, Aniello; Balbinot, Patrizia; Campanile, Vito; Fanucchi, Tiziana; Greco, Giovanni; Macciò, Livia; Meneguzzi, Cristina; Mioni, Davide; Palmieri, Vincenzo Ostilio; Parisi, Michele; Renzetti, Doda; Rossin, Raffaella; Gandin, Claudia; Bottaro, Luigi Carlo; Bernardi, Mauro; Addolorato, Giovanni; Lungaro, Lisa; Zoli, Giorgio; Scafato, Emanuele; Caputo, Fabio",Dig Dis Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-021-07006-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142284/,165
677831,Endonasal surgery in the coronavirus era – Birmingham experience,2020-11-04,"Access to imaging diagnostics has been shown to result in accurate treatment, management, and optimal outcomes. Particularly in low-income and low-middle-income countries (LICs, LMICs), access is limited due to a lack of adequate resources. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, access to imaging services is critical at every tier of the health system. Optimizing imaging services in low-resource settings is best accomplished by prescriptive, integrated, and coordinated tiered service delivery that takes contextual factors into consideration. To our knowledge, this is the first recommendation for optimized, specific imaging care delivery by tier. A model for tier-based essential imaging services informs and guides policymakers as they set priorities and make budgetary decisions. In this paper, we recommend a framework for tiered imaging services essential to reduce the global burden of disease and attain universal health coverage (UHC). A lack of access to basic imaging services, even at the lowest tier of the health system, can no longer be justified by cost. Worldwide, affordable modalities of modern ultrasound and X-ray are becoming an accessible mainstay for the investigation of common conditions such as pregnancy, pneumonia, and fractures, and are safely performed and interpreted by qualified professionals. Finally, given the vast gap in access to imaging resources between LMICs and high-income countries (HICs), a scale-up of tiered imaging services in low-resource settings has the potential to reduce health disparities between, and within countries. As the access to appropriately integrated imaging services improves, UHC may be achieved.","DeStigter, Kristen; Pool, Kara-Lee; Leslie, Abimbola; Hussain, Sarwat; Tan, Bien Soo; Donoso-Bach, Lluis; Andronikou, Savvas",Insights Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-021-01073-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529166/,165

Methods: K-means clustering was employed on the available country-specific COVID-19 epidemiological data and the influential background characteristics. Country-specific case fatality rates and the average number of people tested positive for COVID-19 per every 10,000 population in each country were derived from the WHO COVID-19 situation report 107, and were used for clustering along with the background characteristics of proportion of countrys population aged >65 years and percentage GDP spent as public health expenditure. Results: The algorithm grouped the 89 countries into cluster 1 and Cluster 2 of sizes 54 and 35, respectively. It is apparent that Americas, European countries, and Australia formed a major part of cluster 2 with high COVID-19 case fatality rate, higher proportion of countrys population tested COVID-19 positive, higher percentage of GDP spent as public health expenditure, and greater percentage of population being more than 65 years of age. Conclusion: In spite of the positive correlation between high public health expenditure (%GDP) and COVID-19 incidence, case fatality rate, the immediate task ahead of most of the low and middle income countries is to strengthen their public health systems realizing that the correlation found in this study could be spurious in light of the underreported number of cases and poor death registration.","Chandu, Viswa",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.20121194; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.03.20121194v1?rss=1,165

By studying the spatiotemporal associations of febrile patients, it may allow early detection of case clustering that indicates imminent threat of infectious disease outbreaks in the community. METHODS: We captured consecutive emergency department visits that led to hospitalization in a district hospital in Hong Kong during the period of 12 Sep 2005 to 14 Oct 2005. We recorded demographic data, provisional diagnoses, temperature on presentation and residential location for each patient-episode, and geocoded the residential addresses. We applied Geographical Information System technology to study the geographical distribution these cases, and their associations within a 50-m buffer zone spatially. A case cluster was defined by three or more spatially associated febrile patients within each three consecutive days. RESULTS: One thousand and sixty six patient-episodes were eligible for analysis; 42% of them had fever (>37°C; oral temperature) on presentation. Two hundred and four patient-episodes (19.1%) came from residential care homes for elderly (RCHE). We detected a total of 40 case clusters during the study period. Clustered cases were of older age; 57 (33.3%) were residents of RCHE. We found a median of 3 patients (range: 3 - 8) and time span of 3 days (range: 2 - 8 days) in each cluster. Twenty five clusters had 2 or more patients living in the same building block; 18 of them were from RCHE. CONCLUSIONS: It is technically feasible to perform surveillance on febrile patients and studying their spatiotemporal associations. The information is potentially useful for early detection of impending infectious disease threats.","Choi, Kin-wing; Wong, Ngai-sze; Lee, Lap-yip; Lee, Shui-shan",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-84; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170529/,165

Sans traitement spécifique ni vaccin, il est primordial de pouvoir identifier et isoler les personnes infectées, ainsi que de retrouver et dépister les personnes contacts. Les outils digitaux de contact tracing sont intéressants mais entraînent des défis technologiques et éthiques. Bayes Impact, une association développant des outils digitaux à impact social a conçu en collaboration avec des médecins infectiologues la plateforme « BriserLaChaine.org » (BLC), de notification d’exposition au COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Une plateforme web a été développée de mars à mai 2020 pour permettre d’identifier les cas suspects de COVID-19 et de calculer la période de contagiosité pour retrouver des personnes contacts en les prévenant par voie électronique. Un comité scientifique a conçu un outil d’orientation diagnostique en cas de symptômes par une veille bibliographique régulière et des avis d’experts. Résultats La plateforme BLC, ouverte à tous, ne nécessite ni téléchargement, ni compte, et ne stocke aucune donnée personnelle ou de géolocalisation. Soit l’infection par le COVID-19 est déjà connue et diagnostiquée par un médecin, soit suspectée par l’utilisateur devant la présence de symptômes. L’outil d’orientation diagnostique se base sur des points attribués selon chaque symptôme déclaré : 3 points pour une fièvre>38° C, une toux ou une dyspnée ; 2 points pour asthénie, myalgies, expectorations, anosmie ou agueusie ; 1 point pour rhinorrhée, odynophagie, céphalée, diarrhée ou vomissements. Les personnes ayant une infection probable (score>3 points) sont invitées à se faire tester et à consulter un médecin. Des conseils sont données aux autres, avec un lien vers le site maladiecoronavirus.com. La période de contagion considérée est de 2jours avant et 13jours après l’apparition des premiers symptômes. La notification des personnes contacts se fait soit par l’utilisateur soit anonymement via la plateforme. Depuis sa mise en ligne, il y a eu plus de 12 000 connexions. Conclusion La plateforme BLC est le premier outil digital de notification utilisable en France. Il ne collecte aucune donnée personnelle ni de géolocalisation. Sans adoption massive nécessaire, BLC peut être une aide en cas de recirculation du virus à l’échelle nationale de clusters, avec d’autres mesures de prévention.

Countries imposed lockdowns, which were followed by a reduction in care utilization. The aims of this study were to quantify the effects of lockdown on pediatric care in the Netherlands, to elucidate the cause of the observed reduction in pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions, and to summarize the literature regarding the effects of lockdown on pediatric care worldwide. ED visits and hospital admission data of 8 general hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2016 and June 2020 were summarized per diagnosis group (communicable infections, noncommunicable infections, (probable) infection-related, and noninfectious). The effects of lockdown were quantified with a linear mixed effects model. A literature review regarding the effect of lockdowns on pediatric clinical care was performed. In total, 126,198 ED visits and 47,648 admissions were registered in the study period. The estimated reduction in general pediatric care was 59% and 56% for ED visits and admissions, respectively. The largest reduction was observed for communicable infections (ED visits: 76%; admissions: 77%), whereas the reduction in noninfectious diagnoses was smaller (ED visits 36%; admissions: 37%). Similar reductions were reported worldwide, with decreases of 30–89% for ED visits and 19–73% for admissions. Conclusion: Pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization during lockdown were decreased in the Netherlands and other countries, which can largely be attributed to a decrease in communicable infectious diseases. Care utilization for other conditions was decreased as well, which may indicate that care avoidance during a pandemic is significant.

There are great scientific efforts to find new treatments and vaccines, at the same time that governments, companies, and individuals have taken a series of actions in response to this pandemic. These efforts seek to decrease the speed of propagation, although with significant social and economic costs. Countries have taken different actions, also with different results. In this article we use non-parametric techniques (HT and MST) with the aim of identifying groups of countries with a similar spread of the coronavirus. The variable of interest is the number of daily infections per country. Results show that there are groups of countries with differentiated contagion dynamics, both in the number of contagions plus at the time of the greatest transmission of the disease. It is concluded that the actions taken by the countries, the speed at which they were taken and the number of tests carried out may explain part of the differences in the dynamics of contagion.","Alvarez, E.; Brida, J.

However, the interaction of these preventive measures in interpersonal space (IPS) perception remains unknown. This study evaluated the effects of wearing surgical masks, sex dyads, and approaching patterns on IPS judgment. Data were collected from participants from Mainland China (n=100) and Taiwan (n=100) through an online survey. Therefore, the regional differences were also examined. A smaller IPS was observed when participants faced confederates wearing surgical masks than in the no-mask condition. Female dyads tended to maintain a smaller IPS than did both male and mixed-sex dyads, and Taiwanese participants maintained a significantly larger IPS than did Mainland Chinese participants. No significant difference was observed between the active and passive pattern. Moreover, the interaction between region and mask had a significant influence on IPS perception. Among all test combinations, only the IPS perceived by Taiwanese participants facing confederates without surgical masks exceeded 1.5m. This study revealed that the wearing of surgical masks for health protection during the pandemic influences IPS perception in different regions.

A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010–2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.","Alexander, Jan; Tinkov, Alexey; Strand, Tor A.; Alehagen, Urban; Skalny, Anatoly; Aaseth, Jan",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12082358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784601/,165

Owing to the spread of COVID-19, the need for telemedicine is rapidly increasing to prevent infections more effectively. However, in practices such as traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, where color is used as an important examination factor, an accurate diagnosis cannot be made without adequate color reproduction. In telemedicine using a commercially available smartphone, color reproducibility may deteriorate owing to differences in the devices and lighting, which may result in a misdiagnosis. Therefore, we created a color chart that includes the colors of the human skin and tongue as a tool to help doctors identify the color of patients more accurately when conducting a telemedicine examination. Through a subjective evaluation by eight medical doctors, it was unanimously found that the proposed method is practical in terms of a color examination. The developed color chart can also be used for an automatic color correction.","Takahashi, Masato; Takahashi, Ryo; Morihara, Yasuhiro; Kin, Isseki; Ogawa-Ochiai, Keiko; Tsumura, Norimichi",Artif Life Robot,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10015-020-00627-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837297/,165

DESIGN: A cross-sectional population-based online survey. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in 22 provinces of the DRC. Five provinces with a satisfactory number of respondents were included in the analysis: Haut Katanga, Kasaï-Central, Kasaï-Oriental, Kinshasa and North Kivu. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were people aged ≥18 years, living in the DRC. A total of 3268 participants were included in the study analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Both convenience sampling (surveyors themselves contacted potential participants in different districts) and snowball sampling (the participants were requested to share the link of the questionnaire with their contacts) methods were used. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We computed adherence scores using responses to 10 questions concerning COVID-19 preventive measures recommended by the WHO and the DRC Ministry of Health. We used logistic regression analysis with generalised estimating equations to identify factors of poor adherence. We also asked about the presence or absence of flu-like symptoms during the preceding 14 days, whether a COVID-19 test was done and the test result. RESULTS: Data from 3268 participants were analysed. Face masks were not used by 1789 (54.7%) participants. Non-adherence to physical distancing was reported by 1364 (41.7%) participants. 501 (15.3%) participants did not observe regular handwashing. Five variables were associated with poor adherence: lower education level, living with other people at home, being jobless/students, living with a partner and not being a healthcare worker. CONCLUSION: Despite compulsory restrictions imposed by the government, only about half of the respondents adhered to COVID-19 preventive measures in the DRC. Disparities across the provinces are remarkable.

Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single ""ensemble"" forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S. Methods Beginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths. Results Analysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96% of observations falling within the rounded 95% prediction intervals. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons. Careful development, assessment, and communication of ensemble forecasts can provide reliable insight to public health decision makers.","Ray, E. L.; Wattanachit, N.; Niemi, J.; Kanji, A.

Objectives: To examine the CFR of patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV. Methods: Two authors independently searched PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the COVID-19 living systematic review, and national registry databases. The primary outcome was the “reported CFR” for patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring IMV. “Definitive hospital CFR” for patients with outcomes at hospital discharge was also investigated. Finally, CFR was analyzed by patient age, geographic region, and study quality on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Measurements and Results: Sixty-nine studies were included, describing 57,420 adult patients with COVID-19 who received IMV. Overall reported CFR was estimated as 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39–52%). Fifty-four of 69 studies stated whether hospital outcomes were available but provided a definitive hospital outcome on only 13,120 (22.8%) of the total IMV patient population. Among studies in which age-stratified CFR was available, pooled CFR estimates ranged from 47.9% (95% CI, 46.4–49.4%) in younger patients (age ≤40 yr) to 84.4% (95% CI, 83.3–85.4%) in older patients (age >80 yr). CFR was also higher in early COVID-19 epicenters. Overall heterogeneity is high (I(2) >90%), with nonsignificant Egger’s regression test suggesting no publication bias. Conclusions: Almost half of patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV died based on the reported CFR, but variable CFR reporting methods resulted in a wide range of CFRs between studies. The reported CFR was higher in older patients and in early pandemic epicenters, which may be influenced by limited ICU resources. Reporting of definitive outcomes on all patients would facilitate comparisons between studies.

Inocula in experiments 1, 3, and 5 consisted of intestinal contents from PES-affected birds of less than 2 wk of age, whereas those in experiments 2 and 4 consisted of intestinal contents from PES-affected birds of 4 to 6 wk of age. Poults in all groups were observed daily for clinical signs. The BW and microbiological criteria in experiments 1, 3, and 5 were evaluated at 5, 10, and 15 d postinoculation, whereas in experiments 2 and 4, these observations were made at 10 and 20 d postinoculation. Rotavirus, astrovirus, and Salmonella were present in all 5 inocula. Diarrhea and depression were the major signs in poults given PES material. Significant retardation of growth was observed in poults given any of the 3 PES materials, but this effect was more pronounced in poults given the sediment inoculum. Rotavirus, astrovirus, and Salmonella were detected in poults given PES material. In some cases, enterovirus was also detected. No major difference was noticed in experimental reproduction of PES when intestinal contents from different age birds were used as the inoculum.","Jindal, N.; Patnayak, D. P.; Ziegler, A.

689038,Diagnostic accuracy and interobserver variability of CO-RADS in patients with suspected coronavirus disease-2019: a multireader validation study,2020-09-23,"AIM: To describe the experiences of frontline nurses who are working in critical care areas during the COVID‐19 pandemic with a focus on trauma and the use of substances as a coping mechanism. DESIGN: A qualitative study based on content analysis. METHODS: Data were collected from mid‐June 2020 to early September 2020 via an online survey. Nurses were recruited through the research webpage of the American Association of Critical Care Nurses as well as an alumni list from a large, public Midwest university. Responses to two open‐ended items were analysed: (1) personal or professional trauma the nurse had experienced; and (2) substance or alcohol use, or other mental health issues the nurse had experienced or witnessed in other nurses. RESULTS: For the item related to psychological trauma five themes were identified from 70 nurses’ comments: (1) Psychological distress in multiple forms; (2) Tsunami of death; (3) Torn between two masters; (4) Betrayal; and (5) Resiliency/posttraumatic growth through self and others. Sixty‐five nurses responded to the second item related to substance use and other mental health issues. Data supported three themes: (1) Mental health crisis NOW!!: ‘more stressed than ever and stretched thinner than ever’; (2) Nurses are turning to a variety of substances to cope; and (3) Weakened supports for coping and increased maladaptive coping due to ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study brings novel findings to understand the experiences of nurses who care for patients with COVID‐19, including trauma experienced during disasters, the use of substances to cope and the weakening of existing support systems. Findings also reveal nurses in crisis who are in need of mental health services. IMPACT: Support for nurses’ well‐being and mental health should include current and ongoing services offered by the organization and include screening for substance use issues.","Foli, Karen J.; Forster, Anna; Cheng, Chang; Zhang, Lingsong; Chiu, Yu‐Chin",J Adv Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314068/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14988,165

Given the subject matter impacts on lives across the globe, we are pleased to have the opportunity to continue this worthwhile discussion. While the authors have written a response [2] to our initial concerns [3,4,5], we feel that it falls short in a number of key ways, and thus the paper still does not propose a useful assessment of the efficacy of Non‐Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) against COVID‐19.","Besançon, Lonni; Meyerowitz‐Katz, Gideon; Chini, Emilio Zanetti; Fuchs, Hermann; Flahault, Antoine",Eur J Clin Invest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998694/; https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13599,165

We provide empirical support for the notion that, due to uncertainty about reopening after lockdown, the hospitality sector has found existing problem-solving routines to be of little use. Although the local community has been unable to form a shared vision around the pandemic, hoteliers have nevertheless relied on their network of relationships to sense the crisis and find their own ways to adapt. Interestingly, we find that overreliance on trustworthy relationships can diminish the ability to sense a crisis objectively. Our results not only shed light on sensemaking in the hotel industry, but also grapple with the theoretical nature of sensemaking as a socially constructed process.","Visentin, Marco; Reis, Rosana Silveira; Cappiello, Giuseppe; Casoli, Debora",Int J Hosp Manag,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102820; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431920303728; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431920303728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519017/,165
