Schwangerschaftswoche unter Midazolam oder peripartale Infektion?,11.582911,3.788381,1999-10-01,"OBJECTIVE: Systemic inflammation subsequent to polytrauma is connected to neutrophil (PMN) dysregulation characterized by reduced NF-kB-translocation and cytokine expression. The dynamics of NF-kB-activation as well as its down-stream regulation of IL-8-expression in PMN following major trauma remain unclear. The aim of this pilot study was to analyse NF-kB nuclear translocation in relation to IL- 8-mRNA-expression in PMN after major trauma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PMN were isolated from blood samples of 15 major trauma patients (New Injury Severity Score, NISS > 16) drawn within 90 min and subsequently 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h after trauma. NF-kB-translocation was analysed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, EMSA and quantified by densitometry [arbitrary units], IL-8-mRNA-expression by RT-PCR, [copies/50 ng RNA]. Additionally, NF-kB-translocation and IL-8-expression in PMN of healthy volunteers were analysed natively (-control) and after LPS stimulation (+control). RESULTS: NF-kB-translocation and IL-8-mRNA-expression was significantly increased in polytrauma patients (n=15; NISS: 34 ± 8 [mean ± SEM]) initially. In non-survivors, NFkB- translocation was significantly increased on admission and subsequently reduced within 6 h, while it increased in the survivors group. After 24 h, a second significant increase in NF-kB-activity and IL-8-expression was found in survivors that was subsequently reduced in both groups. CONCLUSION: This pilot study has shown that a concomitant initial increase in transcriptional NF-kB-activity and IL-8 mRNA expression was observed in the early posttraumatic period which preceded the down-regulation of the innate immune system.","Stegmaier, J.

In order to investigate the reason for the higher rate of fatal outcome of this infection, this study compared the molecular epidemiology and virology of avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses from mild (N = 14), severe (N = 50) and fatal (N = 35) cases, as well as from non-human hosts (N = 73). The epidemiological results showed that the average age of the people in the mild, severe and fatal groups was 27.6, 52 and 62 years old, respectively (p < 0.001). Males accounted for 42.9 % (6/14), 58.0 % (29/50), and 74.3 % (26/35) of cases in the mild, severe and fatal group respectively (p = 0.094). Median days from onset to start of antiviral treatment were 2, 5 and 7 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p = 0.002). The median time from onset to discharge/death was 12, 40 and 19 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p < 0.001). Analysis of whole genome sequences showed that PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations were markedly associated with an increased fatality rate, while HA (N276D) and PB2 (N559T) mutations were clearly related to mild cases. There were no differences in the genotypes, adaptation to mammalian hosts, and genetic identity between the three types of infection. In conclusion, advanced age and delayed confirmation of diagnosis and antiviral intervention were risk factors for death. Furthermore, PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations might contribute to a fatal outcome in human H7N9 infection.

The first case infected with H7N9 virus in Beijing involved a family member of a chicken dealer and was reported in April 2013. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of this case and her parents were examined to illustrate some key traits regarding this novel H7N9 virus. METHODS: The index case was subjected to intensive clinical examination in order to observed the clinical process. Real-time PCR was used to confirm cases infected with H7N9 virus. The index case was administered oseltamivir (45 mg, twice daily) at the early stage of the infection. Sera were collected from the index case and her parents from the onset of illness onwards. The subjects were followed for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The sera were confirmed by neutralizing antibody tests. The index case’s clinical manifestation progressed quickly. The pharyngeal swab tested positive for influenza A based on the detection of influenza A antigen (rapid influenza diagnostic test) 15 h after the onset of fever and was positive for H7N9 virus. The patient’s temperature dropped to 36.2 °C 18 h after treatment by oseltamivir (32 h after fever). Cough and other symptoms alleviated rapidly. A number of specimens from the environment of this cluster and from the feces specimens tested positive for viral RNA of the H7N9 virus on the fourth day following onset of the index case’s illness. Pharyngeal swabs of the mother tested positive for H7N9 virus twice, but she showed no clinical symptoms. Four weeks after disease onset, the family did not present any clinical symptoms, and the results of the physical examination and blood tests were normal. The mother and the case’s sera had a fourfold increased neutralizing antibody titer. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and early initiation of the treatment of confirmed infections is the most effective strategy for managing H7N9 virus infection. Human beings exposed to H7N9 virus may develop asymptomatic infection.","Song, R.; Pang, X.; Yang, P.; Shu, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Q.; Chen, Z.; Liu, J.; Cheng, J.; Jiao, Y.; Jiang, R.; Lu, L.; Chen, L.; Ma, J.; Li, C.; Zeng, H.; Peng, X.; Huang, L.; Zheng, Y.; Deng, Y.; Li, X.",Infection,492,1

Mass vaccination targets predominantly major cities, often compromising disease control due to re-introductions. Previous work suggested that areas neighboring cities may behave as the source of these re-introductions. To evaluate this hypothesis, we introduce a spatially explicit metapopulation model for rabies diffusion in Central African Republic. Calibrated on epidemiological data for the capital city, Bangui, the model predicts that long-range movements are essential for continuous re-introductions of rabies-exposed dogs across settlements, eased by the large fluctuations of the incubation period. Bangui’s neighborhood, instead, would not be enough to self-sustain the epidemic, contrary to previous expectations. Our findings suggest that restricting long-range travels may be very efficient in limiting rabies persistence in a large and fragmented dog population. Our framework can be applied to other geographical contexts where dog rabies is endemic.","Colombi, Davide; Poletto, Chiara; Nakouné, Emmanuel; Bourhy, Hervé; Colizza, Vittoria",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,492,1

In a previous study of 68 ESS with CH, in which only one dog received corticosteroids, a median survival time of 189 days was noted. Some ESS with CH appear to improve with prednisolone treatment; therefore, we aimed to investigate the response to prednisolone in this breed. PARTICIPANTS: ESS with histologically confirmed idiopathic CH were treated with prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day. Nine female and three male ESS were enrolled (median age at diagnosis of five years). Patients were monitored clinically and had biochemistry samples taken to assess markers of hepatocellular damage and function. RESULTS: The mean starting dose of prednisolone was 1.1 mg/kg/day. All symptomatic patients showed an initial clinical improvement. Two cases were euthanased while receiving prednisolone. The median time since diagnosis is 1715 days (range: 672–2105 days) and the remaining patients are clinically well, with seven patients still receiving a mean dose of 0.4 mg/kg prednisolone every other day. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant (P<0.05) reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin following 2–4 weeks of prednisolone treatment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates improved clinical and biochemical parameters when some ESS with CH are managed with prednisolone and standard supportive treatments.","Bayton, William; Watson, Penny J; Bexfield, Nicholas H",Vet Rec,492,1

This study aimed to determine the association between social support and frequency of condom use among FSWs in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Using mixed sampling methods, we recruited 170 FSWs in Tehran in 2017. We measured self-reported social support by face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Linear regression was used to assess the association between socio-demographic characteristics (age, education level, marital status, and place of living), transactional sex characteristics (age at first transactional sex and frequency of transactional sex in the last month), HIV knowledge, social support network characteristics (social network size, duration of tie, intimacy, social support), and condom use behavior. RESULTS: Of the total of 1193 persons in FSW’s social networks, 615 (51%) were sexual partners, 529 (44%) were peer sex workers, and 36 (5%) were family members. The participants perceived moderate social support from sexual partners, low from peer sex workers, and very low from family members. Adjusted for individual and other network characteristics, peer sex worker social support (b = 0.28, 95%CI 0.06, 0.50), and family support (b = 1.12, 95%CI 0.028, 2.23) were significantly associated with condom use. CONCLUSION: Family and peer sex worker social support are associated with condom use, but less strongly than HIV knowledge or place of living. However, very few FSWs are socially connected with families. Interventions to promote condom use among this vulnerable population should also consider social and familial support.","Jorjoran Shushtari, Zahra; Mirzazadeh, Ali; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Hosseini, Seyed Ali; Sajjadi, Homeira; Salimi, Yahya; Snijders, Tom A.

Our current understanding is limited regarding the relative importance of various social determinants to mental health challenges in South Africa, and how existing racial inequities may be explained by these determinants. METHODS: This study attempted to elucidate potential social determinants of mental health in South Africa using data from the nationally representative South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1). The main outcome of interest was psychological distress, measured with the Kessler-10 scale. Hierarchical linear regression models included covariates for demographic and socioeconomic factors, count of traumatic events, and a series of stress-related constructs. Analyses were conducted on two populations: the entire sample (n = 15,981), and the African subpopulation (n = 10,723). RESULTS: Regression models on the entire sample indicated racial disparities in psychological distress, with Africans experiencing higher distress than White and Coloured individuals. Results within the African sub-population indicated geo-spatial disparities, with Africans in formal urban settings experiencing higher psychological distress than those living in formal and informal rural locales. Across both samples, results indicated a cumulative association between count of stressors and traumatic events and distress. CONCLUSION: We found racial disparities across several mental health-related domains. Africans had greater exposure to traumatic events, social stressors, and psychological distress. This research is a necessary foundation for public health interventions and policy change to effectively reduce inequities in psychological distress.

Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks and sporadic cases in children and adults worldwide and they still remain refractory to routine cell culture propagation. Recent studies have shown that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are cellular carbohydrates that serve as receptors and host susceptibility factors for human noroviruses. They evolve based on antigenic changes and differential glycan binding specificities. In the last years there have been significant advances in the knowledge of their replication mechanisms, pathogenicity and genetic evolution.

Exposure to humans and tameness of animals when exposed to humans may also imply significant costs such as the rapid spread of viruses and other microorganisms that constitute reservoirs or vectors of serious diseases. Ecotourism and nature-based tourism are factors that may affect the behavior of animals living in natural habitats, including their stress and fear responses. Here I review a scarce and scattered literature dealing with changes in animal behavior across generations and critically assess the relative importance of the mechanisms that potentially underlie these changes. Animals may show short-term changes in behavior across generations as a consequence of microevolution (a genetic change in behavior), nongenetic so-called epigenetic changes, reductions in the response to behavioral stimuli with repeated exposure to a stimulus (habituation), and the nonrandom distribution of animals that differ in behavior among sites (so-called phenotypic sorting). I conclude with a plea for future research to allow assessment of the underlying causes of long-term changes in behavior of animals exposed to human disturbance, particularly those changes caused by ecotourists’ activities.","Møller, Anders Pape",Ecotourism&#x02019;s Promise and Peril,492,28

The usefulness of thermography for mass screening has been evaluated in many recent studies; its sensitivity varies from 40 to 89.4% under various circumstances. In this chapter, we perform IRT evaluations for detecting febrile international travelers entering Japan at Nagoya Airport, immediately after the SARS epidemic, from June 2003 to February 2004, and at Naha International Airport from April 2005 to March 2009. The correlation of body surface temperature measured via thermography with the axillary temperature was significant. Through IRT, febrile individuals were detected with good accuracy and the detection accuracy was improved by corroborating surveillance with self-reporting questionnaires. However, there are several limitations associated with the use of IRT for fever screening. For instance, taking antifebrile medications results in rapid modification of the body temperature and directly affects the efficiency of IRT. To solve this unreliability and obtain higher accuracy in mass screening, we have developed a novel infection screening system using multisensor data, i.e., heart and respiration rates are determined by microwave radar in noncontact manner and facial skin temperature is monitored through IRT. The detection accuracy of the system improved, which is notably higher compared to the conventional screening method using only IRT.","Sun, Guanghao; Matsui, Takemi; Kirimoto, Tetsuo; Yao, Yu; Abe, Shigeto",Application of Infrared to Biomedical Sciences,492,12

These impacts relate to the structure of preferences in the context of a pandemic, income and time constraints, and price effects. Discussion includes accounting for differential impacts of COVID‐19 on demand for food across sociodemographic characteristics, and several high‐level issues and observations related to where and how consumers shop and what they buy. My own thinking leads me to conclude that demand‐side factors will account for most of the changes we see in retail food market. These demand‐side effects will be dominated by income effects, the opportunity cost of time, and longer planning horizons on the part of consumers.","Cranfield, John A. L.",,492,17

Applying process mining techniques to them, event logs may reveal the actual process execution and enable reasoning on quantitative or qualitative process properties. However, event logs often contain sensitive information that could be related to individual process stakeholders through background information and cross-correlation. We therefore argue that, when publishing event logs, the risk of such re-identification attacks must be considered. In this paper, we show how to quantify the re-identification risk with measures for the individual uniqueness in event logs. We also report on a large-scale study that explored the individual uniqueness in a collection of publicly available event logs. Our results suggest that potentially up to all of the cases in an event log may be re-identified, which highlights the importance of privacy-preserving techniques in process mining.","Nuñez von Voigt, Saskia; Fahrenkrog-Petersen, Stephan A.; Janssen, Dominik; Koschmider, Agnes; Tschorsch, Florian; Mannhardt, Felix; Landsiedel, Olaf; Weidlich, Matthias",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,492,5

To obtain the approximation error, the differences between numerical solutions are treated in the frame of the Inverse Problem that is posed in the variational statement with the zero order regularization. In this work we analyse the ensemble of numerical results that is obtained by five OpenFOAM solvers for the inviscid compressible flow around a cone at zero angle of attack.

The aim of this study is exploring a new approach for the control of zoonotic HEV in its main host (swine) through the design and development of an economically interesting chimeric vaccine against HEV and against a devastating swine infection: the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection. RESULTS: First, we adopted a computational approach for rational and effective screening of the different HEV-FMDV chimeric proteins. Next, we further expressed and purified the selected chimeric immunogens in Escherichia coli (E. coli) using molecular cloning techniques. Finally, we assessed the antigenicity and immunogenicity profiles of the chimeric vaccine candidates. Following this methodology, we designed and successfully produced an HEV-FMDV chimeric vaccine candidate (Seq 8-P222) that was highly over-expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein and could self-assemble into virus-like particles. Moreover, the vaccine candidate was thermo-stable and exhibited optimal antigenicity and immunogenicity properties. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the vaccine development technology by using bioinformatics for the selection of the best candidates from larger sets prior to experimentation. It also presents the first HEV-FMDV chimeric protein produced in E. coli as a promising chimeric vaccine candidate that could participate in reducing the transmission of zoonotic HEV to humans while preventing the highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease in swine.","Behloul, Nouredine; Baha, Sarra; Liu, Zhenzhen; Wei, Wenjuan; Zhu, Yuanyuan; Rao, Yuliang; Shi, Ruihua; Meng, Jihong",Microb Cell Fact,492,1

The organization has back sourced software development and abandoned a stage-based software development process with many handovers between business, IT and vendors. We collected data in four semi-structured interviews and analyzed information on changes in the structure and responsibilities of the team. The team has refined its portfolio for better cohesion, stepwise taken over the responsibility for software development from the vendor and in parallel recruited software developers, UX designers and testers. Product owners have joined the team as well. Supported by changes to the financing model, the team has transformed from mediating between business and vendors to a cross-functional product team with autonomy over its budget, backlog and software development process. As a result, the team can better balance between delivering new features and quality improvements, continuously deliver software with less overhead and focus on its mission to deliver user-friendly services with increased involvement of domain experts. Defining a clear product boundary and reducing dependencies on other teams, developing necessary skills and changing the financing model are recognized as the main success factors, as well as the main challenges in the transition process.","Mohagheghi, Parastoo; Lassenius, Casper; Bakken, Ingrid Omang",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming - Workshops,492,1

The study addressed people's support for containment policies, worries about COVID-19 consequences, and trust in sources of information. Citizens were overall satisfied with their government's response to the pandemic; however, the extent of approval differed across countries and policy measures. A north-south divide in public opinion was noticeable across the European states. It was particularly pronounced for intrusive policy measures, such as mobile data use for movement tracking, economic concerns, and trust in the information from the national government. Considerable differences in people's attitudes were noticed within countries, especially across individual regions and age groups. The findings suggest that the epidemic acts as a stressor, causing health and economic anxieties even in households that were not directly affected by the virus. At the same time, the burden of stress was unequally distributed across regions and age groups. Based on the data collected, we draw lessons from the containment stage and identify several insights that can facilitate the design of lockdown exit strategies and future containment policies so that a high level of compliance can be expected.

In this paper, the cumulative number of confirmed cases, number of confirmed cases per day and cumulative number of deaths, were used to compare transmission paths, outbreaks timelines, and coping strategies of COVID-19 in China and the US. The results revealed that: first, the COVID-19 outbreaks in both China and the US exhibited a 6-week initiation stage. In China, the COVID-19 erupted in late January. It lasted only a short period of time and was almost completely contained within 6–8 weeks. But the COVID-19 erupted in early March in the US and was still in the peak or post-peak stage. Second, in China, the COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan and spread to other regions of Hubei Province and then nationwide, exhibiting a cross(“+”)-shaped of spread with Wuhan city as the center. Importantly, the COVID-19 in China had a large concentration and there were no national outbreaks. In contrast, the COVID-19 in the US first spread through New York and the western and eastern coasts but has since emerged throughout the entire country. Third, the lack of emergency response planning in both countries in the early stage (about 6-week) hampered COVID-19 prevention. However, actively high-pressure prevention and control measures were used to basically control COVID-19 in early March in China. And then China has gradually resumed business and production activities. Unfortunately, the US government missed the best opportunity to contain the epidemic. Faced with the choice between economic recovery and coronavirus containment, the US removed the quarantine and restriction measures too early. The COVID-19 is continuing to spread in the country and blossom everywhere, still showing no signs of receding.","Feng, Zhiming; Xiao, Chiwei; Li, Peng; You, Zhen; Yin, Xu; Zheng, Fangyu",J,492,1

During the first wave of the pandemic, healthcare delivery shifted from in-person to virtual clinics. Non-urgent and some emergent procedures, including endoscopies, surgeries, and imaging, were delayed to limit the spread and divert resources to COVID-19. AIMS: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in care to IBD patients METHODS: A survey study was conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD care. All patients had a virtual clinic appointment between March to July 2020 at either: University of Alberta Hospital or the University of Calgary Clinic. A section of the survey assessed patient experience of virtual clinics and delays in access to IBD care during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1581 patients were contacted to complete the survey. 628 patients agreed to participate in the survey, however not all patients completed each component. The mean age of patients who participated in the survey was 48 years (SD = 15.19). 408 patients responded to satisfaction/future use questions: 84.3% (344) patients agree/strongly agree they were comfortable communicating to the physician using the remote system, 77.5% (316) of patients agree/strongly agree that virtual clinic is an acceptable way to receive healthcare services, 84.8% (346) of patients agree/strongly agree they would use virtual care services again, and 82.6% (337) agree/strongly agree they were satisfied with the telehealth system. Additional challenges were reported by 228 patients. Fear and stress (infection risk/mental health concerns/unemployment) was reported by 57.4% (131) patients. Access to healthcare services, PPE, and community resources was a challenge experienced by 26.3% (60) patients. Additionally, 16.2% (37) patients experienced uncertainty around IBD-specific care, including procedures, treatments, labs, and medications. Overall, 17.3% of patients reported some type of delay in care by July 2020. Table 1 shows the proportion of patients with a delay by type of care and the median delay: 5.7% of patients with IBD had surgery delayed by a median of 10 weeks (8–16 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: While some delays in healthcare delivery occurred during the first wave of the pandemic, overall 82.7% of patients with IBD maintained their care without disruption. Sustaining healthcare delivery to the IBD community required adaptation to virtual care; however, patient satisfaction was overwhelming positive among patients with IBD.

Since the onset of the pandemic, the focus of many healthcare systems has shifted toward limiting non-essential visits to hospitals in order to prioritize and allocate resources toward treating those affected by COVID-19, and preventing further exposures. While the effect of COVID-19 has been felt amongst many patient populations, those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been particularly impacted through delayed appointments and endoscopy, which is critical in disease monitoring. AIMS: We aimed to determine how changes to the provision of IBD care due to the COVID-19 pandemic have affected IBD patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using administrative data comparing IBD patients admitted to the gastroenterology ward from March 17 to August 31 2019, with IBD patients admitted from March 17 to August 31 2020 at a tertiary care centre in London, Ontario. Patients were reviewed to assess differences in care utilization and IBD-related outcomes such as hospitalization, surgery and length of stay and in-patient drug therapy. RESULTS: A total of 538 patients (259 in 2019 cohort and 279 in 2020 cohort) were reviewed with 48 and 60 IBD patients meeting the inclusion criteria for 2019 and 2020 respectively. Patient demographics were similar between 2019 and 2020 cohort for age, sex, rurality, disease type, and biologic exposure. A greater proportion of patients were admitted with IBD flares in 2020 (86.7% vs 75%, p=0.03). Furthermore, the 2020 cohort also had a 45% increase in in-patient surgical consultations (p=0.07), a 50% increase in in-patient IBD-related surgeries (p=0.39), a 69% increase in inpatient Remicade prescription (p=0.13) and a 70% increase in infectious complications at presentation to hospital (p=0.21). A shorter median length of stay was reported for patients in the 2020 cohort (4 days IQR 3.95 vs 5.85 IQR 4.65, p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen more deleterious outcomes in our IBD patients such as increased flares necessitating hospital admission. There was also a non-significant trend toward increased infectious complications as well as in-patient surgeries and need for in-patient Remicade. Though these results cannot be fully interpreted due to the need for further sampling, they suggest that IBD patients may be at-risk for poor outcomes in the current climate of medical care. Completion of this study will help define the full impact of care shifts related to reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus on IBD patients and highlight areas of care that need careful assessment and consideration to protect IBD patient health.

Reported patient compliance with submitting samples for hospital testing has been as low as 35% (2). We aimed to evaluate patient compliance with rapid home faecal calprotectin testing kits compared to hospital based testing in our university teaching hospital. METHODS: 100 patients with a diagnosis of IBD for at least 1 year and attended IBD clinic between January 2019 and August 2020 were selected. Our laboratory ceased performing FC testing in late March and we introduced home testing (BÜHLMANN IBD doc). 50 patients who were, pre-pandemic, requested to bring a stool sample to the laboratory for hospital-based ELISA testing were randomly selected. We compared these to 50 random patients who had a home-based FC testing. Patients who were supplied with home testing kits received training from IBD nurses as well as on-line training materials. Data was collated retrospectively. Compliance was recorded if result was documented within 6 weeks of request. RESULTS: Prior to the introduction of home testing, only 52% of the patients’ sampled complied with hospital-based testing. This compared to a 70% compliance rate, when home testing was requested (Figure 1). Figure 1. Comparison of percentage of compliance between hospital and home faecal calprotectin test request. CONCLUSION: The improvement in FC testing compliance with rapid home testing kit compared to laboratory based testing illustrates the benefit of adapting home testing as the standard in future. The considerable increase in compliance by home testing may be due less disruption to patient’s personal life i.e., ability to undergo testing at home, symptoms such as faecal incontinence preventing patients delivering samples to hospital and COVID pandemic compelling patients to stay at home. Adopting rapid FC home testing as standard provides patients with increased locus of control regarding their care, providing health care professionals with rapid results, thus, will improve management of IBD. The ability for patients to perform home test has obvious advantages during the COVID pandemic. REFERENCES: 1. Sands BE. Biomarkers of Inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

Cytokine signal-transduction inhibitor molecule 3 (SOCS3) is an important negative regulator of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and plays certain roles in ALV-J infection. It is of significance to confirm the roles of SOCS3 in ALV-J infection and study how this gene affects ALV-J infection. In this study, we assessed the expression of the SOCS3 gene in vivo and in vitro, and investigated the roles of SOCS3 in ALV-J infection using overexpressed or interfered assays with the SOCS3 in DF-1 cells. The results showed that the SOCS3 expression of ALV-J infected chickens was different from uninfected chickens in the spleen, thymus and cecal tonsil. Further, SOCS3 is mainly expressed in the nucleus as determined by immunofluorescence assay. Overexpression of SOCS3 in DF-1 cells promoted the replication of ALV-J virus, and the expression of interferons (IFNα and INFβ), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNFα) along with interferon-stimulating genes (CH25H, MX1, OASL, and ZAP). Conversely, interference of SOCS3 showed the opposite results. We also observed that SOCS3 promoted ALV-J virus replication by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation. In conclusion, SOCS3 promotes ALV-J replication via inhibiting the phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These results would advance further understanding of the persistent infection and the viral immune evasion of the ALV-J virus.","Mo, Guodong; Fu, Huali; Hu, Bowen; Zhang, Qihong; Xian, Mingjian; Zhang, Zihao; Lin, Ling; Shi, Meiqing; Nie, Qinghua; Zhang, Xiquan",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,492,16

In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19. We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations, beyond this set of examples.","Rubel, Laurie H.; Nicol, Cynthia; Chronaki, Anna",Educ Stud Math,492,1

RESEARCH APPROACH Cross-sectional online survey on APOSW professional listserv from 10/5/2020 to 11/20/2020. SAMPLE 101 surveys were completed by POSW from 31 states and the District of Columbia. METHODS Data were summarized descriptively and with semantic content analyses. FINDINGS Surveys were completed by social workers from diverse work settings. Seventy-five percent of social workers were deemed ""essential,"" and 45% reported working primarily from home. Most (56%) adopted a form of telehealth for patient care, although 71% did not receive telehealth training and 87% perceived lesser quality of care with telehealth. Nearly 80% of respondents reported not being able to provide optimum psychosocial care. Notable stressors on social work practice included worry about exposure to COVID-19, limited resources, lack of contact with and increased emotional needs of patients and families, managing patient and family concerns about COVID-19, and isolation from colleagues. Inequity and social justice issues were identified. Despite challenges, over 60% of POSW endorsed positive changes to their work life resulting from the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, POSW have adapted to a changing work environment, different modes of service provision, and stark health inequities to meet the needs of patients and families in a crisis. IMPLICATIONS FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL PROVIDERS COVID-19 vastly impacted the personal and professional lives of POSW, warranting attentiveness to lessons learned and future directions.","Wiener, Lori; Fry, Abigail; Pelletier, Wendy; Cincotta, Nancy; Jones, Barbara",Journal of psychosocial oncology,492,24

The aim of the current study was to identify family-related non-abuse adverse life experiences occurring for adults with eating disorders, and to establish whether they occur for people with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder more than the general population and other psychiatric populations. Method A systematic review of studies focusing on family-related non-abuse adverse life experiences and eating disorders was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search string was applied to four electronic databases including Psycinfo, PubMed/Medline, CINAHL Plus and EMBASE. Results Of the 26 studies selected for inclusion, six types of family-related non-abuse adverse life experiences were identified: adverse parenting style; family disharmony; loss of a family member, relative or close person; familial mental health issues; family comments about eating, or shape, weight and appearance; and family disruptions. Findings provided tentative evidence for eating disorder specific (i.e. parental demands and criticism) and non-specific (i.e. familial loss and family disruptions) non-abuse adversities, with findings also suggesting that those with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder were more impacted by loss, family separations and negative parent-child interactions compared to those with anorexia nervosa. Conclusions This review provides a clear synthesis of previous findings relating to family-related non-abuse adverse life experiences and eating disorders in adults. Implications for trauma-informed care in clinical practice were discussed (e.g. considering the impact of past life events, understanding the function of ED behaviours, reducing the risk of potential re-traumatisation).","Grogan, Katie; MacGarry, Diarmuid; Bramham, Jessica; Scriven, Mary; Maher, Caroline; Fitzgerald, Amanda",Journal of eating disorders,492,17

In addition, a textile or silicone band restricts food passage through the stomach. CASE PRESENTATION A 71-year-old woman presented with a severe gastric stenosis 11 years after vertical gastroplasty. We describe a side-to-side gastrogastrostomy as a safe surgical procedure to restore the physiological gastric passage after failed vertical-banded gastroplasty. CONCLUSION Occasionally, restrictive procedures for morbid obesity cannot be converted into an alternative bariatric procedure to maintain weight control. This report demonstrates that a side-to-side gastrogastrostomy is a feasible and safe procedure.","Soll, Christopher; Müller, Markus K; Wildi, Stefan; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Weber, Markus",Journal of medical case reports,492,1

Several management factors, such as commingling of calves and large group size, predispose calves to diseases. Acute phase proteins are sensitive detectors of calf diseases. We studied the associations between group size, serum acute phase proteins, immunoglobulin G (IgG), calf morbidity and growth of dairy-beef calves in a random field trial in a calf-rearing unit in Finland. The randomized trial was carried out at a calf rearing unit, where approximately 80 dairy or crossbred calves were allocated either into a single group of 40 calves or into four groups of 10 on arrival at the calf-rearing unit (at age 24.1 SD ± 9.2 days). The study was carried out on 6 arrival batches: 476 calves. Calves were clinically examined and blood sampled on arrival (day 0), and haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), albumin and IgG were determined. Calves were weighed on arrival (day 0, average age 24.1 days), at the end of the milk feed period (day 49), at approximately 200 days of age and at slaughter (carcass weight) at 15-18 months of age. During the rearing calves were observed by the farm workers and treated, if necessary, according to predetermined instructions of the veterinary surgeon. All NSAID and antimicrobial treatments were recorded and used as morbidity indicators in statistical analysis. There were no differences in the numbers of antimicrobial treatments or growth among the groups. The majority (84.1%) of antimicrobial treatments were used against respiratory tract infections. Higher concentrations of albumin and IgG on arrival extended the time before the first and the second antimicrobial treatments. Complex relationships between group size, morbidity, concentrations of serum acute phase proteins and IgG at arrival, and growth of calves were explored. Group size of 10 calves did not protect calves from respiratory tract infections, when the small groups were sharing the air space with a large group. An increased SAA concentration on arrival was associated with poorer average daily gain at two rearing periods and with lower carcass weight at slaughter. Serum proteins could be valuable health indicators for purchased calves because they have numerous and variable associations with health and growth. The mechanisms that connect increased SAA concentration and poorer average daily gain over the long term remain unclear.","Seppä-Lassila, Leena; Oksanen, Jarkko; Herva, Tuomas; Dorbek-Kolin, Elisabeth; Kosunen, Heli; Parviainen, Laura; Soveri, Timo; Orro, Toomas",Preventive veterinary medicine,492,1

Only limited observer reliability data exist. We tested inter- and intra-observer reliability for the assessment of CTA in acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS We selected 15 cases from the Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3, ISRCTN25765518) with various degrees of arterial obstruction in different intracranial locations on CTA. To assess inter-observer reliability, seven members of the IST-3 expert image reading panel (>5 years experience reading CTA) and seven radiology trainees (<2 years experience) rated all 15 scans independently and blind to clinical data for: presence (versus absence) of any intracranial arterial abnormality (stenosis or occlusion), severity of arterial abnormality using relevant scales (IST-3 angiography score, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, Clot Burden Score), collateral supply and visibility of a perfusion defect on CTA source images (CTA-SI). Intra-observer reliability was assessed using independently repeated expert panel scan ratings. We assessed observer agreement with Krippendorff's-alpha (K-alpha). RESULTS Among experienced observers, inter-observer agreement was substantial for the identification of any angiographic abnormality (K-alpha = 0.70) and with an angiography assessment scale (K-alpha = 0.60-0.66). There was less agreement for grades of collateral supply (K-alpha = 0.56) or for identification of a perfusion defect on CTA-SI (K-alpha = 0.32). Radiology trainees performed as well as expert readers when additional training was undertaken (neuroradiology specialist trainees). Intra-observer agreement among experts provided similar results (K-alpha = 0.33-0.72). CONCLUSION For most imaging characteristics assessed, CTA has moderate to substantial observer agreement in acute ischaemic stroke. Experienced readers and those with specialist training perform best.","Mair, Grant; von Kummer, Rüdiger; Adami, Alessandro; White, Philip M; Adams, Matthew E; Yan, Bernard; Demchuk, Andrew M; Farrall, Andrew J; Sellar, Robin J; Ramaswamy, Rajesh; Mollison, Daisy; Boyd, Elena V; Rodrigues, Mark A; Samji, Karim; Baird, Andrew J; Cohen, Geoff; Sakka, Eleni; Palmer, Jeb; Perry, David; Lindley, Richard; Sandercock, Peter A G; Wardlaw, Joanna M",Neuroradiology,492,20

The authors hypothesized that topical vancomycin, applied in powder form directly to the subgaleal space during closure, would reduce cranial wound infection rates. METHODS A cohort of 150 consecutive patients who underwent craniotomy was studied retrospectively. Seventy-five patients received 1 g of vancomycin powder applied in the subgaleal space at the time of closure. This group was compared with 75 matched-control patients who were accrued over the same time interval and did not receive vancomycin. The primary outcome measure was the presence of surgical site infection within 3 months. Secondary outcome measures included tissue pH from a subgaleal drain and vancomycin levels from the subgaleal space and serum. RESULTS Vancomycin was associated with significantly fewer surgical site infections (1 of 75) than was standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone (5 of 75; p < 0.05). Cultures were positive for typical skin flora species. As expected, local measured vancomycin concentrations peaked immediately after surgery (mean ± SD 499 ± 37 μg/ml) and gradually decreased over 12 hours. Vancomycin in the circulating serum remained undetectable. Subgaleal topical vancomycin was associated with a lower incidence of surgical site infections after craniotomy. The authors attribute this reduction in the infection rate to local vancomycin concentrations well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for antimicrobial efficacy. CONCLUSIONS Topical vancomycin is safe and effective for reducing surgical site infections after craniotomy. These data support the need for a prospective randomized examination of topical vancomycin in the setting of cranial surgery.","Abdullah, Kalil G; Attiah, Mark A; Olsen, Andrew S; Richardson, Andrew; Lucas, Timothy H",Journal of neurosurgery,492,1

Spectral analysis (dominant frequency, DF) and quantification of waveform amplitude, regularity (URI) and complexity (NDI) were performed over a median of 24 minutes of VF. RF ablation was performed during VF in two patients. Results - There was a significant increase in DF between VF onset and termination but none of the other parameters significantly changed. Some VF parameters varied from patient to patient and from lead to lead. DF decreased after RF ablation in both cases and VF terminated spontaneously shortly after ablation in one case. The previously incessant VFs in these two patients did not recur afterward. Conclusions - VF rate increases over time in patients with left ventricular assist devices and is lowered by ablation.

Aim The aim of this study is to check the differences in the periodontal status of individuals based on their current tobacco consumption status and type of tobacco consumption. Materials and Methods This study was conducted among subjects attending a teaching dental institution in Andhra Pradesh. Subjects were divided into three groups based on their current tobacco consumption status. The following parameters were recorded after examination by two calibrated investigators: number of sites with bleeding on probing; number of teeth with periodontal pockets; number of teeth with clinical attachment loss of ≥5 mm; number of teeth lost. SPSS version 20 software was used to analyze the data. Results While current users demonstrated poor periodontal status than the former and nonusers, there was a significant difference in periodontal health between former users and nonusers in all the study parameters except the mean number of teeth lost. Among current users, the mean percentage of sites with bleeding and attachment loss >5 mm were found to be least among smokers compared to tobacco chewers and those who consume both smoke and smokeless forms of tobacco. Conclusion The study confirms the negative influence of tobacco consumption on periodontal health and also establishes the increased destruction of clinical attachment levels among tobacco chewers compared to smokers.","Yaragani, Anusha; Sushuma, Kvr; Guduri, Vineeth; Thirumalasetty, S S Manikanta Kumar; Vishnubhotla, Gautam; Kandikatla, Pradeep; Chandu, Viswa Chaitanya",Journal of family medicine and primary care,492,24

However, recombinant adenoviral technology is laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Here, we present an improved protocol using the pAdEasy system to obtain purified adenoviral particles that can induce a strong green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in transduced cells. The advantages of this improved method are faster preparation and decreased production cost compared to the original method developed by Bert Vogelstein. The main steps of the adenoviral technology are: (1) the recombination of pAdTrack-GFP with the pAdEasy-1 plasmid in BJ5183 bacteria; (2) the packaging of the adenoviral particles; (3) the amplification of the adenovirus in AD293 cells; (4) the purification of the adenoviral particles from cell lysate and culture medium; and (5) the viral titration and functional testing of the adenovirus. The improvements to the original method consist of (i) the recombination in BJ5183-containing pAdEasy-1 by chemical transformation of bacteria; (ii) the selection of recombinant clones by ""negative"" and ""positive"" PCR; (iii) the transfection of AD293 cells using the K2 transfection system for adenoviral packaging; (iv) the precipitation with ammonium sulfate of the viral particles released by AD293 cells in cell culture medium; and (v) the purification of the virus by one-step cesium chloride discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation. A strong expression of the gene of interest (in this case, GFP) was obtained in different types of transduced cells (such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells) from various sources (human, bovine, murine).

A 54-year-old public transportation company worker, previously treated for an alcohol use disorder three times, and abstinent since his last treatment in 2017, reported anxiety, irritability, and constant fear of relapse due to increased exposure to sanitizers during the pandemic. He explained that while the diluted disinfectant made him think of alcohol, the now ever-present undiluted disinfectant makes him constantly crave alcohol and it makes it harder for him to work. Although he started group therapy treatment and had several follow-up visits, his poor performance at work and the fear of relapse resulted in him requesting a position change to work in open spaces and avoid the smell of disinfectant, which helped him remain abstinent. Disinfectants are a part of the ""new normal,"" and their increased use is likely to be continued in the years to come, even after the pandemic resolves.

METHODOLOGY A total of 146 children under 5 years visiting the PGHB for ARI between August and December 2016 were recruited, and socio-demographic information, clinical data and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. The samples were analysed by a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction targeting 15 different viruses. RESULTS Of 146 samples collected, 84 (57.5 %) displayed a positive result of at least one of the 15 viruses. The overall prevalence of HRSV was 21.2 %. HRSV A (30, 20.5 %) was the virus the most detected, followed by HRV (24, 16.4 %), PIV3 (20, 16.6) and ADV (7, 4.79 %). The other viruses were detected in three or fewer cases. There were only 11 (7.5 %) cases of co-infection. HRSV infection, malnutrition, younger age, rural settings, low income and mother illiteracy were associated with the risk of ARI being diagnosed as LRTI in bivariate analyses but, after adjusting for the confounding factors, only HRSV infection and younger age were independently associated with LRTI. CONCLUSION The prevalence of HRSV is high among children visiting the PGHB for ARI.

We test whether the inter-state differences in mobility influenced changes in reported psychological distress. Our study is not on the surge in COVID-19 in the later part of 2020. OBJECTIVE To identify whether the change in state-level mobility is associated with the change in individuals' reported psychological distress during the early COVID-19 pandemic and whether the intensity of the association varies by older individuals, females, and nonwhites. METHODS We use differences in state-level mobility and change in reported psychological distress between the two dates of interviews of 5,132 individuals who participated in March and April 2020 waves of Understanding America Study (UAS). RESULTS We find support for modest effects, i.e., a one standard deviation decline in mobility was associated with a 3.02% higher psychological distress [95% CI: 0.4%-5.64%], and the effects are robust to controlling for reported changes in exercise intensity, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, recreational drug use, and meditation intensity. We also find support for a stronger association for females, but not for older individuals or non-whites. Further, we do not find support for the mediation effects from change in chance of running out of money or change in chance of getting COVID-19. CONCLUSION Our findings show that reduced mobility from lockdowns during the early COVID-19 wave in the US is associated with a modest increase in reported psychological distress, especially for females. However, these conclusions should not be construed as a small increase in psychological distress in general, as a variety of non-mobility related factors associated with COVID-19 could have exacerbated psychological distress during the early COVID-19 wave in the US.","Devaraj, Srikant; Patel, Pankaj C",Social science & medicine,492,1

We developed a Monte Carlo simulation model representing the U.S. population and what can happen to each person who gets infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). We estimate resource use and direct medical costs per infection and at the national level, with various ""attack rates"" (infection rates) to understand the potential economic benefits of reducing the burden of the disease. A single symptomatic COVID-19 infection would cost a median of $3,045 in direct medical costs incurred only during the course of the infection. Eighty percent of the U.S. population getting infected could result in a median of 44.6 million hospitalizations, 10.7 million ICU admissions, 6.5 million ventilators used, and 249.5 million hospital bed days, costing $654.0 billion in direct costs over the course of the pandemic. If 20% were to become infected, there would be a median of 11.2 million hospitalizations, 62.3 million hospital bed days, and 1.6 million ventilators used, costing $163.4 billion.

As one major gastropod lineage, the patellogastropods show different characters in its shell field morphogenesis compared to other gastropods (e.g., the pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis), likely related to its epibolic gastrulation. The investigation on the shell field morphogenesis of patellogastropods would be useful to reveal the lineage-specific characters in the process and explore the deep conservation among different molluscan lineages. RESULTS We investigated the early shell field morphogenesis in the patellogastropod Lottia goshimai using multiple techniques. Electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological characters for the central and peripheral cells of the characteristic rosette-like shell field. Gene expression analysis and F-actin staining suggested that the shell field morphogenesis in this species predominantly relied on cell movement and F-actin dynamics, while BrdU assay revealed that cell proliferation contributed little to the process. We found constant contacts between ectodermal and meso/endodermal tissues during the early stages of shell field morphogenesis, which did not support the induction of shell field by endodermal tissues in general, but a potential stage-specific induction was indicated. CONCLUSIONS Our results emphasize the roles of cell movement and F-actin dynamics during the morphogenesis of the shell field in Lo. goshimai, and suggest potential regulators such as diffusible factors and F-actin modulators. These findings reflect the differences in shell field morphogenesis of different gastropods, and add to the knowledge of molluscan larval shell formation.","Yang, Weihong; Huan, Pin; Liu, Baozhong",BMC developmental biology,492,1

In this trial, we compared the survival and safety of NCRT plus surgery with surgery alone in patients with locally advanced ESCC. Patients and Methods From June 2007 to December 2014, 451 patients with potentially resectable thoracic ESCC, clinically staged as T1-4N1M0/T4N0M0, were randomly allocated to NCRT plus surgery (group CRT; n = 224) and surgery alone (group S; n = 227). In group CRT, patients received vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV day 1, or 25 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 4 every 3 weeks for two cycles, with a total concurrent radiation dose of 40.0 Gy administered in 20 fractions of 2.0 Gy on 5 days per week. In both groups, patients underwent McKeown or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. The primary end point was overall survival. Results The pathologic complete response rate was 43.2% in group CRT. Compared with group S, group CRT had a higher R0 resection rate (98.4% v 91.2%; P = .002), a better median overall survival (100.1 months v 66.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .025), and a prolonged disease-free survival (100.1 months v 41.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P < .001). Leukopenia (48.9%) and neutropenia (45.7%) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during chemoradiotherapy. Incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups, with the exception of arrhythmia (group CRT: 13% v group S: 4.0%; P = .001). Peritreatment mortality was 2.2% in group CRT versus 0.4% in group S ( P = .212). Conclusion This trial shows that NCRT plus surgery improves survival over surgery alone among patients with locally advanced ESCC, with acceptable and manageable adverse events.","Yang, Hong; Liu, Hui; Chen, Yuping; Zhu, Chengchu; Fang, Wentao; Yu, Zhentao; Mao, Weimin; Xiang, Jiaqing; Han, Yongtao; Chen, Zhijian; Yang, Haihua; Wang, Jiaming; Pang, Qingsong; Zheng, Xiao; Yang, Huanjun; Li, Tao; Lordick, Florian; D'Journo, Xavier Benoit; Cerfolio, Robert J; Korst, Robert J; Novoa, Nuria M; Swanson, Scott J; Brunelli, Alessandro; Ismail, Mahmoud; Fernando, Hiran C; Zhang, Xu; Li, Qun; Wang, Geng; Chen, Baofu; Mao, Teng; Kong, Min; Guo, Xufeng; Lin, Ting; Liu, Mengzhong; Fu, Jianhua",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,492,19

The main purpose was to develop an easily implemented score for such prediction. METHODS This was an observational, multicenter, development and validation study on a national critical care dataset of COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature review was performed to determine variables possibly important for COVID-19 mortality prediction. Using a logistic multivariable model with a LASSO penalty, we developed the Rapid Evaluation of Coronavirus Illness Severity (RECOILS) score and compared its performance against published scores. RESULTS Our development (validation) cohort consisted of 1480 (937) adult patients from 14 (11) Dutch ICUs admitted between March 2020 and April 2021. Median age was 65 (65) years, 31% (26%) died in hospital, 74% (72%) were males, average length of ICU stay was 7.83 (10.25) days and average length of hospital stay was 15.90 (19.92) days. Age, platelets, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, pH, blood urea nitrogen, temperature, PaCO2, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score measured within +/- 24 hours of ICU admission were used to develop the score. The AUROC of RECOILS score was 0.75 (CI 0.71-0.78) which was higher than that of any previously reported predictive scores (0.68 (CI 0.64-0.71), 0.61 (CI 0.58-0.66), 0.67 (CI 0.63-0.70), 0.70 (CI 0.67-0.74) for ISARIC 4C Mortality Score, SOFA, SAPS-III, and age, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Using a large dataset from multiple Dutch ICUs, we developed a predictive score for mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU, which outperformed other predictive scores reported so far.","Plečko, Drago; Bennett, Nicolas; Mårtensson, Johan; Dam, Tariq A; Entjes, Robert; Rettig, Thijs C D; Dongelmans, Dave A; Boelens, Age D; Rigter, Sander; Hendriks, Stefaan H A; de Jong, Remko; Kamps, Marlijn J A; Peters, Marco; Karakus, Attila; Gommers, Diederik; Ramnarain, Dharmanand; Wils, Evert-Jan; Achterberg, Sefanja; Nowitzky, Ralph; van den Tempel, Walter; de Jager, Cornelis P C; Nooteboom, Fleur G C A; Oostdijk, Evelien; Koetsier, Peter; Cornet, Alexander D; Reidinga, Auke C; de Ruijter, Wouter; Bosman, Rob J; Frenzel, Tim; Urlings-Strop, Louise C; de Jong, Paul; Smit, Ellen G M; Cremer, Olaf L; Mehagnoul-Schipper, D Jannet; Faber, Harald J; Lens, Judith; Brunnekreef, Gert B; Festen-Spanjer, Barbara; Dormans, Tom; de Bruin, Daan P; Lalisang, Robbert C A; Vonk, Sebastiaan J J; Haan, Martin E; Fleuren, Lucas M; Thoral, Patrick J; Elbers, Paul W G; Bellomo, Rinaldo",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,492,2

METHODS Twenty-three IRE ablation zones were created in 4 Yorkshire pig livers percutaneously under image guidance. A prototype generator was used (Ethicon Endo-surgery, Cincinnati, Ohio). Variable spacing of paired electrodes between 1 and 2.0 cm was used. Contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT scans were obtained. Pigs were killed after 5 to 6 hours for gross pathology sectioning with routine and vital histological stains. Computed tomography images were analyzed using 3-dimensional software, and ablation zone size measured on CT was correlated with pathologically determined size. RESULTS Nineteen of 19 ablation zones created with up to 1.5-cm spacing showed fusion between individual ablation zones generated by each electrode. Ablation zones were isodense precontrast and hypodense to liver postcontrast, with best delineation in the portal phase. Nine of these had nondistorted circumferential margins on both CT and gross pathology suitable for correlation, and among these, size measurements on CT were closely correlated with pathologically determined ablation zone size. Most importantly, on the delayed venous phase, there is internal enhancement within the ablation zone itself, except for small perielectrode zones that remained hypodense. On histopathology, IRE ablation zones showed preserved microvasculature with congestion of sinusoids, except for small perielectrode zones where coagulative changes were suggested. CONCLUSION Portal phase contrast-enhanced CT scans correlate well with liver IRE ablation size and shape on histopathology.","Lee, Young Joon; Lu, David S K; Osuagwu, Ferdnand; Lassman, Charles",Journal of computer assisted tomography,492,1

Tears in these tendons are common and often debilitating. There is uncertainty regarding both the histological and macroscopic features of hip abductor tears. This study aims to clarify both the macroscopic and microscopic features of the tendon and enthesis in hip abductor tendon tears. METHODS Thirty-six cadavers with an average age of 81 were dissected, and the hip abductor mechanisms removed en-bloc. The presence, location and size of the tears were recorded and analysed. The samples were processed into histological blocks and viewed using both transmitted and polarised light. Tendon histology was graded using the modified Movin's score in three sections (deep, middle and superficial layers) and the enthesis graded separately using 5-point criteria. Analysis of variance was used to confirm histological features associated with tears. RESULTS Tears were found in 24 of 36 samples (67%). The most common finding was an isolated tear in the gluteus minimus (46%), followed by concurrent gluteus medius and gluteus minimus tears (33%). Histology revealed significantly more degeneration in both the tendon (p = 0.0005) and enthesis (p = 0.0011) when tears were present. Furthermore, these changes were concentrated in the deeper layers of the tendon (p = 0.0002) and enthesis (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated degeneration as the primary pathology underlying hip abductor tendon tears. Degenerative changes occur in both the tendon and enthesis, with the deeper layers predominantly affected. These findings are important for guiding surgical repair techniques and to aid the development of novel materials and biologics.","Zhu, Mark F; Smith, Brittany; Krishna, Sanjeev; Musson, David S; Riordan, Peter R; McGlashan, Sue R; Cornish, Jillian; Munro, Jacob T",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,492,5

Consequently, a high-quality cancer screening program should consider individuals' values and preferences when determining recommendations. In cervical cancer screening, offering women autonomy is considered a ""person-centered"" approach to health care services; however, it may impact the effectiveness of the program should women choose to not participate. As part of a larger project to investigate women's cervical screening preferences and correlates of these preferences, this systematic review will capture quantitative and qualitative investigations of women's cervical screening preferences and the methods used to elicit them. DESIGN AND METHODS This mixed methods synthesis will use a thematic analysis approach to synthesize qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods evidence. This protocol describes the methods that will be used in this investigation. A search strategy has been developed with a health librarian and peer reviewed using PRESS. Based on this strategy, five databases and the gray literature will be searched for studies that meet the inclusion criteria. The quality of the included individual studies will be examined using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Three reviewers will extract data from the primary studies on the tools or instruments used to elicit women's preferences regarding cervical cancer screening, theoretical frameworks used, outcomes measured, the outstanding themes from quantitative and qualitative evidence, and the identified preferences for cervical cancer screening. We will describe the relationships between study results and the study population, ""intervention"" (e.g., tool or instrument), and context. We will follow the PRISMA reporting guideline. We will compare findings across studies and between study methods (e.g., qualitative versus quantitative study designs). The strength of the synthesized findings will be assessed using the validated GRADE and CERQual tool. DISCUSSION This review will inform the development of a tool to elicit women's cervical screening preferences. Understanding the methods used to elicit women's preferences and what is known about women's cervical screening preferences will be useful for guideline developers who wish to incorporate a woman-centered approach specifically for cervical screening guidelines.

We hypothesized that interhospital transfer to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation. METHODS STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital transfer or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0-2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and transfer patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass. RESULTS A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for transfer patients (P<0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the transfer group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.79; P=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of direct patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of transfer patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.92; P=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for transfer; P=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all transferred patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed directly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier. CONCLUSIONS In this large, real-world study, interhospital transfer was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and direct routing to endovascular-capable centers for patients with severe stroke may improve outcomes.

Typically, TMB is evaluated by comprehensive genomic profiling but this requires use of finite tissue specimens and costly, time-consuming laboratory processes. Histologic subtype classification represents an established component of lung adenocarcinoma histopathology, but can be challenging and is associated with substantial inter-pathologist variability. Here we developed a deep learning system to both classify histologic patterns in lung adenocarcinoma and predict TMB status using de-identified Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images. We first trained a convolutional neural network to map histologic features across whole slide images of lung cancer resection specimens. On evaluation using an external data source, this model achieved patch-level area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78-0.98 across nine histologic features. We then integrated the output of this model with clinico-demographic data to develop an interpretable model for TMB classification. The resulting end-to-end system was evaluated on 172 held out cases from TCGA, achieving an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.80). The benefit of using histologic features in predicting TMB is highlighted by the significant improvement this approach offers over using the clinical features alone (AUC of 0.63 [95% CI 0.53-0.72], p = 0.002). Furthermore, we found that our histologic subtype-based approach achieved performance similar to that of a weakly supervised approach (AUC of 0.72 [95% CI 0.64-0.80]). Together these results underscore that incorporating histologic patterns in biomarker prediction for lung cancer provides informative signals, and that interpretable approaches utilizing these patterns perform comparably with less interpretable, weakly supervised approaches.","Sadhwani, Apaar; Chang, Huang-Wei; Behrooz, Ali; Brown, Trissia; Auvigne-Flament, Isabelle; Patel, Hardik; Findlater, Robert; Velez, Vanessa; Tan, Fraser; Tekiela, Kamilla; Wulczyn, Ellery; Yi, Eunhee S; Mermel, Craig H; Hanks, Debra; Chen, Po-Hsuan Cameron; Kulig, Kimary; Batenchuk, Cory; Steiner, David F; Cimermancic, Peter",Scientific reports,492,33

We hypothesize that these challenges can be addressed with the targeted and controlled delivery of thrombolytic drugs or precision drug delivery. A porous and magnetic microbubble platform is developed to formulate tPA. This system can maintain the tPA activity during circulation, be magnetically guided to the thrombi, and then remotely activated for drug release. The ultrasound stimulation also improves the drug penetration into thrombi. In a mouse model of venous thrombosis, the residual thrombus decreased by 67.5% when compared to conventional injection of tPA. The penetration of tPA by ultrasound was up to several hundred micrometers in thrombi. This strategy not only improves the therapeutic efficacy but also accelerates the lytic rate, enabling it to be promising in time-critical thrombolytic therapy.","Wang, Siyu; Guo, Xixi; Xiu, Weijun; Liu, Yang; Ren, Lili; Xiao, Huaxin; Yang, Fang; Gao, Yu; Xu, Chenjie; Wang, Lianhui",Science advances,492,1

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to describe the content of COVID-19 material on TikTok. Methods A total of 100 videos posted under the hashtag #Coronavirus were included in this study along with all (n=17) posts uploaded by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results Overall, these videos were viewed 1,194,081,700 times. The most commonly cited topics included anxiety (14.5%) with more than 190.6 million views and quarantine (10.3%) with 106.6 million views. Fewer than 10% of videos mentioned how the virus is transmitted, symptoms, and prevention. WHO videos more often focused on viral transmission and symptoms but covered these topics in fewer than 10% of the videos. Conclusions Although research suggests that cases of COVID-19 may be less severe in those under 18 years of age, social distancing remains paramount due to the possibility of transmission even in those with minimal or no symptoms. For young adults in particular, the WHO suggests staying connected through social media and making every attempt to stay positive.

RESULTS Variables associated with favorable clinical outcome included NIHSS, TL, TTR and TICI score (p ≤ 0.01) with NIHSS ≤ 15 (p = 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.87), TL ≤ 2 cm (p = 0.017, AUC 0.75), TTR ≤ 231 min (p = 0.001 AUC 0.88) and TICI ≥ 2b (p = 0.050, AUC 0.70). Shorter TTR and higher TICI scores were associated with favorable radiological outcome (p < 0.001) with TTR ≤ 224 min (p = 0.023, AUC 0.77) and TICI ≥ 2b (p = 0.000, AUC 0.86). CONCLUSION Fast and complete recanalization is essential to achieve a favorable radiological and functional outcome after mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. Age, CBS and collateral supply play a subordinate role.","Kaschka, Iris N; Kloska, Stephan P; Struffert, Tobias; Engelhorn, Tobias; Gölitz, Philipp; Kurka, Natalia; Köhrmann, Martin; Schwab, Stefan; Doerfler, Arnd",The neuroradiology journal,492,1

The clinical efficacy of stapled side-to-side anastomosis using a laparoscopic stapling device during alimentary reconstruction in PD is not well understood and its superiority over conventional hand-sewn end-to-side anastomosis remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the stapled side-to-side anastomosis in preventing the development of DGE after PD. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 137 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, as subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD; n = 130), or conventional whipple procedure (n = 7) with Child reconstruction, between January 2010 and May 2014. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had had a stapled side-to-side anastomosis (SA group; n = 57) or a conventional hand-sewn end-to-side anastomosis (HA group; n = 80). RESULTS SA reduced the operative time (SA vs. HA: 508 vs. 557 min, p = 0.028) and the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (SA vs. HA: 21.1 vs. 46.3%, p = 0.003) and was associated with shorter hospitalization (SA vs. HA: 33 vs. 39.5 days, p = 0.007). In this cohort, SA was the only significant factor contributing to a reduction in the incidence of DGE (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Stapled side-to-side gastrojejunostomy reduced the operative time and the incidence of DGE following PD with Child reconstruction, thereby also reducing the length of hospitalization.","Murata, Yasuhiro; Tanemura, Akihiro; Kato, Hiroyuki; Kuriyama, Naohisa; Azumi, Yoshinori; Kishiwada, Masashi; Mizuno, Shugo; Usui, Masanobu; Sakurai, Hiroyuki; Isaji, Shuji",Surgery today,492,32

While school feeding programs are ubiquitous in LMICs, the specific benefits of school feeding programs are unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the impacts of school feeding programs on the educational and health outcomes of children and adolescents in LMICs. METHODS Rigorously designed interventional studies on the impacts of school feeding on nutritional and health outcomes of children and adolescents receiving primary or secondary education in LMICs will be included. The following information sources were used to identify relevant published or unpublished studies: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and governmental or organizational websites. The risk of bias of randomized and non-randomized studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the ROBINS-I tool, respectively. Two reviewers will independently conduct the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis of all the included studies will be provided. Meta-analyses will be performed whenever appropriate. Heterogeneity of effects will be assessed by I2, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression. The certainty of evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DISCUSSION The design and implementation of school feeding programs in LMICs should be based on the understanding of the benefits of such programs. This work will provide a crucial evidence base for the educational and health benefits of school feeding on children and adolescents in LMICs.

The usefulness of the complimentary application of targeted monitoring and GREAT-ER simulations is demonstrated with case studies for three pharmaceuticals in selected German watersheds. Comparison with monitoring data corroborates the capability of the probabilistic model approach to predict the expected range of spatial surface water concentrations. Explicit consideration of local pharmaceutical emissions from hospitals or private doctor's offices (e.g., for X-ray contrast agents) can improve predictions on the local scale without compromising regional exposure assessment. Pharmaceuticals exhibiting low concentrations hardly detectable with established analytical methods (e.g., EE2) can be evaluated with model simulations. Management scenarios allow for a priori assessment of risk reduction measures. In combination with targeted monitoring approaches, the GREAT-ER model can serve as valuable support tool for exposure and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in whole watersheds.","Lämmchen, Volker; Niebaum, Gunnar; Berlekamp, Jürgen; Klasmeier, Jörg",Environmental science and pollution research international,492,1

The size limit of cysts and the methodology for a safe and successful minimally invasive surgery has not been established. Here we report a case of a large 10-kg multi-locular ovarian mass, which was successfully laparoscopically removed: Our aim was to innovate the surgical practice in this field by providing a safe, effective, and minimally invasive management method for such complex and rare cases. CASE SUMMARY A 49-year-old nulliparous woman presented with abdominal distension, lasting from six Mo prior to admission; she reported worsening abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, and mild dyspnea. Imaging showed a presumed benign multi-locular (> 10 locules) left ovarian cyst that measured about 30 cm in diameter. Based on the IOTA-ADNEX model the mass had a 27.5% risk of being a borderline or malignant tumor. The patient was successfully treated via a direct laparoscopic approach with salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by the external drainage of the cyst. Tumor spillage was successfully avoided during this procedure. The final volume of the drained mucinous content was 8950 L; the cyst wall, extracted through the minilaparotomy, weighed about 1200 g. The pathologic gross examination revealed a 24 cm × 15 cm × 10 cm mass; the histologic examination diagnosed a mucinous cystoadenoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a giant multi-locular ovarian cyst treated with a direct laparoscopy with salpingo-oophorectomy followed by external decompression. CONCLUSION Choosing the appropriate technique and surgeon skill are necessary for a safe and effective minimally-invasive approach of unique cases involving giant ovarian cysts.","Sanna, Elisabetta; Madeddu, Clelia; Melis, Luca; Nemolato, Sonia; Macciò, Antonio",World journal of clinical cases,492,8

The American and European guidelines leave decisions about antihypertensive treatment in frail, institutionalized patients up to the treating physician. We therefore systematically searched the literature for publications on the phamacotherapy of arterial hypertension in frail patients. METHODS The MEDLINE, Embase, and Central databases were systematically searched for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies, including observational studies, on the pharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension in elderly patients since the introduction of the concept of frailty, published over the period 1992-2017. RESULTS Out of 19 282 citations for randomized, controlled trials and 5659 for non-randomized trials and observational studies, four RCTs and three observational studies were included in the further analysis. The included RCTs showed a trend to- wards a benefit from pharmacotherapy of hypertension in frail patients with respect to mortality, cardiovascular disease, functional status, and quality of life. On the other hand, some of the observational studies indicated a lower rate of falls and lower mortality among patients who received no antihypertensive treatment. CONCLUSION In view of the conflicting findings of RCTs and non-randomized studies, the lower representation of frail subjects in RCTs, and the high risk of bias in non- randomized studies, the findings of the studies included in this review do not enable the formulation of any strictly evidence-based treatment recommendations. As a rule of thumb, the authors propose that a target systolic blood pressure of <150 mmHg should be aimed at in patients whose gait speed is less than 0.8 m/s, while a target range of 130-139 mmHg can be set for patients over age 80 who are no more than mildly frail.","Mühlbauer, Viktoria; Dallmeier, Dhayana; Brefka, Simone; Bollig, Claudia; Voigt-Radloff, Sebastian; Denkinger, Michael",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,492,11

We report our initial experience of complete laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for patients with upper urinary tract urothelial cancer (UTUC). METHODS A total of four patients with UTUC underwent complete laparoscopic RNU combined with transvesical laparoscopic excision of the distal ureter using three 5-mm ports. Transvaginal specimen extraction was applied in female patients to reduce incisional pain and improve cosmesis. Peri-operative complications were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Postoperative pain was evaluated during hospitalization using a numeric pain rating scale (scales of 1 to 10). Patients who underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery combined with open excision of the distal ureter during the same period were included as a control group (conventional RNU, consisting of laparoscopic nephrectomy combined with open bladder cuff excision) for pain scale evaluation. RESULTS The novel surgery was successfully completed for all four patients (two males and two females). The mean pneumoperitoneum time for retroperitoneoscopic nephroureterectomy and specimen extraction was 174 min, while the mean pneumovesicum time for the ureteral orifice excision was 88 min. One male patient had bladder leakage at the suture site of the bladder wall, which lasted for 2 weeks. No patient experienced recurrent disease during the follow-up period (median, 10 months). Mild to moderate pain lasted for 5 or 6 days after RNU. A couple of days after surgery, the numeric pain rating scale of complete laparoscopic RNU and conventional RNU group reached its peak level at 3.0 ± 1.8 and 5.3 ± 2.8, respectively. There was no statistical difference in the degree of postoperative pain (P = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS We described our initial experience and outcome of complete laparoscopic RNU for UTUC. Further experience and research are required to determine whether this advanced laparoscopic technique yields better outcomes and has true clinical value.","Miyake, Makito; Nishimura, Nobutaka; Aoki, Katsuya; Ohmori, Chihiro; Shimizu, Takuto; Owari, Takuya; Hori, Shunta; Morizawa, Yosuke; Gotoh, Daisuke; Nakai, Yasushi; Anai, Satoshi; Torimoto, Kazumasa; Tanaka, Nobumichi; Fujimoto, Kiyohide",World journal of surgical oncology,492,1

Cellular binding and entry by all RV-C, which trigger these episodes, is mediated by the first extracellular domain (EC1) of cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3), a surface cadherin-like protein expressed primarily on the apical surfaces of ciliated airway epithelial cells. Although recombinant EC1 is a potent inhibitor of viral infection, there is no molecular description of this protein or its binding site on RV-C. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (EM) data resolving the EC1 and EC1+2 domains of human CDHR3 complexed with viral isolate C15a. Structure-suggested residues contributing to required interfaces on both EC1 and C15a were probed and identified by mutagenesis studies with four different RV-C genotypes. In contrast to most other rhinoviruses, which bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptors via a capsid protein VP1-specific fivefold canyon feature, the CDHR3 EC1 contacts C15a, and presumably all RV-Cs, in a unique cohesive footprint near the threefold vertex, encompassing residues primarily from viral protein VP3, but also from VP1 and VP2. The EC1+2 footprint on C15a is similar to that of EC1 alone but shows that steric hindrance imposed by EC2 would likely prevent multiprotein binding by the native receptor at any singular threefold vertex. Definition of the molecular interface between the RV-Cs and their receptors provides new avenues that can be explored for potential antiviral therapies.","Sun, Yingyuan; Watters, Kelly; Hill, Marchel G; Fang, Qianglin; Liu, Yue; Kuhn, Richard J; Klose, Thomas; Rossmann, Michael G; Palmenberg, Ann C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,492,1

OBJECTIVES We estimate the effect of the pandemic on utilization of outpatient services. RESEARCH DESIGN Using 2010-2020 data from a national dataset, the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network, we estimate the difference in outpatient care utilization during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic versus the same weeks in prior years. RESULTS Our findings indicate that the pandemic started to reduce visits during the week of March 15-21. The effect on visits grew until reaching a peak during the week of April 5-11, 2020, when the pandemic reduced the total number of outpatient visits per provider by 70% relative to the same week in prior years. We find negative effects of the pandemic on visits for non-flu symptoms as well as on visits for flu symptoms, but the magnitudes of these latter effects tended to be larger in magnitude. The pandemic's impact declined over time, and by the week of June 28 to July 4, 2020, there was no longer any difference in total visits per provider relative to the same week in prior years. Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 in June and July, we still find no effects on total visits when our data end in July 26 to August 1, 2020. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that one by-product of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is a large decline in the use of outpatient care which peaked around the week of April 5-11. Total outpatient visits rebounded completely and remain stable as of July 26 to August 1, 2020.","Chatterji, Pinka; Li, Yue",Medical care,492,17

Trials included a total of 1,514 children and young people with ADHD who were allocated to take an omega-3/6 intervention, or a placebo. RESULTS Of the studies identified, 13 reported favourable benefits on ADHD symptoms including improvements in hyperactivity, impulsivity, attention, visual learning, word reading, and working/short-term memory. Four studies used supplements containing a 9 : 3 : 1 ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid : docosahexaenoic acid : gamma linolenic acid which appeared effective at improving erythrocyte levels. Supplementation with this ratio of fatty acids also showed promise as an adjunctive therapy to traditional medications, lowering the dose and improving the compliance with medications such as methylphenidate.

In addition to its anti-viral activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine may also contribute to its efficacy. Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). This serine/threonine protein kinase is now recognised as a point of convergence for host inflammatory response.

We investigated the patency of covered side branches and flow modification within the parent artery following placement of the Pipeline Embolization Device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-six aneurysms in 59 patients were treated with 96 Pipeline Embolization Devices. We retrospectively reviewed imaging and clinical results during the postoperative period at 6 and 12 months to assess flow modification through the parent artery and side branches. Reperfusion syndrome was assessed by MR imaging and clinical evaluation. RESULTS Slow flow was observed in 13 of 68 (19.1%) side branches covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device. It was reported in all cases of anterior cerebral artery coverage, in 3/5 cases of M2-MCA coverage, and in 5/34 (14.7%) cases of ophthalmic artery coverage. One territorial infarction was observed in a case of M2-MCA coverage, without arterial occlusion. One case of deep Sylvian infarct was reported in a case of coverage of MCA perforators. Two ophthalmic arteries (5.9%) were occluded, and 11 side branches (16.2%) were narrowed at 12 months' follow-up; patients remained asymptomatic. Parent vessel flow modification was responsible for 2 cases (3.4%) of reperfusion syndrome. Overall permanent morbidity and mortality rates were 5.2% and 6.9%, respectively. We did not report any permanent deficit or death in case of slow flow observed within side branches. CONCLUSIONS After Pipeline Embolization Device placement, reperfusion syndrome was observed in 3.4%, and territorial infarction, in 3.4%. Delayed occlusion of ophthalmic arteries and delayed narrowing of arteries covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device were observed in 5.9% and 16.2%, respectively.

CONCLUSION Cryptorchidectomy in dogs is often considered when there is concern for neoplasm or torsion of retained testes. However, this report suggests that cryptorchidectomy should be considered also to preclude the possibility of bowel obstructive emergencies.","Kodie, Dorcas Oyueley; Oyetayo, Noah Segun; Awoyemi, Oladotun Solomon; Oguntoye, Cecelia Omowunmi; Eyarefe, Oghenemega David",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,492,1

Complications of CEA must be recognized and dealt with efficiently due to the potentially catastrophic neurologic sequelae. A 67-year-old African American man was transferred from an outside hospital for an acute stroke. He had initially presented with a small right frontal subcortical infarct and had undergone a right CEA 2 days prior to transfer. He had a fluctuating examination with left-sided hemiplegia to slight hemiparesis and inconsistent neglect. Head CT demonstrated a watershed infarct of the right hemisphere. CT angiography demonstrated high grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the CEA anastomosis. He was promptly taken for angiography and underwent acute stenting of the right internal carotid artery. This case demonstrates that carotid artery stenting is a safe management strategy for the treatment of complications associated with failed distal anastomosis during CEA.,"Doss, Vinodh T; Arthur, Adam S; Watridge, Clarence; Elijovich, Lucas",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,492,1

METHOD This paper uses Bacchi's 'What is the Problem Represented to Be' framework to analyse the Emergency Requirements for Remote Communities Determination under Subsection 477(1) of the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth). RESULTS Despite the leadership of community-controlled health services and regional councils, and the actions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the policy response constructs Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as vulnerable and mobility as a problem that needs a law and order response. CONCLUSIONS The policy response perpetuates an ongoing paternalistic discourse where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be controlled for the sake of their health, informed by notions of Indigeneity as deficient. This stands in contrast with the work of community-controlled health organisations, advocacy by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for and against restrictions, and examples of communities protecting themselves.

In parallel, viruses have developed a variety of strategies to evade the innate immunity. The hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus that causes chronic hepatitis, has been shown to inhibit RNA helicase RIG-I-mediated interferon (IFN) induction. However, it is still unknown whether HBV could affect the host DNA-sensing pathways. Here we report that in transiently HBV-transfected Huh7 cells, the stably HBV-producing cell line HepAD38, and HBV-infected HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes, HBV markedly interfered with IFN-β induction and antiviral immunity mediated by the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which has been identified as a central factor in foreign DNA recognition and antiviral innate immunity. Screening analysis demonstrated that the viral polymerase (Pol), but not other HBV-encoded proteins, was able to inhibit STING-stimulated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and IFN-β induction. Moreover, the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the RNase H (RH) domains of Pol were identified to be responsible for the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, Pol was shown to physically associate with STING and dramatically decrease the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING via its RT domain without altering the expression level of STING. Taken together, these observations suggest that besides its inherent catalytic function, Pol has a role in suppression of IFN-β production by direct interaction with STING and subsequent disruption of its K63-linked ubiquitination, providing a new mechanism for HBV to counteract the innate DNA-sensing pathways. IMPORTANCE Although whether and how HBV infection induces the innate immune responses are still controversial, it has become increasingly clear that HBV has developed strategies to counteract the pattern recognition receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown that type I IFN induction activated by the host RNA sensors could be inhibited by HBV. However, it remains unknown whether HBV as a DNA virus utilizes evasion mechanisms against foreign DNA-elicited antiviral signaling. In recent years, the cytosolic DNA sensor and key adaptor STING has been demonstrated to be essential in multiple foreign DNA-elicited innate immune signalings. Here, for the first time, we report STING as a new target of HBV to antagonize IFN induction and identify the viral polymerase responsible for the inhibitory effect, thus providing an additional molecular mechanism by which HBV evades the innate immunity; this implies that in addition to its inherent catalytic function, HBV polymerase is a multifunctional immunomodulatory protein.","Liu, Yinghui; Li, Jianhua; Chen, Jieliang; Li, Yaming; Wang, Weixia; Du, Xiaoting; Song, Wuhui; Zhang, Wen; Lin, Li; Yuan, Zhenghong",Journal of virology,492,11

Nine lactones were detected in these samples, and one of these lactones, γ-undecalactone, was identified in Cheddar cheese for the first time. The quantitative results showed that the concentration of lactones in these cheeses usually increased as the length of their maturity period increased. γ-Octalactone, γ-undecalactone, γ-dodecalactone, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone and δ-dodecalactone were identified as aroma-active substances based on their odour activity values and aroma extract dilution analysis, with flavour dilution factors ranging from 2 to 128. Aroma recombination and omission experiments based on a newly developed deodorised Cheddar matrix further validated the important contributions of these lactones to the overall aroma of Cheddar cheeses.

Currently the situation has dramatically changed. The aim of this study is to present knowledge, attitudes and practices at the beginning of the outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina when the spreading of COVID-19 was well controlled and provide useful information to policymakers at this challenging time. Results In total 1,201 respondents, predominantly female (943 or 78.5%), with a mean age 30.57±11.26, scored very high on the knowledge test with a mean score 9.13±1.90. Being male (β: -0.141, p<0.001) and aged >30 (β: -0.099, p=0.030) were associated with lower knowledge scores, while education level of bachelor's degree and above (β: 0.092, p=0.003), living in urban environment (β: 0.062, p=0.044) and being a student (β: 0.240, p<0.001) were associated with higher knowledge scores.

PURPOSE The purposes of this study were to assess the current and future supply of doctors of optometry and to examine in-depth trends related to (1) demographic shifts, (2) sex-based differences, (3) differences in practice behaviors in between self-employed and employed optometrists, and (4) the concept of additional capacity within the profession. METHODS The 2017 National Optometry Workforce Survey (31 items) was distributed to 4050 optometrists, randomly sampled from a population of 45,033 currently licensed and practicing optometrists listed in the American Optometric Association's Optometry Master Data File. A stratified sampling method was applied to the population of optometrists using primary license state, age, and sex as variables to ensure a representative sample. RESULTS With a response rate of 29% (1158 responses), the sample ensured a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of <5%. Key results include finding no significant differences between men and women for hours worked (38.9 vs. 37.5), productivity (patient visits per hour, 2.0 vs. 1.9), or career options/professional growth satisfaction with 65% for both. The data indicate a likely range of additional patient capacity of 2.29 to 2.57 patients per week (5.05 to 5.65 million annually profession-wide). CONCLUSIONS The optometric workforce for the next decade is projected to grow 0.6 to 0.7% more annually than the U.S. population. The study found additional capacity for the profession more limited than previously suggested. Findings also illustrate an evolving/equitable workforce based on sex, in terms of both productivity and satisfaction.

Although RTT patients exhibit delayed onset of symptoms, several evidences demonstrate that MeCP2 deficiency alters early development of the brain. Indeed, during early maturation, Mecp2 null cortical neurons display widespread transcriptional changes, reduced activity, and defective morphology. It has been proposed that during brain development these elements are linked in a feed-forward cycle where neuronal activity drives transcriptional and morphological changes that further increase network maturity. We hypothesized that the enhancement of neuronal activity during early maturation might prevent the onset of RTT-typical molecular and cellular phenotypes. Accordingly, we show that the enhancement of excitability, obtained by adding to neuronal cultures Ampakine CX546, rescues transcription of several genes, neuronal morphology, and responsiveness to stimuli. Greater effects are achieved in response to earlier treatments. In vivo, short and early administration of CX546 to Mecp2 null mice prolongs lifespan, delays the disease progression, and rescues motor abilities and spatial memory, thus confirming the value for RTT of an early restoration of neuronal activity.","Scaramuzza, Linda; De Rocco, Giuseppina; Desiato, Genni; Cobolli Gigli, Clementina; Chiacchiaretta, Martina; Mirabella, Filippo; Pozzi, Davide; De Simone, Marco; Conforti, Paola; Pagani, Massimiliano; Benfenati, Fabio; Cesca, Fabrizia; Bedogni, Francesco; Landsberger, Nicoletta",EMBO molecular medicine,492,1

During virus replication, a 3' coterminal nested set of five to eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are made that are also 5' coterminal with the genome, because they carry the genomic leader as the result of discontinuous transcription at intergenic donor signals during (-)-strand synthesis when templates for sgmRNA synthesis are made. An unanswered question is whether the sgmRNAs, which appear rapidly and abundantly, undergo posttranscriptional amplification. Here, using RT-PCR and sequence analyses of head-to-tail-ligated (-) strands, we show that after transfection of an in vitro-generated marked sgmRNA into virus-infected cells, the sgmRNA, like the genome, can function as a template for (-)-strand synthesis. Furthermore, when the transfected sgmRNA contains an internally placed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase template-switching donor signal, discontinuous transcription occurs at this site, and a shorter, 3' terminally nested leader-containing sgmRNA is made, as evidenced by its leader-body junction and by the expression of a GFP gene. Thus, in principle, the longer-nested sgmRNAs in a natural infection, all of which contain potential internal template-switching donor signals, can function to increase the number of the shorter 3'-nested sgmRNAs. One predicted advantage of this behavior for coronavirus survivability is an increased chance of maintaining genome fitness in the 3' one-third of the genome via a homologous recombination between the (now independently abundant) WT sgmRNA and a defective genome.","Wu, Hung-Yi; Brian, David A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,492,5

R-VATS was initially developed to overcome the drawbacks of VATS by offering surgeons more flexibility and three-dimensional optics during thoracoscopic surgery. The effectiveness of R-VATS lobectomy regarding oncological outcomes, morbidity, mortality, and postoperative quality of life (QoL) has been shown in an increasing number of studies. More recently, these results have also been corroborated for sublobar resections, more specifically for segmentectomy. However, no well-powered, multicentre randomized trials have been performed to demonstrate the superiority of R-VATS compared with open surgery or conventional types of VATS (total VATS, uniportal VATS, etc.). The majority of the evidence currently available is based on non-randomized studies, and many studies report conflicting results when comparing R-VATS and conventional VATS. Moreover, there is a lack of data regarding the cost and the cost-efficiency of robotic surgery compared with VATS and open surgery. Current evidence suggests that R-VATS costs are higher than VATS and that a deficit can only be prevented when up to 150-300 thoracic surgery procedures are performed annually. Finally, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery showed better ergonomics and reduced musculoskeletal disorders compared with non-robotic laparoscopic surgery.","Berzenji, Lawek; Yogeswaran, Krishan; Van Schil, Paul; Lauwers, Patrick; Hendriks, Jeroen M H",Current treatment options in oncology,492,30

In this work, we used optogenetic techniques to control the activity of striatal neurons and investigated how their activity affected the survival and migration of transplanted NSCs and overall neurological outcome after ischemic stroke. NSCs cultured from transgenic mice expressing fluorescent protein were transplanted into the peri-infarct region of the striatum after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) surgery. The striatal neurons were excited or inhibited for 15 minutes daily via implanted optical fiber after tMCAO. The results revealed that mice which received NSC transplantation and optogenetic inhibition had smaller brain infarct volume and increased NSC migration compared to the NSC alone or PBS group (p < 0.05). In contrast, mice which received NSC transplantation and optogenetic excitation showed no difference in infarct volume and neurological behavior improvement compared to the PBS control group. In vitro experiments further revealed that the conditioned media from excited GABAergic neurons reduced NSC viability through paracrine mechanisms. Conclusion. Optogenetic inhibition of striatal neuronal activity further improved neurological recovery after NSC transplantation at the subacute phase after brain ischemia.","Lu, Yifan; Jiang, Lu; Li, Wanlu; Qu, Meijie; Song, Yaying; He, Xiaosong; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Wang, Yongting",Stem cells international,492,5

Patch monitors may simplify the evaluation, providing accurate arrhythmia evaluation and QT assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients referred for evaluation of an inherited arrhythmia syndrome underwent standard investigations, including 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter monitoring, ETT, along with supplemental monitoring using a 7-day ECG patch monitor. Heart rates (HR), corrected QT intervals (QTc), and ectopic burden were compared across monitoring modalities. Among 35 patients that wore the patch monitor, the median age was 39 years (54% male). There was intermediate correlation between resting HR across modalities (r=0.58-0.66) and poor correlation of peak HR (r=0.27-0.39). There was intermediate correlation between resting QTc intervals across modalities (r=0.72-0.77) but negligible correlation between QTc intervals at peak HR across modalities (r=-0.01 to -0.06). There was good correlation in PAC and PVC ectopic burden across the Holter and patch monitor. CONCLUSION Patch monitors may simplify the evaluation of patients for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome and provide resting QT assessment over time. However, QTc interval comparison at peak heart rates remains variable, and may be limited by the single-lead ECG vector when using the patch monitor. Apart from QTc intervals at peak HR, patch monitors demonstrated good correlation with the ECG and Holter monitor for other parameters. This article is protected by copyright.

This paper pushes this agenda further by acknowledging that the experience of a few developed nations should not be taken as the template for the generalized study of inequality dynamics across time and space. In this paper, we interrogate Piketty's analysis and policy proposals against specificities that are central to understanding the production and reproduction of inequalities within South Africa. We reflect on the South African case, the structure of inequality and its changes since 1994. We review a battery of policy interventions that have been implemented to address inequality in the last 25 years. We emphasize that the long shadow cast by centuries of colonialism and various forms of apartheid strongly affirm Piketty's emphasis on understanding history. But this is both affirmation and critique given the foundational, imbedded impact that this specific legacy has had on post-apartheid society and its policies. Piketty is aware that the levels of inequality in South Africa are so high that this is ""unknown territory."" We map out some of this territory to reveal how these extreme initial wealth and racial inequities inform the reproduction of inequalities in all dimensions and undermine well intentioned policies. We claim that understanding extractive histories, imbedded wealth inequalities, and complex social and political institutions allows us to understand and confront some of the reasons why even in light of progressive policies, many of which are in line with the proposals from Piketty, government interventions have thus far failed to reduce inequality.","Díaz Pabón, Fabio Andrés; Leibbrandt, Murray; Ranchhod, Vimal; Savage, Michael",The British journal of sociology,492,31

According to its design, we showed that this microdevice selectively removed stratum corneum of cadaver skin without significantly removing deeper tissue. This one-dimensional depth control was supplemented through the use of a masking film containing 100 μm-diameter holes placed on the skin surface during ablation to define the ablated skin area and thereby provide three-dimensional control over tissue removal. Using this approach, thermal ablation increased skin permeability to sulforhodamine B and bovine serum albumin by at least 1000-fold in vitro. We conclude that microsecond thermal ablation of skin can selectively remove stratum corneum and thereby dramatically increase skin permeability for transdermal drug delivery.","Lee, Jeong Woo; Gadiraju, Priya; Park, Jung-Hwan; Allen, Mark G; Prausnitz, Mark R",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,492,19

METHODS Patients aged >50 admitted for elective major noncardiac surgery were included in a single-blind randomized (ratio 2:1) trial. The anesthetic protocol was allocated by randomization into either closed-loop or manual BIS-guided propofol and remifentanil titration. The BIS target range was 40-60. All patients had cognitive assessment the day before surgery and within 72 hours after surgery using a battery of neuropsychological tests. The primary outcome was the rate of postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders were defined as a decrease >20% from baseline on at least 3 scores. Intergroup comparison of the primary outcome was performed using the χ test. RESULTS A total of 143 and 61 patients were included in the closed-loop and manual groups, respectively (age: 66 [8] vs 66 [9] years). The primary outcome was observed in 18 (13%) and 10 (16%) patients of the closed-loop and manual groups, respectively (relative risk [95% confidence interval {CI}], 0.77 [0.38-1.57], P = .47). Intraoperative propofol consumption was lower (4.7 [1.4] vs 5.7 [1.4] mg·kg·h, mean difference [MD] [95% CI], -0.73 [-0.98 to -0.48], P < .0001) and the proportion of time within the BIS target range higher (84 [77-89] vs 74 [54-81]%, MD [95% CI], 0.94 [0.67-1.21], P < .0001) in the closed-loop group. CONCLUSIONS Closed-loop compared to manual BIS-guided total intravenous anesthesia provided a significant reduction in episodes of an excessive depth of anesthesia while decreasing intraoperative propofol requirement but no evidence for a reduction of the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorders after elective major noncardiac surgery was observed.","Mahr, Nicolas; Bouhake, Yannis; Chopard, Gilles; Liu, Ngai; Boichut, Nathalie; Chazot, Thierry; Claveau, Melanie; Vettoretti, Lucie; Tio, Gregory; Pili-Floury, Sebastien; Samain, Emmanuel; Besch, Guillaume",Anesthesia and analgesia,492,31

METHODS From January 2017 the study planned to enroll 100 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with the Revive SE as a first pass. The study primary outcomes were rates of favorable reperfusion using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score [mTICI] 2b/3 and rates of favorable outcome with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2 at 3 months. The secondary outcomes were time interval from puncture to vascular reperfusion, number of passes by Revive SE stent-retriever, incidence of distal embolization and into new territories and rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) within 24 h post intervention. RESULTS A total of 100 treated patients (mean age: 65.6 ± 11.3 years) were enrolled. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale before the procedure was 16. Target vessel occlusions were as follows: middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 in 48, M2 in 6, anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 3, internal carotid artery (ICA) in 22, basilar artery (BA) in 17, and vertebral artery (VA) in 4. Reperfusion rate with Revive SE without rescue devices was 69%. Reperfusion rate with Revive SE only was 83.3% in MCA M2, followed by 82.4% in BA. Thromboembolic complications and SICH developed in 10% and 2% of patients, respectively. Overall, a satisfactory reperfusion was achieved in 92% and a favorable outcome at 90 days in 48%.

HRCA has differentiated between safe and unsafe swallows, predicted components of the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile, and predicted kinematic events of swallowing such as hyoid bone displacement, laryngeal vestibular closure, and upper esophageal sphincter opening with a high degree of accuracy. However, HRCA has not been used to characterize swallow function in specific patient populations. This study investigated the ability of HRCA to differentiate between swallows from healthy people and people with neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that HRCA would differentiate between swallows from healthy people and people with neurodegenerative diseases with a high degree of accuracy. We analyzed 170 swallows from 20 patients with neurodegenerative diseases and 170 swallows from 51 healthy age-matched adults who underwent concurrent video fluoroscopy with non-invasive neck sensors. We used a linear mixed model and several supervised machine learning classifiers that use HRCA signal features and a leave-one-out procedure to differentiate between swallows. Twenty-two HRCA signal features were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for predicting whether swallows were from healthy people or from patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Using the HRCA signal features alone, logistic regression and decision trees classified swallows between the two groups with 99% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 99% specificity. This provides preliminary research evidence that HRCA can differentiate swallow function between healthy and patient populations.","Donohue, Cara; Khalifa, Yassin; Perera, Subashan; Sejdić, Ervin; Coyle, James L",Dysphagia,492,16

SETTING We retrieved the anonymised electronic health records of a population-based retrospective cohort in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS A total of 26 197 patients were included in the analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES The new-onset, progression and regression of CKD were defined by the transitions of four stages that were classified by combining glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. We applied a multiscale multistate Poisson regression model to estimate the rates of the stage transitions by integrating the baseline demographic characteristics, routine laboratory test results and clinical data from electronic health records. RESULTS During the mean follow-up time of 1.8 years, there were 2632 patients newly diagnosed with CKD, 1746 progressed to the next stage and 1971 regressed into an earlier stage. The models achieved the best performance in predicting the new-onset and progression with the predictors of sex, age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, haemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides and drug prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that individual risks of new-onset and progression of CKD can be predicted from the routine physical and laboratory test results. The individualised prediction curves developed from this study could potentially be applied to routine clinical practices, to facilitate clinical decision making, risk communications with patients and early interventions.","Yang, Lin; Chu, Tsun Kit; Lian, Jinxiao; Lo, Cheuk Wai; Zhao, Shi; He, Daihai; Qin, Jing; Liang, Jun",BMJ open,492,1

However, little is known of whether other non-glucose molecules, besides vitamin C, interfere with glucometry. Therefore, we sought to determine whether other antioxidants might behave like vitamin C in causing falsely elevated blood glucose levels, potentially exposing patients to glycemic mismanagement by being administered harmful doses of glucose-lowering drugs. To determine whether various antioxidants can be detected by seven commercial glucose meters, human blood samples were spiked with various antioxidants ex vivo and their effect on the glucose results were assessed by Parkes error grid analysis. Several of the glucose meters demonstrated a positive bias in the glucose measurement of blood samples spiked with vitamin C, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione. With the most interference-sensitive glucose meter, non-blood solutions of 1 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, cysteine, vitamin C, dihydrolipoate, and dithiothreitol mimicked the results seen on that glucose meter for 0.7, 1.0, 1.2, 2.6, 3.7 and 5.5 mmol/L glucose solutions, respectively. Glucose meter users should be alerted that some of these devices might produce spurious glucose results not only in patients on vitamin C therapy but also in those being administered other antioxidants.

Scanning fiber endoscopes (SFEs) are a novel endoscopic platform that allows high-resolution video imaging in an ultraminiature form factor that is compatible with currently used distal access endoluminal catheters. OBJECTIVE To test the feasibility and potential utility of high-resolution angioscopy with an SFE during common endovascular neurosurgical procedures. METHODS A 3.7-French SFE was used in a porcine model system to image endothelial disruption, ischemic stroke and mechanical thrombectomy, aneurysm coiling, and flow-diverting stent placement. RESULTS High-resolution, video-rate imaging was shown to be possible during all of the common procedures tested and provided information that was complementary to standard fluoroscopic imaging. SFE angioscopy was able to assess novel factors such as aneurysm base coverage fraction and side branch patency, which have previously not been possible to determine with conventional angiography. CONCLUSION Endovascular imaging with an SFE provides important information on factors that cannot be assessed fluoroscopically and is a novel platform on which future neurointerventional techniques may be based because it allows for periprocedural inspection of the integrity of the vascular system and the deployed devices. In addition, it may be of diagnostic use for inspecting the vascular wall and postprocedure device evaluation.","McVeigh, Patrick Z; Sacho, Raphael; Weersink, Robert A; Pereira, Vitor M; Kucharczyk, Walter; Seibel, Eric J; Wilson, Brian C; Krings, Timo",Neurosurgery,492,1

METHODS/DESIGN We will use established approaches to conducting scoping reviews which include five stages: (1) conducting broad searches to identify potentially relevant literature, (2) refining selection criteria, (3) reviewing search results, (4) mapping literature according to conceptual areas of interest, and (5) summarizing results. We will analyze data by thematically grouping the descriptions of assistive products identified in the included articles and conducting a content analysis to iteratively develop a targeted synthesis of literature focused on ethical challenges in relation to assistive product access and procurement by older adults and/or adults living with disabilities. DISCUSSION Our scoping review findings will focus on and provide insight about the models, frameworks, and principles that have been used to understand ethical challenges related to technology access and procurement.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Operation time, cosmetic score and incisional hernia rates between LC (n=20) and SILC-1 (first 20 consecutive operations with the new technique) and 2 (subsequent 20 operations with the new technique) were compared. RESULTS The median operation time for LC, SILC-1 and SILC-2 were; 35 min (12-75), 47.5 min (30-70), and 30 min (12-80), respectively (p=0.005). The operation duration was similar in LC and SILC-2 (p=0.277) groups. Wound seroma rate was higher in SILC-1 (45%) and SILC-2 (30%) groups than LC (5%) group (p=0.010). Cosmetic score was similar between all the groups. Hernia rates were 15.8% and 5.3% in the SILC-1 and SILC-2 groups, respectively, while there was no hernia in the LC group. CONCLUSION SILC with new facilitating maneuver is comparable with classical four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of ease, operation time, reproducibility and safety. Besides these advantages, the single-incision access technique must be optimized to provide comparable wound complication and postoperative hernia rates before being recommended to patients.","Aktimur, Recep; Güzel, Kerim; Çetinkünar, Süleyman; Yıldırım, Kadir; Çolak, Elif",Ulusal cerrahi dergisi,492,31

Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, IgA antibodies to the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to 10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months post-hospital discharge were also tested in 95 patients for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies. RESULTS Antibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks post-symptoms onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the 3rd month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely co-infection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival. CONCLUSIONS The measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival. The presence of partially cross-reactive antibodies with other betacoronoviruses is likely to impact on serological assay specificity and interpretation.","Secchi, Massimiliano; Bazzigaluppi, Elena; Brigatti, Cristina; Marzinotto, Ilaria; Tresoldi, Cristina; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Poli, Andrea; Castagna, Antonella; Scarlatti, Gabriella; Zangrillo, Alberto; Ciceri, Fabio; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Lampasona, Vito",The Journal of clinical investigation,492,1

Molecular analyses of viral evolutionary time-scales generally rely on estimates of rates of nucleotide substitution, which vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the timeframe of measurement. We analysed data from all major groups of viruses and found a strong negative relationship between estimates of nucleotide substitution rate and evolutionary timescale. Strikingly, this relationship was upheld both within and among diverse groups of viruses. A detailed case study of primate lentiviruses revealed that the combined effects of sequence saturation and purifying selection can explain this time-dependent pattern of rate variation. Therefore, our analyses show that studies of evolutionary time-scales in viruses require a reconsideration of substitution rates as a dynamic, rather than as a static, feature of molecular evolution. Improved modelling of viral evolutionary rates has the potential to change our understanding of virus origins.","Duchêne, Sebastián; Holmes, Edward C; Ho, Simon Y W",Proceedings.

Although advances in treatment have greatly improved survival rates in young patients, in the elderly population, ~70% of patients present poor prognosis. A pan-cancer analysis on the TCGA cohort showed that AML has the second higher HUWE1 expression in tumor samples among all cancer types. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis pointed to RAS signaling cascade as one of the most important pathways associated to HUWE1 expression in this particular AML cohort. In silico analysis for biological processes enrichment also revealed that HUWE1 expression is correlated with 13 genes involved in myeloid differentiation. Therefore, to understand the role of HUWE1 in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) we constitutively expressed KRASG12V oncogene concomitantly to HUWE1 knockdown in stromal co-cultures. The results showed that, in the context of KRASG12V, HUWE1 significantly reduces cell cumulative growth and changes myeloid differentiation profile of HSPCs. Overall, these observations suggest that HUWE1 might contribute to leukemic cell proliferation and impact myeloid differentiation of human HSCs, thus providing new venues for RAS-driven leukemia targeted therapy approach.","Ruckert, Mariana Tannús; Brouwers-Vos, Annet Z; Nagano, Luis Fernando P; Schuringa, Jan Jacob; Silveira, Vanessa Silva",Cancer gene therapy,492,31

Traditional methods of fire prevention have included use of ""laser safe"" tubes, inflation of a protective cuff with saline, and wet pledgets to protect the endotracheal tube from laser strikes. We tested a mechanical model of laser laryngeal surgery to evaluate the fire risk. STUDY DESIGN Mechanical model. SETTING Laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An intubation mannequin was positioned for suspension microlaryngoscopy. A Laser-Shield II cuffed endotracheal tube was placed through the larynx and the cuff inflated using saline. Wet pledgets covered the inflated cuff. A CO2 laser created an inadvertent cuff strike at varying oxygen concentrations. Risk reduction measures were implemented to discern any notable change in the outcome after fire. RESULTS At 100% FiO2 an immediate fire with sustained flame was created and at 40% FiO2 a near immediate sustained flame was created. At 29% FiO2, a small nonsustained flame was noted. At room air, no fire was created. There was no discernible difference in the severity of laryngeal damage after the fire occurred whether the tube was immediately pulled from the mannequin or if saline was poured down the airway as a first response. CONCLUSIONS While ""laser safe"" tubes provide a layer of protection against fires, they are not fire proof. Inadvertent cuff perforation may result in fire formation in low-level oxygen enriched environments. Placement of wet pledgets do not provide absolute protection. Endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffs should be placed distally well away from an inadvertent laser strike while maintaining the minimum supplemental oxygen necessary.","Roy, Soham; Smith, Lee P",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,492,16

However, this has not been validated for agreement between dry matter content and observed fecal consistency. Therefore, a comparison of observed fecal consistency score to fecal percent dry matter and Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst shedding was performed to assess the accuracy of observational scoring as a measure of diarrhea and its association with number of oocysts shed. Fecal samples from 20 dairy calves experimentally infected with C. parvum oocysts were collected daily post-infection and scored on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 being normal feces to 4 being severe diarrhea. An aliquot of each sample was analyzed for percent dry matter and Cryptosporidium oocyst counts by using immunofluorescent microscopy. Fecal consistency scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 had median percent dry matter of 20.9, 16.3, 9.6, and 5.8, respectively. Using percent dry matter assessed by fecal consistency scoring were significantly different from each other (P < 0.001). A higher fecal consistency score also was associated with a greater number of Cryptosporidium oocysts shed (P < 0 .0001). Scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 had median oocyst counts of 0, 0, 1.3 × 10⁶, and 2.8 × 10⁶, respectively. These results suggest that observational scoring is a useful proxy to assess diarrhea in dairy calves.","Bellosa, Mary L; Nydam, Daryl V; Liotta, Janice L; Zambriski, Jennifer A; Linden, Thomas C; Bowman, Dwight D",The Journal of parasitology,492,17

RESULTS This 7-year-old child, had a history of persistent ductus arteriousus, autism spectrum behavior, language disorders, dyslalias, hearing disorder, hypotonic musculature, and joint hyperlaxity. The main facial and oral diagnoses were dolichocephaly, convex profile, atypical swallowing, mixed breathing, class II malocclusion, mandibular retrognathism, maxillary prognathism, caries lesions, and biofilm associated gingivitis. A comprehensive treatment was carried out from the stage of adaptation to dental care, control of dental biofilm, motivation, and teaching of oral hygiene with appropriate strategies to the child's age and cognitive abilities. Also, resin restorations, habits management and malocclusion with the use of the modified upper and lower Sanders orthopedic device. The child began with a definitely negative behavior at dental appointments, and evolved to negative on Frankl's Behavior Rating Scale. CONCLUSION Dentists must manage behavior management protocols, in order to avoid situations of rejection of treatment in patients with TBRS, and thus avoid sedation or general anesthesia.

Seventeen patients with symptomatic deep intramural myomas who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound guidance were followed up and reported. All myomas were removed successfully. The endometrium was breached in one patient. All patients were relieved of their symptoms and three patients presenting with infertility conceived. There were no short- or long-term complications associated with the procedure. One patient who had multiple myomas necessitated intravenous iron treatment prior to discharge. Laparoscopic removal of small symptomatic deep intramural myomas is facilitated by the use of intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound that enables exact localisation and correct placement of the serosal incision. Impact statement What is already known on this subject: When the myoma is symptomatic, compressing the endometrium, does not show serosal protrusion and is not amenable to hysteroscopic resection, laparoscopic surgery may become challenging. What do the results of this study add: The use of intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound under these circumstances may facilitate the procedure by accurate identification of the myoma and correct placement of the serosal incision. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: Intraoperative ultrasound should be more oftenly used to accurately locate deep intramural myomas to the end of making laparoscopy feasible and possibly decreasing recurrence by facilitating removal of otherwise unidentifiable disease.","Urman, Bulent; Boza, Aysen; Ata, Baris; Aksu, Sertan; Arslan, Tonguc; Taskiran, Cagatay",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,492,19

OBJECTIVES To describe epidemiological and clinical features in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infection caused by a novel swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) and seasonal influenza virus A (IVA). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 1,074 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected from children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections. The RNAs of S-OIV and seasonal IVA in the samples were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS The presence of IVA was detected in 105 samples (9.8%), including S-OIV in 15 samples (1.4%) and seasonal IVA in the remaining samples (8.4%). The incidence of both viral infections was lower in autumn and winter. The rates of severe pneumonia in patients with S-OIV and seasonal IVA were 6.7% and 15.6%, respectively. In total, 14 out of 90 seasonal IVA-positive cases were categorized as severe pneumonia and 1 out of 15 S-OIV-positive cases as severe bronchiolitis. Five samples were found to have single S-OIV infection among 15 S-OIV-positive cases, while other respiratory viruses were detected in the other 9 samples. Twenty-one samples were found to be single seasonal-IVA-positive among the 90 seasonal-IVA-positive cases. Underlying heart conditions (odds ratio (OR) = 13.60), wheezing (OR = 6.82) and co-infection with adenovirus (OR = 6.21) were risk factors for developing severe pneumonia in seasonal IVA patients. CONCLUSIONS Children younger than 2 years appeared to be susceptible to both kinds of viral infection. Diagnoses of non-severe respiratory tract infection were mainly made for patients with S-OIV and IVA infection. Underlying heart conditions, wheezing and co-infection with adenovirus increase the risk of developing severe pneumonia in seasonal IVA patients.","Jin, Ling; Liu, En-Mei; Xie, Xiao-Hong; Hu, Ying; Liao, Wei",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,492,1

To design an optimal implementation strategy, potential barriers to and facilitators of implementation must be considered. The objective of this systematic review is to identify barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of CPWs in primary care (PC). METHODS A systematic search via Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and MEDLINE via PubMed supplemented by hand searches and citation tracing was carried out. We considered articles reporting on CPWs targeting patients at least 65 years of age in outpatient settings that were written in the English or German language and were published between 2007 and 2019. We considered (non-)randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies (main project reports) as well as associated process evaluation reports of either methodology. Two independent researchers performed the study selection; the data extraction and critical appraisal were duplicated until the point of perfect agreement between the two reviewers. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, a narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS Fourteen studies (seven main project reports and seven process evaluation reports) of the identified 8154 records in the search update were included in the synthesis. The structure and content of the interventions as well as the quality of evidence of the studies varied. The identified barriers and facilitators were classified using the Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework. The identified barriers were inadequate staffing, insufficient education, lack of financial compensation, low motivation and lack of time. Adequate skills and knowledge through training activities for health professionals, good multi-disciplinary communication and individual tailored interventions were identified as facilitators. CONCLUSIONS In the implementation of CPWs in PC, a multitude of barriers and facilitators must be considered, and most of them can be modified through the careful design of intervention and implementation strategies. Furthermore, process evaluations must become a standard component of implementing CPWs to enable other projects to build upon previous experience.

It is one of the growing array of rhabdoviruses with complex genomes that encode multiple accessory proteins of unknown function. In addition to the five canonical rhabdovirus structural protein genes (N, P, M, G, and L), the 13.2-kb negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) WONV genome contains five uncharacterized accessory genes, one overlapping the N gene (Nx or U4), three located between the P and M genes (U1 to U3), and a fifth one overlapping the G gene (Gx or U5). Here we show that WONV U3 is expressed during infection in insect and mammalian cells and is required for efficient viral replication. A yeast two-hybrid screen against a mosquito cell cDNA library identified that WONV U3 interacts with the 83-amino-acid (aa) C-terminal domain of SNF5, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The interaction was confirmed by affinity chromatography, and nuclear colocalization was established by confocal microscopy. Gene expression studies showed that SNF5 transcripts are upregulated during infection of mosquito cells with WONV, as well as West Nile virus (Flaviviridae) and bovine ephemeral fever virus (Rhabdoviridae), and that SNF5 knockdown results in increased WONV replication. WONV U3 also inhibits SNF5-regulated expression of the cytokine gene CSF1. The data suggest that WONV U3 targets the SWI/SNF complex to block the host response to infection. IMPORTANCE The rhabdoviruses comprise a large family of RNA viruses infecting plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates. In addition to the major structural proteins (N, P, M, G, and L), many rhabdoviruses encode a diverse array of accessory proteins of largely unknown function. Understanding the role of these proteins may reveal much about host-pathogen interactions in infected cells. Here we examine accessory protein U3 of Wongabel virus, an arthropod-borne rhabdovirus that infects birds. We show that U3 enters the nucleus and interacts with SNF5, a component of the chromatin remodeling complex that is upregulated in response to infection and restricts viral replication. We also show that U3 inhibits SNF5-regulated expression of the cytokine colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), suggesting that it targets the chromatin remodeling complex to block the host response to infection. This study appears to provide the first evidence of a virus targeting SNF5 to inhibit host gene expression.","Joubert, D Albert; Rodriguez-Andres, Julio; Monaghan, Paul; Cummins, Michelle; McKinstry, William J; Paradkar, Prasad N; Moseley, Gregory W; Walker, Peter J",Journal of virology,492,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study included 20 healthcare professionals. Oxygen saturation, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean ocular perfusion pressure (MOPP), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging were evaluated at baseline and after four hours wearing of FFP3 FFRs without an exhalation valve. Superior temporal artery (STA), inferior temporal artery (ITA), superior temporal vein (STV), and inferior temporal vein (ITV) diameter were measured from OCT images. The total subfoveal choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA) choroidal vascularity index [(CVI), the ratio of LA to TCA] were determined after binarization of enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) images of the choroid. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 27.35 ± 2.80 years (range, 25-34). Eight of them were female and 12 were male. After wearing the FFR for four hours, a significant decrease was observed in the mean DBP (p = 0.018), MAP (p = 0.016), and MOPP (p = 0.007) when compared to base-line values. STV diameter (p = 0.019) and ITV diameter (p = 0.046) measurements were found significantly higher than baseline measurements. A significant increase in the choroidal vascularity was observed in the LA (p = 0.004) and TCA values (p = 0.043) after wearing the FFR for four hours. CONCLUSION The current study shows that after four hours usage of FFR, in addition to systemic changes, retinal and choroidal vascularity might be affected significantly. With further studies, long-term effects and clinical significance of these short-term changes should be investigated on healthcare professionals.","Yildiz, Merve Beyza; Balci, Sevcan; Özçelik Köse, Alev; Yenerel, Nursal Melda; Yildiz, Hatice Elvin",Cutaneous and ocular toxicology,492,12

As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.","Sezgin, Emre; Militello, Lisa K; Huang, Yungui; Lin, Simon",Translational behavioral medicine,492,16

However, the predictive accuracy of these variables during gastrointestinal surgery remains uncertain. METHODS Observational study of patients aged ≥50 yr undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, enrolled in the OPTIMISE trial. Patients received six 250 ml fluid challenges with i.v. colloid solution (three during and three after surgery), while SVV and PPV were measured using the LiDCOrapid monitor (LiDCO Ltd, UK). Fluid responsiveness was defined as a stroke volume increase ≥10%. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Adjustment for covariates was performed by regression modelling and a clustering method was used to adjust for intra-patient correlation. RESULTS One hundred patients were recruited between August 2010 and October 2012. Five hundred and fifty-six fluid challenges were administered and 159 (28.6%) were associated with increased stroke volume. The predictive value of both variables was poor during surgery [SVV 0.69 (0.63-0.77); PPV 0.70 (0.62-0.77)], and also after surgery [SVV 0.69 (0.63-0.78); PPV 0.64 (0.56-0.73)]. The findings were similar when analysed according to whether patients were mechanically ventilated [SVV 0.68 (0.63-0.77); PPV 0.69 (0.61-0.77)] or breathing spontaneously [SVV 0.69 (0.61-0.77); PPV 0.63 (0.56-0.72)]. Predictive value improved slightly in a sensitivity analysis excluding outlier values of SVV and PPV. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the predictive accuracy of SVV and PPV for fluid responsiveness was insufficient to recommend for routine clinical use during or after major gastrointestinal surgery.","MacDonald, N; Ahmad, T; Mohr, O; Kirk-Bayley, J; Moppett, I; Hinds, C J; Pearse, R M",British journal of anaesthesia,492,32

We prepared n-hexane extracts of the three species and evaluated their anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Among all n-hexane extracts, those of A. japonica most strongly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells; five sesquiterpenes, atractylon, atractylenolide I, atractylenolide II, atractylenolide III, and 8-epiasterolid, were isolated from A. japonica. The phytochemical content of A. japonica was similar to those of A. chinensis and A. macrocephala. Moreover, the atractylon concentration was higher in A. japonica than in A. chinensis and A. macrocephala. Atractylon significantly inhibited NO and prostaglandin E2 production as well as inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Atractylon (40 mg/kg) also significantly reduced the acetic-acid-induced writhing response, carrageenan-induced paw edema, and hot-plate latent pain response in mice. According to the results, A. japonica has anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects and atractylon is the major active component of A. japonica. Therefore, atractylon can be used as a bioactivity marker in A. japonica.","Chen, Lih-Geeng; Jan, Yun-Sheng; Tsai, Po-Wei; Norimoto, Hisayoshi; Michihara, Seiwa; Murayama, Chiaki; Wang, Ching-Chiung",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,492,29

Nurses' perceptions about the risk of injury may have a role in preventing such injury. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate how nurses perceived the risk of musculoskeletal injury from work and identify factors associated with their risk perception. METHODS In a cross-sectional study using a postal survey, 361 critical care nurses reported on risk perception, physical workload, psychosocial job factors, safety climate, musculoskeletal symptoms, and safe work behavior. RESULTS Of all critical care nurse respondents, 83% perceived that they were more likely than not to have a musculoskeletal injury within 1 year. On average, nurses perceived the risk of musculoskeletal injury as lower to themselves than to coworkers. This more positive perception of risk to self had stronger correlations with symptom experiences. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that higher risk perception of injury was associated with greater job strain, greater physical workload, lack of availability of lifting devices or lifting teams, and more symptoms. DISCUSSION Study findings indicated that most critical care nurses were concerned about their ergonomic job risks. Their risk perceptions about musculoskeletal injury risk were affected by physical work exposures, psychosocial job stressors, and experience with musculoskeletal symptoms, but not by perceived workplace safety climate.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the reference accuracy in the field of spine surgery. METHODS Four major peer-reviewed spine surgery journals were chosen for this study based on their subspecialty clinical impact factors. Sixty articles per journal were selected from 12 issues each of The Spine Journal, Spine, and Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine, and 40 articles were selected from 8 issues of Global Spine Journal, for a total of 220 articles. All the articles were published in 2019 and were selected using computer-generated numbers. From the references list of each article, one reference was again selected by using a computer-generated number and then checked for citation or quotation errors. RESULTS The results indicate that 84.1% of articles have a minor citation error, 4.5% of articles have a major citation error, 9.5% of articles have a minor quotation error, and 9.1% of articles have a major quotation error. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine had the fewest citation errors compared with the other journals evaluated in this study.

METHODS Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and sociodemographic, occupational, health and sleep quality variables were used to collect data during the first month of the lockdown period due to COVID-19 (March-April 2020). A snowball sampling was carried out, where participants were asked to disseminate and distribute the questionnaire among their own profiles in social networks. RESULTS A representative sample of 5220 participants aged ≥18 years old took part in the study. The global PSQI score was 8.17 points (SD 4.43). A statistical association was found between the global PSQI score and several of the variables collected. Findings show that the quality of sleep was worse among women (p < 0.001), single participants (p 0.02), those working in rotating shifts (p < 0.001), on-site workers (p < 0.001), and people diagnosed with COVID-19 or who had someone in their environment diagnosed with the virus (p < 0.001).

Being a woman, working in rotating shifts, having suffered from COVID-19 or having someone close suffering from COVID-19, being unemployed or being affected by a Temporary Redundancy Scheme, as well as spending long hours in bed were associated with poorer sleep quality. On the contrary, being older and sleeping longer hours were associated with a better sleep quality.","Maestro-Gonzalez, Alba; Sánchez-Zaballos, Marta; Mosteiro-Díaz, María Pilar; Zuazua-Rico, David",Sleep medicine,492,16

The purpose of this study is to examine the available evidence on the application of barbed sutures on both laparoscopic and robotic operations in the field of gynecologic surgery. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. In total, 1991 patients were included in the study. The duration of closure with knotless suture ranged from 3.9 to 13 minutes, which was less than the use of conventional suture in every study. The duration of suturing was significantly less in the barbed suture group during hysterectomy, the mean difference between the observed groups was 2.41 minutes per operation (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.59) whereas in myomectomy there was no statistically significant difference between compared groups. Concerning the estimated blood loss and the presence of major bleeding in hysterectomy, no statistical difference between the 2 groups was observed, while the estimated blood loss in myomectomy was found to be statistically significant (P = .04). Regarding the dehiscence of vaginal cuff in hysterectomy, no statistically significant difference was observed (1031 patients, odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval = 0.37-7.25). The complete absence of knots, the even distribution of tissue strength along the wound, and the reduction of operation time are the main advantages of this type of sutures. Additional clinical trials of higher methodological quality are necessary to further clarify suturing advantages and postoperative outcomes of the barbed sutures.","Iavazzo, Christos; Mamais, Ioannis; Gkegkes, Ioannis D",Surgical innovation,492,1

Despite a variety of manual and instrument assisted interventions available, little work has targeted the possible effects of fast mechanical impulses on myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) on its sensitivity and electrical activity. The purpose of this experimental study was to quantify the immediate effect of one session of mechanical impulses to lumbar latent MTrPs and to normal muscle tissue with pressure pain threshold (PPT) and surface electromyography (sEMG) as outcome measures. METHODS During the autumn of 2009, in 41 asymptomatic subjects between 17-40 years of age the lumbar musculature was searched for a latent MTrP by a trained clinician. Using 3 disposable pre-gelled electrodes bilaterally, sEMG was recorded continuously from muscle containing either latent or no MTrP. Both the trigger point group and control group received the intervention and were blinded to group allocation. The immediate effects of mechanical impulses were assessed by sEMG and PPT before and after intervention using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, Mann-Whitney U test and paired t-tests. RESULTS The PPT increased significantly across both groups (p < 0.01) after intervention. The proportionate increase (14.6 %) was comparable in both MTrP and control groups. The electrical activity on the MTrP side was not significantly higher in the MTrP group compared to the contralateral side. The decrease of resting electrical activity after intervention was significant in the MTrP group on the side of the latent MTrP (P = 0.001) as well as the contralateral side (p=0.022), and not significant in the control group on either side (p=0.33 and p=0.93). CONCLUSION In this study, the immediate effect of one session of mechanical impulses was associated with a significant increase in PPT for both groups and a significant decrease in the resting electrical activity of the lumbar muscles only in the MTrP group. It is unknown if these effects have clinical significance.","Ameloot, Bert; Bagust, Jeff",Chiropractic & manual therapies,492,27

Wide variability in the implementation of practices designed to promote patient and family engagement in hospitals has been noted. Approaches aimed at promoting patient and family engagement in treatment share the over-arching goal of changing behaviors of patients, families, and healthcare providers and possibly administrators. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) can be a key element of patient and family engagement approaches. This scoping review will contribute to the development of an evidence base detailing that the BCTs have potential to be effective in patient and family engagement interventions. The specific objectives of this review are to (a) identify and classify approaches used in acute care hospitals to engage patient and families in treatment according to the behavior change technique taxonomy; and (b) evaluate and synthesize the outcomes for these approaches for patients and families, healthcare providers, and health administrators/funders. METHODS This systematic scoping review will allow us to determine the extent, range, and nature of research activity related to initiatives designed to promote patient and family engagement in care. A comprehensive electronic literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Studies will be included if they report on outcomes of a structured or systematic approach to the promotion of adult inpatient and family engagement in treatment in acute care settings. Studies will be selected in a two-stage screening process (title and abstract; full text) and quality will be assessed using the mixed methods assessment tool. Data extraction will include narrative descriptions of the intervention and classification of the behavior change techniques employed. DISCUSSION This review aims to identify and classify the specific behavior change techniques underpinning patient and family engagement interventions used in acute care hospital settings. By identifying the ""active ingredients"" in these interventions, our findings will be transferable to a wide range of acute care hospital contexts and populations.","Goodridge, Donna; Henry, Chrysanthus; Watson, Erin; McDonald, Meghan; New, Lucia; Harrison, Elizabeth L; Scharf, Murray; Penz, Erika; Campbell, Steve; Rotter, Thomas",Systematic reviews,492,1

The cardiovascular risk factors for dementia trigger widespread inflammation -- which lead to neurodegeneration, gradual cognitive/memory decline, and eventually (late-onset) dementia. Accordingly, one useful strategy to delay dementia could be based upon nanotargeting drug(s), using lipid nanocarriers, toward a major receptor class responsible for inflammation-associated (cytokine-mediated) cell signaling events. At the same time, the immune response and excessive inflammation, commonly observed in the very recent human coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, may accelerate the progression of brain inflammatory neurodegeneration-which increases the probability of post-infection memory impairment and accelerating progression of Alzheimer's disease. Hence, the proposed multitasking combination therapeutic, using a (biobased) lipid nanocarrier, may also display greater effectiveness at different stages of dementia.","D'Arrigo, Joseph S",American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,492,31

As our understanding of the pathways for viral exposure and associated health outcomes in children evolves, it is critical to consider how changes in the social, cultural, economic, and physical environments resulting from the pandemic could affect the development of children. This review article considers the environments and settings that create the backdrop for children's health in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, including current threats to child development that stem from: A) change in exposures to environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, disinfectants, air pollution and the built environment; B) changes in food environments resulting from adverse economic repercussion of the pandemic and limited reach of existing safety nets; C) limited access to children's educational and developmental resources; D) changes in the social environments at the individual and household levels, and their interplay with family stressors and mental health; E) social injustice and racism. The environmental changes due to COVID-19 are overlaid onto existing environmental and social disparities. This results in disproportionate effects among children in low-income settings and among populations experiencing the effects of structural racism.

The new virus, called SARS-CoV-2, which could be transmitted through respiratory droplets, had a range of mild to severe symptoms, from simple cold in some cases to death in others. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 by WHO and has so far killed more people than SARS and MERS. Following the widespread global outbreak of COVID-19, with more than 132758 confirmed cases and 4955 deaths worldwide, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic disease in January 2020. Earlier studies on viral pneumonia epidemics has shown that pregnant women are at greater risk than others. During pregnancy, the pregnant woman is more prone to infectious diseases. Research on both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are pathologically similar to SARS-CoV-2, has shown that being infected with these viruses during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal death, stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation and, preterm delivery. With the exponential increase in cases of COVID-19 throughout the world, there is a need to understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the health of pregnant women, through extrapolation of earlier studies that have been conducted on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. There is an urgent need to understand the chance of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus and the possibility of the virus crossing the placental barrier. Additionally, since some viral diseases and antiviral drugs may have a negative impact on the mother and fetus, in which case, pregnant women need special attention for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","Fathi, Mobina; Vakili, Kimia; Deravi, Niloofar; Yaghoobpoor, Shirin; Ahsan, Elahe; Mokhtari, Melika; Moshfeghi, Maryam; Vaezjalali, Maryam",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,492,24

We addressed this gap by conducting an online survey of members of IPV and sexual assault workforce using a broad, web-based recruitment strategy. In total, 352 staff from 24 states participated. We collaborated with practitioner networks and anti-violence coalitions to develop the brief survey, which included questions about work and health, safety planning, and stress. We used chi-square, t-test, and ANOVA analysis techniques to analyze differences within position and demographic variables. For qualitative data, we used thematic analysis to analyze responses from four open-ended questions. The sample was majority female-identified (93.7%) and essential workers in dual IPV and sexual assault programs (80.7%). Findings demonstrated that since the pandemic began, IPV and sexual assault staff are experiencing more personal and professional stressors, perceive a decrease in client safety, and lack resources needed to help survivors and themselves. Common problems included a lack of food or supplies at home and work and housing and financial support for survivors. There was a 51% increase in the use of video conference for work, which contributed to workforce strain. Reductions in overall service capacity and a shift to remote service provision have implications for both survivors and staff. These findings suggest a critical need for additional training, infrastructure, and support for the IPV and sexual assault workforce. There is an urgent need to classify IPV and sexual assault staff as first responders and address the occupational stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wood, Leila; Schrag, Rachel Voth; Baumler, Elizabeth; Hairston, Dixie; Guillot-Wright, Shannon; Torres, Elizabeth; Temple, Jeff R",Journal of interpersonal violence,492,1

The process of gentrification can bring about improved neighborhood conditions, reduced rates of crime, and property value increases. At the same time, it can equally foster negative conditions associated with poorer health outcomes, such as disrupted social networks from residential displacement and increases in stress. While neighborhood environment is consistently implicated in health outcomes research, gentrification is rarely conceptualized as a public health issue. Though research on gentrification is growing, empirical studies evaluating the health impacts of gentrification in the US are poorly understood. Here we systematically review US population-based empirical studies examining relationships between gentrification and health. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Search Complete) were searched using a combination of terms to identify peer-reviewed studies published on or before July 9, 2018, reporting associations between gentrification and health. Study title and abstract screenings were followed by full-text review of all studies meeting the following inclusion criteria of: ≥ 1 quantitative measure of association for a health outcome, within the context of gentrification; peer-reviewed research; located in the US; and English language. Of 8937 studies identified, 6152 underwent title and abstract screening, and 50 studies underwent full-text screening, yielding six studies for review. Gentrification exposure measures and health outcomes examined varied widely. Most studies reported little to no overall association between gentrification and health outcomes; however, gentrification was repeatedly associated with undesirable health effects among Black and economically vulnerable residents. Despite seemingly overall null associations between gentrification and health, evidence suggests that gentrification may negatively impact the health of certain populations, particularly Black and low-income individuals. Complexities inherent in operationalizing gentrification point toward the need for validated measures. Additionally, understanding how gentrification-health associations differ across health endpoints, race/ethnicities, socioeconomic status, and life course can provide insight into whether this process contributes to urban inequality and health disparities. As gentrification occurs across the US, it is important to understand how this process impacts health. While aging cities reinvest in the revitalization of communities, empirical research examining relationships between gentrification and health can help inform policy decisions.","Smith, Genee S; Breakstone, Hannah; Dean, Lorraine T; Thorpe, Roland J",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,492,31

Studies have suggested that recently approved stent retrievers are safer and more effective than earlier-generation thrombectomy devices. The authors compared cases in which the Solitaire-FR device was used to those in which a MERCI or Penumbra device was used. METHODS This study is a single-center retrospective review of 102 consecutive cases of acute stroke in which patients were treated with mechanical thrombectomy devices between 2007 and 2013. Multivariate models, adjusted for confounding factors, were used to investigate functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≤ 2, and successful reperfusion (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [TICI] score ≥ 2b). RESULTS Thrombectomy device had a significant impact on functional independence (mRS score ≤ 2) at discharge from the hospital (p = 0.040). Solitaire-FR treatment resulted in significantly more patients being discharged as functionally independent in comparison with MERCI treatment (p = 0.016). A multivariate model found the use of Solitaire-FR to improve the odds of good clinical outcome in comparison with prior-generation devices (OR 6.283, 95% CI 1.785-22.119, p = 0.004). Additionally, the use of Solitaire-FR significantly increased the odds of successful reperfusion (OR 3.247, 95% CI 1.160-9.090, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS The stent retriever Solitaire-FR significantly improved the odds of functional independence and successful revascularization of the arterial tree.

RECENT FINDINGS In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, Herpesviridae, mostly herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus, are commonly recovered from the respiratory tract. However, viral detection does not necessarily mean viral disease, and the exact role of viruses recovered in the respiratory tract is still being debated. Are they only benign colonizers activated in proportion to the severity of the underlying illness, or are they infectious agents with true attributable morbidity or mortality or both? SUMMARY Respiratory viruses are responsible for 10% of community-acquired pneumonia cases but do not cause nosocomial pneumonia. Herpesviridae, mainly herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus, are commonly detected in the respiratory tract of nonimmunocompromised, mechanically ventilated patients. Although their detection usually reflects viral reactivation without lung parenchymal involvement, in a particular subset of patients, viral lung disease (bronchopneumonitis) occurs. This bronchopneumonitis seems to have a true impact on outcome, but only interventional studies will be able to determine its real impact. Whether other viruses, such as mimivirus, are responsible for nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients requires additional studies.","Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Combes, Alain; Nieszkowska, Ania; Trouillet, Jean-Louis; Chastre, Jean",Current opinion in critical care,492,0

The findings showed that good nursing practice balanced a person-centred approach with a common staff approach, allowing people who self-harm and staff to share responsibility for structuring everyday life, keeping to the plan, communicating decisions, and finding individual opportunities for relief. Reflective discussions among the staff concerning prejudice, emotional stress, lack of resources, and shortcomings in care planning could also prevent a stigmatizing culture and organizational deficiencies, which would be beneficial for both the people who self-harm and the staff.","Lindgren, Britt-Marie; Molin, Jenny; Graneheim, Ulla H",Issues in mental health nursing,492,17

A complete thrombotic occlusion developing from an atherosclerotic plaque in an epicardial coronary vessel is the cause of STEMI in the majority of cases. Early diagnosis and immediate reperfusion are the most effective ways to limit myocardial ischaemia and infarct size and thereby reduce the risk of post-STEMI complications and heart failure. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the preferred reperfusion strategy in patients with STEMI; if PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes of STEMI diagnosis, fibrinolysis therapy should be administered to dissolve the occluding thrombus. The initiation of networks to provide around-the-clock cardiac catheterization availability and the generation of standard operating procedures within hospital systems have helped to reduce the time to reperfusion therapy. Together with new advances in antithrombotic therapy and preventive measures, these developments have resulted in a decrease in mortality from STEMI. However, a substantial amount of patients still experience recurrent cardiovascular events after STEMI. New insights have been gained regarding the pathophysiology of STEMI and feed into the development of new treatment strategies.","Vogel, Birgit; Claessen, Bimmer E; Arnold, Suzanne V; Chan, Danny; Cohen, David J; Giannitsis, Evangelos; Gibson, C Michael; Goto, Shinya; Katus, Hugo A; Kerneis, Mathieu; Kimura, Takeshi; Kunadian, Vijay; Pinto, Duane S; Shiomi, Hiroki; Spertus, John A; Steg, P Gabriel; Mehran, Roxana",Nature reviews.

Bleeding is an expected complication, and its risk is assumed to be increased in patients on anticoagulants. However, the effect of anticoagulation on BM biopsy safety is unclear and guidelines are lacking robust data in this regard. As such, physicians use their clinical judgement to guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE To provide the best available evidence regarding management of anticoagulation in patients who need BM biopsy. METHODS We reviewed and summarized available guidelines directing management of periprocedural anticoagulation for BM biopsy, and share our experience and practices with BM biopsy at our institution. RESULTS The incidence of significant hemorrhage after BM biopsy is very low (0.007-1.1%). BM biopsy is classified as having a low to moderate bleeding risk. Interrupting anticoagulation is not consistently recommended. Strategies exist to minimize bleeding risk for anticoagulated patients. Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms can develop an acquired von Willebrand syndrome which increases their risk for bleeding and therefore require extra vigilance to ensure appropriate hemostasis. CONCLUSION Withholding anticoagulation prior to BM biopsy is not routinely recommended. Instead, assessment and optimization of bleeding risk factors should be done on a patient by patient basis.","Moore, Cameron; Kotchetkov, Rouslan",Hematology,492,1

The mechanism(s) causing these complications is independent of the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks voltage-gated sodium channels, thus provides an ideal system to investigate lidocaine-induced protein and pathway alterations. Whole-proteome alterations leading to these complications have not been identified. To address this, S. cerevisiae was grown to stationary phase and exposed to an LC50 dose of lidocaine. The differential proteomes of lidocaine treatment and control were resolved 6 h post exposure using 2D DIGE. Amine reactive dyes and carbonyl reactive dyes were used to assess protein abundance and protein oxidation, respectively. Quantitative analysis of these dyes (⩾ 1.5-fold alteration, p ⩽ 0.05) revealed a total of 33 proteoforms identified by MS differing in abundance and/or oxidation upon lidocaine exposure. Network analysis showed enrichment of apoptotic proteins and cell wall maintenance proteins, while the abundance of proteins central to carbohydrate metabolism, such as triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and redox proteins superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin were significantly decreased. Enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, such as phosphoglycerate kinase and enolase, the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase, and multiple ATP synthase subunits were found to be oxidatively modified. Also, the activity of aconitase was found to be decreased. Overall, these data suggest that toxic doses of lidocaine induce significant disruption of glycolytic pathways, energy production, and redox balance, potentially leading to cell malfunction and death.","Boone, Cory H T; Grove, Ryan A; Adamcova, Dana; Braga, Camila P; Adamec, Jiri",Proteomics,492,1

While a narrow, collapsible oropharynx plays a central role in the pathophysiology of OSAS, there are other equally important nonanatomic factors including sleep-stage dependent muscle tone, arousal threshold, and loop gain that drive obstructive apneas and hypopneas. Through mechanisms of intermittent hypoxemia, arousal-related sleep fragmentation, and intrathoracic pressure changes, OSAS impacts multiple organ systems. Risk factors for OSAS include obesity, male sex, age, specific craniofacial features, and ethnicity. The prevalence of OSAS is rising due to increasing obesity rates and improved sensitivity in the tools used for diagnosis. Validated questionnaires have an important but limited role in the identification of patients that would benefit from formal testing for OSA. While an in-laboratory polysomnography remains the gold standard for diagnosis, the widespread availability and accuracy of home sleep apnea testing modalities increase access and ease of OSAS diagnosis for many patients. In adults, the most common treatment involves the application of positive airway pressure (PAP), but compliance continues to be a challenge. Alternative treatments including mandibular advancement device, hypoglossal nerve stimulator, positional therapies, and surgical options coupled with weight loss and exercise offer possibilities of an individualized personal approach to OSAS. Treatment of symptomatic patients with OSAS has been found to be beneficial with regard to sleep-related quality of life, sleepiness, and motor vehicle accidents. The benefit of treating asymptomatic OSA patients, particularly with regard to cardiovascular outcomes, is controversial and more data are needed.","Lee, Janet J; Sundar, Krishna M",Lung,492,16

Although the devices are simple to use, data output may be inaccurate or hard to interpret in certain situations, which could lead to inappropriate clinical decisions. The purpose of this review is to consider such issues in greater detail. After examining the operating principles of pulse oximetry, we describe the available devices and the potential uses of oximetry at high altitude. We then consider the pitfalls of pulse oximetry in this environment and provide recommendations about how to deal with these issues. Device users should recognize that oxygen saturation changes rapidly in response to small changes in oxygen tensions at high altitude and that device accuracy declines with arterial oxygen saturations of less than 80%. The normal oxygen saturation at a given elevation may not be known with certainty and should be viewed as a range of values, rather than a specific number. For these reasons, clinical decisions should not be based on small differences in saturation over time or among individuals. Effort should also be made to minimize factors that cause measurement errors, including cold extremities, excess ambient light, and ill-fitting oximeter probes. Attention to these and other issues will help the users of these devices to apply them in appropriate situations and to minimize erroneous clinical decisions.","Luks, Andrew M; Swenson, Erik R",High altitude medicine & biology,492,16

METHODS One hundred and seventy-nine cryptococcemia patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Demographic characteristics, blood test results and outcome were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The diagnosis time of Cryptococcus infection was 2.0(0-6.0) days for HIV-infected patients, 5.0 (1.5-8.0) days for HIV-uninfected patients (P = 0.008), 2.0 (1.0-6.0) days for cryptococcal meningitis (CM) patients and 6.0 (5.0-8.0) days for non-CM patients (P < 0.001). HIV infection [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) (95% confidence interval); 6.0(2.3-15.9)], CRP < 15 mg/L [AOR:3.7(1.7-8.1)) and hemoglobin >110 g/L [AOR:2.5(1.2-5.4)] were risk factors for CM development. Forty-six (25.7%) patients died within 90 days. ICU stay [AOR:2.8(1.1-7.1)], hypoalbuminemia [AOR:2.7(1.4-5.3)], no anti-cryptococcal treatment [AOR:4.7(1.9-11.7)] and altered consciousness [AOR:2.4(1.0-5.5)] were independent risk factors for 90-day mortality in all patients. HIV infection did not increase the 90-day mortality of cryptococcemia patients when anti-Cryptococcus treatment was available. Non-Amphotericin B treatment [AOR:3.4(1.0-11.2)] was associated with 90-day mortality in HIV-infected patients, but age ≥ 50.0 years old [AOR:2.7(1.0-2.9)], predisposing disease [AOR:4.1(1.2-14.2)] and altered consciousness [AOR:3.7(1.1-12.9)] were associated with 90-day mortality in HIV-uninfected patients who accepted anti-Cryptococcus treatment. CONCLUSION HIV infection increased the incidence of CM rather than mortality in cryptococcemia patients. The predictive model was completely divergent in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients, suggesting that novel strategies for diagnosis and treatment algorithms are urgently needed.","Zhao, Handan; Zhou, Minghan; Zheng, Qing; Zhu, Mingjian; Yang, Zongxing; Hu, Caiqin; Xu, Lijun",Mycoses,492,7

Here we report that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) initially seeded on FFR filter material is inactivated (6 log reduction as measured by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)) after dry heating at 75 °C for 30 minutes. We also find that the quantitative fit of FFRs after heat treatment at this temperature, under dry conditions or at 90% relative humidity, is not affected by single or ten heating cycles. Previous studies have reported that the filtration efficiency of FFR filters is not negatively impacted by these heating conditions. These results suggest that thermal inactivation of coronaviruses is a potentially rapid and widely deployable method to re-use N95 FFRs in emergency situations where re-using FFRs is a necessity and broad-spectrum sterilization is unavailable. However, we also found that a heat source that emits radiation (e.g., an exposed heating element) results in rapid qualitative degradation of the FFR. Finally, we discuss differences in the results reported here and other recent studies investing heat as a means to recycle FFRs and suggest that overall wear time and donning/doffing cycles are important factors that need to be considered.","Massey, Travis; Borucki, Monica; Paik, Sam; Fuhrer, Kyle; Bora, Mihail; Kane, Staci; Haque, Razi; BAXAMUSA, SALMAAN H",,492,28

I claim that it is not enough to introduce countermeasures, as individuals must follow them if they are to be effective. The acceptance of such measures is reflected in individuals' degrees of mobility decrease and contact reduction, the aims of governmental restrictions. I identify a group of attitudes connected with individuals' responses that differ across countries. They are associated with social relations and approaches to dealing with problems. The analysis confirms that formal restrictions can be seen as successful only if they are supported by strong informal institutions. In some cases, they even define individuals' reactions more than formal recommendations. The findings are useful not only for explaining the special case of reaction to pandemic restrictions but also for investigating what generally determines individuals' compliance with formal rules.","Bentkowska, Katarzyna",Journal of Institutional Economics,492,30

To investigate this phenomenon, we generated two lines of Vero cells that stably expressed either C (C-Vero cells) or C lacking the eight N-terminal residues (Cdelta8-Vero cells), a construct previously shown to be unable to complement DeltaNotI. In C-Vero cells but not Vero or Cdelta8-Vero cells, replication of a wild-type (wt) replicon expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene (RUBrep/GFP) was enhanced, and replication of a replicon with deltaNotI (RUBrep/GFP-deltaNotI) was rescued. Surprisingly, replicons with deleterious mutations in the 5' and 3' cis-acting elements were also rescued in C-Vero cells. Interestingly, the Cdelta8 construct localized to the nucleus while the C construct localized in the cytoplasm, explaining the lack of enhancement and rescue in Cdelta8-Vero cells since rubella virus replication occurs in the cytoplasm. Enhancement and rescue in C-Vero cells were at a basic step in the replication cycle, resulting in a substantial increase in the accumulation of replicon-specific RNAs. There was no difference in translation of the nonstructural proteins in C-Vero and Vero cells transfected with the wt and mutant replicons, demonstrating that enhancement and rescue were not due to an increase in the efficiency of translation of the transfected replicon transcripts. In replicon-transfected C-Vero cells, C and the P150 replicase protein associated by coimmunoprecipitation, suggesting that C might play a role in RNA replication, which could explain the enhancement and rescue phenomena.

Other 12 respiratory viruses including human bocavirus (HBoV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (PIV1-4), influenza virus A/B (IFVA/B), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) were also identified by PCR method. All PCR positive products were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was conducted. It was showed that adenoviruses were detected in 171 patients out of 644 (26. 55%) children, 120 (70.18%, 120/171) for ADV3, 16 (9.36%,16/171) for ADV7, 12 (7.02%, 12/171) for ADV1, 10 (5.85%, 10/171) for ADV2, 6 (3.51%, 6/171) for ADV5, 3 (1.75%, 3/171) for ADV6, 3 (1.75%, 3/171) for ADV57, and 1 (0.58%,1/171) for ADV41. ADV infection could occur in any season. There was a higher possibility of ADV infection from April to July in 2011. Most cases (96.49%) were younger than 7 years old. A total of 99 of the 171 ADV-positive children (57.89%) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were the most common additional respiratory viruses, Lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent diagnoses made in the hospital, in which there were 52 pneumonia (30.4%) cases. CONCLUSION ADV is one of the most important pathogens of acute respiratory tract infection in children in Nanjing area, and adenovirus type 3 was the most prevalent serotype. It is important to develop long-term surveillance.","Gao, Xiao-Qian; Jin, Yu; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Gao, Han-Chun; Xie, Le-Yun; Zhang, Jian; Duan, Zhao-Jun",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,492,33

Perpetual evolution of viruses is reflected in changing disease patterns, so that familiar viruses are sometimes discovered to cause new or unexpected diseases. For example, canine parvovirus (CPV) has regained the ability to infect felids and cause a panleucopenia-like illness. Feline panleucopenia virus (FPV) has been shown to cause fading in young kittens and has recently been implicated as a possible cause of feline idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Molecular scrutiny of viral diseases sometimes permits deeper understanding of pathogenesis and epizootiology. Feline gastrointestinal lymphomas have not, in the past, been strongly associated with retroviral infections, yet some of these tumours harbour retroviral proviruses. Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) may play a role in lymphomagenesis, even in cats diagnosed as uninfected using conventional criteria. There is strong evidence that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) can also be oncogenic. The variant feline coronaviruses that cause invariably-fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) arise by sporadic mutation of an ubiquitous and only mildly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV); a finding that has substantial management implications for cat breeders and veterinarians. Conversely, canine enteric coronavirus (CECV) shows considerable genetic and antigenic diversity but causes only mild, self-limiting diarrhoea in puppies. Routine vaccination against this virus is not recommended. Although parvoviruses, coronaviruses and retroviruses are the most important known viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease, other viruses play a role. Feline and canine rotaviruses have combined with human rotaviruses to produce new, reassortant, zoonotic viruses. Some companion animal rotaviruses can infect humans directly. Undoubtedly, further viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease await discovery.","Squires, R A",New Zealand veterinary journal,492,1

Recently, a wide variety of spatial and network models have been proposed that incorporate various aspects of interaction structure among individuals. However, these more complex models necessarily suffer from limited tractability, rendering general conclusions difficult to draw. In seeking a compromise between parsimony and realism, we introduce a class of metapopulation models in which we assume homogeneous mixing holds within local contexts, and that these contexts are embedded in a nested hierarchy of successively larger domains. We model the movement of individuals between contexts via simple transport parameters and allow diseases to spread stochastically. Our model exhibits some important stylized features of real epidemics, including extreme size variation and temporal heterogeneity, that are difficult to characterize with traditional measures. In particular, our results suggest that when epidemics do occur the basic reproduction number R(0) may bear little relation to their final size. Informed by our model's behavior, we suggest measures for characterizing epidemic thresholds and discuss implications for the control of epidemics.","Watts, Duncan J; Muhamad, Roby; Medina, Daniel C; Dodds, Peter S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,492,27

This progress led to marked decrease in mortality rates in anesthesia. In the group of chiral fluorinated compounds, halothane (Fluotan®), isoflurane (Foran®), desflurane (Supran®) and enflurane (Ehran®) are deployed as volatile anesthetics. Chiral anesthetics possess a stereogenic center in their molecules and thus exist as two enantiomers (S)-(+) and (R)-(-). Although these chiral anesthetics are used as racemates, it is crucial to study besides the bioactivities of the racemic compounds also the biological activity and other properties of the particular enantiomers. The present survey discusses the drug category known as inhalational anesthetics in regard to their chiral aspects. These compounds exhibit marked differences between the (R) and (S)-enantiomers in their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity. The main analytical technique employed in the enantioseparation of these compounds is gas chromatography (GC). This review lists the individual chiral phases (chiral selectors) used in the enantioseparation as well as in pharmacokinetic studies. The possibilities of preparation of these compounds in their enantiomerically pure form by means of stereoselective synthesis are also mentioned.","Markuliak, Ružena Čižmáriková Ladislav Habala Mário",Ceska a Slovenska farmacie : casopis Ceske farmaceuticke spolecnosti a Slovenske farmaceuticke spolecnosti,492,1

This study aimed to find the symptom combinations associated with adverse outcome and the therapeutic effects in a cohort of patients with probable SARS retrospectively. In 2003, 123 SARS cases in Beijing were subjected to a strictly western medicine (WM) treatment, or a combined treatment (WM plus Herba houttuyniae injection, addition of individualized herbal treatments when necessary), of which 115 were followed till death or discharge; 8 were transferred and lost to follow-up. In both treatment groups, clinical manifestations were evaluated daily; development of signs and symptoms, and their possible relationship with outcome, were assessed. The relationships between these sign/symptom complexes and outcome under two treatment protocols were evaluated and differences were noted. Dynamic symptom combinations, dividing into the early, the medium-term and the durational symptom clusters, were identified as likely being related to the adverse outcomes of SARS (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Compared with a strictly WM treatment, the combined treatment resulted in a longer hospital stay (p = 0.028), a non-statistically significant mortality rate decrease (combined treatment: 9.6% versus WM: 11.1%), and a significant improvement of arthralgia and myalgia (p < 0.05) in the early symptom cluster. Additionally, the combined protocol improved arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation significantly at day 22 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the progress and outcome of SARS may be associated with specific temporal patterns of development in combination of several non-specific signs and symptom complexes, which are also helpful for evaluating the therapeutic effects on SARS patients.","Li, Shao; Wang, Ruiqin; Zhang, Yulong; Zhang, Xuegong; Layon, A Joseph; Li, Yanda; Chen, Mingzhe",The American journal of Chinese medicine,492,20

We and others have previously shown that the replication of SARS-CoV can be suppressed by exogenously added interferon (IFN), a cytokine which is normally synthesized by cells as a reaction to virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV escapes IFN-mediated growth inhibition by preventing the induction of IFN-beta. In SARS-CoV-infected cells, no endogenous IFN-beta transcripts and no IFN-beta promoter activity were detected. Nevertheless, the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which is essential for IFN-beta promoter activity, was transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus early after infection with SARS-CoV. However, at a later time point in infection, IRF-3 was again localized in the cytoplasm. By contrast, IRF-3 remained in the nucleus of cells infected with the IFN-inducing control virus Bunyamwera delNSs. Other signs of IRF-3 activation such as hyperphosphorylation, homodimer formation, and recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) were found late after infection with the control virus but not with SARS-CoV. Our data suggest that nuclear transport of IRF-3 is an immediate-early reaction to virus infection and may precede its hyperphosphorylation, homodimer formation, and binding to CBP. In order to escape activation of the IFN system, SARS-CoV appears to block a step after the early nuclear transport of IRF-3.","Spiegel, Martin; Pichlmair, Andreas; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; Cros, Jerome; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Haller, Otto; Weber, Friedemann",Journal of virology,492,31

DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Community hospital. PATIENTS Between April 17 and April 26, 2003, 32 consecutive patients with SARS were encountered. Investigation consisted of local examination of ear, nose, and throat fields; palpation of the nuchal areas; and plain chest radiography. Analyses of throat swab samples using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were conducted. RESULTS Clinical manifestations included fever in 31 patients (97%), followed by cough, dyspnea, chill, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, and otalgia. Neither the pharyngeal wall nor the tonsillar area demonstrated hyperemia. There was no lymphadenopathy in the neck. Plain chest radiographs revealed consolidation in 25 (78%) of 32 patients. Results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis targeting the novel coronavirus present in throat swab samples were positive in 19 (66%) of 29 patients tested. Twenty-eight patients required supplemental oxygen, and 14 patients were intubated with mechanical ventilation. Twenty-eight patients survived and 4 patients died. CONCLUSIONS When presented with a patient with flulike symptoms such as fever and/or cough, but no pharyngeal hyperemia or neck lymphadenopathy, physicians should be alerted to the possibility of SARS. In contrast, evidence of inflammatory signs in the otolaryngological field may explain the flulike symptoms, and serve as a differential diagnostic tool between influenza and SARS.","Chen, Hsin-Chi; Young, Yi-Ho; Luo, Jyh-Perng; Tsai, Hui-Ju; Ho, Sung-Jung; Yeh, Chi-Huang; Huang, Lien-Chi",Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,492,9

DESIGN A cross-sectional survey of hospitals in Ontario was used to determine whether they permitted dogs to visit patients and, if so, where the dogs originated. On the basis of this information, dog owners were then contacted through their respective associations and interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. SETTING A cross-section of hospitals in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS A total of 223 (97%) of the 231 hospitals surveyed responded. Ninety owners of 102 visitation dogs were interviewed. RESULTS A total of 201 (90%) of the 223 hospitals indicated that dogs were permitted in their facilities. Origins ranged from national therapy-dog agencies to the patients' families. Acute care wards were 5.1 times as likely than other wards to disallow animals (95% confidence interval, 2.2-12.2; P<.001). According to the 90 dog owners included in the study, the screening protocols that dogs were required to pass to participate in their respective visitation programs were highly variable, as were the owners' infection control practices. Eighteen owners (20%) said they did not practice any infection control. Sixty-six owners (73%) allowed their dogs on patients' beds, and 71 (79%) let their dogs lick patients. Thirty-six owners (40%) were unable to name one zoonotic disease that may be transmitted from their dog. CONCLUSIONS Although canine-visitation programs have become standard practice in nonacute human healthcare facilities, infection control and dog-screening practices are highly variable and potentially deficient.

However, the mental health challenges and complexities faced by hospital staff in the United States has not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we conducted this study to examine the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among hospital staff in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The design is a single-center, cross-sectional, online survey evaluating depression and anxiety among all hospital employees (n = 3,500) at a safety-net hospital with a moderate cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate between April 30-May 22, 2020. We assessed depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to identify associations with depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Of 3,500 hospital employees, 1,246 (36%) responded to the survey. We included 1,232 individuals in the final analysis. Overall, psychological distress was common among the respondents: 21% and 33% of staff reported significant depression and anxiety, respectively, while 46% experienced overwhelming stress due to COVID-19. Notably, staff members overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 were seven and nine times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, respectively. In addition to stress, individuals with six to nine years of work experience were two times more likely to report moderate or severe depression compared to those with 10 or more years of work experience. Moreover, ancillary staff with direct patient contact (odds ratio [OR] 8.9, confidence interval (CI), 1.46, 173.03) as well as administrative and ancillary staff with indirect patient contact (OR 5.9, CI, 1.06, 111.01) were more likely to be depressed than physicians and advanced providers. CONCLUSION: We found that a considerable proportion of staff were suffering from psychological distress. COVID-19-associated depression and anxiety was widespread among hospital staff even in settings with comparatively lower COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Ancillary staff, administrative staff, staff with less job experience, and staff overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 are particularly susceptible to negative mental health outcomes. These findings will help inform hospital policymakers on best practices to develop interventions to reduce the mental health burden associated with COVID-19 in vulnerable hospital staff.","Hassamal, Sameer; Dong, Fanglong; Hassamal, Sunita; Lee, Carol; Ogunyemi, Dotun; Neeki, Michael M",West J Emerg Med,492,16

Additional facets include the sympathetic adrenergic system, for which adrenaline is the key effector; the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis; arginine vasopressin (synonymous with anti-diuretic hormone); the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with angiotensin II and aldosterone the main effectors; and cholinergic anti-inflammatory and sympathetic inflammasomal pathways. A hierarchical brain network-the ""central autonomic network""-regulates these systems; embedded within it are components of the Chrousos/Gold ""stress system."" Acute, coordinated alterations in homeostatic settings (allostasis) can be crucial for surviving stressors such as traumatic hemorrhage, asphyxiation, and sepsis, which throughout human evolution have threatened homeostasis; however, intense or long-term EAS activation may cause harm. While required for appropriate responses in emergencies, EAS activation in the setting of chronically decreased homeostatic efficiencies (dyshomeostasis) may reduce thresholds for induction of destabilizing, lethal vicious cycles. Testable hypotheses derived from these concepts are that biomarkers of EAS activation correlate with clinical and pathophysiologic data and predict outcome in COVID-19 and that treatments targeting specific abnormalities identified in individual patients may be beneficial.","Goldstein, David S",Clin Auton Res,492,19

Unfortunately, this unusual feature can often lead to missed or delayed diagnosis with potential life-threatening outcomes. Clinical Case: The patient is a 53-year-old Caucasian male with PMH of type 2 diabetes mellitus treating with Metformin and Empagliflozin. He presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, and decreased oral intake for a couple of days. Vital signs at presentation were: Temperature 98.2 °F, pulse rate 108 beats/min, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure 134/72 mmHg. He was alert but ill-looking, moderately dehydrated with dry mucus membranes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable at the time of admission. In the initial blood work, sugar was found to be mildly elevated (163mg/dl), and hemoconcentration besides mild pre-renal acute kidney injury was detected. He was also found infected by the COVID-19 virus without hypoxemia or signs of pneumonia. Arterial blood gases showed metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap (PH 7.21, CO2 39.93mmHg, HCO3− 10mEq/L, anion gap 21mEq/L). Urine analysis was positive for ketones and glucose. After ruling out other causes of metabolic acidosis by screening for alcohols, salicylates, acetaminophen, lactic acid, and urine toxicology;the diagnosis of EDKA was made. He was treated with a 3L bolus of IV normal saline and an insulin drip with dextrose solution started as per the protocol based on his glucose levels and promptly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Serial blood tests showed gradual resolution of ketoacidosis and anion gap normalized after 36 hours when insulin drip was stopped and replaced by subcutaneous insulin therapy. Conclusion: SGLT2 inhibitors increase the urinary excretion rate of glucose and subsequent fall in plasma glucose level. Thus, In the absence of exogenous insulin use, increase glucagon release resulting in upregulation of lipolysis and activation of the ketogenesis. Factors such as low oral intake, concurrent infection, and alcohol use can also exacerbate the process. Timely diagnosis of EDKA can be a challenge for physicians unfamiliar with this class of medications, additionally, ketone studies and blood gas analyses are not part of the routine workup for diabetic patients in the emergency department. We recommend all first-line care providers to consider ketosis in ill patients with diabetes and metabolic acidosis, despite the normal or near-normal serum glucose levels. EDKA is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion, but treatment is not different from DKA;correcting dehydration by using intravenous fluids and then, initiating insulin drip along with dextrose-containing solutions, and frequent monitoring of serum anion gap.","TakallooBakhtiari, Asieh Butina Julio Piedra Funderburk Sheri A.

Most critically ill patients have respiratory failure and there is an international effort to understand mechanisms and predictors of disease severity. Coagulopathy, characterized by elevations in D-dimer and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs), is associated with critical illness and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, increasing reports of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi suggest that hemostatic imbalances may contribute to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We review the laboratory and clinical findings of patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, and prior studies of hemostasis in other viral infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We hypothesize that an imbalance between coagulation and inflammation may result in a hypercoagulable state. Although thrombosis initiated by the innate immune system is hypothesized to limit SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, aberrant activation of this system can cause endothelial injury resulting in loss of thromboprotective mechanisms, excess thrombin generation, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis and thrombosis. The role various components including neutrophils, neutrophil extracellular traps, activated platelets, microparticles, clotting factors, inflammatory cytokines, and complement play in this process remains an area of active investigation and ongoing clinical trials target these different pathways in COVID-19.","Colling, Meaghan E; Kanthi, Yogendra",Vasc Med,492,2

We use China's high-speed rail (HSR) network at the scale of prefecture level to assess, based on a probabilistic risk model, the risk of COVID-19 infection from Wuhan to the country's 31 province-level regions at the early stage of domestic spread. We find that the high-risk regions are mainly distributed along the southern half of Beijing-Hong Kong HSR line, where a large number of infection cases have been confirmed at the early stage. Furthermore, the two components of the infection risk, namely, the probability (proxied by the region's correlation with Wuhan through HSR) and the impact (proxied by the region's population with mobility), can play different roles in the risk ranking for different regions. For public health administrators, these findings may be used for better decision making, including the preparation of emergency plans and supplies, and the allocation of limited resources, before the extensive spread of the epidemic. Moreover, the administrators should adopt different intervention measures for different regions, so as to better mitigate the epidemic spread according to their own risk scenarios with respect to the probability of occurring and, once occurred, the impact.","Li, Tao; Rong, Lili; Zhang, Anming",,492,24

Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/µL. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","Alafeef, Maha; Moitra, Parikshit; Dighe, Ketan; Pan, Dipanjan",Nat.

METHODS: A national survey was conducted May 2020 to investigate the association between mental health symptoms, social isolation, and financial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and thoughts of suicide and self-harm. A total of 6607 US adults completed an online survey; survey criteria included an age minimum of 22 years old and reported annual gross income of $75,000 or below. Statistical raking procedures were conducted to more precisely weight the sample using US Census data on age, geographic region, sex, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: COVID-19-related stress symptoms, loneliness, and financial strain were associated with thoughts of suicide/self-harm in multivariable logistic regression analyses, as were younger age, being a military veteran, past homelessness, lifetime severe mental illness, current depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse, and having tested positive for COVID-19. Greater social support was inversely related to thoughts of suicide/self-harm whereas running out of money for basic needs (e.g., food), housing instability (e.g., delaying rent), and filing for unemployment or disability were positively related. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions to decrease risk of suicide and self-harm in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic should address pandemic-related stress, social isolation, and financial strain experienced including food insecurity, job loss, and risk of eviction/homelessness.","Elbogen, Eric B; Lanier, Megan; Blakey, Shannon M; Wagner, H Ryan; Tsai, Jack",Depress. anxiety,492,33

Currently available antiviral drugs have found to be unsuccessful in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The demand for efficient antiviral drugs has created a huge burden on physicians and health workers. Plasma therapy seems to be less accomplishable due to insufficient donors to donate plasma and low recovery rate from viral infection. Repurposing of antivirals has been evolved as a suitable strategy in the current treatment and preventive measures. The concept of drug repurposing represents new experimental approaches for effective therapeutic benefits. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits several complications such as lung damage, blood clot formation, respiratory illness and organ failures in most of the patients. Based on the accumulation of data, sulfated marine polysaccharides have exerted successful inhibition of virus entry, attachment and replication with known or unknown possible mechanisms against deadly animal and human viruses so far. Since the virus entry into the host cells is the key process, the prevention of such entry mechanism makes any antiviral strategy effective. Enveloped viruses are more sensitive to polyanions than non-enveloped viruses. Besides, the viral infection caused by RNA virus types embarks severe oxidative stress in the human body that leads to malfunction of tissues and organs. In this context, polysaccharides play a very significant role in providing shielding effect against the virus due to their polyanionic rich features and a molecular weight that hinders their reactive surface glycoproteins. Significantly the functional groups especially sulfate, sulfate pattern and addition, uronic acids, monosaccharides, glycosidic linkage and high molecular weight have greater influence in the antiviral activity. Moreover, they are very good antioxidants that can reduce the free radical generation and provokes intracellular antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, polysaccharides enable a host-virus immune response, activate phagocytosis and stimulate interferon systems. Therefore, polysaccharides can be used as candidate drugs, adjuvants in vaccines or combination with other antivirals, antioxidants and immune-activating nutritional supplements and antiviral materials in healthcare products to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Andrew, Monic; Jayaraman, Gurunathan",Carbohydr Res,492,16

Obtaining data on specific source(s) and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV during nosocomial outbreaks has been challenging. We performed a clinical, epidemiological and phylogenetic investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV at a University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological and infection control data were obtained from patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs). Full genome sequencing was conducted on nucleic acid extracted directly from MERS-CoV PCR-confirmed clinical samples and phylogenetic analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis combined with published MERS-CoV genomes was performed. HCWs compliance with infection control practices was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 235 persons investigated, there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases, 10 were inpatients and 13 HCWs. Eight of 10 MERS inpatients died (80% mortality). There were no deaths among HCWs. The primary index case assumed from epidemiological investigation was not substantiated phylogenetically. 17/18 MERS cases were linked both phylogenetically and epidemiologically. One asymptomatic HCW yielded a MERS-CoV genome not directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Five HCWs with mild symptoms yielded >75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. HCW compliance with use of gowns was 62.1%, gloves 69.7%, and masks 57.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors and sources, including a HCW MERS-CoV 'carrier phenomenon', occur during nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks.

Healthcare workers who were evaluated as contacted were questioned in detail regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the time of contact, especially suitability of the masks, contact time and shape and all the data were recorded. A total of 53 index cases (40 HCW and 13 inpatients diagnosed as COVID-19) were detected during the study period. The number of HCW contacted with these index cases was 672. In our study, we examined the data of 40 index cases and 672 contacted HCW (total of 712 HCW). Only 3 of 40 index cases (7.5%) had hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection, the other 37 cases were infected by community sources. COVID-19 was not detected in 94.2% of the contacted HCW during the follow-up while 5.8% of them had positive PCR test results. Considering the possible way of contamination among the contacted HCW who developed COVID-19 during the follow-up period, it was determined that 13.1% of the cases were a result of taken care of patients, 86.9% of the cases were a result of being in hospital social environments (drinking tea, smoking, eating, chatting in the same room without personal precautions) and in the days after the contact, it was in the form of contact with healthcare personnel diagnosed with COVID-19. When the contacted HCW were questioned about using proper masks at the time of contact, we determined that 93.3% of them used masks during patient caring procedures, however, only 48.9% used masks when they were in social areas (p<0.001). Healthcare workers face an unprecedented risk of occupational disease and death due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is also observed that prolonged pandemia period caused health workers to disregard rigorous infection control precautions in social areas of hospitals which they follow inpatient care although this has shown to be the most common way of contamination. Commonly performed in-service training and causing awareness in all areas of the hospital about following infection control precautions and PPE usage and checking the process regularly are the most important ways to prevent HCW from being affected by COVID-19.","Korkmaz, Derya; Konya, Petek; Tünay, Havva; Demirtürk, Nese",Mikrobiyol Bul,492,10

Bed rest, obesity, hypoxia, coagulopathy, and acute excessive inflammation are potential mechanisms reported by previous studies. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to thrombosis is crucial for developing more appropriate prophylaxis and treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess fibrinolytic activity and thrombin generation in 78 Covid-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients admitted to the intensive care unit and 30 patients admitted to the internal medicine department were included in the study. All patients received thromboprophylaxis. We measured fibrinolytic parameters (tissue plasminogen activator, PAI-1, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, alpha2 anti-plasmin, and tissue plasminogen activator-modified ROTEM device), thrombin generation, and other coagulation tests (D-dimer, fibrinogen, factor VIII, antithrombin). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We observed two key findings: a high thrombin generation capacity that remained within normal values despite heparin therapy and a hypofibrinolysis mainly associated with increased PAI-1 levels. A modified ROTEM is able to detect both hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis simultaneously in Covid-19 patients with thrombosis.","Nougier, Christophe; Benoit, Remi; Simon, Marie; Desmurs-Clavel, Helene; Marcotte, Guillaume; Argaud, Laurent; David, Jean Stephane; Bonnet, Aurelie; Negrier, Claude; Dargaud, Yesim",J. thromb. haemost,492,1

METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed studies was conducted through January, 2020. The primary inclusion criteria for the studies were studies that evaluated outcomes based on the etiology of the fistula (i.e. radiotherapy/ablation (RA) vs non-radiotherapy/ablation (NRA). Martini RUF classification was utilized for the subgroup analysis. RESULTS: Out of 1948 papers, 7 studies with a total of 490 patients (251 in RA vs 239 NRA) were included in this study. Receiving RA increased the risk of permanent bowel diversion by 11.1 folds, eventual fistula recurrence by 9.1 folds, and post-op urinary incontinence (UI) by 2.6 folds. Similarly, compared to a Grade 0 fistula, a Grade I fistula increased the risk of permanent bowel diversion by 9.1 folds, fistula recurrence by 20 folds, and post-op UI by 2.7 folds. There were some valuable variables that were not captured by the Martini classification. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the Martini classification system is efficacious in stratifying post-op complications from RUF repair based on the grade and etiology; however, it is limited in application. There is an opportunity for the development of more comprehensive staging systems in this domain.","Mishra, Kirtishri; Mahran, Amr; Abboud, Bissan; Bukavina, Laura; Elshafei, Ahmed; Ray, Al; Fernstrum, Austin; Abboud, Rayan; Elgammal, Mohammed; Zhao, Lee C; Gupta, Shubham",Urology,492,33

Thymol is the most important substance in the essential oil of this plant. Thymol is a natural monoterpene phenol with high anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant properties. Thymol in the latest research has a significant impact on slowing the progression of cancer cells in human. In this research, embryos were employed as convenient explants for the fast and effectual regeneration and transformation of T. ammi. To regenerate this plant, Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Gamborg's B5 (B5) media were supplemented with diverse concentrations of plant growth regulators, such as 6-benzyladenine (BA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and kinetin (kin). Transgenic Trachyspermum ammi plants were also obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and zygotic embryos explants. Moreover, two Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (EHA101 and LBA4404) harboring pBI121-TPS2 were utilized for genetic transformation to Trachyspermum ammi. RESULTS: According to the obtained results, the highest plant-regeneration frequency was obtained with B5 medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l NAA. The integrated gene was also approved using the PCR reaction and the Southern blot method. Results also showed that the EHA101 strain outperformed another strain in inoculation time (30 s) and co-cultivation period (1 day) (transformation efficiency 19.29%). Furthermore, HPLC method demonstrated that the transformed plants contained a higher thymol level than non-transformed plants. CONCLUSIONS: In this research, a fast protocol was introduced for the regeneration and transformation of Trachyspermum ammi, using zygotic embryo explants in 25-35 days. Our findings confirmed the increase in the thymol in the aerial part of Trachyspermum ammi. We further presented an efficacious technique for enhancing thymol content in Trachyspermum ammi using Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation system that can be beneficial in genetic transformation and other plant biotechnology techniques.","Nomani, Masoumeh; Tohidfar, Masoud",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,492,33

METHODS: One hundred oropharyngeal samples were obtained during routine work flow of testing symptomatic persons by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and were inoculated onto cell culture of VeroB4 cells to study the degree of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Quantification by virus titration and an external standard using synthetic RNA gave the breaking point of infectivity in SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. RESULTS: A clear negative correlation (r = - 0.76; p < 0.05) could be asserted between the viral load in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the probability of a successful isolation in serial isolation experiments of specific oropharyngeal samples positive in qPCR. Quantification by virus titration and an external standard using synthetic RNA indicate a Cq between 27 and 30 in E-gene screening PCR as a breaking point in vitro, where infectivity decreases significantly and isolations become less probable. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that only the 21% of samples with the highest viral load were infectious enough to transmit the virus in vitro and determined that the dispersion rate in vitro is surprisingly close to those calculated in large retrospective epidemiological studies for SARS-CoV-2. This raises the question of whether this simple in vitro model is suitable to give first insights in dispersion characters of novel or neglected viral pathogens. The statement that SARS-CoV-2 needs at least 40,000 copies to reliably induce infection in vitro is an indication of its transmissibility in Public Health decisions. Applying quantitative PCR systems in diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 can distinguish between patients providing a high risk of transmission and those, where the risk of transmission is probably limited to close and long-lasting contacts.","Sonnleitner, Sissy Therese; Dorighi, Julian; Jansen, Bianca; Schönegger, Carmen; Gietl, Sarah; Koblmüller, Stephan; Sturmbauer, Christian; Posch, Wilfried; Walder, Gernot",Virol J,492,7

As a country in a seismically active zone that relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, Taiwan is vigorously taking the next step in renewable energy development, which is pivotal to securing its position in global supply chains. Solar energy is today the most suitable renewable energy source for Taiwan. However, land prices and policies, and challenges of scale still hinder its development. In this context, identifying optimal sites for solar photovoltaic (PV) construction is a crucial task for major energy stakeholders. In this paper, a two-stage approach, combining the data envelopment analysis (DEA) models and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), has been done for the first time to identify the most suitable locations among 20 potential cities and counties of Taiwan for constructing solar PV farms. DEA models were applied to filter out the areas with the most potential by measuring their efficiency indices with temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and air pressure, as inputs, and sunshine hours and insolation, as outputs. The locations with perfect efficiency scores were then ranked with the AHP method. Five selected evaluation criteria (site characteristics, technical, economic, social, and environmental) and sub-criteria of each were utilized to prioritize the locations with solar energy potential. AHP was used to determine the relative weights of the criteria and sub-criteria and the final weights of the areas. For criteria weighting results, 'support mechanisms,' 'electric power transmission cost,' and 'electricity consumption demand' with weights of 0.332, 0.122, and 0.086, respectively, were found as the most significant sub-criteria. The final ranking suggests Tainan, Changhua, and Kaohsiung as the top three most suitable cities for constructing solar PV energy systems. © 2013 IEEE.","Wang, C. N.; Nguyen, N. A. T.; Dang, T.

The etiology is hypothesized to be related to thrombotic vasculopathy based on lesional biopsy specimen findings, but the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy is not completely understood. Here, we present a case of a retiform purpuric patch on the sacrum/buttocks in a hospitalized patient prior to subsequent diagnosis of COVID-19 and an eventual fatal disease course. Two lesional biopsy specimens at different time points in the disease course revealed thrombotic vasculopathy, despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Detailed histopathologic evaluation using immunohistochemical markers suggest the etiology of the vasculopathy involves both persistent complement activation and platelet aggregation, which possibly promote ongoing thrombus formation. This case highlights that sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may be a presenting sign of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and may represent an ominous sign supporting a future severe disease course. In addition, biopsy specimen findings at separate time points demonstrate that cutaneous vasculopathy may persist despite adequate systemic anticoagulation, possibly due to the combination of persistent complement and platelet activation. Finally, occlusive thrombi in sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may contribute to future ulceration and significant cutaneous morbidity in patients who survive COVID-19.","McBride, Jeffrey D; Narang, Jatin; Simonds, Robert; Agrawal, Shruti; Rodriguez, E Rene; Tan, Carmela D; Baldwin, William M; Dvorina, Nina; Krywanczyk, Alison R; Fernandez, Anthony P",J. cutan. pathol,492,24

No therapies or vaccines so far are recommended to treat or prevent the new coronavirus. A novel traditional Chinese medicine formula, Taiwan Chingguan Yihau (NRICM101), has been administered to patients with COVID-19 in Taiwan since April 2020. Its clinical outcomes and pharmacology have been evaluated. Among 33 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted in two medical centers, those (n = 12) who were older, sicker, with more co-existing conditions and showing no improvement after 21 days of hospitalization were given NRICM101. They achieved 3 consecutive negative results within a median of 9 days and reported no adverse events. Pharmacological assays demonstrated the effects of the formula in inhibiting the spike protein/ACE2 interaction, 3CL protease activity, viral plaque formation, and production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. This bedside-to-bench study suggests that NRICM101 may disrupt disease progression through its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, offering promise as a multi-target agent for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Tsai, Keng-Chang; Huang, Yi-Chia; Liaw, Chia-Ching; Tsai, Chia-I; Chiou, Chun-Tang; Lin, Chien-Jung; Wei, Wen-Chi; Lin, Sunny Jui-Shan; Tseng, Yu-Hwei; Yeh, Kuo-Ming; Lin, Yi-Ling; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Liang, Jian-Jong; Liao, Chun-Che; Chiou, Wen-Fei; Kuo, Yao-Haur; Lee, Shen-Ming; Lee, Ming-Yung; Su, Yi-Chang",Biomed Pharmacother,492,11

Human behavior and knowledge assessment during the crisis are critical in the overall efforts to contain the outbreak. To assess knowledge, attitude, perceptions, and precautionary measures toward COVID-19 among a sample of medical students in Jordan. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted between the 16th and 19th of March 2020. Participants were students enrolled in different levels of study at the six medical schools in Jordan. An online questionnaire which was posted on online platforms was used. The questionnaire consisted of four main sections: socio-demographics, sources of information, knowledge attitudes, and precautionary measures regarding COVID-19. Medical students used mostly social media (83.4%) and online search engines (84.8%) as their preferred source of information on COVID-19 and relied less on medical search engines (64.1%). Most students believed that hand shaking (93.7%), kissing (94.7%), exposure to contaminated surfaces (97.4%), and droplet inhalation (91.0%) are the primary mode of transmission but were indecisive regarding airborne transmission with only 41.8% in support. Participants also reported that elderly with chronic illnesses are the most susceptible group for the coronavirus infection (95.0%). As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic more than 80.0% of study participants adopted social isolation strategies, regular hand washing, and enhanced personal hygiene measures as their first line of defense against the virus. In conclusion, Jordanian medical students showed expected level of knowledge about the COVID-19 virus and implemented proper strategies to prevent its spread.","Khasawneh, Ashraf I.; Humeidan, Anas Abu; Alsulaiman, Jomana W.; Bloukh, Sarah; Ramadan, Mohannad; Al-Shatanawi, Tariq N.; Awad, Hasan H.; Hijazi, Waleed Y.; Al-Kammash, Kinda R.; Obeidat, Nail; Saleh, Tareq; Kheirallah, Khalid A.",Front.

Based on a time-series of 2,940,000 individual commercial facility data, the main purpose of this research is two-fold: (1) to examine long short-term memory (LSTM) as a feasible option for predicting trends in commercial districts and (2) to identify the influence of each variable on prediction results for establishing evidence-based decision-making on the primary influences of commercial vacancy. The results indicate that LSTM can be useful in simulating commercial vacancy dynamics. Furthermore, sales, floating population, and franchise rate were found to be the main determinants for commercial vacancy. The results suggest that it is imperative to control the cannibalization of commercial districts and develop their competitiveness to retain a consistent floating population.","Lee, Jaekyung Kim Hyunwoo Kim Hyungkyoo",Sustainability,492,16

We simulate the aerodynamic flow through the mask and the spatial spread of droplet ejecta resulting from respiratory events such as coughing or sneezing. Without a mask, a turbulent jet forms, and droplets with a broad size distribution are ejected. Large droplets (greater than about 125 {\mu}m in diameter) fall to the ground within about 2 m, while turbulent clouds transport a mist of small aerosolized droplets over significant distances (~ 5 m), consistent with reported experimental findings. A loosely fitted simple cotton cloth mask (with a pore size ~ 4 microns) qualitatively changes the propagation of the high velocity jet, and largely eliminates the turbulent cloud downstream of the mask. About 12\% of the airflow leaks around the sides of a mask, considering a uniform gap of only 1 mm all around, between the face and the mask. The spread of ejecta is also changed, with most large droplets trapped at the mask surface. We present the viral load in the air and deposited around the person, and show that wearing even a simple cloth mask substantially decreases the extent of spatial spread of virus particles when an infected person coughs or sneezes.","Kumar, Vivek; Nallamothu, Sravankumar; Shrivastava, Sourabh; Jadeja, Harshrajsinh; Nakod, Pravin; Andrade, Prem; Doshi, Pankaj; Kumaraswamy, Guruswamy",,492,20

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on risk of contracting COVID-19 and subsequent adverse outcomes. METHODS: Rates of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 were compared across strata of eGFR based on conditional logistic regression using a nested case-control framework with 1:4 matching of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with controls from the Danish general population on age, gender, diabetes and hypertension. Risk of subsequent severe COVID-19 or death was assessed in a cohort study with comparisons across strata of eGFR based on adjusted Cox regression models with G-computation of results to determine 60-day risk standardized to the distribution of risk factors in the sample. RESULTS: Estimated glomerular filtration rate was inversely associated with rate of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19: eGFR 61-90 mL/min/1.73m2 HR 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.25), P = 0.011; eGFR 46-60 mL/min/1.73m2 HR 1.26 (95% CI 1.06-1.50), P = 0.008; eGFR 31-45 mL/min/1.73m2 HR 1.68 (95% CI 1.34-2.11), P < 0.001; and eGFR &#8804; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 3.33 (95% CI 2.50-4.42), P < 0.001 (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2 as reference), and renal impairment was associated with progressive increase in standardized 60-day risk of death or severe COVID-19; eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2 13.9% (95% CI 9.7-15.0); eGFR 90-61 mL/min/1.73m2 16.1% (95% CI 14.5-17.7); eGFR 46-60 mL/min/1.73m2 17.8% (95% CI 14.7-21.2); eGFR 31-45 mL/min/1.73m2 22.6% (95% CI 18.2-26.2); and eGFR &#8804; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 23.6% (95% CI 18.1-29.1).

The 40 Health Systems, Covid-19 (40HS.C-19) Study aimed to investigate relationships between governments' capacity to respond (CTR), their response stringency, scope of COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Data to April 2020 were extracted for 40 national health systems on pre-pandemic government capacity to respond (CTR) (Global Competitiveness Index), stringency measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker Stringency Index), approach to COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 cases and deaths (Our-World-in-Data). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis were applied to examine latent dimensions and visualise country similarities and dissimilarities. Outcomes were tested using multivariate and one-way analyses of variances and Kruskal-Wallis H tests. RESULTS: The MDS model found three dimensions explaining 91% of the variance and cluster analysis identified five national groupings. There was no association between national governments' pre-pandemic CTR and the adoption of early stringent public health measures or approach to COVID-19 testing. Two national clusters applied early stringency measures and reported significantly lower cumulative deaths. The best performing national cluster (comprising Australia, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan) adopted relatively early stringency measures but broader testing earlier than others which was associated with a change in disease trajectory and the lowest COVID-19 death rates. Two clusters (one with high CTR and one low) both adopted late stringency measures and narrow testing and performed least well in COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: Early stringency measures and intrinsic national capacities to deal with a pandemic are insufficient. Extended stringency measures, important in the short-term, are not economically sustainable. Broad-based testing is key to managing COVID-19.","Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Tran, Yvonne; Ellis, Louise A; Westbrook, Johanna",Int. j. qual. health care,492,4

This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on wild-type human-codon-optimized Spike to introduce the D614G variant. Using multiple human cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, we found that the lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Spike D614G are more effective at transducing cells than ones pseudotyped with wild-type Spike. The increased transduction with Spike D614G ranged from 1.3- to 2.4-fold in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells expressing endogenous ACE2 and from 1.5- to 7.7-fold in A549ACE2 and Huh7.5ACE2 overexpressing ACE2. Furthermore, trans-complementation of SARS-CoV-2 virus with Spike D614G showed an increased infectivity in human cells. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the D614 and G614 Spike variants, the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.","Daniloski, Zharko; Jordan, Tristan X; Ilmain, Juliana K; Guo, Xinyi; Bhabha, Gira; tenOever, Benjamin R; Sanjana, Neville E",eLife (Cambridge),492,20

Although initially different in vagal tone suppression during solitary play, girls and boys exhibited similar group patterns of vagal reengagement during successive language and play tasks with their mothers and with an experimenter. In terms of individual differences, vagal suppression during solitary play and vagal reengagement during social interactive tasks predicted language and play performance. Gender differences emerged in patterns of predictive relations: Task-to-task vagal changes predicted primarily play performance in girls and language performance in boys. These findings expose the effects of social context on directional changes in task-to-task vagal tone and speak to the functional role of appropriate vagal regulation in young children's language and play performance.","Suess, Patricia E; Bornstein, Marc H",Infancy,492,24

Treatment options and vaccine availability for DENV are limited. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are considered a promising antiviral approach but infectious virus contamination has limited their development. Here, a DENV-derived DIP production cell line was developed that continuously produced DENV-free DIPs. The DIPs contained and could deliver to cells a DENV serotype 2 subgenomic defective-interfering RNA, which was originally discovered in DENV infected patients. The DIPs released into cell culture supernatant were purified and could potently inhibit replication of all DENV serotypes in cells. Antiviral therapeutics are limited for many viral infection. The DIP system described could be re-purposed to make antiviral DIPs for many other RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, yellow fever, West Nile and Zika viruses.","Li, Dongsheng; Lin, Min-Hsuan; Rawle, Daniel J; Jin, Hongping; Wu, Zhonglan; Wang, Lu; Lor, Mary; Hussain, Mazhar; Aaskov, John; Harrich, David",Commun Biol,492,30

This study aims to synthesise case fatality rate (CFR) among confirmed COVID-19 patients, incubation period and time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, recovery, and death. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of relevant articles from 01 December 2019 to 11 March 2020 without any language restrictions. Quantitative studies that recruited people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies, 43 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean incubation period was 5.68 (99% confidence interval [CI]: 4.78, 6.59) days. The pooled mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.92 (95% CI: 3.95, 5.90), ICU admission was 9.84 (95% CI: 8.78, 10.90), recovery was 18.55 (95% CI: 13.69, 23.41), and death was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled CFR among confirmed COVID-19 patients was 0.02 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03). We found that the incubation period and lag between the onset of symptoms and first clinical visit for COVID-19 are longer than other respiratory viral infections including Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome; however, the current policy of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone potentially exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be too conservative. Longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases.","Khalili, Malahat; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Nasiri, Naser; Javadi, Sara; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Sharifi, Hamid",Epidemiol Infect,492,16

The first mechanism is the introduction of user referrals. We compare four scenarios for the uptake of CTAs-(1) the p% of individuals that use the CTA are chosen randomly, (2) a smaller initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer a contact to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, (3) a small initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer around half of their contacts to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, and (4) for comparison, an idealised scenario in which the p% of the population that uses the CTA is the p% with the most contacts. Using agent-based epidemiological models incorporating a geometric space, we find that, even when the uptake percentage p% is small, CTAs are an effective tool for mitigating the spread of the epidemic in all scenarios. Moreover, user referrals significantly improve efficacy. In addition, it turns out that user referrals reduce the quarantine load. The second mechanism for increasing the efficacy of CTAs is tuning the severity of quarantine measures. Our modelling shows that using CTAs with mild quarantine measures is effective in reducing the maximum hospital load and the number of people who become ill, but leads to a relatively high quarantine load, which may cause economic disruption. Fortunately, under stricter quarantine measures, the advantages are maintained but the quarantine load is reduced. Our models incorporate geometric inhomogeneous random graphs to study the effects of the presence of super-spreaders and of the absence of long-distant contacts (e.g., through travel restrictions) on our conclusions.","Goldberg, Leslie Ann; Jorritsma, Joost; Komjáthy, Júlia; Lapinskas, John",PLoS One,492,24

METHODS: We retrospectively compared outcomes in a cohort of critical COVID-19 patients who received standard care (SC Group) and those who, in addition, received convalescent plasma (CP Group). RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were included in each group. The median patient age was 53.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 42-60.5), and the majority of patients required invasive ventilation (69, 86.2%). Plasma was harvested from donors after a median of 37 days (IQR 31-46) from the first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result and 26 days (IQR 21-32) after documented viral clearance; it was administered after a median of 10 days (IQR 9-10) from the onset of symptoms and 2.5 days (IQR 2-4) from admission to intensive care unit. The primary endpoint of improvement in respiratory support status within 28 days was achieved in 26 patients (65%) in the SC Group and 31 patients (77.5%) in the CP Group (p = .32). The 28-day all-cause mortality (12.5% vs. 2.5%; p = .22) and viral clearance (65% vs. 55%; p = .49) were not significantly different between the two groups. Convalescent plasma was not significantly associated with the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.51-1.49; p = .62).

Two of the most effective tools to prevent infection seem to be regular and thorough hand-washing and physical distancing during interpersonal interactions. Method: Two hundred and eighty-four participants completed a short survey to investigate how previous habits regarding hand-washing and physical distancing have changed in the general population as a function of the current pandemic and the thereby increased information and constant recommendations regarding these behaviors. Results: Participants aged 51 and older reported a greater change in everyday hand-washing behavior than younger participants. In addition, participants aged 31 and older selected significantlygreater distances to have a conversation than younger participants. However, that was not the case if participants had to actively stop their conversational partner from approaching. Conclusion: Participants aged 51 years and older seem to be well aware of their at-risk status during the current pandemic and might therefore be willing to change their behavior more strongly than younger survey participants. Nevertheless, they seem to struggle with enforcing the current rules towards others. The group aged between 31 and 50 years, however, reports a comparable level of fear, but no corresponding change in hand-washing behavior. Future surveys should try to provide more insight into why this might be the case. © 2021 PsychOpen. All rights reserved.","Biehl, S. C.; Schmidmeier, M.; Wechsler, T. F.; Kroczek, L. O.

This review characterizes the course of clinical, laboratory, radiological findings during the primary infection period, and the complications post-recovery. Primary care findings are presented for long-COVID care. METHODS: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, 4 databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Scopus) through December 5, 2020, using the keywords ""COVID-19 and/or recovered and/or cardiovascular and/or long-term and/or sequelae and/or sub-acute and/or complication."" We included published peer-reviewed case reports, case series, and cross-sectional studies providing the clinical course of COVID-19 infection, and cardiopulmonary complications of patients who recovered from COVID-19, while making healthcare considerations for primary care workers. RESULTS: We identified 29 studies across 9 countries including 37.9% Chinese and 24.1% U.S. studies, comprising 655 patients (Mean Age = 45) with various ethnical backgrounds including Asian and European. Based on the WHO COVID-19 severity classification scale, initial disease severity was mild for 377 patients and severe for 52 patients. Treatments during primary infection included corticosteroids, oxygen support, and antivirals. The mean value (in days) for complication onset after acute recovery was 28 days. Complete blood counts and RT-PCR tests were the most common laboratory results described. In 22 of the studies, patients showed signs of clinical improvement and were prescribed medications such as anticoagulants or corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Post-recovery infectious complications are common in long-COVID-19 patients ranging from mild infections to life-threatening conditions. International thoracic and cardiovascular societies need to develop guidelines for patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia, while focused patient care by the primary care physician is crucial to curb preventable adverse events. Recommendations for real-time and lab-quality diagnostic tests are warranted to establish point-of-care testing, detect early complications, and provide timely treatment.","Sarfraz, Zouina; Sarfraz, Azza; Barrios, Alanna; Garimella, Radhika; Dominari, Asimina; Kc, Manish; Pandav, Krunal; Pantoja, Juan C; Retnakumar, Varadha; Cherrez-Ojeda, Ivan",J Prim Care Community Health,492,20

Scenes were classified as high- or low-complexity by the number of unique object categories depicted. We found that recognition of high-complexity, but not low-complexity, scenes increased with age. Age was associated with decreased alpha power and increased instantaneous alpha frequency during the encoding of subsequently recognized high- compared to low-complexity scenes. Critically, decreased alpha power predicted improved recognition of high-complexity scenes in adolescents.

When flow is adequate (perhaps 900 cc/min) but no single vein is cannulatable, a dominant suitable vein can be superficialized or transposed. If no suitable vein is dominant (most accurately assessed by using an intraoperative flowmeter), the best vein can be used, with or without occlusion of the other veins or reimplantation into the brachial artery. Finally, if the original anastomosis remains the sole supply to the cannulated vein, the original fistula has achieved assisted primary maturation (and assisted primary patency continues), while if a new arteriovenous anastomosis has been constructed, the original fistula has failed. We point out that for this reason as well as to best utilize the upper arm for later access, endovascular and percutaneous AVFs should be constructed and maintained within an atmosphere where both surgeons and non-surgeons work together on the overall access plan.","Illig, Karl A; Lok, Charmaine; Rajan, Dheeraj K; Aruny, John; Peden, Eric; Nelson, Peter; London, Mark J; Ross, John R",J Vasc Access,492,14

As India already has inadequate waste treatment facilities, and the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to significant growth of Bio-medical waste (BMW), consequently safe disposal of a large quantity of waste has become a more serious concern. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of BMW of India before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this article highlights the gaps in the implementation of BMW rules in India. This study uses various government and non-government organizations, reports and data specifically from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The finding of the study demonstrated that most of the States/Union Territories (UTs) of India are lacking in terms of COVID-19 waste management. India has generated over 32,996 mt of COVID-19 waste between June and December 2020. During this period, Maharashtra (789.99 mt/month) is highest average generator of COVID-19 waste, followed by Kerala (459.86 mt/month), Gujarat (434.87 mt/month), Tamil Nadu (427.23 mt/month), Uttar Pradesh (371.39 mt/month), Delhi (358.83 mt/month) and West Bengal (303.15 mt/month), and others respectively. We draw attention to the fact that many gaps were identified with compliance of BMW management rules. For example, out of all 35 States/UTs, health care facilitates (HCFs), only eight states received authorization as per BMW management rules. Moreover, the government strictly restricted the practice of deep burials; however, 23 States/UTs are still using the deep burial methods for BMW disposal. The present research suggests that those States/UTs generated on an average of 100 mt/month COVID-19 waste in the last 7 months (June-December 2020) should be considered as a high priority state. These states need special attention to implement BMW rules and should upgrade their BMW treatment capacity.","Rajak, Rahul; Mahto, Ravi Kumar; Prasad, Jitender; Chattopadhyay, Aparajita",Waste Manag Res,492,16

DESIGN: A single-center, retrospective, observational study. SETTING: A newly built ICU in Tongji hospital (Sino-French new city campus), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-seven critical COVID-19 patients. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into a myocardial injury group and nonmyocardial injury group according to the on-admission levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment, and clinical outcome were evaluated, stratified by the presence of myocardial injury on admission. Compared with nonmyocardial injury patients, patients with myocardial injury were older (68.4 ± 10.1 v 62.1 ± 13.5 years; pâ¯=â¯0.02), had higher prevalence of underlying CV disease (34.1% v 11.1%; pâ¯=â¯0.02), and in-ICU CV complications (41.5% v 13.9%; pâ¯=â¯0.008), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (20.3 ± 7.3 v 14.4 ± 7.4; pâ¯=â¯0.001), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (7, interquartile range (IQR) 5-10 v 5, IQR 3-6; p < 0.001).

However, the development of a new, effective, and safe vaccine or drug often requires years and poses great risks. At this critical stage, there is an advantage in using existing clinically approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In this study, in vitro severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike pseudotyped viral infection experiments indicated that histamine H1 antagonists loratadine (LOR) and desloratadine (DES) could prevent entry of the pseudotyped virus into ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells and showed that DES was more effective. Further binding experiments using cell membrane chromatography and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that both antagonists could bind to ACE2 and that the binding affinity of DES was much stronger than that of LOR. Molecular docking results elucidated that LOR and DES could bind to ACE2 on the interface of the SARS-CoV-2-binding area. Additionally, DES could form one hydrogen bond with LYS31 but LOR binding relied on non-hydrogen bonds. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of LOR and DES on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus viropexis by blocking spike protein-ACE2 interaction. This study may provide a new strategy for finding an effective therapeutic option for COVID-19.","Hou, Yajing; Ge, Shuai; Li, Xiaowei; Wang, Cheng; He, Huaizhen; He, Langchong",Chem Biol Interact,492,16

Early data suggest a surge in proinflammatory cytokines in patients with severe COVID-19, which has been associated with poor outcomes. We recently postulated that the inflammatory response in patients with severe COVID-19 disease is not inhibited by natural killer (NK) cells, resulting in a ""cytokine storm."" Here, we assessed the NK-cell functional activity and the associated cytokines and soluble mediators in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Significantly impaired NK-cell counts and cytolytic activity were observed in COVID-19 patients when compared with healthy controls. Also, cytokines like interleukin 12 (IL12), IL15, and IL21 that are important for NK-cell activity were not detected systematically. Serum concentrations of soluble CD25 (sCD25)/soluble IL2 receptor &#945; (sIL2-R&#945;) were significantly elevated and were inversely correlated with the percentage of NK cells. Impaired NK-cell cytolytic activity together with other laboratory trends including elevated sCD25 were consistent with a hyperinflammatory state in keeping with macrophage-activation syndrome. Our findings suggest that impaired counts and cytolytic activity of NK cells are important characteristics of severe COVID-19 and can potentially facilitate strategies for immunomodulatory therapies.","Osman, Mohammed; Faridi, Rehan M; Sligl, Wendy; Shabani-Rad, Meer-Taher; Dharmani-Khan, Poonam; Parker, Arabesque; Kalra, Amit; Tripathi, Minal Borkar; Storek, Jan; Cohen Tervaert, Jan Willem; Khan, Faisal M",Blood Adv,492,6

In a phase 1-2 trial involving healthy adults, the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and was associated with strong neutralizing-antibody and antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy was needed in a setting of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: In this phase 2a-b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 µg of recombinant spike protein with 50 µg of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary end points were safety and vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Of 6324 participants who underwent screening, 4387 received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. Approximately 30% of the participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative and 6% HIV-positive), predominantly mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 15 participants in the vaccine group and in 29 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 49.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 72.8). Vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI, 19.9 to 80.1). Of 41 sequenced isolates, 38 (92.7%) were the B.1.351 variant. Post hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI, -0.6 to 76.2) among the HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity events were more common in the vaccine group; serious adverse events were rare in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, with higher vaccine efficacy observed among HIV-negative participants. Most infections were caused by the B.1.351 variant.

Here we use detailed surveillance data gathered during COVID-19 resurgences in six cities of China at the beginning of 2021 to investigate this question. Data were collected by multiple rounds of city-wide PCR test with detailed contact tracing, where each patient was monitored for symptoms through the whole course of infection. We find that the proportion of asymptomatic infections declines with age (coefficient =-0.006, P<0.01), falling from 56% in age group 0-9 years to 12% in age group >60 years. Using an age-stratified compartment model, we show that this age-dependent asymptomatic pattern together with the age distribution of overall cases can explain most of the geographic differences in reported asymptomatic proportions. Combined with demography and contact matrices from other countries worldwide, we estimate that a maximum of 22%-55% of SARS-CoV-2 infections would come from asymptomatic cases in an uncontrolled epidemic based on asymptomatic proportions in China.

This ongoing longitudinal cohort study aims to (1) characterise the psychological, social and health behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month period in the USA; (2) determine whether these impacts differ for certain subgroups based on sociodemographics and other individual-level factors; and (3) explore whether there are modifiable factors (eg, coping, social support) that moderate the effects of the pandemic over time. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Adults (aged &#8805;18 years) who were fluent in either English or Spanish were recruited via social media and invited to complete an online survey during the 8-week period from 13 April to 8 June 2020 (baseline). Follow-up surveys will be conducted 6 and 12 months after baseline. Data transformations, non-parametric tests or other alternative methods will be used when appropriate. Descriptive statistics and cross-sectional analyses will be performed. Longitudinal associations will be analysed using multilevel modelling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the study period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval was received from the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board (H-47505).

Benefit from the application experience of Chinese Medicine (CM) for influenza and SARS, CM has been used to save patients at the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: In order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CM, and comparing with that of Western Medicine (WM) for COVID-19, we conducted a retrospective case series study based on the patients in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. METHODS: The inclusion and exclusion criteria of data extraction was set for this retrospective study. All patients who were admitted by the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital between January 17 and February 25, 2020 were considered. In addition, patients enrolled met the severe defined by the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. In these cases included in the study, CM or WM treatment was selected according to the wishes of the patients at the beginning of hospitalization. The patients in CM group was treated with Huashi Baidu granule (137 g po, bid) combined with the injections of Xiyanping (100 mg iv, bid), Xuebijing (100 ml iv, bid,) and Shenmai (60 ml iv, qd) according to the syndrome of epidemic toxin blocking the lung in the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The WM group received antiviral therapy (including abidor capsule 0.2 g po, tid; Lopinavir-Ritonavir tablets, 500 mg po, bid), antibiotics (such as cefoperazone, 2 g iv, bid; moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, 0.4 g po, qd) or corticosteroid therapy (such as methylprednisolone succinate sodium, 40mg, iv, 40 mg, qd; prednisone, 30 mg po, qd). In addition, patients in both groups received routine supportive treatment, including oxygen inhalation, symptomatic therapy, and/or human intravenous immunoglobulin, and/or serum albumin, and therapy for underlying diseases. The clinical outcomes were evaluated based on changes before and after the treatment related with clinical manifestations, computer tomography (CT) scan images, and laboratory examinations. RESULTS: 55 severe COVID-19 patients, with 23 in CM group and 32 in WM group, were included for analyzed. There was no case of death, transferred to ICU, or received invasive mechanical ventilation in two groups during hospitalization. The median time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in CM and WM group were 12 days and 15.5 days (P=0.018). Further, the chest CT imaging showed more widely lung lesion opacity absorbed in the CM group (P<0.05). The C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin, and myoglobin decreased significantly in the CM group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in adverse events in terms of liver function and renal function between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Based on this retrospective analysis from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, CM has better effects in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, lung lesion opacity absorbed and reduced inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients, is effective and safe therapy for treating severe COVID-19 and reducing mortality.","Huang, Luqi",J Ethnopharmacol,492,20

During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool.","Baccini, Michela; Rocco, Emilia; Paganini, Irene; Mattei, Alessandra; Sani, Cristina; Vannucci, Giulia; Bisanzi, Simonetta; Burroni, Elena; Peluso, Marco; Munnia, Armelle; Cellai, Filippo; Pompeo, Giampaolo; Micio, Laura; Viti, Jessica; Mealli, Fabrizia; Carozzi, Francesca Maria",PLoS One,492,16

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcome were retrieved. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore potential factors. RESULTS: Overall, 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset until the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12-21). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; p = 0.028), time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding.

What is the impact of these changes on the bosses/teachers' and workers/students' experience? This article uses recent neuroscience research findings to explore how distance learning and smart working impact the following three pillars that reflect the organization of our brain and are at the core of school and office experiences: (a) the learning/work happens in a dedicated physical place; (b) the learning/work is carried out under the supervision of a boss/professor; and (c) the learning/work is distributed between team members/classmates. For each pillar, we discuss its link with the specific cognitive processes involved and the impact that technology has on their functioning. In particular, the use of videoconferencing affects the functioning of Global Positioning System neurons (neurons that code our navigation behavior), mirror neurons, self-attention networks, spindle cells, and interbrain neural oscillations. These effects have a significant impact on many identity and cognitive processes, including social and professional identity, leadership, intuition, mentoring, and creativity. In conclusion, just moving typical office and learning processes inside a videoconferencing platform, as happened in many contexts during the COVID-19 pandemic, can in the long term erode corporate cultures and school communities. In this view, an effective use of technology requires us to reimagine how work and teaching are done virtually, in creative and bold new ways.","Riva, Giuseppe; Wiederhold, Brenda K; Mantovani, Fabrizia",Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,492,29

Within this context, the ability of pain specialists to accurately diagnose and plan appropriate interventional spine procedures based entirely on telemedicine visits, without an in-person evaluation, remains to be established. In this study, our primary objective was to assess the relevance of telemedicine to interventional spine procedure planning by determining whether procedure plans established solely from virtual visits changed following in-person evaluation. METHODS: We reviewed virtual and in-person clinical encounters from our academic health system's 10 interventional spine specialists. We included patients who were seen exclusively via telemedicine encounters and indicated for an interventional procedure with documented procedural plans. Virtual plans were then compared with the actual procedures performed following in-person evaluation. Demographic data as well as the type and extent of physical examination performed by the interventional spine specialist were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 87 new patients included, the mean age was 60 years (SE 1.4 years) and the preprocedural plan established by telemedicine, primarily videoconferencing, did not change for 76 individuals (87%; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94) following in-person evaluation. Based on the size of our sample, interventional procedures indicated solely during telemedicine encounters may be accurate in 79%-94% of cases in the broader population. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that telemedicine evaluations are a generally accurate means of preprocedural assessment and development of interventional spine procedure plans. These findings clearly demonstrate the capabilities of telemedicine for evaluating spine patients and planning interventional spine procedures.","Crawford, Alexander M; Lightsey, Harry M; Xiong, Grace X; Striano, Brendan M; Greene, Nattaly; Schoenfeld, Andrew J; Simpson, Andrew K",Reg Anesth Pain Med,492,16

METHODS: Since the status of infection tends to be congruent in mothers and their children, we tested 401 mothers of children between 1 and 10 years in the city of Rostock (State of Mecklenburg-Westpomerania, northeast of Germany), for the presence of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, and of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. RESULTS: In none of the mothers tested, RNA of this virus was detected in the throat swab. In the ELISA test, IgG antibodies were positive in one serum sample, IgA antibodies were positive in 11, and borderline in 3 serum samples. All 401 sera were negative in the indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) with FITC-labeled IgG, IgA, und IgM antibodies.

However, there is limited information about the clinical characteristics of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 or about interventions to control COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers. METHODS: We collected data retrospectively through an online registration system that includes all patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 65 centers in Wuhan, China. We reviewed epidemiologic and clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of 7154 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 154 had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of the 131 patients in our analysis was 63.2 years; 57.3% were men. Many had underlying comorbidities, with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension) being the most common (68.7%). Only 51.9% of patients manifested fever; 21.4% of infected patients were asymptomatic. The most common finding on chest computed tomography (CT) was ground-grass or patchy opacity (82.1%). After initiating comprehensive interventions-including entrance screening of body temperature and symptoms, universal chest CT and blood tests, and other measures-new patients presenting with COVID-19 peaked at 10 per day on January 30, decreasing to 4 per day on February 11. No new cases occurred between February 26 and March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis were susceptible to COVID-19 and that hemodialysis centers were high-risk settings during the epidemic.

However, the clinical performance of many of these is still insufficiently described. Therefore, we compared 3 commercial CE-marked, SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays side by side. METHODS: We included a total of 1154 specimens from pre-COVID-19 times and 65 samples from COVID-19 patients (&#8805;14 days after symptom onset) to evaluate the test performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin. RESULTS: All 3 assays presented with high specificities: 99.2% (98.6-99.7) for Abbott, 99.7% (99.2-100.0) for Roche, and 98.3% (97.3-98.9) for DiaSorin. In contrast to the manufacturers' specifications, sensitivities only ranged from 83.1% to 89.2%. Although the 3 methods were in good agreement (Cohen's Kappa 0.71-0.87), McNemar tests revealed significant differences between results obtained from Roche and DiaSorin. However, at low seroprevalences, the minor differences in specificity resulted in profound discrepancies of positive predictive values at 1% seroprevalence: 52.3% (36.2-67.9), 77.6% (52.8-91.5), and 32.6% (23.6-43.1) for Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin, respectively.

The increasing use of social media as a source of health information may contribute to vaccine hesitancy due to anti-vaccination content widely available on social media, including Twitter. Being able to identify anti-vaccination tweets could provide useful information for formulating strategies to reduce anti-vaccination sentiments among different groups. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different natural language processing models to identify anti-vaccination tweets that were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the performance of the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and the bidirectional long short-term memory networks with pre-trained GLoVe embeddings (Bi-LSTM) with classic machine learning methods including support vector machine (SVM) and naïve Bayes (NB). The results show that performance on the test set of the BERT model was: accuracy = 91.6%, precision = 93.4%, recall = 97.6%, F1 score = 95.5%, and AUC = 84.7%.

This apparent contradiction may be explained by interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and pneumococcus in the upper airway, resulting in the escape of SARS-CoV-2 from protective host immune responses. Here, we investigated the relationship of these two respiratory pathogens in two distinct cohorts of a) healthcare workers with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by systematic screening and b) patients with moderate to severe disease who presented to hospital. We assessed the effect of co-infection on host antibody, cellular and inflammatory responses to the virus. In both cohorts, pneumococcal colonisation was associated with diminished anti-viral immune responses, which affected primarily mucosal IgA levels among individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection and cellular memory responses in infected patients. Our findings suggest that S. pneumoniae modulates host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and raises the question if pneumococcal carriage also enables immune escape of other respiratory viruses through a similar mechanism and facilitates reinfection occurrence.","Mitsi, Elena; Reine, Jesus; Urban, Britta C; Solorzano, Carla; Nikolaou, Elissavet; Hyder-Wright, Angela D; Pojar, Sherin; Howard, Ashleigh; Hitchins, Lisa; Glynn, Sharon; Farrar, Madlen; Liatsikos, Konstantinos; Collins, Andrea M; Walker, Naomi F; Hill, Helen; German, Esther Lauryn; Cheliotis, Katerina S; Byrne, Rachel Louise; Williams, Christopher T; Atienzar, Ana I Cubas; Fletcher, Tom; Adams, Emily R; Draper, Simon J; Pulido, David; Beavon, Rohini; Begier, Elizabeth; Theilacker, Christian; Jodar, Luis; Gessner, Bradford D; Ferreira, Daniela M",,492,12

Furthermore, COVID-19 might also predispose infected individuals to hyperglycaemia. Interacting with other risk factors, hyperglycaemia might modulate immune and inflammatory responses, thus predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 and possible lethal outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target. Preliminary data, however, do not suggest a notable effect of glucose-lowering DPP4 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Owing to their pharmacological characteristics, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might cause adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 and so cannot be recommended. Currently, insulin should be the main approach to the control of acute glycaemia. Most available evidence does not distinguish between the major types of diabetes mellitus and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited evidence is now available on type 1 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19. Most of these conclusions are preliminary, and further investigation of the optimal management in patients with diabetes mellitus is warranted.","Lim, Soo; Bae, Jae Hyun; Kwon, Hyuk-Sang; Nauck, Michael A",Nat Rev Endocrinol,492,16

The spread of the Coronavirus diseases was considerably attributed to the travel and tourism industry, and with the attempt to curb the spread of the virus, the industry experienced calamitous effects and suffered staggering financial losses. The same accounts for wildlife tourism (Southern Africa’s largest product) – bringing the hunting and ecotourism sector of South Africa to a complete standstill. The pandemic accompanied concerning and devastating effects, not only from a financial point of view, but also in terms of the conservation of these sectors within the industry. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis using the data obtained from the members of Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) to quantify the actual and potential financial losses in the private wildlife industry due to cancellations of hunters and ecotourists, live game sales and finally, game meat sales in the industry. From the results, the estimated financial impact of COVID-19 on the private wildlife industry is R6.694 billion (ZAR). The study made the following three contributions: Firstly, it determined the economic impact of COVID-19 on the private wildlife industry. Secondly, it provides the industry with a tangible document that can be used in securing funding and assistance from government and other non-profit organisations.

Tele-mental health was rapidly implemented to deliver health care services. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to present state-of-the-art tele-mental health research, (2) to survey mental health providers about care delivery during the pandemic, and (3) to assess patient satisfaction with tele-mental health. METHODS: Document clustering was applied to map research topics within tele-mental health research. A survey was circulated among mental health providers. Patient satisfaction was investigated through a meta-analysis of studies that compared satisfaction scores between tele-mental health and face-to-face interventions for mental health disorders, retrieved from Web of Knowledge and Scopus. Hedges g was used as the effect size measure, and effect sizes were pooled using a random-effect model. Sources of heterogeneity and bias were examined. RESULTS: Evidence on tele-mental health has been accumulating since 2000, especially regarding service implementation, depressive or anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and special populations. Research was concentrated in a few countries. The survey (n=174 respondents from Italy, n=120 international) confirmed that, after the onset of COVID-19 outbreak, there was a massive shift from face-to-face to tele-mental health delivery of care. However, respondents held skeptical views about tele-mental health and did not feel sufficiently trained and satisfied. Meta-analysis of 29 studies (n=2143) showed that patients would be equally satisfied with tele-mental health as they are with face-to-face interventions (Hedges g=-0.001, 95% CI -0.116 to 0.114, P=.98, Q=43.83, I2=36%, P=.03) if technology-related issues were minimized. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health services equipped with tele-mental health will be better able to cope with public health crises. Both providers and patients need to be actively engaged in digitization, to reshape their reciprocal trust around technological innovations.","Mazziotti, Raffaele; Rutigliano, Grazia",JMIR Ment Health,492,16

Indiscriminate offtake to satisfy demand for wild meat affects a range of wildlife of conservation concern in Vietnam. It is essential to understand the consumption of wild meat in Vietnam in order to ensure it is not detrimental to wild species.We apply the principles of target audience segmentation to a sample of 384 respondents who had consumed wild meat in the previous year in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We carried out a cluster analysis to divide wild meat consumers into subgroups considering demographic, behavioural and psychographic variables.We found three consumer groups: Classic Consumers (older, less educated), Up‐and‐coming Professionals (younger, wealthier, more educated) and Students. Compared to Students, Classic Consumers and Up‐and‐coming Professionals were significantly more likely to have paid for their meal at wild meat restaurants and to have ordered a combination of wild meat and other types of food rather than other types of food only.Classic Consumers match previous characterisations of wild meat consumers, but the other two groups should also be considered in demand reduction campaigns. As Students appear to have limited influence on restaurant/food choices in certain social contexts and less propensity to eat wild meat, Up‐and‐coming Professionals may be an important target group.A wide variety of species are consumed in wild meat restaurants. Some, such as pangolins, are of conservation concern and were consumed by 5% of our respondents. This is potentially an unsustainable level of consumption.Our study showcases an audience segmentation approach to understanding wildlife consumers and provides insights for behavioural interventions and further research to curtail demand for wild meat in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam where it is of conservation concern.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.","Olmedo, Alegría Veríssimo Diogo Challender Daniel W.

METHODS: Data from all patients treated at our Department since the decision of the regional healthcare authorities of Lombardy to centralize surgical specialties creating a hub/spoke system (March 9, 2020) were prospectively collected and compared with a retrospectively collected cohort from the same period of year 2019. Primary study end point was defined as primary clinical success. Secondary end points were defined as in-hospital mortality and/or any in hospital major adverse event or lower limb amputation. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients were treated (81 men, 70%; median age: 71 years, IQR 65-81). Thirty-two patients (28%) were addressed from spoke hospitals directly referring to our hub, 19 (16%) from hospitals belonging to other hub/spoke nets, 48 (41%) came directly from our emergency department, and 17 (15%) were already hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. Acute limb ischemia was the most observed disease, occurring in 31 (26.7%), 12 (38.7%) of whom were found positive for COVID-19 pneumonia on admission, whereas 3 (9.7%) became positive during hospitalization. Chronic limb ischemia was the indication to treatment in 24 (20.7%) patients. Six (5.2%) patients underwent primary amputation for irreversible ischemia. Aortic emergencies included 21 cases (18.1%), including 13 (61.9%) symptomatic abdominal aortic or iliac aneurysms, 4 (19.0%) thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 2 (9.5%) cases of acute type B aortic dissection (one post-traumatic). Seventeen (14.7%) patients were admitted for symptomatic carotid stenosis (no COVID-19 patients); all of them underwent carotid endarterectomy. Seventeen (14.7%) cases were treated for other vascular emergencies. Overall, at a median follow-up of 23 ± 13 days, primary clinical success was 87.1% and secondary clinical success was 95.9%. We recorded 3 in-hospital deaths for an overall mortality rate of 2.6%. Compared with the 2019 cohort, ""COVID era"" patients were older (72 vs. 63 years, P = 0.002), more frequently transferred from other hospitals (44% vs. 21%, P = 0.014) and more frequently with decompensated chronic limb threatening ischemia (21% vs. 3%, P = 0.015); surgical outcomes were similar between the 2 cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Since its appearance, SARS-CoV-2 has been testing all national healthcare systems which founds themselves facing an unprecedented emergency. Late referral in the pandemic period could seriously worsen limb prognosis; this aspect should be known and addressed by health care providers. Vascular surgical outcomes in pre-COVID and COVID era were comparable in our experience.","Mascia, Daniele; Kahlberg, Andrea; Melloni, Andrea; Rinaldi, Enrico; Melissano, Germano; Chiesa, Roberto",Ann Vasc Surg,492,25

Although we agree that socialmedia platforms haveweakened stakeholder influence in certain conditions, such is not the case for all firms, all stakeholders, or all situations. Drawing from sociocognitive and self-determination theories, we contend that (a) independent, owner-managed small firms present a context wherein information overload is rendered less of an issue because the information about the firmismore salient to locals;(b) stakeholders can bemotivated to influence firms via social media platforms, which facilitate the collective engagement of local community members;and (c) uncertain economic circumstances (e.g., COVID-19) activate stakeholder information searches, which often occur through social media. Together, these three conditions enhance stakeholder power and influence. We also contemplate how, even under these conditions, stakeholder influence may change over time vis-a-vis the issue-attention cycle and societalization.

Identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, the virus rapidly became a global pandemic. The effects on health care worldwide were unprecedented as countries adapted services to treat masses of critically ill patients.The aim of this study is to analyze the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic had on thoracic surgery at a major trauma center during peak prevalence. METHODS: Prospective unit data were collected for all patients who underwent thoracic surgery during March 2020 until May 2020 inclusive. Retrospective data were collected from an earlier comparable time period as a comparison. RESULTS: In the aforementioned time frame, 117 thoracic surgical operations were performed under the care of four thoracic surgeons. Six operations were performed on three patients who were being treated for SARS-CoV-2. One operation was performed on a patient who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2. There were no deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 in any patient undergoing thoracic surgery. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that during the first surge of SARS-CoV-2, it was possible to adapt a thoracic oncology and trauma service without increase in mortality due to COVID-19. This was only possible due to a significant reduction in trauma referrals, cessation of benign and elective work, and the more stringent reprioritization of cancer surgery. This information is vital to learn from our experience and prepare for the predicted second surge and any similar future pandemics we might face.","Smelt, Jeremy; Santhirakumaran, Gowthanan; Vaughan, Paul; Hunt, Ian; Tan, Carol",Thorac. cardiovasc. surg,492,16

METHODS: A total of 90 patients with COVID-19 accompanied with insomnia were randomly divided into an observation group (45 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a control group (45 cases). In the observation group, baduanjin, a traditional Chinese fitness activity, was practiced everyday. Besides, auricular point sticking therapy was exerted at ear-shenmen (TF 4), subcortex (AT 4), heart (CO 15), occiput (AT 3), etc. These auricular points were pressed and kneaded three times a day, 30 s at each point each time, consecutively for 12 days. In the control group, estazolam tablets were prescribed for oral administration, 1 mg, once daily, consecutively for 12 days. Before and after treatment, the score of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the score of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the score of self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the score of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were observed in the two groups and the clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of every item and the total scores in PSQI were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.01). The scores of sleep time and sleep efficiency in the observation group were lower than those in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). SAS scores and SDS scores in the observation group and SAS score in the control group after treatment were all reduced as compared with those before treatment (P<0.01), and SDS score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). After treatment, in the observation group, the score of each of the symptoms of TCM, i.e. unsound sleep, irritability and hot temper, profuse sputum and sticky feeling in the mouth, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath, abdominal distention and poor appetite, as well as lassitude was reduced as compared with that before treatment successively (P<0.01), and the scores aforementioned (excepted for the unsound sleep) in the observation group were all lower than the control group (P<0.05). The total effective rates were 83.3% (35/42) in the observation group and 84.4% (38/45) in the control group, without statistical difference in comparison (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy improves sleep quality, the conditions of anxiety and depression and the symptoms in TCM for patients of COVID-19 with insomnia. The therapeutic effect of this combined treatment is better than the oral administration of estazolam.","Yang, Chao; Ma, Yan; Mei, Jun-Hua; Gong, Xue; Wang, Meng; Liu, Kun",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu,492,16

We sought to assess oncologist perspectives on telemedicine's present and future roles (both phone and video) for patients with cancer. METHODS: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Electronic Health Record (EHR) Oncology Advisory Group formed a Workgroup to assess the state of oncology telemedicine and created a 20-question survey. NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group members e-mailed the survey to providers (surgical, hematology, gynecologic, medical, and radiation oncology physicians and clinicians) at their home institution. RESULTS: Providers (N = 1,038) from 26 institutions responded in Summer 2020. Telemedicine (phone and video) was compared with in-person visits across clinical scenarios (n = 766). For reviewing benign follow-up data, 88% reported video and 80% reported telephone were the same as or better than office visits. For establishing a personal connection with patients, 24% and 7% indicated video and telephone, respectively, were the same as or better than office visits. Ninety-three percent reported adverse outcomes attributable to telemedicine visits never or rarely occurred, whereas 6% indicated they occasionally occurred (n = 801). Respondents (n = 796) estimated 46% of postpandemic visits could be virtual, but challenges included (1) lack of patient access to technology, (2) inadequate clinical workflows to support telemedicine, and (3) insurance coverage uncertainty postpandemic. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appears effective across a variety of clinical scenarios. Based on provider assessment, a substantial fraction of visits for patients with cancer could be effectively and safely conducted using telemedicine. These findings should influence regulatory and infrastructural decisions regarding telemedicine postpandemic for patients with cancer.","Tevaarwerk, Amye J; Chandereng, Thevaa; Osterman, Travis; Arafat, Waddah; Smerage, Jeffrey; Polubriaginof, Fernanda C G; Heinrichs, Tricia; Sugalski, Jessica; Martin, Daniel B",JCO Oncol Pract,492,24

The goal of this research was to determine the immune layer to the measles virus among women in labor and maternity ward personnel in the same medical institution. The levels of IgG antibodies to measles virus in the umbilical cord blood of 594 women in labor and 88 workers of the maternity ward were studied by ELISA. It was revealed that 22.7% of umbilical cord blood serum samples from parturient women and 21.4% of blood serum samples from maternity ward personnel were seronegative (<0.18 IU/ml). Levels of IgG antibodies to measles virus in low values (<1.0 IU/ml) were detected in 67% of blood serum samples among women in labor and 68.9% among employees of the maternity ward. Among women in labor, women under 35 years of age are at the highest risk of contracting measles; the proportion of women with low levels of protective antibodies in this age group was almost 70%, and the proportion of women without protective levels of antibodies was 23%. Compared with the age group 36–43, the age of women in labor under 35 was associated with a higher chance of not having immune protection against infection with measles virus OR [95% CI] = 2.2 [1.1–4.5] (p = 0.02) or had a low level of protection OR [95% CI] = 1.9 [1.2–3.0] (p = 0.001). It was also found that among women over 35 years of age, the proportion of persons with a high level of antibodies in women in labor was statistically significantly higher than among members of the maternity ward staff (13 and 0%, respectively, p = 0.007). Thus, maternity ward employees and women in labor constitute a risk group for measles due to the presence of a high proportion of seronegative persons among women of childbearing age (both maternity ward employees and women in labor). These conditions create the need to revise current approaches to present vaccination procedures, especially in the current epidemiological situation with COVID-19.","Kostinov, Mikhail Petrovich; Zhuravlev, Pavel Ivanovich; Gladkova, Lylia Solomonovna; Mashilov, Kirill Vadimovich; Polishchuk, Valentina Borisovna; Shmitko, Anna Dmitrievna; Zorina, Veronika Nikolaevna; Blagovidov, Dmitriy Alexeyevich; Pahomov, Dmitriy Vladimirovich; Vlasenko, Anna Egorovna; Ryzhov, Alexey Anatolevich; Khromova, Ekaterina Alexandrovna",Front Immunol,492,28

However, drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections are being tested to verify if they might also be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Twenty years ago, the F.D.A. approved Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) to treat HIV infection. LPV and ritonavir were initially purposed to inhibit 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and preliminary promising data on its efficacy for treating people infected with those viruses were available. Therefore, due to the high genetic similarities among those viruses and SARS-CoV-2, early during COVID-19 pandemic LPV/r was also proposed as one emergency treatment. We reviewed data from the literature about LPV/r treatment and SARS-CoV-2 infection, mainly focused on the efficacy and safety of this drugs for COVID-19 treatment. We can conclude that although up to date no clear benefit has been observed with the LPV/r treatment beyond standard care, its efficacy against SARS-COV-2 infection deserves further evaluations, particularly during the very early phase of the disease.","Magro, Paola; Zanella, Isabella; Pescarolo, Marta; Castelli, Francesco; Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia",Biomed J,492,1

The purpose of this study was to determine if unexpected lung base findings on abdominopelvic CTs concerning for COVID-19 infection could serve as a surrogate for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database search of abdominopelvic CT reports from 3/1/2020-5/2/2020 was performed for keywords suggesting COVID-19 infection by lung base findings. COVID-19 status, respiratory symptoms, laboratory parameters and patient outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission/intubation, and death) were recorded. The trend in cases of unexpected concerning lung base findings on abdominopelvic CT at our institution was compared to the total number of confirmed new cases in NYC over the same time period. RESULTS: The trend in abnormal lung base findings on abdominopelvic CT at our institution correlated with the citywide number of confirmed new cases, including rise and subsequent fall in total cases. The trend was not mediated by COVID-19 testing status or number of tests performed. Patients with respiratory symptoms had significantly higher ferritin (median=995ng/ml vs 500ng/ml, p=0.027) and death rate (8/24, 33% vs 4/54, 9%, p=0.018) compared to those without. CONCLUSION: The rise and fall of unexpected lung base findings suggestive of COVID-19 infection on abdominopelvic CT in patients without COVID-19 symptoms correlated with the number of confirmed new cases throughout NYC from the same time period. A model using abdominopelvic CT lung base findings can serve as a surrogate for future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Smereka, Paul; Anthopolos, Rebecca; Latson, Larry A; Kirsch, Polly; Dane, Bari",Acad Radiol,492,1

Questions remain with respect to the durability and functionality of SARS CoV 2 antibodies. This study explored antibody responses in recovered COVID 19 patients in a setting where the probability of re-exposure is effectively nil, owing to New Zealand's successful elimination strategy. Methods A triplex bead-based assay that detects antibody isotype (IgG, IgM and IgA) and subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) responses against Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. After establishing baseline levels with pre-pandemic control sera (n=113), samples from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease (n=189) collected up to eight months post infection were examined. The relationship between antigen-specific antibodies and neutralising antibodies (NAbs) was explored with a surrogate neutralisation assay that quantifies inhibition of the RBD/hACE 2 interaction. Results While most individuals had broad isotype and subclass responses to each antigen shortly after infection, only RBD and S protein IgG, as well as NAbs, were stable over the study period, with 99%, 96% and 90% of samples, respectively, having responses over baseline 4-8 months post-infection. Anti-RBD antibodies were strongly correlated with NAbs at all time points (Pearsons r > 0.87) and feasibility of using finger prick sampling to accurately measure anti-RBD IgG was demonstrated. Conclusion Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist for up to eight months following mild to moderate infection. This robust response can be attributed to the initial exposure without immune boosting given the lack of community transmission in our setting.","Whitcombe, A.

Infectious bronchitis is an acute, highly contagious, viral disease of chickens, characterized by rales, coughing, and sneezing. Because secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) are involved in inflammatory processes, the gene expressions of sPLA2s were investigated in both healthy chickens and chickens with infectious bronchitis and lung inflammation. The draft chicken genome was first scanned using human sPLA2 sequences to identify chicken sPLA2s (ChPLA2), chicken total mRNA were isolated and RT-PCR experiments were performed to amplify and then sequence orthologous cDNAs. Full-length cDNA sequences of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA, -IIE, -V and -X were cloned. The high degree of sequence identity of 50–70% between the avian and mammalian (human and mouse) sPLA2 orthologs suggests a conservation of important enzymatic functions for these phospholipases. Quantitation by qPCR of the transcript levels of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA, -IIE, -V and -X in several tissues from healthy chicken indicated that the expression patterns and mRNA levels diverged among the phospholipases tested. In chicken with infectious bronchitis, an over expression of ChPLA2-V was observed in lungs and spleen in comparison with healthy chicken. These findings suggest that ChPLA2-V could be a potential biomarker for lung inflammation. Conversely, a down regulation of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA and -X was observed in lungs and spleen in case of infectious bronchitis. A significant increase in the expression level of ChPLA2-X and ChPLA2-IB was also noticed in pancreas. No or minor changes have been detected in the expression of ChPLA2-IIE in lungs and small intestine, but it shows a significant increase in several infected tissues.","Karray, Aida; Ben Ali, Yassine; Boujelben, Jamil; Amara, Sawsan; Carrière, Frédéric; Gargouri, Youssef; Bezzine, Sofiane",Biochimie,492,20

We previously described von willebrand factor (VWF) and their high molecular weight multimers (HMWMs) as potential trigger of microthrombosis. OBJECTIVES: Investigate VWF activity with collagen-binding assay and ADAMTS13 in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study enrolled 77 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 37 suffering from a non-critical form and 40 with critical form. Plasma levels of VWF collagen-binding ability (VWF:CB) and ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13:Act) were measured in the first 48 hours following admission. VWF:CB was increased in critical (631% IQR [460–704]) patients compared to non-critical patients (259% [235–330], p < 0.005). VWF:CB was significantly associated (r = 0.564, p < 0.001) with HMWMs. Moreover, median ADAMTS13:Act was lower in critical (64.8 IU/dL IQR 50.0–77.7) than non-critical patients (85.0 IU/dL IQR 75.8–94.7, p < 0.001), even if no patients displayed majors deficits. VWF:Ag-to-ADAMTS13:Act ratio was highly associated with VWF:CB (r = 0.916, p < 0.001). Moreover, VWF:CB level was highly predictive of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality as shown by the ROC curve analysis (AUC = 0.92, p < 0.0001) in which we identified a VWF:CB cut-off of 446% as providing the best predictor sensitivity–specificity balance. We confirmed this cut-off thanks to a Kaplan–Meier estimator analysis (log-rank p < 0.001) and a Cox-proportional Hazard model (HR = 49.1, 95% CI 1.81–1328.2, p = 0.021) adjusted on, BMI, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: VWF:CB levels could summarize both VWF increased levels and hyper-reactivity subsequent to ADAMTS13 overflow and, therefore, be a valuable and easy to perform clinical biomarker of microthrombosis and COVID-19 severity.","Philippe, Aurélien; Gendron, Nicolas; Bory, Olivier; Beauvais, Agathe; Mirault, Tristan; Planquette, Benjamin; Sanchez, Olivier; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Chocron, Richard; Smadja, David M.",Angiogenesis,492,2

In humans, coronaviruses are one of several groups of viruses that cause the common cold. The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses and causes an acute respiratory disease, which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. The strategy of expression of the coronavirus genome is unique. The input virion RNA molecule is translated directly, one of the products being an RNA polymerase that then transcribes a full-length (—) sense copy RNA, from which in turn is transcribed a 3′-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The nested set comprises six overlapping species of mRNAs that extend for different lengths from a common 3′ terminus. Only the unique sequence toward the 5′ end, which is not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set, is translated, each product, therefore, being a unique protein.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

METHODS: Although a review of the literature shows that digital technology overuse in youth represents an important topic to be studied itself (during the pandemic and afterwards), the present work also takes into account findings from Affective Neuroscience Theory (ANT). RESULTS: An investigation of digital overuse while the COVID-19 pandemic (and beyond) against the background of ANT calls for a shift of perspective in research, at least as an important supplement to research efforts querying the actual nature of digital overuse. In the present work, we argue that it is high time to more comprehensively address why children spend too much time with screens and to also highlight the indirect media effects of screen time use (e.g. less mammalian rough and tumble PLAY time outside and elevated SADNESS due to parental neglect). CONCLUSIONS: In sum, insights from ANT are put forward to guide research shedding light on detrimental aspects of too much screen time in youth.","Montag, Christian; Elhai, Jon D.",Addict Behav Rep,492,24

This is a cross-sectional study of teachers at elementary, middle, and high schools in Minas Gerais. An online questionnaire was made available to all participants through the Google Forms platform. For the analysis, sociodemographic, economic, occupational profile, health conditions, and behavioral/habitual variables were used. Food consumption was assessed through the weekly frequency of eating foods considered healthy and unhealthy before and during the pandemic. The changes observed in the frequency were classified as: decreased intake, no change in intake, and increased intake during the pandemic. Statistical analysis was performed using bivariate and multiple analysis using the Multinomial Logistics Regression model. The data were tabulated with the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 18.0. A total of 15,641 teachers participated in this study, with an average age of 42.96 (±9.27) years, and most of them were female (81.9%). During the pandemic, approximately 40% reported altered sleep quality and alcohol consumption, and lack of physical activity with 60.4% of the professionals categorized as overweight. During this period, there was an increase in the consumption of sweets (19.5%), soft drinks (13.3%), sausages (12.0%), frozen foods (8.9%), salty foods (6.3%), vegetables (13.1%), fruits (12.6%), and wholegrain products (8.3%). In the regression analysis, several factors were found to be associated with changes in teachers’ food consumption in a bidirectional way when associated with variables related to sociodemographic characteristics, occupational profile, general health, and lifestyle.","Alves Durães, Sabrina; das Graças Pena, Geórgia; Neri Nobre, Luciana; Handyara Bicalho, Audrey; Ramos Veloso Silva, Rosângela; Sant’Ana Haikal, Desirée; Amaral Oliveira Rodrigues, Carolina; Fagundes Silveira, Marise; Santos Figueiredo Brito, Maria Fernanda; Fonseca Bastos, Vítor; de Pinho, Lucineia",Obes Med,492,32

SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor to invade human cells. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We compared ACE2 expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger (ages ≤ 49 years) and older (ages > 49 years) persons using two-sided Student’s t test. We also investigated the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures in various tissues using Pearson’s correlation test. RESULTS: ACE2 expression levels were the highest in the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue, and were the lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle. ACE2 showed medium expression levels in the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland. ACE2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue. In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, ACE2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females. In the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally. The different host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explain why males and females, young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity. This study provides new insights into the role of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Li, Meng-Yuan; Li, Lin; Zhang, Yue; Wang, Xiao-Sheng",Infect Dis Poverty,492,1

The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of biventricular longitudinal strain and its combination with hs‐TNI in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: A total of 160 COVID‐19 patients who underwent both echocardiography and hs‐TNI testing were enrolled in our study. COVID‐19 patients were divided into two groups (critical and non‐critical) according to severity‐of‐illness. The clinical characteristics, cardiac structure and function were compared between the two groups. The prognostic value of biventricular longitudinal strain and its combination with hs‐TNI were evaluated by logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves. Left ventricular longitudinal strain (LV LS) and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were determined by 2D speckle‐tracking echocardiography. RESULTS: The LV LS and RVFWLS both were significantly lower in critical patients than non‐critical patients (LV LS: ‐16.6±2.4 vs ‐17.9±3.0, P = .003; RVFWLS :‐18.8±3.6 vs ‐23.9±4.4, P<.001). During a median follow‐up of 60 days, 23 (14.4%) patients died. The multivariant analysis revealed that LV LS and RVFWLS [Odd ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.533 (1.131–2.079), P = .006; 1.267 (1.036–1.551), P = .021, respectively] were the independent predictors of higher mortality. Further, receiver‐operating characteristic analysis revealed that the accuracy for predicting death was greater for the combination of hs‐TNI levels with LV LS than separate LV LS (AUC: .91 vs .77, P = .001), and the combination of hs‐TNI levels with RVFWLS than RVFWLS alone (AUC: .89 vs .83, P = .041). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that the combination of ventricular longitudinal strain with hs‐TNI can provide higher accuracy for predicting mortality in COVID‐19 patients, which may enhance risk stratification in COVID‐19 patients.","Sun, Wei; Zhang, Yanting; Wu, Chun; Xie, Yuji; Peng, Li; Nie, Xiu; Yu, Cheng; Zheng, Yi; Li, Yuman; Wang, Jing; Yang, Yali; Lv, Qing; Zhang, Li; Taub, Cynthia C.; Xie, Mingxing",Echocardiography,492,20

The relative importance of adult age, sex, ethnicity, geographical region, and degree of social deprivation on weight gain is not known. We aimed to identify high-risk groups for changes in weight and BMI using electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: In this longitudinal, population-based cohort study we used linked EHR data from 400 primary care practices (via the Clinical Practice Research Datalink) in England, accessed via the CALIBER programme. Eligible participants were aged 18–74 years, were registered at a general practice clinic, and had BMI and weight measurements recorded between Jan 1, 1998, and June 30, 2016, during the period when they had eligible linked data with at least 1 year of follow-up time. We calculated longitudinal changes in BMI over 1, 5, and 10 years, and investigated the absolute risk and odds ratios (ORs) of transitioning between BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity class 1 and 2, and severe obesity [class 3]), as defined by WHO. The associations of demographic factors with BMI transitions were estimated by use of logistic regression analysis, adjusting for baseline BMI, family history of cardiovascular disease, use of diuretics, and prevalent chronic conditions. FINDINGS: We included 2 092 260 eligible individuals with more than 9 million BMI measurements in our study. Young adult age was the strongest risk factor for weight gain at 1, 5, and 10 years of follow-up. Compared with the oldest age group (65–74 years), adults in the youngest age group (18–24 years) had the highest OR (4·22 [95% CI 3·86–4·62]) and greatest absolute risk (37% vs 24%) of transitioning from normal weight to overweight or obesity at 10 years. Likewise, adults in the youngest age group with overweight or obesity at baseline were also at highest risk to transition to a higher BMI category; OR 4·60 (4·06–5·22) and absolute risk (42% vs 18%) of transitioning from overweight to class 1 and 2 obesity, and OR 5·87 (5·23–6·59) and absolute risk (22% vs 5%) of transitioning from class 1 and 2 obesity to class 3 obesity. Other demographic factors were consistently less strongly associated with these transitions; for example, the OR of transitioning from normal weight to overweight or obesity in people living in the most socially deprived versus least deprived areas was 1·23 (1·18–1·27), for men versus women was 1·12 (1·08–1·16), and for Black individuals versus White individuals was 1·13 (1·04–1·24). We provide an open access online risk calculator, and present high-resolution obesity risk charts over a 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year follow-up period. INTERPRETATION: A radical shift in policy is required to focus on individuals at the highest risk of weight gain (ie, young adults aged 18–24 years) for individual-level and population-level prevention of obesity and its long-term consequences for health and health care.

We can no longer take reductionist approaches that consider only the cancer cells and their genes. Instead, we need to understand how millions of years of evolution have guided strategies that shape cancer risk, why cancer risk varies across different animals, how cancer risk can vary in a population and be influenced by ecology (and influence this ecology), and of course how cancers evolve within us and the evolutionarily informed strategies to counter their impact.

A cross-sectional study was conducted through telephone interviews, targeting 213 caregivers of pediatric patients with epilepsy, belonging to underserved areas of Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. A simple questionnaire was designed to record the responses of participants relevant to the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic and their knowledge about possible ways that can be accessed for the management of epilepsy during an ongoing pandemic. The current study, which holds 77% of the respondents from rural areas and 23% from urban settings, showed that partial measures of lockdown taken to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 resulted in adverse economic and health outcomes in the said population including cancelation of follow-up visits, worsening of seizures, job loss, burden of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) costs, and discontinuation of medicines. Furthermore, knowledge about alternative ways to access health facilities was found very poor among caregivers. Income sources of poor people disrupted by lockdown can lead to unintentional nonadherence to medication, which is a clear picture of inequitable distribution of resources.

The breakdown of antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programs determine an increase in infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, particularly in intensive care units. Most of these infections are related to high-risk carbapenemase-producing clones and occasionally with resistance to new ß-lactam-ß-lactamase inhibitor combinations. On the contrary, in the primary care, there has been a decrease in the use of antimicrobials during the first wave, although it would not have had a significant impact on pathogens associated with community-acquired infections.

RESULTS: We found that while students preferred face-to-face, physical teaching, they were able to adapt to the new norm of e-learning. More than 60 % of the students agreed that pre-recorded lectures and viewing videos of practical sessions, plus answering short questions, were beneficial. Certain aspects, such as hands-on practical and clinical experience, could never be replaced. The e-learning and study-from-home environment accorded a lot of flexibility. However, students also found it challenging to focus because of distractions, lack of engagement and mental stress.

We aimed to explore the reasons behind Australian parents' vaccine intentions for themselves and for their children. METHOD: This mixed methods study relates to Wave 13 (January 2021) of a longitudinal study of Australian parents' experiences during COVID-19 and contained 1094 participants (83% mothers). We used multinomial logistic regression to understand demographic predictors of vaccine intention, and a descriptive template thematic analysis to analyse open-ended questions about parents' reasons for vaccine intentions for themselves and their children. RESULTS: 64% of Australian parents intend on vaccination, 26% are unsure and 9% intend to decline; 48% intend to vaccinate their children, 38% are unsure, and 14% intend to decline. Relative to those intending to vaccinate, parents unsure (OR = -0.63, 95% CI: 0.46, −0.84, p = .002) or not intending (OR = -0.41, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.67 p < .001) to vaccinate were more likely to have lower trust in doctors. Similar predictors emerged for parents who did not intend to vaccinate their children (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.70, p < .001). Qualitative data indicated that many parents had not made a firm decision, including a lack of alignment between intentions and reasons. For example, parents who said ‘yes’ to vaccination, often then expressed hesitance and a focus on risks in their written response. Reasons for hesitancy for themselves included concerns about testing, side effects, and long-term outcomes. Similar themes were present for children, but parents expressed a strong desire to protect their children, and an eagerness for health information. CONCLUSION: Based on prior research and the themes identified here, a multipronged campaign that includes education/promotion, good access to vaccines and role models, is likely to support parents to make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccination.","Evans, S.; Klas, A.; Mikocka-Walus, A.; German, B.; Rogers, G.D.; Ling, M.; Fernando, J.W.; Kothe, E.; Westrupp, E.M.",J Psychosom Res,492,20

Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients. Methods We selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2 patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants. Results The initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg/L after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg/L, which decreased to 43.82 mg/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P/F ratio (p<0.05), and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p<0.05). Conclusion Steroids have ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients. Physicians should consider the use of dexamethasone use in appropriate patients with COVID-19.

We surmise that the number of urgent endoscopies outside regular working hours in the Paris area decreased as a result. The objective of this study was to describe the observed number of acts during the 2020 mandatory period of home isolation, compared to the values in prior years and the expected value for 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter cohort study to investigate the practice of urgent endoscopy acts, outside regular working hours, in Paris and its surrounding suburbs, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected the number of endoscopies performed between January 17(th) and April 17(th) 2018, 2019 and 2020. We then collected clinical, endoscopic and outcome variables from the patients of years 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: From March 17(th) to April 17(th) (during home isolation), the number of acts was respectively of 147 in 2018, 137 in 2019, and 79 in 2020, lower that the expected number of 142 (-44.0%). In 2020, the number of endoscopies for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and findings of variceal and non-variceal bleeding decreased by 52.1%, 69.2% and 43.1% respectively, after a month of home isolation. In-hospital death rate were similar. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the urgent endoscopy caseload outside regular hours decreased nearly by half during the pandemic. Our results suggest a decreased number of endoscopies for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding, and findings of variceal and non-variceal bleeding.","Becq, Aymeric; Jais, Benedicte; Fron, Clémence; Rotkopf, Hugo; Perrod, Guillaume; Rudler, Marika; Thabut, Dominique; Hedjoudje, Abdellah; Palazzo, Maxime; Amiot, Aurélien; Sobhani, Iradj; Dray, Xavier; Camus, Marine",Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol,492,30

(2): Using a stochastic approach, we estimated the risk of RVF virus (RVFV) introduction during the period of May to October (the period when mosquito populations, including RVFV potential vectors, are present in European countries), into previously unaffected areas (e.g., United Kingdom, UK) via virus-carrying vectors traveling in commercial aircraft from RVF-affected countries (e.g., East Africa); (3): On average N = 68 (95% CI: 0–337), RVF-virus-infected mosquitoes are estimated to be mechanically transported by planes (with N = 0 as most likely), in direct flights from RVF-affected East African countries to the UK, between May and October. This estimate is considered as low but not negligible. The model developed should be easily scaled up to other European countries by amending appropriately country-specific variables (e.g., number of flights between countries) in order to map the areas/airports of higher risk and inform risk management per country accordingly and to adopt risk-mitigation measures.","Filippitzi, Maria-Eleni; Saegerman, Claude",Pathogens,492,1

There is an unmet need to develop therapies against SARS-CoV-2 due to its severity and lack of treatment options. A promising approach to combat COVID-19 is through the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by therapeutic antibodies. Previously, we described a strategy to rapidly identify and generate llama nanobodies (VHH) from naïve and synthetic humanized VHH phage libraries that specifically bind the S1 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and block the interaction with the human ACE2 receptor. In this study we used computer-aided design to construct multi-specific VHH antibodies fused to human IgG1 Fc domains based on the epitope predictions for leading VHHs. The resulting tri-specific VHH-Fc antibodies show more potent S1 binding, S1/ACE2 blocking, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization than the bi-specific VHH-Fcs or combination of individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs. Furthermore, protein stability analysis of the VHH-Fcs shows favorable developability features, which enable them to be quickly and successfully developed into therapeutics against COVID-19.","Dong, Jianbo; Huang, Betty; Wang, Bo; Titong, Allison; Gallolu Kankanamalage, Sachith; Jia, Zhejun; Wright, Meredith; Parthasarathy, Pannaga; Liu, Yue",Sci Rep,492,8

Most emerging infectious disease agents in humans are of zoonotic origin. Bats are important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses and have been implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events in recent years. It is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of the bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks. To facilitate further research, we constructed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir). Known viral sequences detected in bat samples were manually collected and curated, along with the related metadata, such as the sampling time, location, bat species and specimen type. Additional information concerning the bats, including common names, diet type, geographic distribution and phylogeny were integrated into the database to bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists. The database currently covers >4100 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 viral families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. It provides an overview and snapshot of the current research regarding bat-associated viruses, which is essential now that the field is rapidly expanding. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, DBatVir provides a convenient and powerful platform for virologists and zoologists to analyze the virome diversity of bats, as well as for epidemiologists and public health researchers to monitor and track current and future bat-related infectious diseases.
