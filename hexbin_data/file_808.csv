60164,COVID-19 and tuberculosis co-infection: a neglected paradigm.,2020-09-04,"UNLABELLED Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), also known as avian pneumovirus or turkey rhinotracheitis virus, is the causative agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and is associated with swollen head syndrome in chickens. Since its discovery in the 1970s, aMPV has been recognized as an economically important pathogen in the poultry industry worldwide. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2'-O positions. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant aMPV (raMPV) Colorado strains carrying mutations in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2'-O, but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) young turkeys. Importantly, turkeys vaccinated with these MTase-defective raMPVs triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody and were completely protected from challenge with homologous aMPV Colorado strain and heterologous aMPV Minnesota strain. Collectively, our results indicate (i) that aMPV lacking 2'-O methylation is highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo and (ii) that inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for aMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses include many economically and agriculturally important viruses such as avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), human pathogens such as human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus type 3, and measles virus, and highly lethal emerging pathogens such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus. For many of them, there is no effective vaccine or antiviral drug. These viruses share common strategies for viral gene expression and replication. During transcription, paramyxoviruses produce capped, methylated, and polyadenylated mRNAs. Using aMPV as a model, we found that viral ribose 2'-O methyltransferase (MTase) is a novel approach to rationally attenuate the virus for vaccine purpose. Recombinant aMPV (raMPV) lacking 2'-O MTase were not only highly attenuated in turkeys but also provided complete protection against the challenge of homologous and heterologous aMPV strains. This novel approach can be applicable to other animal and human paramyxoviruses for rationally designing live attenuated vaccines.","Sun, Jing; Wei, Yongwei; Rauf, Abdul; Zhang, Yu; Ma, Yuanmei; Zhang, Xiaodong; Shilo, Konstantin; Yu, Qingzhong; Saif, Y M; Lu, Xingmeng; Yu, Lian; Li, Jianrong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01095-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122790/,808
60342,Gender differences in treatment of Coronavirus Disease-2019.,2020-12-03,"The Bactigras(®) paraffin tulle coated with chlorhexidine is normally used for the treatment of donor-site wounds in burn patients who received split-thickness skin grafts in several centers. It has some disadvantages, such as adhesion to wound surfaces and pain from the irritation caused by this dressing. The Telfa AMD(®), a non-adherent wound dressing which consists of absorbent cotton fibers impregnated with polyhexamethylene biguanide enclosed in a sleeve of thermoplastic polymers, is a new option for donor-site wound care which causes less adherence to the wound. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical efficacy of these two dressings for the management of donor-site wounds. Thirty-two patients who received split-thickness skin grafts by donor site harvesting from the thigh were enrolled in this study and randomized into two groups receiving either the Bactigras(®) or the Telfa AMD(®) wound treatment. Re-epithelialization, pain, infection and cost-effectiveness analyses were compared between both groups. The results showed that there was no significant difference in age, area of donor sites or length of hospital stays between the groups (p > 0.05). However, the day of re-epithelialization (≥90%) was significantly shorter in patients treated with the Telfa AMD(®) compared to the Bactigras(®) group (14.00 ± 3.05 vs. 9.25 ± 1.88 days for Bactigras(®) and Telfa AMD(®) groups, respectively, p < 0.001). The average pain score was also significantly lower in the Telfa AMD(®) group (1.57 ± 0.55 vs. 4.70 ± 1.16, p < 0.001). There was no difference in the cost of treatment between the groups (4.64 ± 1.97 vs. 5.72 ± 2.54 USD, p = 0.19). This study indicated that the Telfa AMD(®) was an effective dressing for the treatment of donor-site wounds.","Muangman, Pornprom; Nitimonton, Sooksan; Aramwit, Pornanong",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms12085031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21954342/,808

62615,COVID-19 and clinical mimics. Correct diagnosis is the key to appropriate therapy.,2020-05-06,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of computed tomography (CT)-based residual lung volume (RLV) on mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS A single-center, retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database was performed. In total, 138 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Baseline chest CT scan was performed in all patients. CT-based automated and semi-automated lung segmentation was performed using the Alma Medical workstation to calculate normal lung volume, lung opacities volume, total lung volume, and RLV. The primary end point of the study was mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS Overall, 84 men (61%) and 54 women (39%) with a mean age of 47.3 years (±14.3 y) were included in the study. Overall mortality rate was 21% (29 patients) at a median time of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 11 d). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with death (P<0.01). Similarly, patients who died had lower normal lung volume and RLV than patients who survived (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low RLV was the only independent predictor of death (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 10.2-10.65). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that a RLV ≤64% significantly increased the risk of death (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.7). CONCLUSION Overall mortality of patients with COVID-19 may reach 21%. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that reduced RLV was the principal independent predictor of death. Furthermore, RLV ≤64% is associated with a 4-fold increase on the risk of death.","Timaran-Montenegro, David Ernesto; Torres-Ramírez, Christian Alexander; Morales-Jaramillo, Leonardo Mauricio; Mateo-Camacho, Yohana Sarahi; Tapia-Rangel, Edgar Alonso; Fuentes-Badillo, Karla Daniela; Hernández-Rojas, Ana Milena; Morales-Domínguez, Valeria; Saenz-Castillo, Pedro Fernando; Parra-Guerrero, Lina Marcela; Jacome-Portilla, Katherine Isamara; Obrando-Bravo, Daniel Ernesto; Contla-Trejo, Giovanni Saul; Falla-Trujillo, Manuel Gerardo; Punzo-Alcaraz, Gerardo Rafael; Feria-Arroyo, Gustavo Adolfo; Chávez-Sastre, Alberto Joshua; Govea-Palma, Jovani; Carrillo-Álvarez, Santiago; Orozco-Vázquez, Julita Del Socorro",Journal of thoracic imaging,https://doi.org/10.1097/rti.0000000000000572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600123/,808
69415,Emerging prophylaxis strategies against COVID-19.,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND Studies aimed at reducing neonatal anaemia or transfusing higher blood volumes did not find improvement in neurodevelopmental function at two years of age. This study investigated the relationship between the receipt, timing, and number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and neurodevelopmental outcomes among preterm infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of preterm infants (gestational age <34 weeks) with a full neurodevelopmental assessment at 18-36 months corrected age from October 2008 to September 2020. Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers were collected. Multivariable regressions were used to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes. RESULTS 654 preterm infants were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 25 months. 295 infants (45%) received a total of 1,322 blood transfusions. After adjustment for gestational age, baseline morbidity, and socioeconomic status, receipt of RBC transfusion was associated with decreased two-year cognitive and motor function, but not language (p=0.047, 0.025, and 0.879, respectively). There was no significant difference in outcomes between receipt of transfusion in the first week of life compared to after. Number of transfusions was associated with decreased cognitive, language, and motor function (all p<0.001), and increased likelihood to develop severe neurodevelopmental impairment (adjusted-odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.15; p=0.004). DISCUSSION Our study demonstrates an association between RBC transfusion and lower cognitive and motor outcomes at two-years after adjustment for prematurity and illness at birth. Increasing number of transfusions worsened neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Lum, Trenton G; Sugar, Jenna; Yim, Rachel; Fertel, Sophie; Morales, Ana; Poeltler, Debra; Katheria, Anup",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2021.0070-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369862/,808

75612,"COVID-2019: update on epidemiology, disease spread and management.",2020-04-16,"BACKGROUND Despite the availability of published data on 4 pandemics that have occurred over the past 120 years, there is little modern information on the causes of death associated with influenza pandemics. METHODS We examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred during the era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918-1919 ""Spanish flu"" pandemic. We examined lung tissue sections obtained during 58 autopsies and reviewed pathologic and bacteriologic data from 109 published autopsy series that described 8398 individual autopsy investigations. RESULTS The postmortem samples we examined from people who died of influenza during 1918-1919 uniformly exhibited severe changes indicative of bacterial pneumonia. Bacteriologic and histopathologic results from published autopsy series clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria in most influenza fatalities. CONCLUSIONS The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria. Less substantial data from the subsequent 1957 and 1968 pandemics are consistent with these findings. If severe pandemic influenza is largely a problem of viral-bacterial copathogenesis, pandemic planning needs to go beyond addressing the viral cause alone (e.g., influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs). Prevention, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia, as well as stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines, should also be high priorities for pandemic planning.","Morens, David M; Taubenberger, Jeffery K; Fauci, Anthony S",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1086/591708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18710327/,808

However, the drivers of BTSC resistance to therapy remain unknown. The cytokine receptor for oncostatin M (OSMR) regulates BTSC proliferation and glioblastoma tumorigenesis. Here, we report our discovery of a mitochondrial OSMR that confers resistance to IR via regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, independent of its role in cell proliferation. Mechanistically, OSMR is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix via the presequence translocase-associated motor complex components, mtHSP70 and TIM44. OSMR interacts with NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase 1/2 (NDUFS1/2) of complex I and promotes mitochondrial respiration. Deletion of OSMR impairs spare respiratory capacity, increases reactive oxygen species, and sensitizes BTSCs to IR-induced cell death. Importantly, suppression of OSMR improves glioblastoma response to IR and prolongs lifespan.","Sharanek, Ahmad; Burban, Audrey; Laaper, Matthew; Heckel, Emilie; Joyal, Jean-Sebastien; Soleimani, Vahab D; Jahani-Asl, Arezu",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17885-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807793/,808

However, it is not clear how the chirality of the extracellular microenvironment regulates cell adhesion and cytoskeletal structures and therefore affects gene transfection. In this study, the chirality of focal adhesions and the cytoskeleton of single human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was controlled by specially designed micropatterns, and its influence on gene transfection was investigated. Micropatterns with different cell adhesion areas and swirling stripe lines were prepared by micropatterning fibronectin on polystyrene surfaces. The chiral micropatterns induced the formation of chiral focal adhesions and chiral cytoskeletal structures. Gene transfection efficiency was enhanced with increasing adhesion area, while hMSCs on left-handed and right-handed swirling micropatterns showed the same level of gene transfection. When the swirling angle was changed from 0°, 30°, and 60° to 90°, the gene transfection efficiency at a swirling angle of 60° was the lowest. The influence of cell chirality on gene transfection was strongly associated with cellular uptake capacity, DNA synthesis and cytoskeletal mechanics. The results demonstrated that cytoskeletal swirling had a significant influence on gene transfection.","Wang, Yongtao; Yang, Yingjun; Wang, Xinlong; Yoshitomi, Toru; Kawazoe, Naoki; Yang, Yingnan; Chen, Guoping",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740614/,808

A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated with increasing SeIV and TeIV (up to 500 µM each) for 205 days to evaluate metalloid oxyanion and nutrient removal. AGS efficiently removed SeIV and TeIV by readily converting them to biomass associated forms. The total Se and Te removal efficiencies were higher at 98% and 99%, respectively. Formation of biomass-associated Se0 and Te0 was confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and SEM-EDX. Feeding of SeIV and TeIV elicited inhibitory action on ammonium removal initially, nonetheless removal performance was recovered during the subsequent cycles. Ammonium, total nitrogen and phosphorus removals were stabilized at 85%, 80% and 75%, respectively, at 500 µM of SeIV and TeIV. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene confirmed enrichment of known SeIV and TeIV reducing bacteria in the granules. qPCR and removal kinetics supported ammonia removal via nitritation-denitritation. This work demonstrates functional capabilities of AGS for effectively removing toxic SeIV and TeIV oxyanions apart from performing simultaneous COD, nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Efficient biological nutrient removal in the presence of toxic SeIV and TeIV concentrations, suggests robustness of AGS and its resilience to toxic contaminants.","Nancharaiah, Y V; Sarvajith, M",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399215/,808

Vaccine strategies combined with, or without, adjuvants have been established to eradicate various bacterial and viral pathogens. A new generation of vaccines is being developed using specific strains of Gram-positive, lactic acid bacteria and, notably, some probiotic lactobacilli. These bacteria have been safely consumed by humans for centuries in fermented foods. Thus, they can be orally administered, are well tolerated by recipients and could be easily and economically provided to large populations. In this overview, we focus on mucosal immunity and how its cellular component(s), particularly dendritic cells, can be specifically targeted to deliver immunogenic subunits, such as the protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax). An antigen-specific immune response can be elicited using specific strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus expressing the protective antigen. A mucosal, dendritic cell-targeted approach increases the bioavailability of an immunogen of interest when delivered orally by L. acidophilus.

In normal rats, the percentage injected dose in urine at 10 and 60 min for both preparations averaged, respectively, 103% and 106% that of (131)I-OIH. The renal clearances of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(rac-ASMA) and (131)I-OIH were comparable (P = 0.48). The tracer was excreted unchanged in the urine, proving its in vivo stability. In pedicle-ligated rats, (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(rac-ASMA) had less excretion into the bowel (P < 0.05) than did (131)I-OIH and was better retained in the blood (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Both (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(ASMA) complexes have pharmacokinetic properties in rats comparable to or superior to those of (131)I-OIH, and human studies are warranted for their further evaluation.","Lipowska, Malgorzata; Klenc, Jeffrey; Marzilli, Luigi G; Taylor, Andrew T","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.111.102236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22717977/,808

A broad-spectrum antiviral targeting entry of enveloped viruses. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 107, 3157-3162 (2010). The emergence and re-emergence of viruses and the widespread antiviral resistance calls for the development of a broad-spectrum strategy for viral infection. The article under review describes an approach to achieve this goal by developing an antiviral rhodanine derivative effective against enveloped viruses targeting the viral lipid membrane. By intercalating into the viral membrane, the compound irreversibly inactivates the virions with virucidal effects. Potential toxic effects on hosts could be minimized by continuous regeneration of cellular membranes. The present strategy exploits the therapeutic window that exists between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes and provides a useful guideline for future research endeavors towards broad-spectrum antiviral approaches for enveloped viruses. Developing a formulation that ensures efficient delivery and pharmacokinetic properties while minimizing systemic toxicity on cell membranes remains a challenge. The advantages and disadvantages of a viral membrane-targeting approach for the control of emerging and re-emerging viruses will be discussed.","Song, Jae-Min; Seong, Baik-Lin",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1586/eri.10.51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20521891/,808

Certain groups are known to be at higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 infection, such as men and people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Identifying and managing HCWs who have been exposed to COVID-19 is of utmost importance in preventing healthcare transmission and protecting staff and vulnerable patients in healthcare settings. Recently, antibody testing to diagnose previous COVID-19 exposure among HCW has commenced in the UK. This provided an opportunity to assess exposure to COVID-19 among the various subgroups within the HCW community, based on their roles and ethnic background. We found that HCWs working in patient-facing roles were twice as likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 than their colleagues in non-patient-facing roles. Reassuringly, workers from BAME backgrounds had a similar risk of previous COVID-19 exposure to their white colleagues. More research is required to assess how frontline staff, especially those working in patient facing roles, can reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19.","Razvi, Salman; Oliver, Rahima; Moore, Jonathan; Beeby, Andrew",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962975/,808

Experiencing such a feeling as an employee has been called organizational dehumanization. Scholars have recently suggested that organizational dehumanization may play a key role in the development of emotional labor. However, how organizational dehumanization and two main emotional labor strategies (i.e., surface and deep acting) are causally related remains unclear in this literature. In the present research, we argue that employees who experience organizational dehumanization and whose self is thus threatened then engage in surface acting to ""conserve"" their self or in deep acting to ""give up"" their self in service of the role. Overall, the combined results of three studies offer strong evidence that organizational dehumanization leads employees to perform more surface acting, but not more deep acting. Unexpectedly, our findings also indicate that deep acting reduces the perception of being dehumanized by the organization. In showing this, the present research sheds light on the potential dark side of deep acting, by suggesting that this strategy can change employees' perspectives in a way that may encourage them to stay in an organization that treats them as a means to an end.

Systemic oxygen saturation (SpO2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and cerebral saturation (near-infrared spectroscopy, SctO2) were measured continuously over the first 72 h. Resulting data underwent error-processing. For each remaining 10 m window, the mean MABP and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) were calculated. The infants were divided into two groups (23-25 and 26-28 weeks). The median FTOE at low, medium, and high MABP values (empirically defined within each group based on the 25th and 75th centile) were compared between estimated gestational age (EGA) groups.ResultsSample n=68, mean±SD GA=25.5±1.3 weeks, and birthweight (BW)=823±195 g.

To date, heterogeneous findings and methodologies have limited clinicians' and researchers' ability to meaningfully synthesise existing literature. In this context, there is a need to clarify mental health outcomes in a homogeneous sample, controlling for key methodological differences and applying a consistent definition of concussion across studies. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SportDiscus, Scopus and PubMed. ELIGIBILITY Peer-reviewed studies published between 1980 and June 2020 that prospectively examined mental health outcomes after paediatric concussion, defined as per the Berlin Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport. RESULTS Sixty-nine articles characterising 60 unique samples met inclusion criteria, representing 89 114 children with concussion. Forty articles (33 studies) contributed to a random effects meta-analysis of internalising (withdrawal, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress), externalising (conduct problems, aggression, attention, hyperactivity) and total mental health difficulties across three time points post-injury (acute, persisting and chronic). Overall, children with concussion (n=6819) experienced significantly higher levels of internalising (g=0.41-0.46), externalising (g=0.25-0.46) and overall mental health difficulties compared with controls (g=0.18-0.49; n=56 271), with effects decreasing over time. SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS Our review highlights that mental health is central to concussion recovery. Assessment, prevention and intervention of mental health status should be integrated into standard follow-up procedures. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying observed relationships between mental health, post-concussion symptoms and other psychosocial factors. Results suggest that concussion may both precipitate and exacerbate mental health difficulties, thus impacting delayed recovery and psychosocial outcomes.","Gornall, Alice; Takagi, Michael; Morawakage, Thilanka; Liu, Xiaomin; Anderson, Vicki",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926965/,808
121886,Bleeding events in COVID-19: the other side of the coin?,2021-04-01,"Liver failure is associated to high mortality due to the accumulation of protein-bound metabolites, such as bilirubin, not removed by conventional hemodialysis. Different methods can efficiently remove them, such as the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), plasma exchange (PEX), and bilirubin or plasma adsorption perfusion (PAP). No direct comparison exists between MARS, PEX and PAP, and current guidelines do not specify which method (and when) to use. We have retrospectively evaluated MARS, PEX and PAP in their effectiveness in lowering plasma bilirubin concentration, and their effects on liver and kidney function. A total of 98 patients have been recruited, which comprised 68 patients treated with PAP (177 sessions), 16 patients with PEX (41 sessions) and 11 patients with MARS (21 sessions). Bilirubin, creatinine, liver enzymes were analyzed before and after the first treatment with each technique. The three methods did not differ for bilirubin lowering efficiency, with MARS showing only slightly less effective reductions. Finally, the three techniques did not differ in the amount of change of cholinesterase, but a lower reduction in AST was found using PAP. Our retrospective observation is one of the largest case series of hepatic failure treated with bilirubin absorption. The choice of the technique cannot be based on the desired reduction in bilirubin concentration. Based on costs and duration of treatment, we suggest that PAP could be considered as a first-line approach. In case of kidney involvement, MARS remains a valuable option.","Viggiano, Davide; de Pascale, Emanuela; Marinelli, Gaia; Pluvio, Corrado",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10047-017-0986-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28887736/,808

Hayek (Lamiaceae), is an Eastern Mediterranean element, which is used in traditional medicine and cuisine in the same manner as S. fruticosa Mill. and S. officinalis L.. The essential oil (EO) and the extracts of S. pomifera possess bioactive compounds with anti-proliferative, anticholinesterase, antioxidant, antiviral and antifungal properties. In this study, the chemical (EO), genetic (DNA microsatellites, SSRs) and morphological diversity of forty-nine individuals of Salvia pomifera subsp. calycina, originating from five natural populations of the Peloponnese (Greece) were determined, in order to explore the potential for successful breeding and to reveal tools and biomarkers for identification and authentication. Chemical and genetic analyses revealed high levels of variation both within and among populations, while morphological analysis mainly within populations. Essential oil yield ranged from 1.79 to 5.79 ml 100 g-1 dry wt, among individuals while β-thujone ranged from 6.04 to 64.75%. Consistency was found in the EO yield and composition of specific individuals, when sampled during the same period, for three consecutive years, while the analysis during spring and summer months showed differentiation that still retained individual's discrimination. Genetic analysis using SSRs showed that the observed population heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.48 to 0.67, while high number of private alleles were revealed in all populations. Considerable genetic differentiation was observed among the three Salvia taxa (S. pomifera subsp. calycina, S. fruticosa, S. officinalis) (Fst values ranged from 0.27 to 0.48) and lower among S. pomifera subsp. calycina populations (Fst values ranged from 0.06 to 0.13). The great variation that was revealed in all measured traits, in combination with the demonstrated, genetically based, consistency of their EO yield and composition, advocates to a successful breeding, whereas SSR genotyping presents a strong identification and authentication tool.","Leontaritou, Peggy; Lamari, Fotini N; Papasotiropoulos, Vasileios; Iatrou, Gregoris",Phytochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.112900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399302/,808

Exhausted T cells are continuously replenished by T cells with precursor characteristics that self-renew and depend on the transcription factor TCF1; however, their developmental requirements are poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that high antigen load promoted the differentiation of precursor T cells, which acquired hallmarks of exhaustion within days of infection, whereas early effector cells retained polyfunctional features. Early precursor T cells showed epigenetic imprinting characteristic of T cell receptor-dependent transcription factor binding and were restricted to the generation of cells displaying exhaustion characteristics. Transcription factors BACH2 and BATF were key regulators with opposing functions in the generation of early precursor T cells. Overall, we demonstrate that exhaustion manifests first in TCF1+ precursor T cells and is propagated subsequently to the pool of antigen-specific T cells.","Utzschneider, Daniel T; Gabriel, Sarah S; Chisanga, David; Gloury, Renee; Gubser, Patrick M; Vasanthakumar, Ajithkumar; Shi, Wei; Kallies, Axel",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0760-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839610/,808

MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult patients with groups 1 and 4 PPH were invited to participate in the study. Age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were also recruited as controls. At baseline, patients underwent clinical examination, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurement and CMR with feature tracking post-processing (CMR-FT). Healthy controls underwent only CMR-FT. The study's primary endpoint was clinical failure, defined as death, hospitalization or demonstrable clinical deterioration during follow-up. Patients who were unable to perform 6-minute walking test due to musculoskeletal disorders were excluded from the study. RESULTS Thirty-six patients (8 men, 28 women; mean age, 50.6±13.8 [SD] years [range: 18.6-78.5years]) and 12 healthy control subjects (5 mean, 7 women; mean age, 40.6±13.5 [SD] years [range: 23.1-64.4years]) were recruited. Right ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly impaired in PPH patients (-20.2±5.3 [SD] % [range: -28.8 to -9.1%] vs. -28.4±3.1% [-33.7 to -22.7%] respectively, P<0.001). The right atrial GLS was significantly impaired in PPH compared to healthy controls (-19.9±4.5% [range: -28.6 to -3.6%] vs. -26.5±4.2% [range: -32.8 to -15.8%] respectively) (P<0.001). Clinical failure occurred in 19 (19/36, 53%) of patients. Right ventricular GLS predicted clinical failure most reliably among CMR parameters (-22.6±3.8 [SD] % [range: -27.6 to -12.7%] for patients without clinical failure vs. -18±5.6 [SD] % [range: -28.8 to -9.1%] for patients with clinical failure; hazard ratio [HR]=1.85; P=0.007; area under the AUC curve=0.75).

139301,Post COVID-19 tuberculosis: An emerging threat of pandemic.,2021-03-31,"Preservation of a robust circadian rhythmicity (particulsarly of the sleep/wake cycle), a proper nutrition and adequate physical exercise are key elements for healthy aging. Aging comes along with circadian alteration, e.g. a disrupted sleep and inflammation, that leads to metabolic disorders. In turn, sleep cycle disturbances cause numerous pathophysiological changes that accelerates the aging process. In the central nervous system, sleep disruption impairs several functions, among them, the clearance of waste molecules. The decrease of plasma melatonin, a molecule of unusual phylogenetic conservation present in all known aerobic organisms, plays a particular role as far as the endocrine sequels of aging. Every day, the late afternoon/nocturnal increase of melatonin synchronizes both the central circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei as well as myriads of peripheral cellular circadian clocks. This is called the ""chronobiotic effect"" of melatonin, the methoxyindole being the prototype of the endogenous family of chronobiotic agents. In addition, melatonin exerts a significant cytoprotective action by buffering free radicals and reversing inflammation via down regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, suppression of low degree inflammation and prevention of insulin resistance. Because of these properties melatonin has been advocated to be a potential therapeutic tool in COVID 19 pandemic. Melatonin administration to aged animals counteracts a significant number of senescence-related changes. In humans, melatonin is effective both as a chronobiotic and a cytoprotective agent to maintain a healthy aging. Circulating melatonin levels are consistently reduced in the metabolic syndrome, ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders like the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The potential therapeutic value of melatonin has been suggested by a limited number of clinical trials generally employing melatonin in the 2-10mg/day range. However, from animal studies the cytoprotective effects of melatonin need higher doses to become apparent (i.e. in the 100mg/day range). Hence, controlled studies employing melatonin doses in this range are urgently needed.","Cardinali, Daniel P",Vitamins and hormones,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.vh.2020.12.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706965/,808

Nowadays, double adenomas remain a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic task. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 64-year-old woman was referred to an endocrine surgeon to evaluate a persistently elevating level of calcium. In the biochemical analysis the serum level of total calcium was increased - 2.79 mmol/l, ionized calcium - 1.64 mmol/l, parathyroid hormone - 191.4 pg/mL. Ultrasound and MSCT scan of the neck showed an increase of the parathyroid glands under the lower poles of both lobes of the thyroid gland. No functionally active parathyroid glands were found on scintigraphy. The patient underwent bilateral neck exploration with identiﬁcation of all four parathyroid glands and a double parathyroid adenomectomy. According to a histological study, the removed parathyroid glands are represented by adenomas from the dark main cells. Remission of primary hyperparathyroidism was achieved. DISCUSSION This clinical report confirms the literature on a decrease in the sensitivity of imaging methods in the diagnosis of double adenomas. A decrease in the effectiveness of intraoperative monitoring of parathyroid hormone with double adenomas was confirmed. In this patient, a double parathyroid adenomectomy was sufficient to achieve remission of hyperparathyroidism. CONCLUSION With double adenomas, a comprehensive assessment of all imaging methods is required. A positive test during intraoperative monitoring of IPTG does not exclude a double adenoma in a patient.

This study examined the susceptibility patterns and trends of drug-resistant TB cases in the 309 Hospital in Beijing, China. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were retrospectively identified, drug susceptibility test (DST) results and clinical data were analysed for the period 1997-2009. Of the 5523 culture-positive TB patients, 47·1% had resistance to any anti-TB drug, 14·8% had mono-resistant TB, 19·8% had poly-resistant TB, 19·4% had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and 1·3% had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Drug-resistant TB was significantly associated with age group, residential situation, and TB treatment history (P<0·001). During 1997-2000, the percentage of TB patients with any resistance, mono-resistant TB, poly-resistant TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB all increased significantly (P<0·001). During 2000-2003, the increasing trends of MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases were reversed. During 2004-2009, the percentage of TB patients with any resistance, mono-resistant TB, poly-resistant TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB all declined significantly (P<0·001), but the prevalence of MDR-TB and poly-resistant TB cases remained high.

The purpose of this work was to determine if these inhibitors would effectively treat vaccinia virus infections in mice, which has not previously been studied. METHODS ECA was investigated by cell culture plaque reduction assay for the inhibition of cowpox and vaccinia virus infections to clarify issues regarding its potency and selectivity. Mice infected intranasally with vaccinia virus were treated by intraperitoneal route twice daily for 5 days with ATA (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) and ECA (15 and 30 mg/kg/day) or once daily for 2 days with cidofovir (100 mg/kg/day). RESULTS ECA caused 50% inhibition of virus plaque formation at 20-79 muM in four cultured cell lines, with 50% cytotoxicity at 84-173 muM, giving low (1.3-4.2) selectivity index values. Preliminary toxicity tests in uninfected mice indicated that ATA and ECA were both overtly toxic at 100 mg/kg/day. No protection from mortality was afforded by treatment of vaccinia virus infections with ATA or ECA, but 100% survival was achieved in the cidofovir group. ATA- and ECA-treated mice died significantly sooner than placebo-treated animals, indicating that these compounds exacerbated the infection. CONCLUSIONS Both ATA and ECA lack antiviral potency and selectivity in cell culture. The compounds were ineffective in treating mice at intraperitoneal doses of <or=30 mg/kg/day. These compounds do not appear to have potential for the treatment of poxvirus infections in vivo.","Smee, Donald F; Hurst, Brett L; Wong, Min-Hui",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp1480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20413827/,808

Experience in clinical practice.",2021-03-02,"The health crisis resulting from the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worlwide, added to the low evidence of currently used treatments has led to the development of a large number of clinical trials (CT) and observational studies. Likewise, important measures have been adopted in healthcare and research centers aimed at halting the pandemic as soon as possible. The objective of this study is to gather the main aspects of the clinical research studies undertaken by the Departments of Hospital Pharmacy (DHP) of Spain during the COVID-19 crisis. The decision of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy (SEFH) to sponsor CTs made it possible that 13% of DHP had been led at least one CT. The Spanish Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS), in coordination with Institutional Review Boards, has adopted a fast-track review procedure to accelerate authorizations for CTs related to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. There have also been numerous public and private calls for financing research projects aimed at contributing to the fight against this virus. Despite the pandemic, actions have been taken to continue ongoing CTs and studies while the safety and well-being of patients are guaranteed. More specifically, the AEMPS and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have issued guidelines that incorporate changes to CT protocols that will have to be applied until the pandemic is over. In this health emergency, the scientific community has found itself in a race against time to generate evidence. It is at this moment that hospital pharmacists emerge as key players in clinical research and are contributing to a rational, effective and safe healthcare decision-making.","Castro-Balado, Ana; Varela-Rey, Iria; Bandín-Vilar, Enrique José; Busto-Iglesias, Manuel; García-Quintanilla, Laura; Mondelo-García, Cristina; Fernández-Ferreiro, Anxo",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533675/,808

We sought to characterize the current practice of ICM insertion procedures to evaluate the influence of prophylactic antibiotic administration on the occurrence of infections. METHODS We characterized insertion procedures and procedure-related infections from an ongoing multicenter registry (Reveal LINQ(TM) Registry). In order to accurately capture infections, only patients enrolled before or the day of insertion who also had a record of whether or not preoperative antibiotics were used were included in this analysis. Infections were defined based on the physician's assessment and reported upon occurrence. Patients were categorized into two analysis cohorts based on prophylactic antibiotic use. RESULTS We analyzed 375 patients from 14 U.S. centers (age 63.1 ± 15.6 years; male 54.1%). Approximately two-thirds of patients (66.4%) did not receive any preprocedural antibiotics. The overall infection rate was 1.1% (0.3-2.7% confidence interval [CI]) and corresponded to four events. In the group that did not receive preprocedural antibiotics, there were two minor infections (0.8%, [0.1-2.9% CI]), whereas in the group receiving preprocedural antibiotics a serious and a minor infection occurred (1.6%, [0.2-5.6% CI]); this serious infection resulted in an explant. CONCLUSIONS Current real-world practice shows that ICM insertions are increasingly performed without the use of prophylactic antibiotics, which is associated with a very low infection rate.","Beinart, Sean C; Natale, Andrea; Verma, Atul; Amin, Alpesh; Kasner, Scott; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Pouliot, Erika; Franco, Noreli; Mittal, Suneet",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.12886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27198480/,808

Methods One hundred fifteen patients undergoing AVR or combined aortic and mitral valve replacements with Nicks' posterior ARE between 1997 and 2019 underwent long-term echocardiographic and angio-computed tomographic evaluation. Age was 11-72 years (AVR: median, 30; interquartile range, 21-47 years; AVR and mitral valve replacement: median, 27.5; interquartile range, 20-37.5 years). The aortotomy was closed using autologous pericardial patch and Teflon-buttressed sutures. Results Hospital mortality was 1.7% (n = 2), with 4 (3.5%) late deaths. At a mean follow-up of 123.11 ± 77.67 months, the survival probability from Kaplan-Meier was 93.25 ± 0.03%. No cases of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) were observed, and only 2 patients had moderate PPM. Median aortic root diameters at the level of sinus of Valsalva and sinotubular junction were 32 (29-35) mm and 33 (30-36) mm, respectively, at discharge, and were 33 (30-36) mm, and 33 (31-37) mm, respectively, at latest follow-up, with no cases of late pericardial patch aneurysm. Conclusions ARE is a safe adjunct to AVR in patients with a small aortic annulus to prevent PPM. Retention of a pericardial collar and Teflon-buttressed sutures is an expedient, safe, and effective technique in reducing bleeding at the enlarged ventriculo-aortic junction. Autologous pericardial patch aortoplasty is not associated with late aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm formation.","Chowdhury, Ujjwal Kumar; Singh, Sukhjeet; George, Niwin; Hasija, Suruchi; Sankhyan, Lakshmikumari; Pandey, Niraj Nirmal; Sengupta, Sanjoy; Kalaivani, Mani",JTCVS techniques,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xjtc.2020.08.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34317974/,808

Advances in genetic testing have enabled the diagnosis of IBD caused by gene mutations, also known as monogenic or Mendelian disorder-associated IBD (MD-IBD), with approximately 60 causative genes reported to date. The diagnosis of VEO-IBD requires endoscopic and histological evaluations. However, satisfactory small bowel imaging studies may not be feasible in this small population. Both genetic and immunological approaches are necessary for the diagnosis of MD-IBD, which can differ among countries according to the available resources. As a result of the use of targeted gene panels covered by the national health insurance and the nationwide research project investigating inborn errors of immunity, an efficient approach for the diagnosis of MD-IBD has been developed in Japan. Proper management of VEO-IBD by pediatric gastroenterologists constitutes a challenge. Some MD-IBDs can be curable by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. With an understanding of the affected gene functions, targeted therapies are being developed. Social and psychological support systems for both children and their families should also be provided to improve their quality of life. Multidisciplinary team care would contribute to early diagnosis, proper therapeutic interventions, and improved quality of life in patients and their families.","Arai, Katsuhiro","Pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology & nutrition",https://doi.org/10.5223/pghn.2020.23.5.411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953636/,808

To test this claim, we administered two detailed assessments about the practices of science to a demographically representative sample of the US public (N = 1500), along with questions about the acceptance of evolution, climate change, and vaccines. Participants' political and religious views predicted their acceptance of scientific claims, as in prior work. But a greater knowledge of the nature of science and a more mature view of how to mitigate scientific disagreements each related positively to acceptance. Importantly, the positive effect of scientific thinking on acceptance held regardless of participants' political ideology or religiosity. Increased attention to developing people's knowledge of how science works could thus help to combat resistance to scientific claims across the political and religious spectrum.","Weisberg, Deena Skolnick; Landrum, Asheley R; Hamilton, Jesse; Weisberg, Michael",Public understanding of science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520977700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336623/,808

The lysosomal protease cathepsin B (CTSB) has shown to be involved in the lifecycle of various viruses. Here, we examined the role of CTSB in the IAV lifecycle. Methods CTSB-deficient (CTSB-/-) macrophages and the human lung epithelial cell line A549 cells treated with CA-074Me were infected with the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 strain of IAV (IAV-PR8). Viral entry and propagation were measured through quantitative real-time RT-PCR; production and localization of hemagglutinin (HA) protein in the infected host cells were analysed by Western blots, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy; production of progeny viruses were measured by a hemagglutination assay. Results CTSB-/- macrophages and CA-074Me-treated A549 cells had no defects in incorporating IAV-PR8 virions and permitting viral RNA synthesis. However, these cells produced significantly lower amounts of HA protein and progeny virions than wild-type or untreated cells. Conclusion These data indicate that CTSB is involved in the expression of IAV-PR8 HA protein and subsequent optimal production of IAV-PR8 progeny virions. Targeting CTSB can be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating IAV infection.","Coleman, Macon D; Ha, Soon-Duck; Haeryfar, S M Mansour; Barr, Stephen Dominic; Kim, Sung Ouk",Journal of virology & antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.4172/2324-8955.1000178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29349092/,808
153965,Incidental diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma following coronavirus OC 43 severe pneumonia.,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Various endovascular techniques have been applied to treat blister-like aneurysms. We performed a systematic review to evaluate endovascular treatment for ruptured blister-like aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search and subgroup analyses to compare deconstructive versus reconstructive techniques and flow diversion versus other reconstructive options. RESULTS Thirty-one studies with 265 procedures for ruptured blister-like aneurysms were included. Endovascular treatment was associated with a 72.8% (95% CI, 64.2%-81.5%) mid- to long-term occlusion rate and a 19.3% (95% CI, 13.6%-25.1%) retreatment rate. Mid- to long-term neurologic outcome was good in 76.2% (95% CI, 68.9%-8.4%) of patients. Two hundred forty procedures (90.6%) were reconstructive techniques (coiling, stent-assisted coiling, overlapped stent placement, flow diversion) and 25 treatments (9.4%) were deconstructive. Deconstructive techniques had higher rates of initial complete occlusion than reconstructive techniques (77.3% versus 33.0%, P = .0003) but a higher risk for perioperative stroke (29.1% versus 5.0%, P = .04). There was no difference in good mid- to long-term neurologic outcome between groups, with 76.2% for the reconstructive group versus 79.9% for the deconstructive group (P = .30). Of 240 reconstructive procedures, 62 (25.8%) involved flow-diverter stents, with higher rates of mid- to long-term complete occlusion than other reconstructive techniques (90.8% versus 67.9%, P = .03) and a lower rate of retreatment (6.6% versus 30.7%, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of ruptured blister-like aneurysms is associated with high rates of complete occlusion and good mid- to long-term neurologic outcomes in most patients. Deconstructive techniques are associated with higher occlusion rates but a higher risk of perioperative ischemic stroke. In the reconstructive group, flow diversion carries a higher level of complete occlusion and similar clinical outcomes.","Rouchaud, A; Brinjikji, W; Cloft, H J; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

155276,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and pulmonary tuberculosis: convergence can be fatal.,2020-07-22,"This study has examined the batch binding behaviour of different thermo-responsive co-polymer grafted chromatographic materials under different temperature and protein loading conditions. The effect of molecular composition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-based co-polymers on the phase transition properties has been documented. Sixteen co-polymers of different compositions were synthesized by free radical polymerization methods. Most underwent relatively sharp phase transitions upon application of increasing temperature. However, the value of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) varied due to differences in co-polymer compositions. In general, it was found that the LCST increased for co-polymers containing more hydrophilic moieties, but decreased for co-polymers with more hydrophobic moieties. Moreover, the LCST increased, together with increased width of the transition temperature, when highly branched monomeric moieties (i.e. N‑tert‑octyl groups) were present. When bulky side chains (octadecyl or triphenylmethyl groups) were located in the polymer structures the LCST transition was absent. Based on these findings, 6 thermo-responsive co-polymers of different compositions were individually immobilised onto cross-linked Sepharose 6 Fast Flow by a ""grafting-from"" method. Bovine holo-lactoferrin and bovine holo-transferrin at different concentrations in the range 1-100 mg/mL were then employed as target proteins to evaluate the adsorption behaviour under batch binding conditions with these different polymer grafted Sepharose 6 Fast Flow sorbents at two different temperatures. In general, all sorbents exhibited greater affinity and adsorption capacity for bovine holo-lactoferrin at 50 °C compared to 20 °C. In addition, the affinity and adsorption capacity of bovine holo-lactoferrin with positively charged copolymer grafted Sepharose 6 Fast Flow chromatographic sorbents at 20 °C and 50 °C were much lower than that found for negatively charged copolymer grafted Sepharose 6 Fast Flow sorbents, whilst the opposite trend was found with bovine holo-transferrin due to differences in the surface charge properties of these two proteins, indicative of different separation selectivity. Furthermore, the structure of the side chains present in the grafted copolymer structure was found to affect the adsorption performance of both proteins at 20 °C and 50 °C.","Tan, Sinuo; Campi, Eva M; Boysen, Reinhard I; Saito, Kei; Hearn, Milton T W",Journal of chromatography.

DATA SOURCES The PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar databases were searched systematically from inception to May 2021 by using the search terms ('de-escalation' OR 'switching') AND ('antiplatelet' OR 'clopidogrel' OR 'ticagrelor' OR 'prasugrel') AND ('percutaneous coronary intervention' OR 'PCI'' OR 'Acute coronary syndrome' OR 'ACS'). STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION We included RCTs that reported the primary outcomes, i.e. net clinical benefits and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2 or higher bleeding. A combination of both ischemic and bleeding events was defined as a net clinical benefit. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of four RCTs were included, with 5952 patients. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed that a de-escalation strategy was associated with lower ischemic and bleeding events (net clinical benefits; risk ratio [RR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.85; p = 0.003), and lower BARC type 2 or higher bleeding (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.91; p = 0.02) when compared with a continuation strategy. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE The current guidelines recommend potent P2Y12 prasugrel or ticagrelor for 12 months despite their association with a high risk of bleeding. Our meta-analysis updates cardiologists, providing them with the best available evidence in managing patients with ACS who underwent PCI. CONCLUSION Among patients with ACS treated with PCI, a de-escalation strategy (prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel) is associated with lower ischemic and bleeding events (net clinical benefits) and lower BARC type 2 or higher bleeding; however, due to the limited number of included studies, further high-quality studies are needed to establish the clinical efficacy of the de-escalation strategy.","Abdelazeem, Basel; Shehata, Joseph; Abbas, Kirellos Said; El-Shahat, Nahla Ahmed; Baral, Nischit; Adhikari, Govinda; Khan, Hafiz; Hassan, Mustafa","American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40256-021-00504-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651261/,808

As a result, limited information is available on clinical characteristics, underlying causes, treatment, and outcome of these patients. METHODS We performed a systematic review of individual patient data on triple and quadruple cervical artery dissection (CeAD). We included all cases for whom, at minimum, data on age, sex and affected cervical arteries were available. RESULTS Out of 1396 publications identified in the initial search, 52 were included, with data available on 96 patients. Mean age was 42 years and 66% were women. 63% had triple CeAD. The most common manifestations were headache (69%), neck pain (44%), motor deficit (36%), and Horner syndrome (34%). 57% had an ischemic stroke, in the majority of these patients the stroke was confined to the vascular territory of a single artery. 83% were managed medically (antiplatelets or anticoagulants) and 11% underwent endovascular treatment. An underlying disease or triggering event was identified in 71%, most commonly trauma (35%, cervical manipulative therapy in 13%), infection (18%), fibromuscular dysplasia (16%), and hereditary connective tissue disorder (8%). In-hospital mortality was 1%. 80% of patients had a good functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at follow-up. Two recurrences (3%) were reported. CONCLUSIONS Triple or quadruple CeAD mostly affected young women, and underlying disease or triggering event could be identified in more than two-thirds of patients.

Monoclonal antibodies are powerful tools currently used as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in different clinical contexts but not yet developed for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. In this paper we report the development of the first humanized monoclonal antibody specific for β-1,3 glucans, a vital component of several pathogenic fungi. H5K1 has been tested on C. auris, one of the most urgent threats and resulted efficient both alone and in combination with Caspofungin and Amphotericin B showing an enhancement effect. Our results support further preclinical and clinical developments for the use of H5K1 in the treatment of patients in need.","Di Mambro, Tomas; Vanzolini, Tania; Bruscolini, Pierpaolo; Perez-Gaviro, Sergio; Marra, Emanuele; Roscilli, Giuseppe; Bianchi, Marzia; Fraternale, Alessandra; Schiavano, Giuditta Fiorella; Canonico, Barbara; Magnani, Mauro",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98659-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34593880/,808
661150,Risk factors for Covid-19 in India.,2021-09-14,"Background: Exercise training has been extensively studied in heart failure (HF) and psychological disorders, which has been shown to worsen each other. However, our understanding of how exercise simultaneously protect heart and brain of HF patients is still in its infancy. The purpose of this study was to take advantage of big data techniques to explore hotspots and frontiers of mechanisms that protect the heart and brain simultaneously through exercise training. Methods: We studied the scientific publications on related research between January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2020 from the WoS Core Collection. Research hotspots were assessed through open-source software, CiteSpace, Pajek, and VOSviewer. Big data analysis and visualization were carried out using R, Cytoscape and Origin. Results: From 2003 to 2020, the study on HF, depression, and exercise simultaneously was the lowest of all research sequences (two-way ANOVAs, p < 0.0001). Its linear regression coefficient r was 0.7641. The result of hotspot analysis of related keyword-driven research showed that inflammation and stress (including oxidative stress) were the common mechanisms. Through the further analyses, we noted that inflammation, stress, oxidative stress, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, cell death, and the mechanisms related to mitochondrial biogenesis/homeostasis, could be regarded as the primary mechanism targets to study the simultaneous intervention of exercise on the heart and brain of HF patients with depression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential mechanism targets by which exercise interferes with both the heart and brain for HF patients with depression. We hope that they can boost the attention of other researchers and clinicians, and open up new avenues for designing more novel potential drugs to block heart-brain axis vicious circle.","Wang, Yan; Jia, Yuhong; Li, Molin; Jiao, Sirui; Zhao, Henan",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095256/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.665993,808
674234,Successful surgical repair of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm in a patient with subacute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.,2021-09-24,"Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.","Port, Julia; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Avanzato, Victoria; Schulz, Jonathan; Holbrook, Myndi; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Shaia, Carl; Fischer, Robert; Munster, Vincent",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-753550/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34401871/,808
685505,Common anti-oxidant vitamin C as an anti-infective agent with remedial role on SARS-CoV-2 infection. An update.,2021-07-19,"SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has been spreading rampantly. The global scientific community has responded rapidly to understand immune correlates of protection to develop vaccines and immunotherapeutics against the virus. The major goal of this mini review is to summarize current understanding of the structural landscape of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) glycoprotein. The RBD plays a critical role in the very first step of the virus life cycle. Better understanding of where and how nAbs bind the RBD should enable identification of sites of vulnerability and facilitate better vaccine design and formulation of immunotherapeutics. Towards this goal, we compiled 38 RBD-binding nAbs with known structures. Review of these nAb structures showed that (1) nAbs can be divided into five general clusters, (2) there are distinct non-neutralizing faces on the RBD, and (3) maximum of potentially four nAbs could bind the RBD simultaneously. Since most of these nAbs were isolated from virus-infected patients, additional analyses of vaccine-induced nAbs could facilitate development of improved vaccines.","Niu, Ling; Wittrock, Kathryn N.; Clabaugh, Gage C.; Srivastava, Vikram; Cho, Michael W.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.647934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995366/,808
