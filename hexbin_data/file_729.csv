There have been various research groups that focus on understanding the viruses in terms of their host-viral relationships, pathogenesis and immune evasion. However, with the current advances in the field of science, now the research field has widened up at the ‘omics’ level. Apparently, generation of viral sequence data has been increasing. There are numerous bioinformatics tools available that not only aid in analysing such sequence data but also aid in deducing useful information that can be exploited in developing preventive and therapeutic measures. This chapter elaborates on bioinformatics tools that are specifically designed for animal viruses as well as other generic tools that can be exploited to study animal viruses. The chapter further provides information on the tools that can be used to study viral epidemiology, phylogenetic analysis, structural modelling of proteins, epitope recognition and open reading frame (ORF) recognition and tools that enable to analyse host-viral interactions, gene prediction in the viral genome, etc. Various databases that organize information on animal and human viruses have also been described. The chapter will converse on overview of the current advances, online and downloadable tools and databases in the field of bioinformatics that will enable the researchers to study animal viruses at gene level.","Gautam, Ablesh; Tiwari, Ashish; Malik, Yashpal Singh",Recent Advances in Animal Virology,729,1

In particular, models using attention mechanism such as BERT have shown to have the capability of capturing the contextual information within a sentence or document. However, their ability of capturing the global information about the vocabulary of a language is more limited. This latter is the strength of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). In this paper, we propose VGCN-BERT model which combines the capability of BERT with a Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN). Local information and global information interact through different layers of BERT, allowing them to influence mutually and to build together a final representation for classification. In our experiments on several text classification datasets, our approach outperforms BERT and GCN alone, and achieve higher effectiveness than that reported in previous studies.","Lu, Zhibin; Du, Pan; Nie, Jian-Yun",Advances in Information Retrieval,729,1

LSM has potential to control insecticide resistant, outdoor biting and outdoor resting vectors. Concerns about costs and operational feasibility of implementation of LSM at large scale are among the reasons the strategy is not utilized in many African countries. Involving communities in LSM could increase intervention coverage, reduce costs of implementation and improve sustainability of operations. Community acceptance and participation in community-led LSM depends on a number of factors. These factors were explored under the Majete Malaria Project in Chikwawa district, southern Malawi. METHODS: Separate focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with members from the general community (n = 3); health animators (HAs) (n = 3); and LSM committee members (n = 3). In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with community members. Framework analysis was employed to determine the factors contributing to community acceptance and participation in the locally-driven intervention. RESULTS: Nine FGDs and 24 IDIs were held, involving 87 members of the community. Widespread knowledge of malaria as a health problem, its mode of transmission, mosquito larval habitats and mosquito control was recorded. High awareness of an association between creation of larval habitats and malaria transmission was reported. Perception of LSM as a tool for malaria control was high. The use of a microbial larvicide as a form of LSM was perceived as both safe and effective. However, actual participation in LSM by the different interviewee groups varied. Labour-intensiveness and time requirements of the LSM activities, lack of financial incentives, and concern about health risks when wading in water bodies contributed to lower participation. CONCLUSION: Community involvement in LSM increased local awareness of malaria as a health problem, its risk factors and control strategies. However, community participation varied among the respondent groups, with labour and time demands of the activities, and lack of incentives, contributing to reduced participation. Innovative tools that can reduce the labour and time demands could improve community participation in the activities. Further studies are required to investigate the forms and modes of delivery of incentives in operational community-driven LSM interventions.","Gowelo, Steven; McCann, Robert S.; Koenraadt, Constantianus J.

While in most applications, the FM is defined either by experts or numerically derived through optimization, these approaches are only viable if additional information on the sources is available. When such information is unavailable, as is commonly the case when sources are unknown a priori (e.g., in crowdsourcing), prior work has proposed the extraction of valuable insight (captured within FMs) directly from the evidence or input data by analyzing properties such as specificity or agreement amongst sources. Here, existing agreement-based FMs use established measures of similarity such as Jaccard and Dice to estimate the source agreement. Recently, a new similarity measure based on bidirectional subsethood was put forward to compare evidence, minimizing limitations such as aliasing (where different inputs result in the same similarity output) present in traditional similarity measures. In this paper, we build on this new similarity measure to develop a new instance of the agreement-based FM for interval-valued data. The proposed FM is purposely designed to support aggregation, and unlike previous agreement FMs, it degrades gracefully to an average operator for cases where no overlap between sources exists. We validate that it respects all requirements of a FM and explore its impact when used in conjunction with the Choquet FI for data fusion as part of both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing empirically that it generates robust and qualitatively superior outputs for the cases considered.","Kabir, Shaily; Wagner, Christian",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,729,1

Existing NMODL DSL transpilers lack either essential features to generate optimized code or capability to parse the diversity of existing models in the user community. Our NMODL framework has been tested against a large number of previously published user models and offers high-level domain-specific optimizations and symbolic algebraic simplifications before target code generation. NMODL implements multiple SIMD and SPMD targets optimized for modern hardware. When comparing NMODL-generated kernels with NEURON we observe a speedup of up to 20[Formula: see text], resulting in overall speedups of two different production simulations by [Formula: see text].

In the current study, we automatically extracted acoustic features from live lectures to determine their association with rates of classroom mind-wandering (i.e., lack of student attention). Results indicated that five speech features reliably predicted classroom mind-wandering rates (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio, Formant 1 Mean, Formant 2 Mean, Formant 3 Mean, and Jitter Standard Deviation). These speaker correlates of mind-wandering may be a foundation for developing a system to provide feedback in real-time for lecturers online and in the classroom.

But what happens when ITSs are available to students for voluntary practice? EER-Tutor is a mature ITS which was previously found effective in controlled experiments. Students can use EER-Tutor for tutored problem solving, and there is also a special mode allowing students to develop solutions for the course assignment without receiving feedback. In this paper, we report the observations from two classes of university students using EER-Tutor. In 2018, the system was available for completely voluntary practice. We hypothesized that the students’ pre-existing knowledge and the time spent in EER-Tutor, mediated by the number of attempted EER-Tutor problems, contribute to the students’ scores on the assignment. All but one student used EER-Tutor to draw their assignment solutions, and 77% also used it for tutored problem solving. All our hypotheses were confirmed. Given the found benefits of tutored problem solving, we modified the assignment for the 2019 class so that the first part required students to solve three problems in EER-Tutor (without feedback), while the second part was similar to the 2018 assignment. Our hypothesized model fits the data well and shows the positive relationship between the three set problems on the overall system use, and the assignment scores. In 2019, 98% of the class engaged in tutored problem solving. The 2019 class also spent significantly more time in the ITS, solved significantly more problems and achieved higher scores on the assignment.","Mitrović, Antonija; Holland, Jay",Artificial Intelligence in Education,729,1

This Ventilator is named as DEVEN—DRDO’s Economical Ventilator. DEVEN has features comparable to high-end ventilators and would serve the requirements of a large number of ventilators under the present COVID-19 pandemic situation. Also, DEVEN being a portable ventilator can be used in field application using a portable air compressor and reservoir. Hence, it can be used in an ambulance, any mobile vehicle or for application in any remote/rural area. DEVEN has a micro-controller-operated solenoid valve-based design and is developed by tweaking existing technology being used for hot gas reaction control systems (HRCS), employed in attitude control of exo-atmospheric missiles. HRCS is achieved by actuating solenoid valves through a micro-controller to control the flow of oxidizer as well as fuel. Existing controllers being used for control of electro-mechanical actuators are tweaked for control of the above-mentioned solenoid valves for inspiratory as well as expiratory lines of DEVEN.

Quantitative proteomics studies have been performed on proteins expressed by F. hepatica to investigate the differential expression of proteomes in different growth phases. And the screening of several marker proteins for use as early diagnostic antigens is essential. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was conducted to analyze the differences in the expression of F. hepatica somatic proteins in different growth phases. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) functional annotation, KEGG metabolic pathway, and clustering analyses were also performed. LC-MS/MS identified 629, 2286, 2254, and 2192 proteins in metacercariae, juvenile flukes 28dpi, immature flukes 59dpi, and adult phases, respectively. GO analysis revealed that differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were mainly involved in transport, localization, metabolism, enzyme regulation, protein folding and binding, and nucleoside and nucleotide binding. The DEPs were enriched in cells, intracellular components, organelles, cytoplasm, vesicles, and membranes. KEGG pathway annotation results showed that the DEPs were involved in metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, organismal systems, and other processes.

Thus, immunization with a polyantigen chimeric epitope vaccine may be an effective strategy for protecting poultry from infection with different AIV subtypes. METHODS: Baculovirus has recently emerged as a novel and attractive gene delivery vehicle for animal cells. In the present study, a recombinant baculovirus BmNPV-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT containing a fused codon-optimized sequence (CTLT) of T lymphocyte epitopes from H1HA, H9HA, and H7HA AIV subtypes, and another fused codon-optimized sequence (THB) of Th and B cell epitopes from H1HA, H9HA, and H7HA AIV subtypes, driven by a baculovirus P10 promoter and cytomegalovirus CMV promoter, respectively, was constructed. RESULTS: Western blotting and cellular immunofluorescence demonstrated that the CTLT (THB) can be expressed in rBac-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT-infected silkworm cells (mammalian HEK293T cells). Furthermore, the recombinant virus, rBac-CMV-THB-CTLT, was used to immunize both chickens and mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results of an indirect ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and T lymphocyte proliferation assay indicated that specific humoral and cellular responses were detected in both chicken and mice. These results suggest that rBac-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT can be developed as a potential vaccine against different AIV subtypes.","Yu, Lei; Pan, Jun; Cao, Guangli; Jiang, Mengsheng; Zhang, Yunshan; Zhu, Min; Liang, Zi; Zhang, Xing; Hu, Xiaolong; Xue, Renyu; Gong, Chengliang",Virol J,729,1

Careful management of patient expectations along with open discussion regarding the potential risk of ISP may serve to minimise treatment-related anxieties and, importantly, allow the patient to remain in control of his/her treatment. Other interventions to help minimise ISP include psychological interventions, allowing biologics to reach room temperature prior to injection, using the most suitable injection device for the individual patient and selecting an alternative drug formulation, when available.

On the other hand, change action models have been shown to capture these examples as well as more “exotic” examples of differentiation. However, change action models are very general and do not share the nice properties of a Cartesian differential category. In this paper, we introduce Cartesian difference categories as a bridge between Cartesian differential categories and change action models.

Based on the results of the device fit analysis, the anesthesiology team confidently proceeded with the operation. The approach used and described serves as an example of the advantages available when coupling new technologies to visualize patient anatomy during the procedural planning process.","Kloesel, Benjamin; Juhnke, Bethany; Irvine, Laura; Donadio, James V.; Erdman, Arthur; Belani, Kumar",J Med Syst,729,22

An investigation regarding properties and behavior device has been investigated with the help of Silvaco TCAD. It is observed that Junction less TFET has advantageous over JLFET and TFETdue to the absence of junctions. The proposed device shows reduced short channel effects, lower subthreshold swing along with a higher voltage gain. The detection of the biomolecule is done by varying the gate dielectric constant inside the cavity and different electrical parameters such as electric field, sensing current, threshold voltage and transconductance are observed. The change in the threshold voltage, drain current, transconductance has been used as the sensing metric to detect the sensitivity of the presented device for biomolecule detection. Biomolecule position inside the cavity have been investigated to find out their effect on sensitivity parameter.","Peesa, Rohit Bhargav; Panda, Deepak Kumar",Silicon,729,1

COVID-19 genome sequencing is critical to understanding the virus behavior, its origin, how fast it mutates, and for the development of drugs/vaccines and effective preventive strategies. This paper investigates the use of artificial intelligence techniques to learn interesting information from COVID-19 genome sequences. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is first applied on a computer-understandable corpus of COVID-19 genome sequences to see if interesting hidden patterns can be found, which reveal frequent patterns of nucleotide bases and their relationships with each other. Second, sequence prediction models are applied to the corpus to evaluate if nucleotide base(s) can be predicted from previous ones. Third, for mutation analysis in genome sequences, an algorithm is designed to find the locations in the genome sequences where the nucleotide bases are changed and to calculate the mutation rate. Obtained results suggest that SPM and mutation analysis techniques can reveal interesting information and patterns in COVID-19 genome sequences to examine the evolution and variations in COVID-19 strains respectively.","Nawaz, M.

Sometimes, it is reduced to a list of shared principles such as transparency, non-discrimination, and sustainability; at other times, it is conflated with specific mechanisms for certification of algorithmic solutions or ways to protect the privacy of personal data. We suggest a conceptual and normative approach to AI governance in the context of a global digital public goods ecosystem to enable progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conceptually, we propose rooting this approach in the human capability concept—what people are able to do and to be, and in a layered governance framework connecting the local to the global. Normatively, we suggest the following six irreducibles: a. human rights first; b. multi-stakeholder smart regulation; c. privacy and protection of personal data; d. a holistic approach to data use captured by the 3Ms—misuse of data, missed use of data and missing data; e. global collaboration (‘digital cooperation’); f. basing governance more in practice, in particular, thinking separately and together about data and algorithms. Throughout the article, we use examples from the health domain particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic. We conclude by arguing that taking a distributed but coordinated global digital commons approach to the governance of AI is the best guarantee of citizen-centered and societally beneficial use of digital technologies for the SDGs.","Gill, Amandeep S.; Germann, Stefan",AI Ethics,729,1

We aimed to ascertain the impact of lockdown on the workload of a busy vascular surgical unit. METHOD: Data on all major vascular procedures performed between March 2020 and June 2020 were collected prospectively. Comparison to the same time period over the last 6 years was performed using a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS: 92 major cases were performed, a reduction of 30% compared with cases performed during similar periods (803 cases total, mean 133), with an increased proportion of unplanned & emergency cases(35.9% & 31.5% vs 31.4% & 20.5%). There was a significant reduction in aortic procedures (19 vs mean 36). Despite the reduction in cases there was a similar number of amputations performed (9 vs mean 10). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown period resulted in a 30% reduction in cases performed with far fewer aortic procedure performed and a similar number of amputations. These pending cases will need consideration, especially with critical care capacity to ensure they are completed within a timely period. Considerations for capacity are also pertinent given the approach of winter and the possibility of a second wave.","Nicholls, J; Stewart, C; Coulston, J",Br J Surg,729,5

Therefore, following the sequencing development, bioinformatics researchers have been challenged to implement alignment algorithms for next-generation sequencing reads. However, nowadays selection of aligners based on genome characteristics is poorly studied, so our benchmarking study extended the “state of art” comparing 17 different aligners. The chosen tools were assessed on empirical human DNA- and RNA-Seq data, as well as on simulated datasets in human and mouse, evaluating a set of parameters previously not considered in such kind of benchmarks. As expected, we found that each tool was the best in specific conditions. For Ion Torrent single-end RNA-Seq samples, the most suitable aligners were CLC and BWA-MEM, which reached the best results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, duplication rate, saturation profile and running time. About Illumina paired-end osteomyelitis transcriptomics data, instead, the best performer algorithm, together with the already cited CLC, resulted Novoalign, which excelled in accuracy and saturation analyses. Segemehl and DNASTAR performed the best on both DNA-Seq data, with Segemehl particularly suitable for exome data. In conclusion, our study could guide users in the selection of a suitable aligner based on genome and transcriptome characteristics. However, several other aspects, emerged from our work, should be considered in the evolution of alignment research area, such as the involvement of artificial intelligence to support cloud computing and mapping to multiple genomes.

Although studies have attempted to define “high-volume” days, no standard definition exists. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the frequency of high-volume days, by any definition, is related to the size of an ED. We aimed to determine the correlation between ED size and the frequency of high-volume days for various volume thresholds, and to develop a measure to identify high-volume days. METHODS: We queried retrospective patient arrival data including 1,682,374 patient visits from 32 EDs in 12 states between July 1, 2018–June 30, 2019 and developed linear regression models to determine the correlation between ED size and volume variability. In addition, we performed a regression analysis and applied the Pearson correlation test to investigate the significance of median daily volumes with respect to the percent of days that crossed four volume thresholds ranging from 5–20% (in 5% increments) greater than each site’s median daily volume. RESULTS: We found a strong negative correlation between ED median daily volume and volume variability (R(2) = 81.0%; P < 0.0001). In addition, the four regression models for the percent of days exceeding specified thresholds greater than their daily median volumes had R(2) values of 49.4%, 61.2%, 70.0%, and 71.8%, respectively, all with P < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: We sought to determine whether smaller EDs experience high-volume days more frequently than larger EDs. We found that high-volume days, when defined as days with a count of arrivals at or above certain median-based thresholds, are significantly more likely to occur in lower-volume EDs than in higher-volume EDs. To the extent that EDs allocate resources and plan to staff based on median volumes, these results suggest that smaller EDs are more likely to experience unpredictable, volume-based staffing challenges and operational costs. Given the lack of a standard measure to define a high-volume day in an ED, we recommend 10% above the median daily volume as a metric, for its relevance, generalizability across a broad range of EDs, and computational simplicity.","Nourazari, Sara; Harding, Jonathan W.; Davis, Samuel R.; Litvak, Ori; Traub, Stephen J.; Sanchez, Leon D.",West J Emerg Med,729,1

In the United States, 42% of the population is obese (body mass index (BMI) > 30) and 9.2% is obese class III (BMI > 40). One of the greatest challenges in critically ill patients with obesity is the optimization of mechanical ventilation. The goal of this review is to describe respiratory physiologic changes in patients with obesity and discuss possible mechanical ventilation strategies to improve respiratory function. RECENT FINDINGS Individualized mechanical ventilation based on respiratory physiology after a decremental positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trial improves oxygenation and respiratory mechanics. In a recent study, mortality of patients with respiratory failure and obesity was reduced by about 50% when mechanical ventilation was associated with the use of esophageal manometry and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). SUMMARY Obesity greatly alters the respiratory system mechanics causing atelectasis and prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. At present, novel strategies to ventilate patients with obesity based on individual respiratory physiology showed to be superior to those based on standar universal tables of mechanical ventilation. Esophageal manometry and EIT are essential tools to systematically assess respiratory system mechanics, safely adjust relatively high levels of PEEP, and improve chances for successful weaning.","Kacmarek, Robert M; Wanderley, Hatus V; Villar, Jesús; Berra, Lorenzo",Current opinion in critical care,729,23

Therefore, we created a new surgical technique of combination retroperitoneal with transperitoneal (CRT) laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (LNU) in a single position and here report our early outcomes. Methods From January 2017 to December 2019, a total of 106 patients underwent LNU by a single surgeon at our department, of whom 50 patients underwent standard technique and 56 patients underwent CRT technique. Relevant clinical data were collected including each patient's characteristics, surgical outcomes, and follow-up results. A comparative analysis between standard LNU cases and CRT LNU cases was performed. Results LNU was performed successfully on all 106 patients. There was no significant difference in patients' characteristics. Compared to the standard group, patients in the CRT group had shorter operative time (P=0.001), less estimated blood loss (EBL) (P<0.001), lower visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score (P=0.020) and less scarring (P=0.013). The median time of surgical drain stay decreased from 5 to 2 days (P=0.004) and median hospital stay after surgery decreased from 5 to 3 days (P=0.001). The complication rates did not show statistical differences between the two groups within the first 30 days postoperatively (P=0.263). For the long-term complications, the incidence of abdomen bulge or incisional hernia in the CRT group was less than that in the standard group (P<0.001). Conclusion The CRT technique, which combines both the advantages of retroperitoneal and transperitoneal approaches, is a more minimally invasive, simplified and effective way to perform the LNU.","Song, Liming; Wang, Wenkuan; Zhao, Qinxin; Wen, Yuhong; Zhou, Xiaoguang; Han, Hu; Zhang, Xiaodong",Cancer management and research,729,1

One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together. This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. economic concerns across two decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.'s classic experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming condition. Participants were presented with two casualty-minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100 lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a) economic concerns; b) health concerns; or c) control (no priming). Results showed that in the choice condition, unless primed for economic concerns, health concerns are more prominent. In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all ""preferred"" the cheaper option. These results add further support to the practical relevance of using the proper decision-making modes in times of consequential crises where multiple concerns, interests, and parties are involved.","Maaravi, Yossi; Heller, Ben",F1000Research,729,31

Before-COVID-19, traditional universities had choices in pedagogical practice, which included a variety of teaching delivery modes. Overnight, a single mode of delivery became the only option for traditional higher education institutions. All services migrated to digital platforms, leading to a period of “emergency eLearning”. The full impact of this sudden shift to digital platforms on all cohorts of students is still unclear. A measure of disruption to the normal student learning experience, especially for those attending traditional universities, was inevitable. Moreover, this disruption was varied depending on the University’s country and the country’s lockdown logistics. This international, comparative, quantitative research project investigated and explored higher education students’ perceptions of emergency eLearning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of students at universities in three countries were evaluated in terms of four dimensions: (1) home learning environment, (2) engagement, (3) participation preference, and (4) impact on learning skills. The research revealed significant differences between the participating universities students’ experiences. The most important differences were in the ‘home learning environment’, followed by ‘engagement’ and the perception of ‘impact on learning skills’. The differences in the ‘home learning environment’ can be attributed to the differing economic and digital development of the surveyed countries: South Africa, Wales, and Hungary.

First, some agents cannot afford to stay home to minimize virus exposure. Our results show that poor agents bear most of the epidemic’s health costs. Furthermore, we show that recessions are usually deeper and recoveries are faster when a larger share of agents fail to optimally adjust their behavior during the epidemic. Second, agents develop symptoms heterogeneously. We show that for diseases with a higher share of asymptomatic cases, even when less lethal, health and economic outcomes are worse. For both types of heterogeneity, economic effects are driven by a large share of the agents taking voluntary precautions to minimize virus exposure. Due to this mechanism of voluntary precautions, testing and subsequent quarantining are particularly beneficial in economies with larger shares of poor agents. In contrast, unless a health system collapse is large enough, lockdowns are quite costly for both developing and developed economies.","Dizioli, Allan Pinheiro Roberto",Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,729,1

Design/methodology/approach Based on a extend literature review on CSR, BT and BL studies, the authors evaluate the impact of those construct on SMEs' performance in an emerging market. The paper follows a quantitative approach. In total, 247 responses were collected from 300 samples. The Smart Partial Least Squares SEM (version) was used to analyze the data of the SMEs of Vietnam in the year 2020. Findings The findings revealed significant and positive relationships among the variables in the model, such as CSR and firm performance (FP), CSR and BT, CSR and BL, as well as the mediating effect of BT and BL between CSR and firm performance. Research limitations/implications First, the sample was composed of small business from different segments, thus the respondents' perspective about CSR can differ according the impact of the business on society. Therefore, future studies could address businesses from a single segment to get a deeper understanding of their knowledge and involvement with CSR. Second, a cross-cultural study in emerging countries can be a rich venue for future research. Third, this study was developed through a quantitative approach;thus, the future research can apply qualitative approach or mixed methods to extend the study findings. Practical implications Managerial level of firm should prioritize noneconomic-related CSR;however, those will ultimately drive financial indicators of FP. The result is reasonable because firm simultaneously keeps committed with its stakeholders by delivering the committed qualification, transparency in operation and consistency in communication, environment respect, employee development and social welfare integrated directly into business activities. Those will result in creating love, trust and admiration from stakeholder, customers for brand and firms will get their engagement and support in many ways. This implication suggests that firm should incorporate CSR strategy into their core business activities and practice properly toward its stakeholders. Social implications This study contributes to the CSR literature in emerging context by shedding light on the roles of CSR in FP with the mediation roles of BT and BL. Most CSR studies focused on Western context as developed economy, thus less attention has been paid for emerging economy. While there is increasing interest CSR in Vietnam, traditional culture and its distinctive economic and political structure has had a great influence on CSR in Vietnam. Thus, this study is important and meaningful for business practitioners, investors, shareholders and policymakers toward sustainable development for firms and Vietnam as a whole. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explores the mediating role of BT and BL between CSR and FP for SMEs. The findings of this study may be of great implications to entrepreneurs, top management with respect to strategic perspectives to drive their businesses and to improve their FP in a sustainable direction in contexts of emerging markets. In addition, this finding may be of great interest to motive SMEs' managers to engage with CSR actions where those businesses are situated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. By that understanding, Government may consider for policy reforms/innovation/groundbreaking to leverage businesses to promote their strengths toward sustainable development in the new economic settings. The findings of this study may be of significant contribution to SMEs in Vietnam and in others in emerging economies.","Thanh, T. L.; Ngo, H.

Wherever possible, FYi1s were placed on the specialty and site they were starting on in August, and their buddy would be an FY1 currently working on that specialty. Feedback was obtained at the end of the internship. 16 of the 24 FYi1s responded to the feedback with a mixture of multiple choice and free text responses addressing communication, support, responsibility and the 1:1 buddy scheme.ResultsFeedback from the internship was overwhelmingly positive and used to modify features of the full induction process in August, such as dedicated coffee meetings solely for new starters to share their experiences without senior presence.The buddy system received excellent feedback and gave each FYi1 a personal support mechanism during their first weeks at the trust. Overcrowding on surgical wards was raised as an issue with a proportionally larger number of FYi1s starting on surgical rather than medical specialties volunteering to for the internship.

Healthcare workers are at constant risk of infection. The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in Colombia. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study focused on estimating the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers from 65 hospitals in 10 cities of Colombia during the second semester of 2020. The seroprevalence was determined using an automated immunoassay (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG). The study included a survey to establish the sociodemographic variables and the risk of infection. Results: The global seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 35% (95% Bayesian Confidence Interval 33%-37%). All the personnel reported the use of protective equipment. General services personnel and nurses presented the highest rates of seroprevalence among the healthcare workers. Low socioeconomic strata have shown a strong association with seropositivity. Conclusion: This study shows the occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. Even though, all the personnel reported the use of protective equipment, the seroprevalence in the general services personnel and nurses was high. Also, it was observed a significant difference by city. The results could be used to perform prevention and control in this exposed population. However, further investigation of these is required to inform sources of infection to improve the control and occupational health practices.","Malagon-Rojas, J.

To save mankind from this apocalyptic onslaught, it is essential to curb the fast spreading of this dreadful virus. Moreover, the absence of specialized drugs has made the scenario even more badly and thus an early-stage adoption of necessary precautionary measures would provide requisite supportive treatment for its prevention. The prime objective of this article is to use radiological images as a tool to help in early diagnosis. The interval type 2 fuzzy clustering is blended with the concept of superpixels, and metaheuristics to efficiently segment the radiological images. Despite noise sensitivity of watershed-based approach, it is adopted for superpixel computation owing to its simplicity where the noise problem is handled by the important edge information of the gradient image is preserved with the help of morphological opening and closing based reconstruction operations. The traditional objective function of the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is modified to incorporate the spatial information from the neighboring superpixel-based local window. The computational overhead associated with the processing of a huge amount of spatial information is reduced by incorporating the concept of superpixels and the optimal clusters are determined by a modified version of the flower pollination algorithm. Although the proposed approach performs well but should not be considered as an alternative to gold standard detection tests of COVID-19.

The number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 is relatively small, perhaps due to the lower expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) in children compared to adults. Little is known about foetal impairment in mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2. This paper describes an ongoing scientific project on smell perception in infants. Objective: The goal of the study is to develop and validate a behavioural evaluative scale of olfactory perception in healthy newborns and to apply this scale to newborn children of women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy comparing to newborn children of women without COVID-19 infection history, in order to compare these groups. Methods: This is a retrospective comparative analytical cohort study of 300 newborns exposed and unexposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy. The data collection will follow the experimental procedure in a previous study that explored odours of the maternal breastmilk, vanilla (sweet) and distilled water (neutral). A coffee smell was implemented as an addition to this previous study in order to include acid/bitterness category to the categories of stimuli. Discussion: It is feasible to argue the hypothesis of the involvement of the foetus' olfactory bulb as one of the indelible pathophysiological manifestations to the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 with neurosensory olfactory deficit in foetuses and newborns affected by intrauterine infection. This study aims to investigate if newborn children of women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy have olfactory sensory changes.

The authors have limited knowledge of its impact on mental health. The present study aimed to examine the level and extent of psychological distress of SARS survivors following 1-month recovery, to explore patients' negative appraisals of the impact of SARS, and to evaluate the associations between psychological distress and negative appraisals. METHOD The Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and a newly developed measure, the SARS Impact Scale (SIS), were mailed to 453 Hong Kong Chinese SARS survivors discharged from hospital for 4 weeks or more. RESULTS A total of 425 patients received the questionnaires and 180 (mean age 36.9 years; 120 women) gave valid replies. The response rate was 42.4 %. The participants also represented 13.6 % of all adult survivors in Hong Kong. About 35 % of respondents reported 'moderate to severe' or 'severe' ranges of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. It was found that those working as healthcare workers or having family members killed by SARS were more prone to develop subsequent high levels of distress. Factor analyses extracted three meaningful factors of the SIS, namely 'survival threat', 'physical impact', and 'social impact'. Negative appraisals at the acute phase and 1-month recovery significantly accounted for substantial portions of variances for anxiety and depressive symptoms, after the effects of other psychosocial variables were controlled. CONCLUSIONS Psychological distress of SARS survivors at 1-month recovery is real and significant. Negative appraisals may play a pivotal role in the development of psychological distress for SARS survivors, at least in the short term.","Cheng, S K W; Wong, C W; Tsang, J; Wong, K C",Psychological medicine,729,7

The effect of trypsin was manifested in fixation with formalin, ethanol, methanol, and acetone treated immunofluorescent preparations of cell cultures infected with rota- and adeno-viruses as well as in fixation with acetone of cultures infected with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, and corona virus. Formalin, ethanol, and partly methanol were shown to be unsuitable for the purpose of fixation of cell culture preparations infected with viruses that contained a lipoprotein envelope.

Recent global events including the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic means that human encounter with viruses is increased. Cancer development in individuals with viral infection can take many years after infection, demonstrating that the involvement of viruses in cancer development is a long and complex process. This complexity emanates from individual genetic heterogeneity and the many steps involved in cancer development owing to viruses. The process of tumorigenesis is driven by the complex interaction between several viral factors and host factors leading to the creation of a tumor microenvironment (TME) that is ideal and promotes tumor formation. Viruses associated with human cancers ensure their survival and proliferation through activation of several cellular processes including inflammation, migration, and invasion, resistance to apoptosis and growth suppressors. In addition, most human oncoviruses evade immune detection and can activate signaling cascades including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, Notch and Wnt pathways associated with enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis. This expert review examines and synthesizes the multiple biological factors related to oncoviruses, and the signaling cascades activated by these viruses contributing to viral oncogenesis. In particular, I examine and review the Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomaviruses, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus in a context of cancer pathogenesis. I conclude with a future outlook on therapeutic targeting of the viruses and their associated oncogenic pathways within the TME. These anticancer strategies can be in the form of, but not limited to, antibodies and inhibitors.","Dzobo, Kevin",OMICS,729,1

Ce pays a été frappé par de nombreuses épidémies qui ont engendré une grande létalité des personnes. Le Maroc a connu certaines catastrophes naturelles et épidémies (la peste, le choléra, la famine…) qui ont eu des conséquences extrêmement sévères. Actuellement, la COVID-19 constitue un défi international pour la santé publique. Au Maroc, cette pandémie est devenue un problème de santé majeur. Dans ce cadre, plusieurs actions préventives et curatives ont été mises en place pour faire face à cette pandémie. La réalisation de ces actions nécessite l’utilisation d’un SIG adéquat pour un meilleur suivi de l’évolution de cette pandémie. Pour une analyse spatiale de cette pandémie et vu l’importance de l’information épidémiologique dans la lutte contre la pandémie, le SIG se considère comme outil puissant d’aide à la décision. Le présent travail vise à identifier les zones à risque et leur hiérarchisation en fonction du degré de risque potentiel dès le début de la propagation de la COVID-19 au Maroc du 2 mars 2020 jusqu’au 31 décembre 2020 et à améliorer le système de surveillance épidémiologique à l’aide du SIG. Méthodes Pour réaliser cette étude, nous nous sommes basés sur l’exploitation et l’analyse des données déclarées par le Ministère de la santé Marocain et sur la carte géographique et administrative du Royaume du Maroc. Une analyse spatiale de la COVID-19 a été réalisée à travers ArcGIS 10.8 qui est un logiciel de traitement de l’information géographique. Les données sanitaires concernant les 12 régions du territoire marocain se présentaient dans le nombre des cas de la COVID-19 comme une variable quantitative discrète et dans le temps comme une variable temporelle continue. Résultats D’après les cartes réalisées à l’aide du SIG, il s’avère que la concentration des cas de la COVID-19 dans la région de Casablanca-Settat est la plus forte. Le classement des régions selon les cas enregistrés de la COVID-19 est comme suit : Casablanca-Settat&gt;Rabat-Salé-Kénitra&gt;Tanger-Tétouan-Al Hoceima&gt;Marrakech-Safi&gt;Souss-Massa&gt;L’Oriental&gt;Fès-Meknès&gt;Beni Mellal-Khénifra&gt;Drâa-Tafilalet&gt;Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra&gt;Guelmim-Oued Noun&gt;Dakhla-Oued Eddahab. L’élévation des cas dans les grandes villes est due à plusieurs facteurs, notamment les facteurs démographiques. Ce qui indique qu’il faudrait tenir compte de l’apport de la démographie en santé environnementale. Les facteurs démographiques permettent de comprendre la santé environnementale à partir des données empiriques. La géographie améliore les décisions et la responsabilité en matière de santé. L’intégration du contexte géographique de la propagation de la COVID-19 aide les décideurs à comprendre l’influence du lieu sur la stratégie et les objectifs de la lutte contre cette pandémie. Conclusion L’utilisation du SIG en épidémiologie et plus particulièrement dans l’analyse spatiale de la COVID-19 a permis de bien visualiser la géographie de cette pandémie ;ce qui va contribuer à mieux gérer la situation épidémiologique au Maroc.

This module is based on the alloy of Bismuth Telluride Selenide (Bi2Te3Se), designed in a press tablet form and characterized under solar energy. Here, both aspects of solar energy i.e., light and heat are utilized for both energy production and water heating. The semitransparent PTEC converts heat energy directly to electrical energy due to the gradient of temperature between two electrodes (top and bottom) of thermoelectric cells. The PTEC is 25% transparent, which can be varied according to the necessity of the utilizer. The X-ray diffraction of material and electric characterization of module i.e., open-circuited voltage (VOC) and Seebeck coefficient were performed. The experimental observations disclose that in the proposed PTEC module with an increment in the average temperature (TAvg) from 34 to 60 °C, results in the rise of VOC â¼ 2.4 times. However, by modifying the size of heat-absorbing top electrode and by increasing the temperature gradient through the addition of water coolant under the bottom electrode, an uplift in the champion device results in as increment of VOC â¼5.5 times and Seebeck coefficient obtained was -250 µV/0C, respectively. Results show that not only the selection of material but also the external modifications in the device highly effective the power efficiency of the devices. The proposed modules can generate electric power from light and utilize the penetrating sunlight inside the room and for the heating of the water which also acts as a coolant. These semitransparent thermoelectric cells can be built-in within windows and roofs of buildings and can potentially contribute to green energy harvesting, in situations where movement is restricted locally or globally.","Fatima, Noshin; Karimov, Khasan S; Qasuria, Tahseen Amin; Ibrahim, Mohd Adib",J Alloys Compd,729,14

Fast, accurate, and simple blood-based assays for quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. METHODS: The study included 33 plasma samples from 20 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non-COVID-19 plasma samples. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected by a microfluidic quantitative immunomagnetic assay (IMA) (ViroTrack Sero COVID IgM + IgA/IgG Ab, Blusense Diagnostics) and compared to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (EuroImmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika). RESULTS: Of the 33 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients, 28 were positive for IgA/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA + IgM and 75% IgG by IMA and 80% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 91%. The specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG.

EGCG is a major constituent of brewed green tea, and several studies have reported that EGCG inhibits the enzymatic activity of the coronavirus 3CL protease. Moreover, EGCG has been reported to regulate other potential targets, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the viral spike protein.

RECENT FINDINGS: The syndrome consists of five inter-correlated elements: (a) fear of SARSCoV2 infection and fear of coming into contact with objects or surfaces contaminated with the coronavirus; (b) fear of socio-economic impacts of the pandemic; (c) fear of foreigners for fear that they are infected; (d) pandemic-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking; and (e) pandemic-related traumatic stress symptoms. A severe form of the syndrome, characterized by clinically significant distress and impairment in functioning, is the COVID Stress Disorder, which is regarded as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. Several treatment options exist but further research is needed. Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. The diagnosis of COVID Stress Syndrome should be made only after ruling out other disorders that could potentially account for the pattern of symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. Similar adjustment disorders may arise in future pandemics. Accordingly, understanding the COVID Stress Syndrome may facilitate efforts to understand and treat psychopathology in future pandemics.","Taylor, Steven",Curr Psychiatry Rep,729,21

RESULTS: The average age of 273 COVID-19 patients enrolled with imaging progression were older than those without imaging progression (p = 0.006). The white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and acid glycoprotein were all decreased in imaging progression patients (all p < 0.05), and monocytes were increased (p = 0.025). The parameters including homocysteine, urea, creatinine and serum cystatin C were significantly higher in imaging progression patients (all p < 0.05), while eGFR decreased (p < 0.001). Monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was significantly higher in imaging progression patients compared to that in imaging progression-free ones (p < 0.001). Logistic models revealed that age, MLR, homocysteine and period from onset to admission were factors for predicting imaging progression on chest CT at first week from COVID-19 patients (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Age, MLR, homocysteine and period from onset to admission could predict imaging progression on chest CT from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The primary outcome was imaging progression on chest CT. Baseline parameters were collected at the first day of admission.

We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves. Using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset, a linked dataset combining the 2011 Census with primary care and hospital records and death registrations, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and ï»¿the first part of the second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We estimated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions. The study population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7-376.2] and 166.8 [141.7-191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4-390.1] and 127.1 [91.1-171.3] in men and women) background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves. Between the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes.","Nafilyan, Vahé; Islam, Nazrul; Mathur, Rohini; Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Banerjee, Amitava; Glickman, Myer; Humberstone, Ben; Diamond, Ian; Khunti, Kamlesh",Eur J Epidemiol,729,26

The aim of this study was to assess the possible roles of Jordanian pharmacists in minimizing the stage of community transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using Google forms targeting Jordanian pharmacists was conducted during March 2020 and distributed electronically by means of social media. Using the survey tool, we measured the pharmacists' knowledge, the educative activities they perform, and their perceptions regarding undertaking traditional and untraditional roles during the COVID-19 outbreak, as specified by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). Collected data were analyzed using SPSS version-19. RESULTS: Jordanian pharmacists (n = 449) reported performing various educative activities, and in general, they were knowledgeable about various aspects of the COVID-19 disease (median knowledge score: 20 [range, 13-25]), but certain gaps in knowledge were detected that must be addressed. Pharmacists had positive perceptions about both their traditional and untraditional roles specified by the FIP, the median perceptions score was 4 (range, 1-5). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian pharmacists can be used to reduce community transmission of the outbreak. However, more actions are required to keep pharmacists knowledgeable with recent disease updates to enable them to perform their tasks effectively during times of crisis.","Abdel Jalil, Mariam; Alsous, Mervat M; Abu Hammour, Khawla; Saleh, Mais M; Mousa, Rimal; Hammad, Eman A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,729,24

This research develops a multi-level influence model to explore how cybercriminals are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing situational factors, identifying victims, impersonating trusted sources, selecting attack methods, and employing social engineering techniques. The model extends upon prior work on influence techniques and emotional appeals that cybercriminals employ, by bringing into sharper focus the role of situational factors in COVID-19 related cybercrime attacks. Content and thematic analysis was conducted on 185 distinct COVID-19 cybercrime scam incident documents, including text, images, and photos, provided by a global online fraud and cybersecurity company tracking COVID-19 related cybercrime. The analysis reveals interesting patterns about the sheer breadth and diversity of COVID-19 related cybercrime and how these crimes are continually evolving in response to changing situational factors.

But both research and commercial VR meeting environments typically seek to approximate physical meetings, instead of exploring new capacities of communication and coordination. We argue the most transformative features of VR (and XR more broadly) may look and feel very different from familiar social rituals of physical meetings. Embracing ""weird""forms of sociality and embodiment, we incorporate inspiration from a range of sources including: (1) emerging rituals in commercial social VR, (2) existing research on social augmentation systems for meetings, (3) novel examples of embodied VR communication, and (4) a fictionalized vignette envisioning a future with aspects of ""Weird Social XR""folded into everyday life.

This study aimed to develop an innovative prediction score using clinical and biological parameters (PREDICT score) to anticipate the need of intensive care of COVID-19 patients already hospitalized in standard medical units. Methods: PREDICT score was based on a training cohort and a validation cohort retrospectively recruited in 2020 in the Marseille University Hospital. Multivariate analyses were performed, including clinical, and biological parameters, comparing a baseline group composed of COVID-19 patients exclusively treated in standard medical units to COVID-19 patients that needed intensive care during their hospitalization. Results: Independent variables included in the PREDICT score were: age, Body Mass Index, Respiratory Rate, oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and lactate dehydrogenase. The PREDICT score was able to correctly identify more than 83% of patients that needed intensive care after at least 1 day of standard medical hospitalization. Conclusions: The PREDICT score is a powerful tool for anticipating the intensive care need for COVID-19 patients already hospitalized in a standard medical unit. It shows limitations for patients who immediately need intensive care, but it draws attention to patients who have an important risk of needing intensive care after at least one day of hospitalization.","Gette, Mickael Fernandes Sara Marlinge Marion Duranjou Marine Adi Wijayanto Dambo Maelle Simeone Pierre Michelet Pierre Bruder Nicolas Guieu Regis Fromonot Julien",Biomedicines,729,16

DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review to update and summarise evidence on trends in health expectancies, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-income countries. DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, 1946-19 September 2019; Embase 1980-2019 week 38; Scopus 1966-22 September 2019, Health Management Information Consortium, 1979-September 2019), and the UK Office for National Statistics website (November 2019). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: English language studies published from 2016 that reported trends in healthy, active and/or disability-free life expectancy in an OECD high-income country. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Records were screened independently by two researchers. Study quality was assessed using published criteria designed to identify sources of bias in studies reporting trends, and evidence summarised by narrative synthesis. FINDINGS: Twenty-eight publications from 11 countries were included, covering periods from 6 to 40 years, between 1970 and 2017. In most countries, gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy do not match the growth in total life expectancy. Exceptions were demonstrated for women in Sweden, where there were greater gains in disability-free years than life expectancy. Gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy were greater for men than women in most countries except the USA (age 85), Japan (birth), Korea (age 65) and Sweden (age 77). CONCLUSION: An expansion of disability in later life is evident in a number of high-income countries, with implications for the sustainability of health and care systems.

In this paper, authors explored basic segments of everyday and their subjective perception to what extent sleeping habits, physical inactivity, physical activity, nutritional habits and smoking have changed. METHODS: The online survey was conducted in nine European countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) in 4108 participants, aged 15-82 years. The survey took place 30 to 40 days after WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic state, from April 15th to May 3rd, 2020. RESULTS: The results have shown 30 minutes longer sleeping time, 50% longer physical inactivity time, 65% longer screen time, 43% shorter walking time, 24% shorter sport time and 37% longer physical work time. Additionally, body mass gains (0.3 kg) could be explained in 20.6% with meals sizes, unhealthy food consumption, screen time and sport time. Further, respondents reported more regular meals (44%) and healthier meals with less alcohol consumption and less smoking, which have been positive outcomes of home confinement. CONCLUSION: The findings draw attention to negative changes in everyday praxis (inactivity, body mass gain) after such a short period. Because of possible risk to population's health (especially of countries such as Italy and Spain with serious threat and more stringent measures), findings enable development of recommendations for maintaining healthy lifestyle habits with minimal negative health consequences in similar pandemic circumstances.","Pisot, Sasa; Milovanovic, Ivana; Simunic, Bostjan; Gentile, Ambra; Bosnar, Ksenija; Prot, Franjo; Bianco, Antonino; Lo Coco, Gianluca; Bartoluci, Suncica; Katovic, Darko; Bakalár, Peter; Slancová, Terézia Kovalik; Tlucáková, Lenka; Casals, Cristina; Feka, Kaltrina; Christogianni, Aikaterini; Drid, Patrik",Eur. j. public health,729,16

In this paper, we present the entire architecture and the experience of using the Tel.Te.Covid19 telemedicine platform. Projected for the treatment of chronic diseases, it has been technologically updated for the management of Covid-19 patients with the support of a group of doctors in the territory when the pandemic arrived, introducing new sensors and functionalities (e.g., the familiar use and video calls). In Tuscany (Central Italy), during the first wave of outbreak, a model for enrolling patients was created and tested. Because of the positive results, the latter has been then adopted in the second current wave. The Tel.Te.Covid19 platform has been used by 40 among general practitioners and doctors of continuity care and about 180 symptomatic patients since March 2020. Both patients and doctors have good opinion of the platform, and no hospitalisations or deaths occurred for the monitored patients, reducing also the impact on the National Healthcare System.","Panicacci, S.; Donati, M.; Lubrano, A.; Vianello, A.; Ruiu, A.; Melani, L.; Tomei, A.; Fanucci, L.",Healthcare,729,26

DESIGN: Multicenter case-controlled study. SETTING: Two ICUs in The Netherlands and one in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Thirty-four critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients were compared with 33 healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The microcirculatory parameters quantified included total vessel density (mm × mm-2), functional capillary density (mm × mm-2), proportion of perfused vessels (%), capillary hematocrit (%), the ratio of capillary hematocrit to systemic hematocrit, and capillary RBC velocity (µm × s-1). The number of leukocytes in capillary-postcapillary venule units per 4-second image sequence (4 s-1) and capillary RBC microaggregates (4 s-1) was measured. In comparison with healthy volunteers, the microcirculation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients showed increases in total vessel density (22.8 ± SD 5.1 vs 19.9 ± 3.3; p < 0.0001) and functional capillary density (22.2 ± 4.8 vs 18.8 ± 3.1; p < 0.002), proportion of perfused vessel (97.6 ± 2.1 vs 94.6 ± 6.5; p < 0.01), RBC velocity (362 ± 48 vs 306 ± 53; p < 0.0001), capillary hematocrit (5.3 ± 1.3 vs 4.7 ± 0.8; p < 0.01), and capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio (0.18 ± 0.0 vs 0.11 ± 0.0; p < 0.0001). These effects were present in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores less than 10 but not in patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores greater than or equal to 10. The numbers of leukocytes (17.6 ± 6.7 vs 5.2 ± 2.3; p < 0.0001) and RBC microaggregates (0.90 ± 1.12 vs 0.06 ± 0.24; p < 0.0001) was higher in the microcirculation of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Receiver-operating-characteristics analysis of the microcirculatory parameters identified the number of microcirculatory leukocytes and the capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio as the most sensitive parameters distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 patients from healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The response of the microcirculation to coronavirus disease 2019-induced hypoxemia seems to be to increase its oxygen-extraction capacity by increasing RBC availability. Inflammation and hypercoagulation are apparent in the microcirculation by increased numbers of leukocytes and RBC microaggregates.","Favaron, Emanuele; Ince, Can; Hilty, Matthias P; Ergin, Bülent; van der Zee, Philip; Uz, Zühre; Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Hofmaenner, Daniel A; Acevedo, Claudio T; van Boven, Wim Jan; Akin, Sakir; Gommers, Diederik; Endeman, Henrik",Crit. care med,729,1

Different countries implemented their own combinations of NPIs to prevent local epidemics and healthcare system overloaded. Portfolios, as temporal sets of NPIs have various systemic impacts on preventing cases in populations. Here, we developed a probabilistic modeling framework to evaluate the effectiveness of NPI portfolios at the macroscale. We employed a deconvolution method to back-calculate incidence of infections and estimate the effective reproduction number by using the package EpiEstim. We then evaluated the effectiveness of NPIs using ratios of the reproduction numbers and considered them individually and as a portfolio systemically. Based on estimates from Japan, we estimated time delays of symptomatic-to-confirmation and infection-to-confirmation as 7.4 and 11.4 days, respectively. These were used to correct surveillance data of other countries. Considering 50 countries, risk communication and returning to normal life were the most and least effective yielding the aggregated effectiveness of 0.11 and - 0.05 that correspond to a 22.4% and 12.2% reduction and increase in case growth. The latter is quantified by the change in reproduction number before and after intervention implementation. Countries with the optimal NPI portfolio are along an empirical Pareto frontier where mean and variance of effectiveness are maximized and minimized independently of incidence levels. Results indicate that implemented interventions, regardless of NPI portfolios, had distinct incidence reductions and a clear timing effect on infection dynamics measured by sequences of reproduction numbers. Overall, the successful suppression of the epidemic cannot work without the non-linear effect of NPI portfolios whose effectiveness optimality may relate to country-specific socio-environmental factors.","Chan, Louis Yat Hin; Yuan, Baoyin; Convertino, Matteo",Sci Rep,729,16

To address this issue, SMP foams are synthesized using the monomer diethanolamine (DEA) in place of triethanolamine (TEA) to provide improved mechanical properties for medical device applications. Mechanical testing and micro-fracture analysis were performed on DEA and TEA foams. DEA foams show improved toughness and reduced micro-fractures compared to the control.

We assessed whether lockdown measures, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, differentially affect perceived stress, body weight, exercise and related this to glycemic control in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a short-term observational cohort study at the Leiden University Medical Center. People with type 1 and type 2 diabetes &#8805;18 years were eligible to participate. Participants filled out online questionnaires, sent in blood for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) analysis and shared data of their flash or continuous glucose sensors. HbA1c during the lockdown was compared with the last known HbA1c before the lockdown. RESULTS: In total, 435 people were included (type 1 diabetes n=280, type 2 diabetes n=155). An increase in perceived stress and anxiety, weight gain and less exercise was observed in both groups. There was improvement in glycemic control in the group with the highest HbA1c tertile (type 1 diabetes: -0.39% (-4.3 mmol/mol) (p<0.0001 and type 2 diabetes: -0.62% (-6.8 mmol/mol) (p=0.0036). Perceived stress was associated with difficulty with glycemic control (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in perceived stress and anxiety, weight gain and less exercise but no deterioration of glycemic control occurs in both people with relatively well-controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes during short-term lockdown measures. As perceived stress showed to be associated with glycemic control, this provides opportunities for healthcare professionals to put more emphasis on psychological aspects during diabetes care consultations.","Ruissen, Merel M; Regeer, Hannah; Landstra, Cyril P; Schroijen, Marielle; Jazet, Ingrid; Nijhoff, Michiel F; Pijl, Hanno; Ballieux, Bart E P B; Dekkers, Olaf; Huisman, Sasja D; de Koning, Eelco J P",,729,32

Suzuki had established the Suzuki Company of Toga (SCOT) in 1976, making a secluded mountainous landscape of Japan its home to this day. Bogart's venture in the United States, although inspired by Suzuki's model of a production-based troupe of high artistic standards that, at the same time, developed its unique training methods, by no means merely duplicates its predecessor. In this Covid Conversation, Bogart briefly maps a segment of SITI's history, reflecting on the company's inter-arts endeavours with differing dance idioms and its engagement with Greek tragedy. She discusses the effects of the Covid pandemic on her troupe, also interrupting its performances of The Bacchae at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis. Her most recent opera production, Tristan and Isolde, was closed for the same reason at the Croatian National Theatre – a key work in her portfolio of nineteenth-century grand opera as well as contemporary avant-garde opera. An acclaimed theatre director, Anne Bogart runs and teaches the Graduate Directing Programme at Columbia University in New York. At the SITI summer school in Saratoga, she and the company have workshopped the Viewpoints method that she has elaborated from Mary Overlie's six principles for theatre and dance training. Bogart's international workshops have further developed her method. She is the author of A Director Prepares (Routledge, 2001) and of many influential books that include (with Tina Landau) The Viewpoints Book (Theatre Communications Group, 2004).

In terms of breast cancer care, this has led to a restricted provision of reconstruction with autologous free tissue transfer. A primary concern is the risk of mortality in elective surgery patients who develop COVID-19. The aim of this report is to describe the observed physiological impact of the virus on our patient, and to address how outpatient care after autologous free tissue transfer can be delivered to COVID-19 positive patients. In March 2020, we performed a bilateral breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap and a superficial inferior epigastric perforator flap. The patient became symptomatic on day three post-operatively, tested positive for COVID-19 and was discharged home. Drain and dressing management was continued through the use of telemedicine. Two weeks following the operation, a breast seroma formed that was drained semi-electively in the COVID-19 positive area of the Emergency Department. The patient visited the dressing clinic twice in total and healed after three weeks. Despite undergoing complex surgery and having pre-operative chemotherapy, our patient suffered a mild form of the virus limited to upper respiratory symptoms. Physiologically we did not see any significant difference to that of the normal post-operative course. This case demonstrates the possibility of managing autologous breast reconstruction patients using telemedicine. Although COVID-19 can complicate, or even be fatal, in the perioperative course, our patient thankfully suffered no discernable negative outcome from her infection.","Sharp, O; Masud, D",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,729,10

Guidelines around surgeries were well arranged: clear for 98% concerning triage with no difference between T and C; clear for 84% concerning pre-operative screening and for 81% concerning surgical dressing with a significance difference between T and C in understanding (p=0.07 and p=0.06). Forty-two respondents (48%) tested all surgical patients and the 20% operated patients positive for COVID-19. Thirteen (15%) were relocated to work in other divisions on different tasks, 12 were C. 86% of T did not participate in surgeries as much as before. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the pandemic has been very significant for pediatric urologists and the difference between C and T confirm that the training could be impacted. After the first wave we should be careful on PPE, on pre-operative screening of surgical patients and we should protect the trainee learning curve.","Mariani, Aurora; Tiryaki, Sibel; Harms, Mirjam; Orlov, Vladimir; Enache, Tudor; Bidault-Jourdainne, Valeska; Waterschoot, Mieke; Faraj, Sebastien; Lammers, Rianne J",,729,13

However, how patients with CeD perceive their COVID-19 risk may differ from their actual risk. AIM: To investigate risk perceptions of contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD and determine the factors that may influence their perception. METHODS: We distributed a survey throughout 10 countries between March and June 2020 and collected data on demographics, diet, COVID-19 testing, and risk perceptions of COVID-19 in patients with CeD. Participants were recruited through various celiac associations, clinic visits, and social media. Risk perception was assessed by asking individuals whether they believe patients with CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to the general population. Logistic regression was used to determine the influencing factors associated with COVID-19 risk perception, such as age, sex, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and comorbidities such as cardiac conditions, respiratory conditions, and diabetes. Data was presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: A total of 10737 participants with CeD completed the survey. From them, 6019 (56.1%) patients with CeD perceived they were at a higher risk or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the non-CeD population. A greater proportion of patients with CeD perceived an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to infections in general due to their CeD (56.1% vs 26.7%, P < 0.0001). Consequently, 34.8% reported taking extra COVID-19 precautions as a result of their CeD. Members of celiac associations were less likely to perceive an increased risk of COVID-19 when compared to non-members (49.5% vs 57.4%, P < 0.0001).

CONCLUSION: Overall, high levels of risk perceptions, such as those found in patients with CeD, may increase an individual's pandemic-related stress and contribute to negative mental health consequences. Therefore, it is encouraged that public health officials maintain consistent communication with the public and healthcare providers with the celiac community.

This ecological time-series study was conducted in Imperatriz, Maranhão, Brazil. Leprosy cases diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 were included. Detection rates stratified by sex and age groups were estimated. The study of temporal trends was accomplished using the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition method and temporal modeling of detection rates using linear seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model according to Box and Jenkins method. Trend forecasts were performed for the 2017-2020 period. A total of 3,212 cases of leprosy were identified, the average incidence among men aged between 30 and 59 years old was 201.55/100,000 inhabitants and among women in the same age group was 135.28/100,000 inhabitants. Detection rates in total and by sex presented a downward trend, though rates stratified according to sex and age presented a growing trend among men aged less than 15 years old and among women aged 60 years old or over. The final models selected in the time-series analysis show the forecasts of total detection rates and rates for men and women presented a downward trend for the 2017-2020 period. Even though the forecasts show a downward trend in Imperatriz, the city is unlikely to meet a significant decrease of the disease burden by 2020.","Ramos, Antônio Carlos Vieira; Gomes, Dulce; Santos Neto, Marcelino; Berra, Thaís Zamboni; de Assis, Ivaneliza Simionato; Yamamura, Mellina; Crispim, Juliane de Almeida; Martoreli Júnior, José Francisco; Bruce, Alexandre Tadashi Inomata; Dos Santos, Felipe Lima; Souza, Ludmilla Leidianne Limirio; Alves, Yan Mathias; de Andrade, Hamilton Leandro Pinto; Arcoverde, Marcos Augusto Moraes; Pieri, Flávia Meneguetti; Arcêncio, Ricardo Alexandre",PLoS One,729,2

Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are employed to conduct prediction of development of the epidemic. According to different epidemic response measures, i.e., mitigation measures, suppression measures, medical treatment, evolutionary trend of epidemic situation under the initial population distribution structure are discussed. Results show that the control effects of different response measures on the number of deaths depend on the timing of the implementation of the measures. For mitigation response measures, the timing of the implementation of the measures has no obvious effect on the final epidemic, while for suppression response measures, the effect of suppression response measures in the early stage of the epidemic is significantly better than that in the middle and late stage of the epidemic development. Furthermore, no matter which stage the epidemic is in, the improvement of medical treatment level will play an important role in effectively reducing mortality.

Any disturbance in the regulation process can lead to neurological developmental diseases, such as autism and schizophrenia. Histone variants are important components of epigenetic regulation. The function and mechanisms of the macroH2A (mH2A) histone variant during brain development are unknown. Here, we show that deletion of the mH2A isoform mH2A1.2 interferes with neural stem cell differentiation in mice. Deletion of mH2A1.2 affects neurodevelopment, enhances neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, and reduces NPC differentiation in the developing mouse brain. mH2A1.2-deficient mice exhibit autism-like behaviors, such as deficits in social behavior and exploratory abilities. We identify NKX2.2 as an important downstream effector gene and show that NKX2.2 expression is reduced after mH2A1.2 deletion and that overexpression of NKX2.2 rescues neuronal abnormalities caused by mH2A1.2 loss. Our study reveals that mH2A1.2 reduces the proliferation of neural progenitors and enhances neuronal differentiation during embryonic neurogenesis and that these effects are at least in part mediated by NKX2.2. These findings provide a basis for studying the relationship between mH2A1.2 and neurological disorders.","Ma, Hongyan; Su, Libo; Xia, Wenlong; Wang, Wenwen; Tan, Guohe; Jiao, Jianwei",EMBO Rep,729,16

This virus is transmitted by air and, therefore, clinical practices with the production of contaminant aerosols are highly at risk. The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness of bio-inspired systems, as adjuvants to nonsurgical periodontal therapy, in order to formulate bio-inspired protocols aimed at restoring optimal condition, reducing bacteremia and aerosols generation. METHODS: A comprehensive and bibliometric review of articles published in English. Research of clinical trials (RCTs) were included with participants with chronic or aggressive periodontal disease, that have compared benefits for nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). RESULTS: Seventy-four articles have been included. For probing depth (PPD) there was a statically significant improvement in laser, probiotic, chlorhexidine groups, such as gain in clinical attachment level (CAL). Bleeding on probing (BOP) reduction was statistically significant only for probiotic and chlorhexidine groups. There were changes in microbiological and immunological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The use of bio-inspired systems in nonsurgical periodontal treatment may be useful in reducing risk of bacteremia and aerosol generation, improving clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters, of fundamental importance in a context of global pandemic, where the reduction of bacterial load in aerosols becomes a pivotal point of clinical practice, but other clinical trials are necessary to achieve statistical validity.","Butera, Andrea; Maiorani, Carolina; Natoli, Valentino; Bruni, Ambra; Coscione, Carmen; Magliano, Gaia; Giacobbo, Giulia; Morelli, Alessia; Moressa, Sara; Scribante, Andrea",,729,15

As the curve progresses and patients are discharged, the rehabilitation wave brings a high number of postacute COVID-19 patients suffering from physical, mental, and cognitive impairments threatening their return to normal life. The complexity and severity of disease in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection require an approach that is implemented as early in the recovery phase as possible, in a concerted and systematic way. To address the rehabilitation wave, we describe a spectrum of interventions that start in the intensive care unit and continue through all the appropriate levels of care. This approach requires organized rehabilitation teams including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, rehabilitation psychologists or neuropsychologists, and physiatrists collaborating with acute medical teams. Here, we also discuss administrative factors that influence the provision of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The services that can be provided are described in detail to allow the reader to understand what services may be appropriate locally. We have been learning and adapting real time during this crisis and hope that sharing our experience facilitates the work of others as the pandemic evolves. It is our goal to help reduce the potentially long-lasting challenges faced by COVID-19 survivors.","Kim, Soo Y; Kumble, Sowmya; Patel, Bhavesh; Pruski, April D; Azola, Alba; Tatini, Anisa L; Nadendla, Kavita; Richards, Laryssa; Keszler, Mary S; Kott, Margaret; Friedman, Michael; Friedlander, Tracy; Silver, Kenneth; Hoyer, Erik H; Celnik, Pablo; Lavezza, Annette; González-Fernández, Marlís",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,729,16

That article notes the vulnerabilities of people in these informal settlements and argues that any assistance program must recognize these realities so that the policies do not further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the population of these communities. This note extends the arguments in that paper, focusing on some of the logistic issues involved in providing assistance to informal settlements. It argues that such assistance is essential not only for the help it would provide to people in these settlements but also because the residents of these communities should be key targets of assistance. Because of the location and occupation of most of the residents of these communities, targeting them simultaneously addresses health and economy-wide concerns generated by COVID-19. Their characteristics make them much more likely to be afflicted by the virus and spread it to others. The main conclusions of this note with respect to policy are that the scale of such assistance is likely to be larger than has so far been proposed, that in countries with limited testing ability slums provide one of the most effective places to target assistance, that the role of community groups in providing the assistance is difficult to exaggerate, and that philanthropy has a role to play in supporting innovation.","Buckley, Robert M",J Urban Health,729,1

None considered the significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on adverse outcomes. We aimed to clarify the prognostic role of NTIS among predominantly mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: A prospective study of COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Consecutive adults admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for confirmed COVID-19 from July to December 2020 were prospectively recruited. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was represented by cycle threshold (Ct) values from real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the respiratory specimen on admission. Serum TSH, free thyroxine and free T3 were measured on admission. The outcome was deterioration in clinical severity, defined as worsening in &#8805;1 category of clinical severity according to the Chinese National Health Commission guideline. RESULTS: We recruited 367 patients. At baseline, 75.2% had mild disease, and 27 patients (7.4%) had NTIS. Fifty-three patients (14.4%) had clinical deterioration. Patients with NTIS were older, had more comorbidities, worse symptomatology, higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and worse profiles of inflammatory and tissue injury markers. They were more likely to have clinical deterioration (p < .001). In multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis, NTIS independently predicted clinical deterioration (adjusted odds ratio 3.19, p = .017), in addition to Ct value <25 (p < .001), elevated C-reactive protein (p = .004), age >50 years (p = .011) and elevated creatine kinase (p = .017). CONCLUSIONS: Non-thyroidal illness syndrome was not uncommon even in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. NTIS on admission could predict clinical deterioration in COVID-19, independent of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, age and markers of inflammation and tissue injury.","Lui, David Tak Wai; Lee, Chi Ho; Chow, Wing Sun; Lee, Alan Chun Hong; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Fong, Carol Ho Yi; Law, Chun Yiu; Leung, Eunice Ka Hong; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng; Woo, Yu Cho; Lam, Ching Wan; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lam, Karen Siu Ling",Clin. endocrinol,729,23

To minimize negative effects, the parallels, lessons, and resources from existing public health programs need to be identified and used. Often underappreciated synergies relating to COVID-19 are with tuberculosis (TB). COVID-19 and TB share commonalities in transmission and public health response: case finding, contact identification, and evaluation. Data supporting interventions for either disease are, understandably, vastly different, given the diseases' different histories. However, many of the evolving issues affecting these diseases are increasingly similar. As previously done for TB, all aspects of congregate investigations and preventive and therapeutic measures for COVID-19 must be prospectively studied for optimal evidence-based interventions.

Some countries issued government bonds with interests payments tackled to GDP rates of growth. Emission of such bonds usually not taking into account the wave shape of GDP growth curve. After shock slide down of economy, usually high rates of growth are observed. Despite the fact that the economy may not have recovered even pre-crisis level, but payments on such bonds should be exercised. This situation takes place in the modern world economic space, when the economies of countries as a result of the ""coronavirus crisis"" can demonstrate a rapid decline with further significant growth. At the same time, it is almost impossible to predict both the duration and depth of decline and growth of economies. In addition, the set of some ratios for the some economy parameters estimations is based on GDP level. Among them monetization and credit saturation of economy. However, they may not reflect the real level of fiscal potential of the country due to stock market capacity, technological progress, cryptocurrency development, shadow part of economy, social stability, environment protection and other factors. Groupes of scientists try to invent new indicators, which may correct GDP weaknesses or, at least, help to create more realistic and more comprehensive picture of a country socio-economic development. The purpose of the article is to study the indicator of GDP and other indicators, that may objectively determine the level of a country development. Based on the analysis of the IMF data on 264 countries over 10 years, the lack of correlation between the level of monetization and creditization of GDP and its dynamics was reviled, although such dependence should have been direct. This gave us the opportunity to assume that the GDP indicator does not fully characterize the development and socio-economic state of the country. It contains components that have no direct connection with the development of the economy. At the same time, the modern economic development acquires qualitative features to replace the quantitative characteristics on which the GDP calculation is based. Such qualitative aspects of development include digitization of societies, ecology, social security, product quality, not its quantity. They must be taken into account when determining the socio-economic level of development of countries.","Savluk, S.; Arzhevitin, S.",Financial and Credit Activity-Problems of Theory and Practice,729,5

Several studies show that air quality has improved during the lockdown in a variety of places, especially in big cities, but there are fewer studies on water quality parameters. Recent studies, using satellite images, show there are improvements in the water quality of lakes and bays due to less traffic and industrial activities. In this study, with the collaboration of two high schoolers, we want to find rivers with dissolved oxygen data, in the Great Lakes region, and compare the period of lockdown with the same period of time in 2019.

The swabs were stored at room temperature (20-25°C), then divided into aliquots and subjected to different temperature for different periods in order to inactivate the viruses (56°C for 30, 45, 60 min; 65, 70, 80°C for 10, 15, 20 min). Control aliquots were stored at room temperature for 60 min. Then all aliquots were tested in a real-time fluorescence PCR using primers against SARS-CoV-2. Regardless of inactivation temperature and time, 7 of 12 cases (58.3%) tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, and cycle threshold values were similar. These results suggest that virus inactivation parameters exert minimal influence on PCR test results.

Additionally, the prevalence among children who started EC within 12 months after birth and those who never engaged in EC was 1.36% and 15.71% respectively. Early introduction of EC and weaning of DD usage has a positive correlation with lower prevalence of BBD in children in China.","Xu, Peng Chao; Wang, Yi He; Meng, Qing Jun; Wen, Yi Bo; Yang, Jing; Wang, Xi Zheng; Chen, Yan; He, Yu Lin; Wang, Qing Wei; Wang, Yan; Cui, Lin Gang; Sihoe, Jennifer D; Franco, Israel; Lang, Jing He; Wen, Jian Guo",Sci Rep,729,20

Indeed, neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have already been reported and highlight the relevance of considering the neurological impact of coronavirus (CoV) from a translational perspective. Animal models of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by structurally similar CoVs during the 2002 and 2012 epidemics, have provided valuable data on nervous system involvement by CoVs and the potential for central nervous system spread of SARS-CoV-2. One key finding that may unify these pathogens is that all require angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cell entry receptor. The CoV spike glycoprotein, by which SARS-CoV-2 binds to cell membranes, binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 with a higher affinity compared with SARS-CoV. The expression of this receptor in neurons and endothelial cells hints that SARS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared with previous CoVs. However, it remains to be determined how such invasiveness might contribute to respiratory failure or cause direct neurological damage. Both direct and indirect mechanisms may be of relevance. Clinical heterogeneity potentially driven by differential host immune-mediated responses will require extensive investigation. Development of disease models to anticipate emerging neurological complications and to explore mechanisms of direct or immune-mediated pathogenicity in the short and medium term is therefore of great importance. In this brief review, we describe the current knowledge from models of previous CoV infections and discuss their potential relevance to COVID-19.","Natoli, S; Oliveira, V; Calabresi, P; Maia, L F; Pisani, A",Eur. j. neurol,729,22

METHODS: A survey was disseminated to DBP clinicians through contact with international professional organizations to determine the use of telehealth in DBP care, before and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics and &#967;2 tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 271 respondents from 38 countries completed the survey. The number of respondents offering telehealth increased from 36% to 88% after the pandemic, with the greatest shift to telehealth among high-income countries (HICs). Among respondents using telehealth, 75.1% were conducting interactive video visits, with HICs using more telehealth modalities embedded in electronic health records. Most patients (98.7%) were at home for the telehealth encounter. Almost half (46.5%) could not include an interpreter in telehealth visits. Barriers reported by telehealth users included concerns about limited patient access to technology (74.3%), home environment distractions (56.5%), preference for in-person care (53.6%), telehealth effectiveness (48.1%), workflow efficiency (42.2%), and cost/reimbursement (32.1%). CONCLUSION: Global DBP clinicians rapidly adopted telehealth and continued to have interprofessional practice while doing so, with the largest adoption occurring in HICs. Provider concerns about effectiveness and patient access to technology emerged as key organizational and patient barriers, respectively. Increased provider confidence in telehealth and its sustained use in the future depends on supportive regulatory policies and availability and use of measures to monitor quality and effectiveness.","Srinivasan, Roopa; Wallis, Kate E; Soares, Neelkamal",J. dev. behav. pediatr,729,5

However, several problems/challenges have been reported in different processes of e-learning that need to be addressed for effective use of e-learning. These problems/challenges include development of student focused contents, giving learner partial control, addressing different learning styles, etc. Recently, several efforts have been made to solve e-learning process problems using dynamic programming techniques. Dynamic programming techniques divide a problem situation into several subproblems and dynamically solves each sub-problem based on student needs. Thus it allows student focused customization at each step and provides adaptive e-learning to support students with different capabilities. The objective of this study is to review different e-learning problems and challenges and how those can be addressed using dynamic programming techniques.

We draw several conclusions about ACP in the context of infectious diseases: interpersonal and sociostructural barriers to ACP are high; ACP is not well-oriented toward decision-making for treatment of an acute illness; and the U.S. health care system is not well positioned to fulfill patients' end of life preferences in a pandemic.

An often-overlooked capability of this approach is the opportunity to examine the electronic evolution of a chemical system. For AIMD trajectories based on Hartree-Fock or density functional theory methods, the real-time evolution of single-particle molecular orbitals (MOs) can provide detailed insights into the time-dependent electronic structure of molecules. The evolving electronic Hamiltonians at each MD step pose problems for tracking and visualizing a given MO's character, ordering, and associated phase throughout an MD trajectory, however. This report presents and assesses a simple algorithm for correcting these deficiencies by exploiting similarity projections of the electronic structure between neighboring MD steps. Two aspects bring this analysis beyond a simple step-to-step projection scheme. First, the challenging case of coincidental orbital degeneracies is resolved via a quadrupole-field perturbation that nonetheless rigorously preserves energy conservation. Second, the resulting orbitals are shown to evolve adiabatically, in spite of the ""preservation of character"" concept that undergirds a projection of neighboring steps' MOs. The method is tested on water clusters, which exhibit considerable dynamic degeneracies, as well as a classic organic nucleophilic substitution reaction, in which the adiabatic evolution of the bonding orbitals clarifies textbook interpretations of the electronic structure during this reactive collision.","Zhanserkeev, Asylbek A; Talbot, Justin J; Steele, Ryan P",J. chem. theory comput.

Normally consisting of cholesterol or lipid tails, the end group is replaced in this study by a photoresponsive polymer that partitions into lipid bilayers at physiological pH. When exposed to UV light, it undergoes excited state proton transfer with water. The ensuing increase in polarity increases the solubility of the polymer in the aqueous phase.

While impacts are of a global magnitude, they have been felt at the most local of levels. Across the world pupils’ daily lives and experiences have been directly impacted by government-imposed measures and restrictions taken to address the pandemic. Existing research on the teaching of primary geography in Ireland, although both dated and limited, indicates the prevalence of didactic, textbook-based methods involving rote-learning. This points to a policy-practice gap whereby teaching methods are not aligned with those advocated by the curriculum. Primary teachers and student primary teachers have been found to hold knowledge-based encyclopaedic images of geography, failing to recognise the subject’s relevance to the real-world lived experiences of pupils. This paper frames the Covid-19 as an authentic learning experience that can form the foundation for effective geography education. Pupils learn best and are more motivated to engage in a problem or issue that affects them or that they are connected to. By investigating Covid-19 through geography in the primary classroom, this paper argues that both pupils and teachers can recognise the relevance of geography to their lives and the wider world.

However, the spread of the virus has been uneven in both prevalence and speed of propagation. We analyse the association of social, economic, and demographic factors in the initial spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 across 23 European countries between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Diagnosed COVID-19 cases from Johns Hopkins University and data from the European Social Survey and other sources were used to estimate bivariate associations between cumulative reported case numbers at ten-day intervals and nine social, demographic, and economic variables. To avoid overfitting, we first reduce these variables to three factors by factor analysis before conducting a multiple regression analysis. We also perform a sensitivity analysis using rates and new cases between two time periods. Results showed that social and economic factors are strongly and positively associated with COVID-19 throughout the studied period, while the association with population density and cultural factors was initially low, but by April, was higher than the earlier mentioned factors. For future influenza-like pandemics, implementing strict movement restrictions from early on will be crucial to curb the spread of such diseases in economically, socially, and culturally vibrant and densely populated countries.

The mixed method procedure was followed in the study. In the quantitative dimension, the survey model was used in order to reveal the smartphone usage status of the teacher candidates, while in the qualitative dimension, the phenomenology model was used to determine their perceptions about the smartphone. The sample of the study consisted of 45 teacher candidates studying in the faculty of education at a state university located in Turkey's Aegean region during the 2020-2021 fall semester. The data of the study were collected by the researcher with a questionnaire form created by taking the literature review and expert opinion. The quantitative data collected within the scope of the research were subjected to statistical analysis. The metaphors collected in qualitative dimension were analyzed with content analysis. Research findings indicated that the teacher candidates were generally aware of the technical features of their personal phones. On the other hand, it has been determined that they are indecisive in controlling themselves about their phone usage, being dependent on their phones and being aware of their phone time. It has been observed that the teacher candidates produced metaphors for their smart phones that point to the themes of ""addiction, functionality, correct use, having a happy time, socialization/communication and other.""

We examined the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol samples and on environmental surfaces in a hospital designated for treating severe COVID-19 patients. Aerosol samples were collected by a microbial air sampler, and environmental surfaces were sampled using sterile premoistened swabs at multiple sites. Ninety surface swabs and 135 aerosol samples were collected. Only two swabs, sampled from the inside of a patient's mask, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. All other swabs and aerosol samples were negative for the virus.

The world is now immobilized by this infectious RNA virus. As of June 15, already more than 7.9 million people have been infected and 432k people died. This RNA virus has the ability to do the mutation in the human body. Accurate determination of mutation rates is essential to comprehend the evolution of this virus and to determine the risk of emergent infectious disease. This study explores the mutation rate of the whole genomic sequence gathered from the patient's dataset of different countries. The collected dataset is processed to determine the nucleotide mutation and codon mutation separately. Furthermore, based on the size of the dataset, the determined mutation rate is categorized for four different regions: China, Australia, the United States, and the rest of the World. It has been found that a huge amount of Thymine (T) and Adenine (A) are mutated to other nucleotides for all regions, but codons are not frequently mutating like nucleotides. A recurrent neural network-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model has been applied to predict the future mutation rate of this virus. The LSTM model gives Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.06 in testing and 0.04 in training, which is an optimized value. Using this train and testing process, the nucleotide mutation rate of 400 thpatient in future time has been predicted. About 0.1% increment in mutation rate is found for mutating of nucleotides from T to C and G, C to G and G to T. While a decrement of 0.1% is seen for mutating of T to A, and A to C. It is found that this model can be used to predict day basis mutation rates if more patient data is available in updated time.","Pathan, Refat Khan; Biswas, Munmun; Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin",Chaos Solitons Fractals,729,10

Eye-care professionals should educate patients about limiting screen time and managing digital eye strain symptoms. Background: This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 isolation's impact on digital device use by comparing hours spent on digital devices before and during the 24-hour curfew in Saudi Arabia, while assessing the symptoms associated with digital eye strain. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was used to compare the total hours per day, either continuous or intermittent, spent on digital devices during and before curfew, and the association of these durations with digital eye strain. Results: A total of 1,939 participants, (mean ± SD: 33 ± 12.2 years and 72% women) were recruited. Results showed a significant difference between usage duration before and during curfew. Digital eye strain incidence was 78% during the curfew. Chi-squared analysis indicated most symptoms are associated with usage duration and employment status. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between digital eye strain and the following factors: using more than one device (odds ratio 1.208, 95% confidence interval: 1.068-1.3661), age, optical correction, employment status, gender, using rewetting drops, and usage duration. Conclusions: In this population, prolonged use of digital devices significantly increased during home-isolation. Digital eye strain incidence increased during curfew. Regular eye exams should be encouraged to ensure the use of optimum prescription use and meet the specific visual demands required for the use of digital devices. Eye-health strategies and awareness campaigns should be employed on the importance of regular eye exams, decreasing screen time, practising the 20-20-20 rule, and the use of rewetting drops to help reduce the symptoms of digital eye strain during this period.","Alabdulkader, Balsam",Clin Exp Optom,729,13

It has been shown that nearly 80% of S. aureus infections following surgery are the same as those in the anterior nares of patients, suggesting that the anterior nares is the source of the infection strain. This has led to the use of mupirocin ointment being applied nasally to reduce infections; mupirocin resistance is being observed. This study was undertaken to determine whether gel composed of 5% glycerol monolaurate solubilized in a glycol-based, nonaqueous gel (5% GML gel) could be used as an alternative. In our study, 40 healthy human volunteers swabbed their anterior nares for 3 days with the 5% GML gel. Prior to swabbing and 8 to 12 h after swabbing, S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal CFU per milliliter were determined by plating the swabs on mannitol salt agar. Fourteen of the volunteers had S. aureus in their nares prior to 5% GML gel treatment, most persons with the organisms present in both nares; five had pure cultures of S. aureus All participants without pure culture of S. aureus were cocolonized with S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Five of the S. aureus strains produced the superantigens commonly associated with toxic shock syndrome, though none of the participants became ill. For both S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, the 5% GML gel treatment resulted in a 3-log-unit reduction in microorganisms. For S. aureus, the reduction persisted for 2 or 3 days.IMPORTANCE In this microflora study, we show that a 5% glycerol monolaurate nonaqueous gel is safe for use in the anterior nares. The gel was effective in reducing Staphylococcus aureus nasally, a highly significant hospital-associated pathogen. The gel may be a useful alternative or additive to mupirocin ointment for nasal use prior to surgery, noting that 80% of hospital-associated S. aureus infections are due to the same organism found in the nose. This gel also kills all enveloped viruses tested and should be considered for studies to reduce infection and transmission of coronaviruses and influenza viruses.","Schlievert, Patrick M; Peterson, Marnie L",MSphere,729,26

We used the COVID-19 Impact on lifestyle change survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective survey distributed via social media platforms in early May 2020 where more than 10 000 youth participants in China have voluntarily reported their basic sociodemographic information, weight status, and routine lifestyles in the months before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The extended IOTF and WHO standards were used to define overweight and obesity of the participants. We used paired t-tests or &#967;2 tests and non-parametric methods to evaluate the significance of differences in weight-related outcomes and lifestyles across education levels, between sexes, and before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The mean body mass index of all participating youths has significantly increased (21.8-22.6) and in all education subgroups during COVID-19 lockdown. Increases also occurred in the prevalence of overweight/obesity (21.3%-25.1%, P < .001) and obesity (10.5% to 12.9%, P < .001) in overall youths, especially in high school and undergraduate students. Their activity patterns had also significantly changed, including the decreased frequency of engaging in active transport, moderate-/vigorous-intensity housework, leisure-time moderate-/vigorous-intensity physical activity, and leisure-time walking, and the increased sedentary, sleeping, and screen time. Our findings would inform policy-makers and clinical practitioners of these changes in time, for better policy making and clinical practice. School administrators should also be informed of these changes, so in-class and/or extracurricular physical activity programs could be designed to counteract them.","Yang, Shujuan; Guo, Bing; Ao, Linjun; Yang, Chao; Zhang, Lei; Zhou, Junmin; Jia, Peng",Clin Obes,729,22

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyse the Covid-19 preventive behaviour and the socio-economic drivers behind the health-response behaviour. DATA: The study employs data from waves 1 and 2 of South Africa's nationally representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS)-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (CRAM). The nationally representative panel data has a sample of 7073 individuals in Wave 1 and 5676 individuals in Wave 2. METHODS: The study uses bivariate statistics, concentration indices and multivariate estimation techniques, ranging from a probit, control-function approach, special-regressor method and seemingly unrelated regression to account for endogeneity while identifying the drivers of the response behaviour. FINDINGS: The findings indicate enhanced behavioural responsiveness to Covid-19. Preventive behaviour is evolving over time; the use of face mask has overtaken handwashing as the most utilised preventive measure. Other measures, like social distancing, avoiding close contact, avoiding big groups and staying at home, have declined between the two periods of the study. There is increased risk perception with significant concentration among the higher income groups, the educated and older respondents. Our findings validate the health-belief model, with perceived risk, self-efficacy, perceived awareness and barriers to preventive strategy adoption identified as significant drivers of health-response behaviour. Measures such as social distancing, avoiding close contact, and the use of sanitisers are practised more by the rich and educated, but not by the low-income respondents.

Measures such as social distancing, avoiding close contact, and the use of sanitisers are practised more by the rich and educated, but not by the low-income respondents. CONCLUSION: The respondents from lower socio-economic backgrounds are associated with optimism bias and face barriers to the adoption of preventive strategies. This requires targeted policy attention in order to make response behaviour effective.","Kollamparambil, Umakrishnan; Oyenubi, Adeola",PLoS One,729,16

Results of such tests can be reported as cycle threshold (Ct) values, which may provide semi-quantitative or indirect measurements of viral load. Previous reports have examined temporal trends in Ct values over the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using testing data collected during a prospective household transmission investigation of outpatient and mild COVID-19 cases, we examined the relationship between Ct values of the viral RNA N1 target and demographic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics collected through participant interviews and daily symptom diaries. RESULTS: We found Ct values are lowest (corresponding to higher viral RNA concentration) soon after symptom onset and are significantly correlated with time elapsed since onset (p<0.001); within 7 days after symptom onset, the median Ct value was 26.5 compared with a median Ct value of 35.0 occurring 21 days after onset. Ct values were significantly lower among participants under 18 years of age (p=0.01) and those reporting upper respiratory symptoms at the time of sample collection (p=0.001) and were higher among participants reporting no symptoms (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the importance of early testing for SARS-CoV-2 among individuals with symptoms of respiratory illness and allows cases to be identified and isolated when their viral shedding may be highest.","Salvatore, Phillip P; Dawson, Patrick; Wadhwa, Ashutosh; Rabold, Elizabeth M; Buono, Sean; Dietrich, Elizabeth A; Reses, Hannah E; Vuong, Jeni; Pawloski, Lucia; Dasu, Trivikram; Bhattacharyya, Sanjib; Pevzner, Eric; Hall, Aron J; Tate, Jacqueline E; Kirking, Hannah L",Clin Infect Dis,729,21

Forty-two patients with colon cancer were included in the present study. Tumor tissues and tumor-adjacent tissues were collected from all patients. Bioinformatics was used to analyze how TRAF5 was related to metastasis and prognosis of colon cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was carried out to determine the expression of mRNA. SW620 and SW480 cells were used to study the inhibition and overexpression of TRAF5, respectively. CCK-8 assay was used to examine cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was employed to investigate cell phase and apoptosis. Transwell assay was used to study migration and invasion of cells. Western blotting was utilized to test how TRAF5 expression affected the activities of PI3K/AKT/NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Bioinformatics showed that the expression of TRAF5 in colon cancer tissues was correlated with metastasis and prognosis of the tumor. TRAF5 mRNA expression was up-regulated in colon cancer tissues, and related to recurrence and metastasis of the cancer. In vitro experiments showed that TRAF5 expression promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer cells, but reduced apoptosis of the cells. Moreover, TRAF5 might exert its biological functions by activating PI3K/AKT/NF-&#954;B signaling pathways in colon cancer cells. In conclusion, TRAF5 expression in colon cancer tissues is up-regulated and correlated with prognosis, lymphatic metastasis and clinical staging. TRAF5 promotes the occurrence and development of colon cancer by activating PI3K/ AKT/NF-&#954;B signaling pathways, and acts as an oncogene.","Sun, G; Zheng, C; Deng, Z; Huang, C; Huang, J",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,729,17

The aim of this study was to compare patient characteristics and outcome of ARDS before and during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study at 3 hospitals sites of Montefiore Medical Center comparing a pre-COVID respiratory failure cohort from 2017 to 2018 and a COVID respiratory failure cohort from March 2020 to May 2020. ARDS was identified by having PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;= 300 and independent x-ray review consistent of bilateral infiltrates according to 2012 Berlin definition. We used Mann-Whitney-U test for non-parametric comparison of continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We included 1328 ARDS pre-COVID patients from 2017-2018 and 536 COVID-19 patients. The age or race was not different between the 2 ARDS cohorts (Table 1). There were more males in the COVID-19 ARDS (56.2% pre-COVID vs 61.4% COVID-19;p = 0.039). The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio for pre-COVID ARDS was higher than COVID (184 (IQR 117, 242) vs 116 (IQR 80.3, 178), p &lt; 0.0005) with less severe ARDS in pre-COVID (18.3% vs 38.2%;p &lt; 0.0005). In-hospital mortality almost doubled in COVID-19 ARDS (68.8%) compare with pre-COVID ARDS (37.2%, p &lt;0.0005). The hospital length of stay was significantly longer in pre-COVID ARDS;ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation did not differ between the two ARDS groups (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 ARDS presented more severely than pre-COVID ARDS based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio. The increase in in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 ARDS is likely related to the severity of respiratory failure. We need to adjust for the confounders between ARDS types and patient outcomes.","Hache-Marliere, M.; Tanner, T.; Offor, O.; You, J.; Hope, A. A.; Gong, M.

One of the most known features of this RNA virus is its easiness to be mutated. In late 2020, almost no region of this SARS-CoV-2 genome can be found completely conserved within the original Wuhan coronavirus. Any information of the SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged through as time being will be evaluated for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We extracted more than two million data of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from the open COVID-19 dashboard. The sequences of the 38-amino acid putative open reading frame 10 (Orf10) protein within infected patients were gathered output through from National Center for Biotechnology Information and the mutation rates in each position were analyzed and presented in each month of 2020. The mutation rates of A8 and V30 within Orf10 are displayed in selected counties: United States, India, German, and Japan. RESULTS: The numbers of COVID-19 patients are correlated to the death numbers, but not with the death rates (stable and <3%). The amino acid positions locating at A8(F/G/L), I13, and V30(L) within the Orf10 sequence stay the highest mutation rate; N5, N25, and N36 rank at the lowest one. A8F expressed highly dominant in Japan (over 80%) and German (around 40%) coming to the end of 2020, but no significant finding in other countries. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate via mutation analysis of Orf10 can be further combined with advanced tools such as molecular simulation, artificial intelligence, and biosensors that can practically revealed for protein interactions and thus to imply the authentic Orf10 function of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.","Yang, De-Ming; Lin, Fan-Chi; Tsai, Pin-Hsing; Chien, Yueh; Wang, Mong-Lien; Yang, Yi-Ping; Chang, Tai-Jay",J Chin Med Assoc,729,1

METHODS: We performed a thorough literature search with regard to COVID-19 vaccines in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) tends to portend a poor prognosis in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Primary prevention remains the mainstay for mitigating the risks associated with COVID-19 in patients with DM. A significant step in primary prevention is timely vaccination. Routine vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis B is recommended in patients with DM with good efficacy and reasonable safety profile. With clinical data supporting a robust neutralizing antibody response in COVID-19 patients with DM, vaccination in individuals with DM is justified. In fact, as the burden of the disease is borne by people with DM, COVID-19 vaccination should be prioritized in individuals with DM. Multiple unresolved issues with regard to preferred vaccine type, vaccine efficacy and durability, frequency of administration, vaccination in children (<18 years) and pregnant/lactating women however remain, and need to be addressed through future research. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a high risk of poor prognosis with COVID-19 and vaccination should be prioritized in them.

However, additional innovations are required in this field because there are no effective vaccines to prevent some infectious diseases. The shift from the attenuated or inactivated pathogens to safer but less immunogenic protein or peptide antigens has led to a search for effective antigen delivery carriers that can function as both antigen vehicles and intrinsic adjuvants. Among these carriers, self-assembled nanoparticles (SANPs) have shown great potential to be the best representative. For the nanoscale and multiple presentation of antigens, with accurate control over size, geometry, and functionality, these nanoparticles are assembled spontaneously and mimic pathogens, resulting in enhanced antigen presentation and increased cellular and humoral immunity responses. In addition, they may be applied through needle-free routes due to their adhesive ability, which gives them a great future in vaccination applications. This review provides an overview of various SANPs and their applications in prophylactic vaccines.","Pan, Jingdi; Cui, Zongqiang",Biotechnol J,729,17

Currently, several systematic reviews have suggested that the commonly used acupuncture therapy (electroacupuncture, fire acupuncture, warm acupuncture, and filiform needle acupuncture) has achieved significant efficacy in the treatment of SPAS. In this study, network meta-analysis will be used to analyze the results of different clinical trials and evaluate the differences in the efficacy of different acupuncture treatments for SPAS. METHODS: Only randomized controlled trials will be included and all patients were diagnosed as spastic paralysis after stroke. A computer-based retrieval will be conducted at CNKI, WanFang databases, VIP, Sinoed, Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library. The search period limit is from the time the date of database establishment to April 17, 2020. To avoid omissions, we will manually retrieve relevant references and conference papers. The risk of bias in the final included studies will be evaluated based on the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. All data analysis will be conducted by Revman5.3, WinBUGS 1.4.3, and Stata14.2. RESULTS: This study quantified the effectiveness of each intervention for different outcome indicators. The primary outcomes include the Fugl-Meyer Assessment score, the modified Ashworth scale for the assessment of spasticity, and Barthel Index. The secondary outcomes include clinical effectiveness and adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: It will provide evidence-based medical evidence for clinicians to choose more effective acupuncture therapy for SPAS.","Wang, Ruiqi; Xie, Rongfang; Hu, Jinwen; Wu, Qingzhong; Rao, Wangfu; Huang, Chunhua",Medicine (Baltimore),729,14

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed among adult patients admitted to a quaternary care center in New York City between March 1 and April 3, 2020. Patients were included if they underwent TTE during the hospitalization after a known positive diagnosis for COVID-19. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using chart abstraction from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Of 749 patients, 72 (9.6%) underwent TTE following positive results on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction testing. The most common clinical indications for TTE were concern for a major acute cardiovascular event (45.8%) and hemodynamic instability (29.2%). Although most patients had preserved biventricular function, 34.7% were found to have left ventricular ejection fractions &#8804; 50%, and 13.9% had at least moderately reduced right ventricular function. Four patients had wall motion abnormalities suggestive of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Using Spearman rank correlation, there was an inverse relationship between high-sensitivity troponin T and left ventricular ejection fraction (&#961; = -0.34, P = .006). Among 20 patients with prior echocardiograms, only two (10%) had new reductions in LVEF of >10%. Clinical management was changed in eight individuals (24.2%) in whom TTE was ordered for concern for acute major cardiovascular events and three (14.3%) in whom TTE was ordered for hemodynamic evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the clinical indications for use and diagnostic performance of TTE, as well as findings seen on TTE, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In appropriately selected patients, TTE can be an invaluable tool for guiding COVID-19 clinical management.","Jain, Sneha S; Liu, Qi; Raikhelkar, Jayant; Fried, Justin; Elias, Pierre; Poterucha, Timothy J; DeFilippis, Ersilia M; Rosenblum, Hannah; Wang, Elizabeth Y; Redfors, Bjorn; Clerkin, Kevin; Griffin, Jan M; Wan, Elaine Y; Abdalla, Marwah; Bello, Natalie A; Hahn, Rebecca T; Shimbo, Daichi; Weiner, Shepard D; Kirtane, Ajay J; Kodali, Susheel K; Burkhoff, Daniel; Rabbani, LeRoy E; Schwartz, Allan; Leon, Martin B; Homma, Shunichi; Di Tullio, Marco R; Sayer, Gabriel; Uriel, Nir; Anstey, D Edmund",J Am Soc Echocardiogr,729,16

We reported the clinical features and therapeutic characteristics of moderate COVID-19 cases in Wuhan that were treated via the integration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We collected electronic medical record (EMR) data, which included the full clinical profiles of patients, from a designated TCM hospital in Wuhan. The structured data of symptoms and drugs from admission notes were obtained through an information extraction process. Other key clinical entities were also confirmed and normalized to obtain information on the diagnosis, clinical treatments, laboratory tests, and outcomes of the patients. A total of 293 COVID-19 inpatient cases, including 207 moderate and 86 (29.3%) severe cases, were included in our research. Among these cases, 238 were discharged, 31 were transferred, and 24 (all severe cases) died in the hospital. Our COVID-19 cases involved elderly patients with advanced ages (57 years on average) and high comorbidity rates (61%). Our results reconfirmed several well-recognized risk factors, such as age, gender (male), and comorbidities, as well as provided novel laboratory indications (e.g., cholesterol) and TCM-specific phenotype markers (e.g., dull tongue) that were relevant to COVID-19 infections and prognosis. In addition to antiviral/antibiotics and standard supportive therapies, TCM herbal prescriptions incorporating 290 distinct herbs were used in 273 (93%) cases. The cases that received TCM treatment had lower death rates than those that did not receive TCM treatment (17/273 = 6.2% vs. 7/20= 35%, P = 0.0004 for all cases; 17/77= 22% vs. 7/9= 77.7%, P = 0.002 for severe cases). The TCM herbal prescriptions used for the treatment of COVID-19 infections mainly consisted of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, Radix Scutellariae, Rhizoma Pinellia, and their combinations, which reflected the practical TCM principles (e.g., clearing heat and dampening phlegm). Lastly, 59% of the patients received treatment, including antiviral, antibiotics, and Chinese patent medicine, before admission. This situation might have some effects on symptoms, such as fever and dry cough. By using EMR data, we described the clinical features and therapeutic characteristics of 293 COVID-19 cases treated via the integration of TCM herbal prescriptions and Western medicine. Clinical manifestations and treatments before admission and in the hospital were investigated. Our results preliminarily showed the potential effectiveness of TCM herbal prescriptions and their regularities in COVID-19 treatment.","Shu, Zixin; Zhou, Yana; Chang, Kai; Liu, Jifen; Min, Xiaojun; Zhang, Qing; Sun, Jing; Xiong, Yajuan; Zou, Qunsheng; Zheng, Qiguang; Ji, Jinghui; Poon, Josiah; Liu, Baoyan; Zhou, Xuezhong; Li, Xiaodong",Front.

Access to outpatient specialist and home healthcare services was explored during the pandemic outbreak and the lockdown amongst MS patients in the Lazio region. Adherence to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is also described. METHODS: A population-based study was conducted using regional healthcare administrative databases. A validated algorithm was used to identify MS cases over the period 2011-2018. The numbers of specialist and home-based services were compared between 2019 and 2020. The medication possession ratio was used to measure adherence to DMTs. RESULTS: A total of 9380 MS patients were identified (68% women). A decline in the number of outpatient care services between March and June 2020 compared to the previous year was observed, in particular for rehabilitation (-82%), magnetic resonance imaging (-56%) and neurological specialist services (-91%). Important year-to-year variations were observed in May and June 2020 in home-based nursing and medical care (-91%) and motor re-education services (-74%). Adherence to DMTs was higher in the first 4 months of 2019 compared to the same period of 2020 (67.1% vs. 57.0%). CONCLUSIONS: A notable disruption of rehabilitative therapy and home-based services as well as in DMT adherence was observed. Since the pandemic is still ongoing and interruption of healthcare services could have a major impact on MS patients, it is necessary to monitor access of MS patients to healthcare resources in order to ensure adequate treatments, including rehabilitative therapies.","Colais, Paola; Cascini, Silvia; Balducci, Maria; Agabiti, Nera; Davoli, Marina; Fusco, Danilo; Calandrini, Enrico; Bargagli, Anna Maria",Eur. j. neurol,729,2

To meet the increased demand for hand sanitizer during the pandemic, the US FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization allowing new manufacturers and importers to enter the market. Some of the newly introduced hand sanitizer products contained methanol in lieu of ethanol or isopropanol. We describe five patients with fatal methanol poisoning resulting from hand sanitizers improperly containing methanol. CASE SUMMARY: Comparing a 5-month period from 2019 to the same time frame in 2020, the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center has seen an increase of 124% in exposures to hand sanitizer. Of these cases, 28% involved methanol-contaminated hand sanitizer. Five of these patients died from methanol poisoning. All five cases had similar clinical features with severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis and, in four patients, elevated osmolal gap. Methanol concentrations were consistently very elevated, but these results were not available before the patients succumbed. Four of the patients received fomepizole and adjunctive care. Two patients received emergency extracorporeal therapy. All five died despite maximal treatment efforts. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic in 2020, there was a proliferation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers which contained methanol. Exposure to these products, which failed to meet regulatory standards, led to increased harm and death. Challenges to treatment of methanol poisoning, especially in rural areas, include lack of access to timely laboratory measurement of methanol concentrations and lack of available emergency hemodialysis without transfer of the patient.","Holzman, Sarah Denise; Larsen, Jaiva; Kaur, Ramandeep; Smelski, Geoffrey; Dudley, Steven; Shirazi, Farshad Mazda",Clin Toxicol (Phila),729,16

Conceptually, it is a lightweight semantic search engine focusing on easy inclusion of specialized COVID-19 textual collections and provides a user friendly web interface for semantic information retrieval. In order to support semantic search functionality, we integrated a text mining workflow for indexing with relevant terminologies. Currently, diseases, human genes and SARS-CoV-2 proteins are annotated, and more will be added in future. The system integrates collections from several different preprint servers that are used in the biomedical domain to publish non-peer-reviewed work, thereby enabling one central access point for the users. In addition, our service offers facet searching, export functionality and an API access.

This study aims to investigate this further, particularly in the context of increasing development of Irish and European trauma systems. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of, and patterns behind head and neck injury in major trauma in an Irish population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Trauma Audit Research Network database was analysed for major trauma patients (injury severity score > 15) with head and neck injuries admitted to any of the 26 participating hospitals in the Republic of Ireland between 2014 and 2017. The data was studied for patterns in the epidemiology of injuries and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 5364 patients were identified. Males were affected more than females (M:F 2.1:1). The most common mechanism of injury was falls. There were 1272 counts of soft tissue injury, and 5814 counts of bony injury recorded within the cohort. Twenty-six percent of patients underwent some form of surgical procedure. Median length of hospital stay was 8 days, and the 30-day survival rate was 90%. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of Irish major trauma patients of all ages and genders sustain some form of head and neck injury. It produces significant injury and surgical workload involving input from multiple disciplines.","Mohamed, Abdulrahman; Mulcaire, Jeffrey; Clover, Anthony James P",Ir. j. med. sci,729,1

The availability of information in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) remains limited. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 positive admissions (CPAs) in the United States and to determine factors that may impact those admissions. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 Virtual Pediatric System (VPS) dashboard containing information regarding respiratory support and comorbidities for all CPAs between March and April 2020. The state-level data contained 13 different factors from population density, comorbid conditions, and social distancing score. The absolute CPA count was converted to frequency using the state's population. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CPA frequency and admission endpoints. Results: A total of 205 CPAs were reported by 167 PICUs across 48 states. The estimated CPA frequency was 2.8 per million children in a one-month period. A total of 3,235 tests were conducted of which 6.3% were positive. Children above 11 years of age comprised 69.7% of the total cohort and 35.1% had moderated or severe comorbidities. The median duration of a CPA was 4.9 days (1.25-12.00 days). Out of the 1,132 total CPA days, 592 (52.2%) involved mechanical ventilation. The inpatient mortalities were 3 (1.4%). Multivariate analyses demonstrated an association between CPAs with greater population density (beta coefficient 0.01, p < 0.01). Multivariate analyses also demonstrated an association between pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus with increased CPA duration requiring advanced respiratory support (beta coefficient 5.1, p < 0.01) and intubation (beta coefficient 4.6, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Inpatient mortality during PICU CPAs is relatively low at 1.4%. CPA frequency seems to be impacted by population density. Type 1 DM appears to be associated with increased duration of HFNC and intubation. These factors should be included in future studies using patient-level data.","Loomba, Rohit S; Villarreal, Enrique G; Farias, Juan S; Bronicki, Ronald A; Flores, Saul",Int J Pediatr,729,1

After 7 days, the blood tests showed a significant rise of inflammatory and procoagulant markers, along with a relevant elevation of high-sensitivity Troponin I. Electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) were consistent with a diagnosis of infero-posterolateral acute myocardial infarction and the patient was transferred to the isolated Cath Lab for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The angiography showed an acute massive thrombosis of a dominant right coronary artery without clear evidence of atherosclerosis. Despite the optimal pharmacological therapies and different PCI techniques, the final TIMI flow was 0/1 and after 3 hr the clinical condition evolved in cardiac arrest for pulseless electric activity. Acute coronary syndrome-ST-elevation myocardial infarction is a relevant complication of COVID-19. Due to high levels of proinflammatory mediators, diffuse coronary thrombosis could occur even in patients without cardiac history or comorbidities. This clinical case suggests that coronary thrombosis in COVID-19 patients may be unresponsive to optimal pharmacological (GP IIb-IIIa infusion) and mechanical treatment (PCI).","Tedeschi, Delio; Rizzi, Andrea; Biscaglia, Simone; Tumscitz, Carlo",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,729,24

The objective was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions. METHODS: Fifteen initial items were generated based on suggestions from 121 people with the chronic autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). Patients in a COVID-19 SSc cohort completed items between April 9 and 27, 2020. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and item analysis were used to select items for inclusion. Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate internal consistency reliability and convergent validity. Factor structure was confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in follow-up data collection two weeks later. RESULTS: 787 participants completed baseline measures; 563 of them completed the follow-up assessment. Ten of 15 initial items were included in the final questionnaire. EFA suggested that a single dimension explained the data reasonably well. There were no indications of floor or ceiling effects. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91.

The impact of such changes in the workflow of AECs on throughput and other performance indicators is largely unknown, although a significant reduction in revenue stream is expected. METHODS: A discrete event simulation-based model was developed in the setting of a small to medium community-based single-specialty AEC to quantify the impact of COVID-19-related workflow changes on performance indicators and cost per case compared with the pre-COVID-19 baseline. RESULTS: In the simulation model, post-COVID-19 recommended workflow changes significantly impacted the operational and productivity metrics and, in turn, adversely affected financial metrics. Overall, there was a significant decrease in staff utilization and consequent increase in total facility time, waiting time for patients, and cost per case because of a bottleneck at the time of preprocedure COVID-19 screening and testing while practicing social distancing.

However, public acceptance is reliant on beliefs and perception toward the vaccine. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the beliefs and barriers associated with COVID-19 vaccination among the Saudi population. METHODS: An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed across the main regions of Saudi Arabia on May 2020. The questionnaire addressed the socio-demographic variables, beliefs toward COVID-19 vaccination, and potential barriers that may prevent participants from being vaccinated. The association between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic variables were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predicting variables of vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: Out of 3101 participants, 44.7% were accepting of COVID-19 vaccination if available, whereas 55.3% admitted hesitancy. Younger, male, who received seasonal influenza vaccine were more likely to accept taking the vaccine. The study found that concerns about side effects were the key barrier for vaccine acceptance. Furthermore, the majority of refusers may accept the vaccine if additional studies confirmed safety and effectiveness.

Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can contribute to CVD and alter lipid storage and inflammation in adipose tissue. Our previous exposure studies revealed that traffic-generated emissions increase RAS signaling, further exacerbated by a high-fat diet. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to engine emissions increases systemic and local adipocyte RAS signaling, promoting the expression of factors involved in CVD and obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 wk old) were fed either a high-fat (HF, n = 16) or low-fat (LF, n = 16) diet, beginning 30d prior to exposures, and then exposed via inhalation to either filtered air (FA, controls) or a mixture of diesel engine + gasoline engine vehicle emissions (MVE: 100 μg PM/m(3)) via whole-body inhalation for 6 h/d, 7 d/wk, 30d. Endpoints were assessed via immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR. MVE-exposure promoted vascular adhesion factors (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) expression, monocyte/macrophage sequestration, and oxidative stress in the vasculature, associated with increased angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) expression. In the kidney, MVE-exposure promoted the expression of renin, AT1, and AT2 receptors. In adipose tissue, both HF-diet and MVE-exposure mediated increased epididymal fat pad weight and adipocyte hypertrophy, associated with increased angiotensinogen and AT1 receptor expression; however, these outcomes were further exacerbated in the MVE + HF group. MVE-exposure also induced inflammation, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and leptin, while reducing insulin receptor and glucose transporter, GLUT4, expression in adipose tissue. Our results indicate that MVE-exposure promotes systemic and local adipose RAS signaling, associated with increased expression of factors contributing to CVD and obesity, further exacerbated by HF diet consumption.","Phipps, Benjamin L.; Suwannasual, Usa; Lucero, JoAnn; Mitchell, Nicholas A.; Lund, Amie K.",Toxicol Rep,729,17

Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 - its high reproductive number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread - exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with biomedical and nonpharmaceutical interventions designed to limit disease transmission. In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals, demonstrating that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions. We then used epidemiological modeling to explore the impact of noncompliance on short-term disease control, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. Our modeling shows that the existence of a noncompliant population can also prevent any return to normalcy over the long run. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering COVID-19 disease control ineffective in the short term and making complete suppression impossible in the long term. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.","Stoddard, M.; Van Egeren, D.; Johnson, K.; Rao, S.; Furgeson, J.; White, D.

Until now, no holistic concept existed to use medical students as support for professionals in intensive care units (ICU) to avoid staff shortages in medical care. METHOD: In a large-scale pilot project 265 medical students were trained for an ICU assignment. The innovative training module was accompanied by a pre-post questionnaire for self-assessment of the skills learned. 22 weeks after the training module and still during the pandemic deployment, another questionnaire was used to evaluate experiences in deployment and the efficiency of the training module with respect to preparation for ICU deployment. RESULTS: The analysis revealed significant mean differences for all COVID-19-specific variables (safety dimension) in favor of the training module (n = 168). The deployment evaluation showed that the training concept was inconsistently assessed as preparation for the work deployment for 69 of the 89 deployed students in total (53% agreement/47% disagreement). CONCLUSION: The results show a good feasibility of an innovative training concept for medical students with respect to a pandemic deployment as assistants in intensive care units. The concept is suitable for providing additional helpers in intensive care units during a pandemic; however, the inconsistent evaluation indicates that the concept can be expanded and needs to be adapted.","Vogt, Lina; Schmidt, Michelle; Klasen, Martin; Bickenbach, Johannes; Marx, Gernot; Sopka, Saša",Anaesthesist,729,22

We discuss how with the use of smart IoMT wearables certain biomarkers can be tracked for detection of COVID-19 in exposed individuals. We enumerate several machine learning algorithms which can be used to process a wide range of collected biomarkers for detecting (a) multiple symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the dynamical likelihood of contracting the virus through interpersonal interaction. Eventually, we enunciate how a systematic use of smart wearable IoMT devices in various social sectors can intelligently help controlling the spread of COVID-19 in communities as they enter the reopening phase. We explain how this framework can benefit individuals and their medical correspondents by introducing Systems for Symptom Decoding (SSD), and how the use of this technology can be generalized on a societal level for the control of spread by introducing Systems for Spread Tracing (SST).","Mehrdad, Sarmad; Wang, Yao; Atashzar, S.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper identifies four common reasons given for the lack of effective canine rabies control in Africa: (a) a low priority given for disease control as a result of lack of awareness of the rabies burden; (b) epidemiological constraints such as uncertainties about the required levels of vaccination coverage and the possibility of sustained cycles of infection in wildlife; (c) operational constraints including accessibility of dogs for vaccination and insufficient knowledge of dog population sizes for planning of vaccination campaigns; and (d) limited resources for implementation of rabies surveillance and control. We address each of these issues in turn, presenting data from field studies and modelling approaches used in Tanzania, including burden of disease evaluations, detailed epidemiological studies, operational data from vaccination campaigns in different demographic and ecological settings, and economic analyses of the cost-effectiveness of dog vaccination for human rabies prevention. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that there are no insurmountable problems to canine rabies control in most of Africa; that elimination of canine rabies is epidemiologically and practically feasible through mass vaccination of domestic dogs; and that domestic dog vaccination provides a cost-effective approach to the prevention and elimination of human rabies deaths.","Lembo, Tiziana; Hampson, Katie; Kaare, Magai T.; Ernest, Eblate; Knobel, Darryn; Kazwala, Rudovick R.; Haydon, Daniel T.; Cleaveland, Sarah",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,729,1

They have also been associated with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has made them an all important agent for CoV evolution and transmission. Our objective in this study was to investigate the dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of betacoronavirus (βCoV) among African bats. We retrieved sequence data from established databases such as GenBank and Virus Pathogen Resource, covering the partial RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of bat coronaviruses from eight African, three Asian, five European, two South American countries and Australia. We analyzed for phylogeographic information relating to genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics. Our study revealed that majority of the African strains fell within Norbecovirus subgenera, with an evolutionary rate of 1.301 × 10(−3), HPD (1.064 × 10(−3)–1.434 × 10(−3)) subs/site/year. The African strains diversified into three main subgenera, Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and Merbecovirus. The time to most common recent ancestor for Norbecovirus strains was 1973, and 2007, for the African Merbecovirus strains. There was evidence of inter species transmission of Norbecovirus among bats in Cameroun and DRC. Phlylogeography showed that there were inter-continental spread of Bt-CoV from Europe, China and Hong Kong into Central and Southern Africa, highlighting the possibility of long distance transmission. Our study has elucidated the possible evolutionary origins of βCoV among African bats; we therefore advocate for broader studies of whole genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.","Motayo, Babatunde O.; Oluwasemowo, Olukunle Oluwapamilerin; Akinduti, Paul A.",PeerJ,729,21

Currently only few sequences are available from three states in India. Kerala was the first state to deposit complete sequence from two isolates followed by one from Gujarat. On April 27, 2020, the first five sequences from the state of West Bengal (Eastern India) were deposited on GISAID, a global initiative for sharing avian flu data. In this study, we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all five isolates and also compared their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and another at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only. There was one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of the mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.","Begum, Feroza; Mukherjee, Debica; Thagriki, Dluya; Das, Sandeepan; Tripathi, Prem Prakash; Banerjee, Arup Kumar; Ray, Upasana",F1000Res,729,9

In the Philippines, however, research has tended to focus on extreme ends of the implementation process such as the awareness of educators about the gender perspective or the success in incorporating gender in their pedagogical practices, rather than an in-depth analysis on the overall experience of educators in the government’s attempt to mainstream gender-and-development education in schools. Also, there is a gap in the literature concerning Filipino English language teaching (ELT) practitioners' views on integrating the gender perspective into English language education. Through semi-structured interviews, the present study explores how a group of 71 Filipino college teachers of English perceive the benefits, ways, and challenges of incorporating the gender dimension in ELT. The thematic analysis of interview responses revealed the following benefits: enhancement of learners’ critical thinking skills, promotion of an inclusive and supportive learning environment, and increased awareness on the critical role of language (i.e., English) in recognizing diversity. Further, it was found that the teacher-participants incorporate gender knowledge in ELT in two ways: instructional materials and teaching-learning activities, and teacher-student interaction. In terms of challenges, three major themes emerged: learner factor, teacher factor, and institutional constraints (which were further categorized as curriculum, resource, and belief).","Tarrayo, Veronico N.; Potestades, Rafaella R.; Ulla, Mark B.",Sex Cult,729,24

In severe cases the disease progresses into an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which in turn depends on an overproduction of cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, IL-12, IL-8, CCL-2 and IL1) that causes alveolar and vascular lung damage. Clearly, it is essential to find an immunological treatment that controls the “cytokine storm”. In the meantime, however, it is essential to have effective antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs available immediately. PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR COVID-19: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been widely adopted worldwide for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, the choice of this treatment was based on low quality of evidence, i.e. retrospective, non-randomized controlled studies. Recently, four large Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) have been performed in record time delivering reliable data: (1) the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RCT included 60 hospitals participating all over the world and showed the efficacy of remdesivir in reducing the recovery time in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 pneumonia; (2) three large RCTs already completed, for hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone and Lopinavir and Ritonavir respectively. These trials were done under the umbrella of the 'Recovery' project, headed by the University of Oxford. The project includes 176 participating hospitals in the UK and was set up to verify the efficacy of some of the treatments used for COVID-19. These three ‘Recovery’ RCTs concluded definitely: (a) that treatment with hydroxychloroquine provides no benefits in patients hospitalized with COVID-19; (b) that treatment with dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in COVID-19 patients that were mechanically ventilated, and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen only; (c) that the combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir is not effective in reducing mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these four large RCTs have provided sound indications to doctors for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and prompted the correction of many institutional provisions and guidelines on COVID-19 treatments (i.e. FDA, NIH, UK Health Service, etc.). Even though a definitive treatment for COVID-19 has not yet been found, large RCTs stand as the Gold Standards for COVID-19 therapy and offer a solid scientific base on which to base treatment decisions.","Ortolani, Claudio; Pastorello, Elide A.",Clin Mol Allergy,729,24

METHODS We conducted an online cross-sectional survey among outpatient health care professionals. The responses of n=277 physicians and n=87 psychotherapists were included in the analysis. Frequencies are shown; the relationship between categorical variables was examined using the χ2 test; we used a qualitative content analysis for free text answers. RESULTS Almost all (96 %) physicians and 59 % of the psychotherapists reported a patient volume reduction since the COVID-19 outbreak. Cancellations were most often initiated by patients rather than physician offices. Among the physicians, routine check-ups and preventive care consultations were cancelled most frequently, and patients also appeared less frequently in open consultations. 72 % of the physicians and 29 % of the psychotherapists reported economic losses. While personal patient-physician contact was reduced, the use of telehealth has increased since the COVID-19 outbreak: during the first 'lockdown', two thirds of the psychotherapists (66 %) and 14 % of the physicians used telehealth for the first time. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a positive change in attitudes towards telehealth; this trend was significantly stronger among psychotherapists than among physicians. DISCUSSION The reduction in patient volume shown in this study is confirmed by outpatient billing data analyses. Clinical routines changed due to COVID-19 and led to a growth in telehealth usage. By facilitating formal billing options, the increased use of telehealth can also be promoted after the pandemic. CONCLUSION Shortly after COVID-19 outbreak, outpatient physicians and psychotherapists were faced with various challenges: Through their spontaneous and flexible response to the COVD-19 pandemic, outpatient providers were able to maintain their work despite high stress levels. Telehealth is becoming more important as a result of COVID-19.","Bruch, Dunja; Muehlensiepen, Felix; Alexandrov, Alexander; Konstantinova, Yana; Voß, Karl; Ronckers, Cecile; Neugebauer, Edmund; May, Susann","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen",729,33

It often starts as an upper respiratory tract infection that is complicated by a bacterial infection in which the symptoms worsen, persist, or are particularly severe. The accurate diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is challenging because of the overlap of symptoms with other common diseases, heavy reliance on subjective reporting of symptoms by the parents, and difficulties related to the physical examination of the child. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. There is no strong evidence for the use of ancillary therapy. Orbital and intracranial complications may occur and are best treated early and aggressively.

Many virus use their own IDPs to “hack” these processes to disactive host defenses and promote viral growth. Thus, viral IDPs are attractive drug targets. While IDPs are hard to study by X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM, atomic level information on their conformational perferences and dynamics can be obtained using NMR spectroscopy. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2 interacts with human proteins that regulate translation initiation and endosome vesicle sorting, and the C-terminal region of this protein is predicted to be disordered. Molecules that block these interactions could be valuable leads for drug development. To enable inhibitor screening and to uncover conformational preferences and dynamics, we have expressed and purified the 13C,15N-labeled C-terminal region of Nsp2. The 13Cβ and backbone 13CO, 1HN, 13Cα and 15N nuclei were assigned by analysis of a series of 2D 1H-15N HSQC and 13C-15N CON as well as 3D HNCO, HNCA, CBCAcoNH and HncocaNH spectra. Overall, the chemical shift data confirm that this region is chiefly disordered, but contains two five-residue segments that adopt a small population of β-strand structure. Whereas the region is flexible on ms/ms timescales as gauged by T1ρ measurements, the {1H}-15N NOEs reveal a flexibility on ns/ps timescales that is midway between a fully flexible and a completely rigid chain.","Mompeán, Miguel; Treviño, Miguel Á.; Laurents, Douglas V.",bioRxiv,729,1
