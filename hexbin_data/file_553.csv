17592,Developing a SARS-CoV-2 antigen test using engineered affinity proteins,2021-04-19,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly affecting extremely preterm infants. Although mechanical ventilation and oxygen requirements in premature infants are identified as inciting mechanisms for inflammation and the development of BPD over time, data now support an array of perinatal events that may stimulate the inflammatory cascade prior to delivery. Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, have proven beneficial for the prevention and management of BPD postnatally due to their anti-inflammatory characteristics. This review aims to examine the pharmacologic properties of several corticosteroids, appraise the existing evidence for postnatal corticosteroid use in preterm infants, and assess steroid management strategies to ameliorate BPD. Finally, we aim to provide guidance based on clinical experience for managing adrenal suppression resulting from prolonged steroid exposure since this is an area less well-studied.","Htun, Zeyar T.; Schulz, Elizabeth V.; Desai, Riddhi K.; Marasch, Jaime L.; McPherson, Christopher C.; Mastrandrea, Lucy D.; Jobe, Alan H.; Ryan, Rita M.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8133053/,553
28836,Le nouveau virus MERS-CoV : attention danger !,2013-11-23,"Medical errors are a major public health concern and a leading cause of death worldwide. Many healthcare centers and hospitals use reporting systems where medical practitioners write a preliminary medical report and the report is later reviewed, revised, and finalized by a more experienced physician. The revisions range from stylistic to corrections of critical errors or misinterpretations of the case. Due to the large quantity of reports written daily, it is often difficult to manually and thoroughly review all the finalized reports to find such errors and learn from them. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ranking approach, consisting of textual and ontological overlaps between the preliminary and final versions of reports. The approach learns to rank the reports based on the degree of discrepancy between the versions. This allows medical practitioners to easily identify and learn from the reports in which their interpretation most substantially differed from that of the attending physician (who finalized the report). This is a crucial step towards uncovering potential errors and helping medical practitioners to learn from such errors, thus improving patient-care in the long run. We evaluate our model on a dataset of radiology reports and show that our approach outperforms both previously-proposed approaches and more recent language models by 4.5% to 15.4%.","MacAvaney, Sean; Cohan, Arman; Goharian, Nazli; Filice, Ross",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148074/,553
62055,SARS-CoV-2 E gene variant alters analytical sensitivity characteristics of viral detection using a commercial RT-PCR assay.,2021-04-26,"Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis, Mafa) have emerged as important animal models for biomedical research, necessitating a more extensive characterization of their major histocompatibility complex polymorphic regions. The current information on the polymorphism or diversity of the polygenetic Mafa class I A loci is limited in comparison to the more commonly studied rhesus macaque Mafa class I A loci. Therefore, in this paper, to better elucidate the degree and types of polymorphisms and genetic differences of Mafa-A1 among three native Southeast Asian populations (Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Filipino) and to investigate how the allele differences between macaques and humans might have evolved to affect their respective immune responses, we identified 83 Mafa-A loci-derived alleles by DNA sequencing of which 66 are newly described. Most alleles are unique to each population, but seven of the most frequent alleles were identical in sequence to some alleles in other macaque species. We also revealed (1) the large and dynamic genetic and structural differences and similarities in allelic variation by analyzing the population allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg's equilibrium, heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity profiles, and phylogeny, (2) the difference in genetic structure of populations by Wright's FST statistic and hierarchical analysis of molecular variance, and (3) the different demographic and selection pressures on the three populations by performing Tajima's D test of neutrality. The large level of diversity and polymorphism at the Mafa-A1 was less evident in the Filipino than in the Vietnam or the Indonesian populations, which may have important implications in animal capture, selection, and breeding for medical research.","Kita, Yuki F; Hosomichi, Kazuyoshi; Kohara, Sakae; Itoh, Yasushi; Ogasawara, Kazumasa; Tsuchiya, Hideaki; Torii, Ryuzo; Inoko, Hidetoshi; Blancher, Antoine; Kulski, Jerzy K; Shiina, Takashi",Immunogenetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00251-009-0390-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19649628/,553

63061,A pooled testing strategy for identifying SARS-CoV-2 at low prevalence.,2020-10-21,"Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less ribonucleoprotein-based cellular compartments that form in the cytoplasm of a cell upon exposure to various environmental stressors. SGs contain a large set of proteins, as well as mRNAs that have been stalled in translation as a result of stress-induced polysome disassembly. Despite the fact that SGs have been extensively studied for many years, their function is still not clear. They presumably help the cell to cope with the encountered stress, and facilitate the recovery process after stress removal, upon which SGs disassemble. Aberrant formation of SGs and impaired SG disassembly majorly contributes to various pathological phenomena in cancer, viral infections, and neurodegeneration. The assembly of SGs is largely driven by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), however the molecular mechanisms behind that are not fully understood. Recent studies have proposed a novel mechanism for SG formation that involves the interplay of a large interaction network of mRNAs and proteins. Here we review this novel concept for the assembly of SGs, and discuss the current insights into SG disassembly.","Hofmann, Sarah; Kedersha, Nancy; Anderson, Paul; Ivanov, Pavel",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

71313,Checklists Continue to Prove Their Worth: A Donning and Doffing Checklist Prevents SARS-CoV-2 Transmission.,2021-06-01,"What are the psychological consequences of the increasingly politicized nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States relative to similar Western countries? In a two-wave study completed early (March) and later (December) in the pandemic, we found that polarization was greater in the United States (N = 1,339) than in Canada (N = 644) and the United Kingdom. (N = 1,283). Political conservatism in the United States was strongly associated with engaging in weaker mitigation behaviors, lower COVID-19 risk perceptions, greater misperceptions, and stronger vaccination hesitancy. Although there was some evidence that cognitive sophistication was associated with increased polarization in the United States in December (but not March), cognitive sophistication was nonetheless consistently negatively correlated with misperceptions and vaccination hesitancy across time, countries, and party lines. Furthermore, COVID-19 skepticism in the United States was strongly correlated with distrust in liberal-leaning mainstream news outlets and trust in conservative-leaning news outlets, suggesting that polarization may be driven by differences in information environments.","Pennycook, Gordon; McPhetres, Jonathon; Bago, Bence; Rand, David G",Personality & social psychology bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672211023652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180276/,553
73835,Assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland.,2020-05-18,"PURPOSE To assess clinical results of the 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 accelerated crosslinking (ACXL) in the treatment of progressive keratoconus (KC) over a span of 5 years. METHODS The prospective open non-randomized interventional study (Siena Eye-Cross Study 2) included 156 eyes of 112 patients with early progressive KC undergoing the Epi-Off 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 ACXL at the Siena Crosslinking Centre, Italy. The mean age was 18.05 ± 5.6 years. The 20-min treatments were performed using the New KXL I (Avedro, Waltham, USA), 10 min of 0.1% HPMC Riboflavin soaking (VibeX Rapid, Avedro, Waltham, USA) and 10 min of continuous-light UV-A irradiation. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), Kmax, coma, minimum corneal thickness (MCT), surface asymmetry index (SAI), endothelial cell count (ECC) were measured, and corneal OCT performed. RESULTS UDVA and CDVA improved significantly at the 3rd (P = 0.028), Δ + 0.17 Snellen lines and 6th postoperative month, respectively (P < 0.001), Δ + 0.23 Snellen lines. Kmax improved at the 6th postoperative month (P = 0.03), Δ - 1.49 diopters from the baseline value. Also, coma aberration value improved significantly (P = 0.004). A mild temporary haze was recorded in 14.77% of patients without affecting visual acuity and without persistent complications. Corneal OCT revealed a mean demarcation line depth at 332.6 ± 33.6 μm. CONCLUSION The 5-year results of Epi-Off 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 ACXL demonstrated statistically significant improvements in UCVA and CDVA, corneal curvature and corneal higher-order aberrations which confers a long-term stability for progressive ectasia. Based on the results of the Siena Eye-Cross Study 2, the 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 ACXL is a candidate to be the natural evolution of Epi-Off CXL treatment for the management of early progressive corneal ectasia, and thus optimize clinic workflow.","Mazzotta, Cosimo; Raiskup, Frederik; Hafezi, Farhad; Torres-Netto, Emilio A; Armia Balamoun, Ashraf; Giannaccare, Giuseppe; Bagaglia, Simone Alex",Eye and vision,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40662-021-00240-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931101/,553
78978,Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Youth and Staff Attending Day Camps.,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND Exercise and physical activity are key components of treatment for chronic respiratory diseases. However, the level of physical activity and adherence to exercise programs are low in people with these diseases. Active video games (AVGs) may provide a more engaging alternative to traditional forms of exercise. OBJECTIVE This review examines the effectiveness of game-based interventions on physiological outcome measures, as well as adherence and enjoyment in subjects with chronic respiratory diseases. METHODS A systematic search of the literature was conducted, with full texts and abstracts included where they involved an AVG intervention for participants diagnosed with respiratory conditions. A narrative synthesis of included studies was performed. Additionally, meta-analysis comparing AVGs with traditional exercise was undertaken for 4 outcome measures: mean heart rate (HR) during exercise, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) during exercise, dyspnea induced by the exercise, and enjoyment of the exercise. RESULTS A total of 13 full-text papers corresponding to 12 studies were included in the review. Interventions predominantly used games released for the Nintendo Wii (8 studies) and Microsoft Xbox Kinect (3 studies). There were 5 studies that examined the acute effects of a single session of AVGs and 7 studies that examined the long-term effects after multiple sessions of AVGs. Trials conducted over more than 1 session varied in duration between 3 and 12 weeks. In these, AVG interventions were associated with either similar or slightly greater improvements in outcomes such as exercise capacity when compared with a traditional exercise control, and they also generally demonstrated improvements over baseline or nonintervention comparators. There were a few studies of unsupervised AVG interventions, but the reported adherence was high and maintained throughout the intervention period. Additionally, AVGs were generally reported to be well liked and considered feasible by participants. For outcome measures measured during a single exercise session, there was no significant difference between an AVG and traditional exercise for HR (mean difference 1.44 beats per minute, 95% CI -14.31 to 17.18), SpO2 (mean difference 1.12 percentage points, 95% CI -1.91 to 4.16), and dyspnea (mean difference 0.43 Borg units, 95% CI -0.79 to 1.66), but AVGs were significantly more enjoyable than traditional exercise (Hedges g standardized mean difference 1.36, 95% CI 0.04-2.68). CONCLUSIONS This review provides evidence that AVG interventions, undertaken for several weeks, can provide similar or greater improvements in exercise capacity and other outcomes as traditional exercise. Within a single session of cardiovascular exercise, an AVG can evoke similar physiological responses as traditional exercise modalities but is more enjoyable to subjects with chronic respiratory diseases. However, there is very limited evidence for adherence and effectiveness in long-term unsupervised trials, which should be the focus of future research.","Simmich, Joshua; Deacon, Anthony J; Russell, Trevor G",JMIR serious games,https://doi.org/10.2196/10116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30801256/,553

Dry needling (DN) and trigger point manual therapy (TMPT) techniques are often used to manage MPS. OBJECTIVE To compare DN and TPMT for reducing pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) scores and improving function on the Neck Disability Index (NDI) in patients with neck and upper back MPS. METHODS PubMed, PEDro, and CINAHL were searched for randomized controlled trials within the last 10 years comparing a group receiving DN and the other receiving TPMT. Studies were assessed using PEDro scale and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool to assess methodological quality. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effect model. Standardized mean differences (Cohen's d) and confidence intervals were calculated to compare DN to TPMT for effects on VAS, PPT, and NDI. RESULTS Six randomized controlled trials with 241 participants total were included in this systematic review. The effect size of difference between DN and TPMT was non-significant for VAS [d = 0.41 (-0.18, 0.99)], for PPT [d = 0.64 (-0.19, 1.47)], and for NDI [d = -0.66 (-1.33, 0.02)]. CONCLUSIONS Both DN and TPMT improve pain and function in the short to medium term. Neither is more superior than the other.","Lew, Jennalyn; Kim, Jennifer; Nair, Preeti",The Journal of manual & manipulative therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/10669817.2020.1822618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962567/,553

Approximately 67.2% and 32.8% of cases were symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission accounted for 75.9% of the total recorded transmission. The reproductive number was 1.64 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-2.40) for G1-to-G2 transmission, decreasing to 0.31-0.39 in later generations, concomitant with implementation of rigorous control measures. Substantially higher infection risk was associated with contact within 5 d after the infectors had been infected, frequent contact and ≥8 h of contact duration. The spread of COVID-19 was effectively controlled in Wanzhou by breaking the transmission chain through social distancing, extensive contact tracing, mass testing and strict quarantine of close contacts.","Shi, Qiuling; Hu, Yaoyue; Peng, Bin; Tang, Xiao-Jun; Wang, Wei; Su, Kun; Luo, Chao; Wu, Bo; Zhang, Fan; Zhang, Yong; Anderson, Benjamin; Zhong, Xiao-Ni; Qiu, Jing-Fu; Yang, Cheng Yong; Huang, Ai-Long",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01178-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257893/,553
91096,SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in the United States-Challenges and Opportunities.,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND Level II-III inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombectomy for renal cell carcinoma is among the most challenging urologic oncologic surgeries. In 2015, we reported the initial series of robot-assisted level III caval thrombectomy. OBJECTIVE To describe our University of Southern California technique in a step-by-step fashion for robot-assisted IVC level II-III tumor thrombectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-five selected patients with renal neoplasm and level II-III IVC tumor thrombus underwent robot-assisted surgery with a minimum 1-yr follow-up (July 2011 to March 2015). SURGICAL PROCEDURE Our standardized anatomic-based ""IVC-first, kidney-last"" technique for robot-assisted IVC thrombectomy focuses on minimizing the chances of an intraoperative tumor thromboembolism and major hemorrhage. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline demographics, pathology data, 90-d and 1-yr complications, and oncologic outcomes at last follow-up were assessed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Robot-assisted IVC thrombectomy was successful in 24 patients (96%) (level III: n=11; level II: n=13); one patient was electively converted to open surgery for failure to progress. Median data included operative time of 4.5h, estimated blood loss was 240ml, hospital stay 4 d; five patients (21%) received intraoperative blood transfusion. All surgical margins were negative. Complications occurred in four patients (17%): two were Clavien 2, one was Clavien 3a, and one was Clavien 3b. All patients were alive at a 16-mo median follow-up (range: 12-39 mo). CONCLUSIONS Robotic IVC tumor thrombectomy is feasible for level II-III thrombi. To maximize intraoperative safety and chances of success, a thorough understanding of applied anatomy and altered vascular collateral flow channels, careful patient selection, meticulous cross-sectional imaging, and a highly experienced robotic team are essential. PATIENT SUMMARY We present the detailed operative steps of a new minimally invasive robot-assisted surgical approach to treat patients with advanced kidney cancer. This type of surgery can be performed safely with low blood loss and excellent outcomes. Even patients with advanced kidney cancer could now benefit from robotic surgery with a quicker recovery.","Chopra, Sameer; Simone, Giuseppe; Metcalfe, Charles; de Castro Abreu, Andre Luis; Nabhani, Jamal; Ferriero, Mariaconsiglia; Bove, Alfredo Maria; Sotelo, Rene; Aron, Monish; Desai, Mihir M; Gallucci, Michele; Gill, Inderbir S",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2016.08.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663048/,553
93447,How the US Failed to Prioritize SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance.,2021-03-24,"OBJECTIVE This present study reports the frequency and outcome of material failure of the silicone catheter lines of a port device implanted in the upper arm during a 5-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2006 to 2011, a total of 553 patients had a port device implanted percutaneously in the upper arm. In the spring of 2013, several instances of material failure led to device withdrawal. At that time, 39 patients (7.1%) with the specific device in situ were still alive, and 36 of these patients agreed to removal. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the log-transformed device dwell time. Random effects were modeled using group variables. The mean estimated values and their corresponding 95% CIs were reported. Nominal p values were reported, and two-sided p < 0.05 was considered to denote statistical significance. RESULTS Among the 553 patients, material failure was noticed in 19 patients (3.4%), with a mean estimated dwell time of 243 days (95% CI, 104-570 days). Specifically, complete rupture occurred in 10 patients (1.8%) after a mean of 322 days (95% CI, 95-1089 days), partial rupture occurred in eight patients (1.4%) after a mean of 190 days (95% CI, 61-596 days), and disconnection occurred in one patient (0.2%) 8 days after device placement. CONCLUSION The frequency of catheter line rupture was 3.4%. The mean estimated interval to rupture was less than a year, with an increasing probability of rupture noted in association with a longer dwell time. The exact cause of material failure remains unexplained, and further investigation of the mechanical properties contributing to rupture is required. Insight into the safety profile of these devices is needed to avoid potentially severe injury and improve the management of affected patients.","Busch, Jasmin D; Vens, Maren; Herrmann, Jochen; Adam, Gerhard; Ittrich, Harald",AJR.

108402,Sample collection and stabilization from saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection by qPCR.,2020-09-01,"INTRODUCTION Health literacy research has focused predominantly on the adult population, and much less is understood about this concept from an adolescent perspective. The tools currently available to measure adolescent health literacy have been adapted from adult versions. This limits their applicability to young people because of the developmental characteristics that impact on adolescents' behaviour, including impulse control and judgement skills. This protocol describes the intended development and validity testing of a questionnaire to measure health literacy in adolescents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol describes this mixed methods study that has three phases: the first phase will involve grounded research with adolescents using qualitative group interviews, co-design and concept mapping workshops to understand what health and healthy behaviours mean to adolescents and to explore their health literacy needs and the potential domains for the questionnaire. The draft health literacy domains identified will be presented to the youth advisory panel, and the questionnaire will be altered based on their feedback. Cognitive pretesting of the questionnaire items will also be conducted. Phase 2 will involve piloting the questionnaire to a two-stage random sample of young people in five urban and rural schools in Ireland. Test-retest reliability will be conducted using Pearson correlation coefficient. Confirmatory factor analysis will also be conducted to analyse the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Phase 3 will involve the questionnaire being rolled out to a nationally representative sample of adolescents (n=6052) in Ireland to assess their levels of health literacy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval to conduct this study has been granted from the University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee - Sciences (LS-20-08). Informed assent from adolescents and informed consent from parents/guardians will be sought. The findings of this research will be disseminated at national and international conferences, as well as through publication in peer-reviewed journals.","Spillane, Ailbhe; Belton, Sarahjane; McDermott, Clare; Issartel, Johann; Osborne, Richard H; Elmer, Shandell; Murrin, Celine",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177140/,553

Histology revealed severe atrophy of villi in all segments of the small intestines with occasional villus-epithelial syncytial cells, but testing for rotaviruses and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Alphacoronavirus 1) were negative. Negative-staining electron microscopy of feces revealed coronavirus-like particles and a pan-coronavirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to amplify a conserved region of the polymerase gene for all members in the family Coronaviridae produced expected 251-bp amplicons. Subsequent sequencing and analysis revealed 99.6-100% identity among the PCR amplicons from the 4 farms and 97-99% identity to the corresponding portion of the polymerase gene of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains, with the highest identity (99%) to strains from China in 2012. Findings were corroborated at National Veterinary Services Laboratories using 2 nested S-gene and 1 nested N-gene PCR tests where the sequenced amplicons also had the highest identity with 2012 China strains. Whole genome sequence for the virus from 2 farms in 2 different states using next-generation sequencing technique was compared to PEDV sequences available in GenBank. The 2013 U.S. PEDV had 96.6-99.5% identity with all known PEDV strains and the highest identity (>99.0%) to some of the 2011-2012 Chinese strains.

Here, on behalf of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) Working Group, we evaluate research on the potential risk of immune enhancement of disease by vaccines and viral infections, including coronavirus infections, together with emerging data about COVID-19 disease. Vaccine-associated enhanced disease has been rarely encountered with existing vaccines or viral infections. Although animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection may elucidate mechanisms of immune protection, we need observations of enhanced disease in people receiving candidate COVID-19 vaccines to understand the risk of immune enhancement of disease. Neither principles of immunity nor preclinical studies provide a basis for prioritizing among the COVID-19 vaccine candidates with respect to safety at this time. Rigorous clinical trial design and post-licensure surveillance should provide a reliable strategy to identify adverse events, including the potential for enhanced severity of COVID-19 disease, following vaccination.","Haynes, Barton F; Corey, Lawrence; Fernandes, Prabhavathi; Gilbert, Peter B; Hotez, Peter J; Rao, Srinivas; Santos, Michael R; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Watson, Michael; Arvin, Ann",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abe0948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077678/,553

This article describes the introduction of a new restructured referral pathway to reduce the burden on healthcare providers and create a safe environment. METHODS During January and February 2020 (group 1), all appointments were face-to-face with a walk-in eye casualty. The first audit cycle comprised all patients in group 1. The primary audit criteria were discharge rates, referral to subspeciality and reattendance. In April 2020, a remodelled system was implemented in which walk-in attendance ceased and was replaced with telephone triage coupled with digital imaging via NHS email for remote clinical review. Patients requiring further assessment following this triage were invited in for face-to-face appointments. A reaudit was conducted during April-July 2020 (group 2) following implementation of these COVID-19 protocol changes. RESULTS In group 1, 2868 appointments (100.0%) were face-to-face and in group 2 4870 (100.0%) appointments were telephone consults that resulted in 2639 (54.2%) face-to-face appointments. The rate of discharge in the first cycle and second cycle were 55.3% and 76.9% respectively (P<0.0001). Furthermore 2298 (47.2%) patients were able to be discharged following telephone consultation in group 2. CONCLUSIONS Using this telephone and digital imaging review triage system, the authors have demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for face-to-face reviews. The reduction in avoidable patient face-to-face reviews allows the system to move from saturated to sustainable while increasing accessibility to services for patients who may not be able to present for face-to-face review. This complete audit cycle successfully charts interventions that maximise accessibility, reduce unnecessary hospital visits and deliver safe and prompt management during the pandemic.","Moussa, George; Mushtaq, Fizza; Mandal, Priyanka; Mathews, Namita; Royal, Ben; Manjunatha, Nonavinakere; Lee, Rynn",British journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12968/hmed.2020.0408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377847/,553
139131,Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the prepandemic period in Italy.,2020-11-11,"OBJECTIVES We evaluated the performance of the MDR/XDR-TB Colour Test (CT) as an in-house thin-layer agar-based indirect drug susceptibility test (DST) in previously inexperienced settings in Estonia. METHODS After a two-day hands-on training, six panels of 150 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were cultured onto CT plates prepared in-house in two laboratories. Finally, triplicate readings of 900 CT plates resulted 18 DST patterns for each of the initial isolates. Time intervals to the results and for media preparations were estimated, as were intra- and interobserver agreements, test sensitivities and specificities calculated. BACTEC MGIT 960 DST was used as a reference. RESULTS The median time to produce DST results for isoniazid, rifampicin and levofloxacin was 13 days. The CT sensitivity ranged from 94.7% for levofloxacin to 95.8% and 97.3% for isoniazid and rifampicin, respectively. The test specificities were even higher exceeding 97% for all three drugs tested. Interobserver agreement reached 100% in one of the laboratories and exceeded 97% for levofloxacin and 99% for isoniazid and rifampicin in the second laboratory. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of the CT into a new laboratory was straightforward with only minimal guidance. This study proves that the CT is highly reproducible and easily interpreted by previously inexperienced personnel.","Klaos, Kadri; Agejeva, Anna; Kummik, Tiina; Laks, Sirje; Remets, Olesja; Sasi, Sirje; Tann, Anneli; Viiklepp, Piret; Altraja, Alan",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385582/,553
139623,"Free, At-Home Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Tests.",2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND DNA methylation, as an essential epigenetic modification found in mammals and plants, has been implicated to play an important role in insect reproduction. However, the functional role and the regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation during insect organ or tissue development are far from being clear. RESULTS Here, we found that DNA methylation inhibitor (5-aza-dC) treatment in newly molted pupae decreased the chitin content of pupal wing discs and adult wings and resulted in wing deformity of Bombyx mori. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the up-regulation of chitinase 10 (BmCHT10) gene might be related to the decrease of chitin content induced by 5-aza-dC treatment. Further, the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that DNA methylation suppressed the promoter activity of BmCHT10 by down-regulating the transcription factor, homeobox protein araucan (Bmara). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DNA pull-down and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bmara directly bound to the BmCHT10 promoter. Therefore, DNA methylation is involved in keeping the structural integrity of the silkworm wings from unwanted chitin degradation, as a consequence, it promotes the wing development of B. mori. CONCLUSIONS This study reveals that DNA methylation plays an important role in the wing development of B. mori. Our results support that the indirect transcriptional repression of a chitin degradation-related gene BmCHT10 by DNA methylation is necessary to keep the proper wing development in B. mori.","Xu, Guanfeng; Yi, Yangqin; Lyu, Hao; Gong, Chengcheng; Feng, Qili; Song, Qisheng; Peng, Xuezhen; Liu, Lin; Zheng, Sichun",Epigenetics & chromatin,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13072-020-00356-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887667/,553

They can be treated by surgery or embolization. Angiographic controls are usually performed rapidly after treatment in order to prove the cure of the lesion but no long term angiographies are generally scheduled. We wanted to control the stabilities of such lesions at follow up. Method - Clinical history and imaging of ninety-five patients with high flow shunts draining into venous ectasias (MAVFs, Vein of Galen malformations and dilatations) were reviewed. Results - De novo arteriovenous shunts related to angiogenesis involving vasa vasorum developed in three patients with MAVFs at various intervals. Genetic underlying conditions as HHT or RASA 1 mutations were suspected in each patient. Conclusions - Neo-angiogenesis can occur after cure of MAVFs. Long term imaging follow-ups should be considered as the natural history of such recurrent shunts is currently unknown.","Tsang, Chun Pong; Mizutani, Katsuhiro; Trenkler, Johannes; Holmin, Staffan; Rodesch, Georges",Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurad.2020.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32603766/,553

Despite imposing no risk, however, PPP supply reflects traditional measures of relationship lending: Decreasing in bank size;increasing in prior experience, in commitment lending, and in core deposits. Our results suggest a new benefit of bank relationships, as they help firms access government-subsidized lending. Consistent with this benefit, we show that bank PPP supply, based on the structure of the local banking sector, alleviates increases in unemployment. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

165412,SARS-CoV-2 Lambda Variant Remains Susceptible to Neutralization by mRNA Vaccine-elicited Antibodies and Convalescent Serum,2021-07-03,"COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although COVID-19 is characterized mainly by diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure, in some cases COVID-19 may acquire extra-respiratory features, including renal dysfunction that has existed earlier or developed de novo. The reasons for the extra-respiratory manifestations are biological properties of SARS-CoV-2 based on its multiple organ tropism. It has been shown that at least 50% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have proteinuria, hematuria, and signs of renal dysfunction, which in some cases reaches the degree of acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we present a review that discusses the clinical aspects and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney damage in COVID-19. It is believed that renal damage observed in this disease is the result of a complex mechanism induced directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 with the development of acute kidney injury. Two main pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney damage in COVID-19 are discussed. The first of them is the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the renal epithelium with the development of acute tubulonecrosis. The second mechanism is the cytokine storm syndrome that results from hyperactivation of the immune system with the development of acute renal and multiorgan infl ammatory damage accompanied by hypoxia, persistent hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, hyperactivation of the coagulation cascade, and microcirculation disorders. From a clinical point of view, it should be noted that signs of kidney damage are associated with an increase in the severity of COVID-19 and a poor outcome of the disease, and the prognosis becomes the worst with the development of AKI (the risk of death may increase by 5.3 times). The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with ESRD is higher than in the general population. The most typical for these patients is a severe course of the disease, which determines the increased mortality in comparison with the general population, caused by a respiratory failure with hyperactive infl ammation, cytokine storm, hemodynamic, and multiple organ failures. © 2021 JSC Vidal Rus.

167251,The influence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on national case fatality rates,2021-08-17,"In the U.S., those who lack broadband internet have limited ability to connect to care providers over a telemedicine video visit (VV). During the coronavirus disease pandemic, VVs have become increasingly common, but are not equitably accessible, which may exacerbate existing health disparities. Widening health disparities are of particular concern in the rural U.S. where broadband is lacking. We term this inequity in healthcare access due to limited internet access the ""digital health divide."" Because public libraries typically offer free use of broadband internet to patrons, they can help bridge the digital health divide and assist patrons with VVs. However, no guidelines currently exist for care providers and libraries to implement this needed, but potentially complex undertaking. Individual programs in which community members have used public libraries as a place from which to connect to a VV may offer insight into guidance needed. Thus, we conducted a scoping review to explore interventions reporting use of public libraries for community members to connect to a healthcare provider via telemedicine. One article was found describing the use of a public library for community members to connect to a telemedicine VV. The use of public libraries as spaces from which patrons can participate in VVs with providers is promising, but research is urgently needed to guide implementation.","DeGuzman, P.

It examines the level of social media adoption by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in protecting Filipino nationals abroad. The popularity of social networking sites among Filipinos, including DFA officials and staff, played a vital role in influencing the institution's move toward social media adoption. Key informant interviews were conducted with 10 officials, case officers, and staff at the DFA home office and Foreign Service Posts in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from June to July 2019. While Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can be effective tools for speedy communication between the DFA and OFWs, the DFA faces several challenges such as budgetary constraints, lack of human resources with ICT skills, and verifying reports, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the indispensable role of social media platforms in communicating with OFWs and in extending assistance to those in distress. Hence, the DFA may consider the formulation of an agency-wide social media strategy and collaboration with other migration authorities on social media-anchored projects.","Katigbak, J. J.

It falls under the stage of mild to moderate does not require hospitalization. If the patient's immune system is strong, they can recover on their own with proper nutrition and treatment. This disease has an impact on the human hormone system. A computer-aided diagnosis is needed to predict COVID-19. The blood volume must be determined in order to predict the disease's severity level. The blood vessels or capillaries provide oxygen to the Red Blood Cells (RBCs), and the RBCs, in turn, provide oxygen to the internal organs. The wall and lining of the alveolus and capillaries are damaged and thickened by COVID-19. The oxygen transfer by RBCs becomes extremely difficult as the wall thickens. The body has trouble breathing as a result of this condition. This is the most common cause of respiratory problems in COVID-19 patients. Respiratory issues cause problems on the retina, triggering haemorrhages. It also has an impact on the human digestive tract and taste buds. This has been confirmed in medical studies. As a result, of diagnosis, the proposed IoT-based method needs microscopic blood smear images, CT images of the digestive tract, X-ray images of the chest, and fundus images of the eye.

Additionally, the study also explores the possible strategies adopted by professional students to cope with the pandemic situation. Design/methodology/approach With an approach to establish a probable concrete relationship between fear with the level of stress, anxiety and depression, the data for the study was collected from 1,408 management students through a structured questionnaire designed in Google Form and administered through WhatsApp. The survey was carried out in the month of July and August 2020 during the lockdown period. Correlation and structural equation modeling have been used to examine the relationship among the test attributes. Findings The results from the study discovered that ""fear of COVID-19"" has a significant and considerable impact on the increased level of anxiety and stress among the professional students, but the observations did not demonstrate a significant influence of the ""fear"" on ""depression."" The responses reveal that students have developed anxiety and felt stressed mostly due to uncertainty in the upcoming academic plans, disturbances in their regular academic routines and concerns about their future careers. Further, the findings have portrayed that students have adopted both protective and avoidance coping strategies to overcome the adverse consequences of the pandemic. Research limitations/implications The study gives an insight on the psychological vulnerability of the management students and their capability to overcome such sudden disruptions due to pandemics.

In the spleens of anemic mice, CECs expansion-induced L-arginine depletion suppresses T-cell responses. In humans with anemia, CECs expand and express ARG1 and ARG2 that suppress T-cells IFN-γ production. Moreover, bone marrow CECs from healthy human donors suppress T-cells proliferation. CECs differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells potently suppress T-cell activation, proliferation, and IFN-γ production in an ARG- and ROS-dependent manner.

The mechanism underlying the regulation of these pathways upon Influenza A virus IAV infection is not well characterized. We report that a cytosolic DNA sensor IFI16 is essential for the activation of programmed cell death pathways in IAV infected cells. We have identified that IFI16 functions as an RNA sensor for influenza A virus by binding to genomic RNA. The activation of IFI16 triggers the production of type I, III interferons, and also other pro-inflammatory cytokines via the STING-TBK1 and Pro-caspase-1 signaling axis, thereby promoting cell death (apoptosis and pyroptosis in IAV infected cells). Whereas, IFI16 knockdown cells showed reduced inflammatory responses and also prevented cell mortality during IAV infection. These results demonstrate the pivotal role of IFI16-mediated IAV sensing and its essential role in activating programmed cell death pathways.","Mishra, Shalabh; Raj, Athira S; Kumar, Akhilesh; Rajeevan, Ashwathi; Kumari, Puja; Kumar, Himanshu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.13.431067,553

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerably reduced blood supply such that the importance of conserving donor RBCs for patients particularly in need is even more crucial (Shander, Anesth Analg 2020). While some patients with MDS experience improved QOL after transfusions, many do not, even at the same ECOG performance status (PS) and hemoglobin (Hb). In a pilot study, we sought to assess the feasibility of a peri-transfusion QOL assessment (PTQA;QOL assessed before and after transfusion) to determine if it could help inform future transfusion decisions for patients with MDS. METHODS: Starting in 2019, patients with MDS at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Yale School of Medicine, and Wake Forest University were screened for eligibility using clinic schedule reports in Epic;those 18 or older with biopsy-proven MDS presenting to clinic for RBC transfusions with no evidence of known CHF or unstable angina were eligible to participate. A Hb threshold of 7.5 g/dL or greater was required for participation (Tanasijevic, Leuk Lymph 2020). The QUALMS, a validated PRO for patients with MDS (Abel, Haematologica, 2016), was used to assess patients' QOL before and after RBC transfusion. At consent, patients were given a study packet including a copy of the QUALMS and were instructed to fill out the survey the day before their upcoming transfusion. One week after RBC transfusion, the patient completed the QUALMS again. Surveys were scored, compared, and compiled into a report that was sent to patients and providers (Figure). Based on the QUALMS validation study, we considered a change by 5 or more points to be potentially clinically significant. After descriptive statistics, two-sided Fisher's Exact tests assessed for associations between patient characteristics (ECOG PS and Hb) and post-transfusion increase in QOL. RESULTS: As of July 2020, a total of 57 patients had been enrolled. Of these, 28 (49%) have completed PTQA with both a pre-transfusion and post-transfusion QUALMS. Mean age was 72 years (standard deviation (SD)=11.6), 19% were female, and 89% had had one or more RBC transfusions within 8 weeks prior to enrollment. For the 29 patients who did not undergo PTQA, 11 are still awaiting their index transfusion;4 passed away before the index transfusion;4 were transplanted before the index transfusion;2 developed AML;7 later became ineligible or were lost to follow up;and 1 withdrew consent. Of the 28 who underwent PTQA, about half had an ECOG performance status of 1, and median Hb at transfusion was 8.05 g/dL (Table). The mean pre-transfusion QUALMS score was 56.1 (SD=15.3) and post-transfusion score was 59.3 (SD=18.0);overall, 35.7% experienced an increase in QOL. Patients with ECOG PS of 1 or 2 were no more likely to have an increase in QOL after RBC transfusion compared to those with PS of 0 (p=1.00). In contrast, 50% of patients with pre-transfusion Hb < 8.0 g/dL had an increase in QOL compared to 25% of patients with Hb >= 8.0 g/dL, although this difference also did not reach significance (p=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Although PTQA was feasible for about half of patients enrolled, there were many barriers when working with this high-risk MDS population. Moreover, only about one-third of patients experienced an increase in QOL one week after RBC transfusion, arguing that, for some patients, a more limited transfusion schedule may be possible.

In pathologies with clinical characteristics similar to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, most patients showed cognitive deficits after discharge from ICU. Further studies are needed to explore global cognitive impairment among PICS patients after COVID-19 infection.ObjectivesTo analyse the global cognitive functioning in patients with PICS after COVID-19 infection in a Functional Rehabilitation Unit in Madrid (Spain) using the Spanish version of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S).MethodsThis study was conducted in the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, in Madrid (Spain). A sample of 17 PICS adult patients was included, with age ranging from 56 to 74 years old (mean = 68.35 years;13 males). Patients were assessed around three weeks after referral from their reference hospital. The total score of the SCIP-S was used as outcome. Descriptive analyses were conducted (mean and standard deviation) on standardized scores (z) based on age-adjusted general population norms. Significant impairment was set at z < -1.5.ResultsMean total z-score on SCIP-S was -1.08 (S.D. = .82) from the total sample, with 52.9% of cases with significant impairment (mean = -1.74;S.D. = .21).ConclusionsThese preliminary results show the probable presence of mild-moderate global cognitive impairment in a relevant proportion of patients after COVID-19 infection.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess incidence of postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated HCWs. METHODS: We searched multiple databases from inception through August 2021 to identify studies that reported on incidence of postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs. Meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled proportions of COVID-19 infection in partially and fully vaccinated individuals. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 228,873 HCWs were included in the final analysis. Total number of partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and unvaccinated HCWs were 132,922, 155,673 and 17505, respectively. Overall pooled proportion of COVID-19 infections among partially/fully vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs was 2.1% (95% CI 1.2-3.5). Among partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs, pooled proportion of COVID-19 infections was 3.7% (95% CI 1.8-7.3), 1.3% (95% CI 0.6-2.9), and 10.1% (95% CI 4.5-19.5), respectively. DISCUSSION: Our analysis shows the risk of COVID-19 infection in both partially and fully vaccinated HCWs remains exceedingly low when compared to unvaccinated individuals. There remains an urgent need for all frontline HCWs to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chandan, S.; Khan, S. R.; Deliwala, S.; Mohan, B. P.; Ramai, D.; C.

In contrast, quiescent basal cells contribute to tissue repair during adult tissue regeneration by shifting from slow-cycling to proliferating and subsequently back to slow-cycling. Although sustained basal cell proliferation results in tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanisms regulating these transitions remain unknown. Using temporal single-cell transcriptomics of developing murine airway progenitors and in vivo genetic validation experiments, we found that Tgfß signaling slowed down cell cycle by inhibiting Id2 expression in airway progenitors and contributed to the specification of slow-cycling basal cell population during development. In adult tissue regeneration, reduced Tgfß signaling restored Id2 expression and initiated epithelial regeneration. Id2 overexpression and Tgfbr2 knockout enhanced epithelial proliferation; however, persistent Id2 expression in basal cells drove hyperplasia at a rate that resembled a precancerous state. Together, the Tgfß-Id2 axis commonly regulates the proliferation transitions in airway basal cells during development and regeneration, and its fine-tuning is critical for normal regeneration while avoiding basal cell hyperplasia.","Kiyokawa, Hirofumi; Yamaoka, Akira; Matsuoka, Chisa; Tokuhara, Tomoko; Abe, Takaya; Morimoto, Mitsuru",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.394908,553

182616,Modeling the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a partially vaccinated population,2021-09-26,"Bats are natural reservoirs for both Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses and the hypothesized original hosts of five of seven known zoonotic coronaviruses. To date, the vast majority of bat coronavirus research has been concentrated in Asia, though coronaviruses are globally distributed; indeed, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related Betacoronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus have been identified circulating in Rhinolophid bats in both Africa and Europe, despite the relative dearth of surveillance in these regions. As part of a long-term study examining the dynamics of potentially zoonotic viruses in three species of endemic Madagascar fruit bat (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, Rousettus madagascariensis), we carried out metagenomic Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) on urine, throat, and fecal samples obtained from wild-caught individuals. We report detection of RNA derived from Betacoronavirus subgenus Nobecovirus in fecal samples from all three species and describe full genome sequences of novel Nobecoviruses in P. rufus and R. madagascariensis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the existence of five distinct Nobecovirus clades, one of which is defined by the highly divergent sequence reported here from P. rufus bats. Madagascar Nobecoviruses derived from P. rufus and R. madagascariensis demonstrate, respectively, Asian and African phylogeographic origins, mirroring those of their fruit bat hosts. Bootscan recombination analysis indicates significant selection has taken place in the spike, nucleocapsid, and NS7 accessory protein regions of the genome for viruses derived from both bat hosts. Madagascar offers a unique phylogeographic nexus of bats and viruses with both Asian and African phylogeographic origins, providing opportunities for unprecedented mixing of viral groups and, potentially, recombination. As fruit bats are handled and consumed widely across Madagascar for subsistence, understanding the landscape of potentially zoonotic coronavirus circulation is essential for mitigation of future zoonotic threats.","Kettenburg, Gwenddolen; Kistler, Amy; Ranaivoson, Hafaliana Christian; Ahyong, Vida; Andrianiaina, Angelo; Andry, Santino; DeRisi, Joseph L.; Gentles, Anecia; Raharinosy, Vololoniaina; Randriambolamanantsoa, Tsiry Hasina; Fifi Ravelomanantsoa, Ny Anjara; Tato, Cristina M.; Dussart, Philippe; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Brook, Cara E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462406,553

201046,Self-contained system for mitigation of contaminated aerosol sources of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen HAb18G/CD147, a member of CD147 family, could promote tumour invasion and metastasis via inducing the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). Anti-CD147 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have exhibited obvious inhibitory effect on MMP induction. However, none of the epitopes of these MoAb has been reported. We previously prepared five MoAb against HAb18G/CD147, named HAb18, 3B3, 1B3, 5A5 and 4D2. To map the epitopes of these MoAb, a series of truncated fragments of extracellular region of HAb18G/CD147 was expressed in Escherichia coli and the MoAb-binding affinity to these fragments was examined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The residues (39)LTCSLNDSATEV(50), (36)KILLTCS(42) and (22)AAGTVFTTVEDL(33) were determined to be the epitopes of HAb18, 3B3 and 1B3, respectively, which were further proved by a dot-blot analysis with synthesized peptides and bioinformatics epitope prediction. The binding regions of MoAb 5A5 and 4D2 were located at residues E(120)-R(203). Then we constructed and expressed full-length HAb18G/CD147 and truncated HAb18G/CD147 without residues A(22)-V(50) in COS-7 cells. Gelatin zymography and Boyden chamber assay showed that the COS-7 cells expressing truncated HAb18G/CD147 failed to induce MMP production and enhance the cells' invasive potential, compared with the cells expressing full-length HAb18G/CD147. Taken together with the obviously inhibitory effects of HAb18 on the function of full-length HAb18G/CD147, these findings suggest that residues (22)AAGTVFTTVEDLGSKILLTCSLNDSATEV(50) may play a critical role in the functions of HAb18G/CD147 on MMP secretion and tumour invasion.

METHODS: The neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and antibodies targeting nucleocapsid (N), spike protein (S), and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in longitudinal plasma samples from the LOTUS China trial were measured by microneutralization assay and ELISA. Viral load was determined by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 576 plasma and 576 throat swabs were collected from 191 COVID-19 patients. Antibody titers related to adverse outcome and clinical improvement were analysed. Multivariable adjusted generalized linear mixed model for random effects were developed. RESULTS: After day 28 post symptoms onset, the rate of antibody positivity reached 100% for RBD-IgM, 97.8% for S-IgM, 100% for N-IgG, 100% for RBD-IgG, 91.1% for N-IgM and 91.1% for NAbs. The NAbs titers increased over time in both survivors and non-survivors and correlated to IgG antibodies against N, S and RBD, while its presence showed no statistical correlation with death.

Results from a North-West Italy hospital,2021,"Background: Southern African countries adopted diverse responses to the challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which manifested itself as both a health and economic disaster. Aim: Using a case study approach of two South African countries, namely Botswana and South Africa, the article assessed their response measures to the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: Southern African countries applied ‘domesticated’ forms of responses thus, there has been no one-size-fits-all approach to managing the pandemic. Methods: The study adopted a qualitative approach. Two case studies namely Botswana and South Africa were used. Documentary evidence was drawn from these case studies. Results: To ensure that Southern African countries and indeed the world in general navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed operational planning guidelines that had sought to balance the demands of responding effectively to COVID-19 and the need to serve economies from collapse. However, an analysis of the programmes of responses in South African countries such as Botswana showed the ‘domestication’ of the guidelines. Nevertheless, the guidelines, although having met with criticism in some cases had significantly contributed to the effective management of COVID-19 health and economic effects. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic required the state and its institutions to exercise effective leadership and unified action. In South African countries such as Botswana and South Africa, this pandemic showed the importance of governments in shaping the effectiveness of national responses, strategies and approaches in tackling the crisis.","Masiya, Tyanai Mandiyanike David Molosiwa Dintle Mazenda Adrino",Africa&#039;s Public Service Delivery and Performance Review,,553
207812,Observations of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.1.7 at the UK's largest hospital Trust,2021,"Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a rapid and inexpensive isothermal alternative to the current gold standard reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, unlike RT-qPCR, there are no consensus detection regions or optimal RT-LAMP methods, and most protocols do not include internal controls to ensure reliability. Naked RNAs, plasmids, or even RNA from infectious COVID-19 patients have been used as external positive controls for RT-LAMP assays, but such reagents lack the stability required for full-process control. To overcome the lack of proper internal and external positive controls and the instability of the detection RNA, we developed virus-like particles (VLPs) using bacteriophage Qß and plant virus cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) for the encapsidation of target RNA, namely a so-called SARS-CoV-2 LAMP detection module (SLDM). The target RNA is a truncated segment of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene and human RNase P gene (internal control) as positive controls for RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP. Target RNAs stably encapsidated in Qß and CCMV VLPs were previously shown to function as full-process controls in RT-qPCR assays, and here we show that SLDMs can fulfill the same function for RT-LAMP and swab-to-test (direct RT-LAMP with heat lysis) assays. The SLDM was validated in a clinical setting, highlighting the promise of VLPs as positive controls for molecular assays.","Chan, Soo Khim; Du, Pinyi; Ignacio, Caroline; Mehta, Sanjay; Newton, Isabel G; Steinmetz, Nicole F",Biomacromolecules,,553

209040,Forewarned is forearmed: chronic spontaneous urticaria as a potential risk to effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake and global public health,2021,"BACKGROUND: If globally implemented, a safe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination program will have broad clinical and socioeconomic benefits. However, individuals who anticipate that the coronavirus vaccine will bring life back to normality may be disappointed, due to the emerging antivaccination attitude within the general population. METHODS: We surveyed a sample of adult Polish citizens (n = 1066), and compared it with the data on international COVID-19 vaccine reluctance. RESULTS: In 20 national surveys, the vaccine averseness for the anticipated COVID-19 vaccine varied from meager (2-6% China) to very high (43%, Czech Republic, and 44%, Turkey) and in most countries was much higher than regular vaccination reluctance, which varies between 3% (Egypt) and 55% (Russia). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a 67% herd immunity may be possible only if mandatory preventive vaccination programs start early and are combined with coordinated education efforts supported by legislative power and social campaigns.","Feleszko, Wojciech; Lewulis, Piotr; Czarnecki, Adam; Waszkiewicz, Pawel",,,553
211325,Public health actions to control new SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021,"OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 has evolved rapidly into several genetic clusters. However, data on mutations during the course of infection are scarce. This study aims to determine viral genome diversity in serial samples of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Targeted deep sequencing of the spike gene was performed on serial respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. Sanger sequencing was then performed to confirm the single nucleotide polymorphisms. RESULTS: A total of 28 serial respiratory specimens from 12 patients were successfully sequenced using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. A 75-year-old patient with severe disease had a mutation, G22017T, identified in the second specimen. The frequency of G22017T increased from &#8804;5% (nanopore: 3.8%; Illumina: 5%) from the first respiratory tract specimen (sputum) to &#8805;60% (nanopore: 67.7%; Illumina: 60.4%) in the second specimen (saliva; collected 2 days after the first specimen). The difference in G22017T frequency was also confirmed by Sanger sequencing. G22017T corresponds to W152L amino acid mutation in the spike protein which was only found in <0.03% of the sequences deposited into a public database. Spike amino acid residue 152 is located within the N-terminal domain, which mediates the binding of a neutralizing antibody. DISCUSSION: A spike protein amino acid mutation W152L located within a neutralizing epitope has appeared naturally in a patient. Our study demonstrated that monitoring of serial specimens is important in identifying hotspots of mutations, especially those occurring at neutralizing epitopes which may affect the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies.","Ip, Jonathan Daniel; Kok, Kin-Hang; Chan, Wan-Mui; Chu, Allen Wing-Ho; Wu, Wai-Lan; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; To, Wing-Kin; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Leung, Wai-Shing; Chik, Thomas Shiu-Hong; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang",Clin. microbiol. infect,,553

Infected children may be asymptomatic or present fever, dry cough, fatigue or gastrointestinal symptoms. The CDC recommends that clinicians should decide to test patients based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 42 children (the majority < 5 years of age) were referred, to our Pediatric Department, as possible cases of COVID-19 infection. Blood analysis, chest X-ray, and naso-oropharyngeal swab specimens for viral identification of COVID-19 were requested. RESULTS: None of the screened children resulted positive for COVID-19 infection. At first presentation, the most frequent signs and symptoms were: fever (71.4%), fatigue (35.7%) and cough (30.9%). An high C-reactive protein value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (bronchial wall thickening) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively. Almost half of patients (45.2%) required hospitalization in our Pediatric Unit and one patient in Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS: Testing people who meet the COVID-19 suspected case definition criteria is essential for clinical management and outbreak control. Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults, as reported in our preliminary survey. Further studies are needed to confirm our observations.","Nicoletti, Angela; Talarico, Valentina; Sabetta, Lucilla; Minchella, Pasquale; Colosimo, Manuela; Fortugno, Carmelo; Galati, Maria Concetta; Raiola, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,,553

The aim of this study is to characterize the extent of MS patients' perceptions of risk and adherence to care during the pandemic. METHODS: A survey was emailed to patients from a large MS center in New York City during the local peak of the pandemic to assess perceptions of infection risk and adherence to MS care including appointments, laboratory studies, MRIs, and taking disease-modifying therapies (DMT). RESULTS: 529 patients from the MS center responded to the survey during two weeks in April 2020. Patients collectively showed concern about becoming infected with COVID-19 (88%) and perceived a higher infection risk due of having MS (70%) and taking DMTs (68%). Patients frequently postponed appointments (41%), laboratory studies (46%), and MRIs (41%). Noncompliance with DMTs was less common (13%). Decisions to alter usual recommendations for care were made by the patient more often than by the provider regarding adherence to appointments (68%), laboratory studies (70%), MRI (67%), and DMT (65%). Degree of concern for infection was associated with adherence to appointments (p=0.020) and laboratory studies (p=0.016) but not with adherence to MRI and DMTs. Thirty-five patients reported being tested for COVID-19, of whom fourteen reported a positive test. CONCLUSION: Patients with MS were highly concerned about becoming infected during the local peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Behaviors that deviated from originally recommended MS care were common and often self-initiated, but patients were overall compliant with continuing DMTs.","Zhang, Yinan; Staker, Erin; Cutter, Gary; Krieger, Stephen; Miller, Aaron E",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,553

In contrast to a standard SIR model, we find that the incidence of COVID-19 spread is concave in the number of infectious individuals, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. This concave shape has a significant impact on forecasted COVID-19 cases. In particular, our model forecasts that the number of COVID-19 cases would only have an exponential growth for a brief period at the beginning of the contagion event or right after a reopening, but would quickly settle into a prolonged period of time with stable, slightly declining levels of disease spread. This pattern is consistent with observed levels of COVID-19 cases in the US, but inconsistent with standard SIR modeling. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19.","Liu, Meng; Thomadsen, Raphael; Yao, Song",Sci Rep,,553

226813,How to coordinate vaccination and social distancing to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks,2020-12-22,"Protected areas (PAs) are the cornerstone of global conservation policy and have expanded dramatically over the last century. Though unequivocally beneficial for biodiversity, gazetting land for protecting nature can also be seen as an 'opportunity cost' that some politicians are unwilling to pay. One of the most effective strategies to increase the political resilience of PAs in the face of such threats is to demonstrate their broader value to society. This is one of the objectives of the recently proposed 'PA asset framework'. The framework conceptualizes PAs as being composed of suites of biophysical, human, infrastructure, institutional and cultural assets that interact with individuals and institutions to generate different forms of tangible and intangible value. Here, we test the utility of the framework by conducting an asset-based analysis of Brazilian National Parks (NPs) at two different scales (NP system and NP unit). Assets were identified at the system level through a systematic review of 49 Management Plans (MPs) using a typology of PA asset classes as a tool for characterising the presence and state of assets in or associated with NPs. At the NP unit level, assets were identified through semi-structured interviews with local managers of the Chapada Diamantina National Park. Biophysical and infrastructure assets were the most represented asset classes at both scales. Our analysis successfully revealed: (i) which assets can be managed to generate wider forms of values at local scale (e.g. natural spectacles, iconic species, park volunteers) (ii) relational values between assets (e.g. trails and outdoor recreational features), and (iii) value generating practices (VGPs) to capture values from the interaction between different assets (i.e. restoration of degraded areas through voluntary programmes, etc.). We conclude by discussing how the PA asset framework can be operatively integrated into NP management to improve the future allocation of limited financial resources.","Bragagnolo, Chiara; Correia, Ricardo A; Gamarra, Norah Costa; Lessa, Thainá; Jepson, Paul; Malhado, Ana C M; Ladle, Richard J",J Environ Manage,,553

This was one of the main reasons behind the difference in the disease fatality rates between countries. In this study, the public progressive measures taken in Saudi Arabia (SA) are described in detail. This is a descriptive study in which measures were retrieved via the government official news agency-Saudi Press Agency (SPA). The total number of Covid-19 cases and its fatality rate were obtained/calculated from the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) official Covid-19 port, as well as the WHO COVID-19 dashboard. SA took active measures in order to interrupt the spread of Covid-19 which were strict, rapid, and progressive in nature. Social distancing was at the heart of almost every measure taken by the government. The main themes of these interventions are as follows: travel bans, suspending religious activities, closure of non-essential shops, enforcing changes at workplaces, and imposing curfews. This was followed by the gradual return to working life with various precautions to prevent a spike in the number of cases. The imposed measures in SA succeeded in reducing the burden of Covid-19 and its fatality rate. Comparatively, the fatality rate in SA was significantly lower compared to developed countries with better healthcare infrastructure such as the United States and United Kingdom.","Sayed, Anwar A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,553

All individuals of all age groups are at risk of COVID-19. This study aims to describe the knowledge and attitude of Jordanian parents regarding COVID-19 in children, including clinical signs of the disease, modes of transmission and protection measures. METHOD: A cross-section study amongst Jordanian parents was conducted. The size of the sample was 810. Information regarding the clinical signs of the disease, modes of transmission, protection measures against COVID-19 and satisfaction with governmental measures was collected. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the parents had a good understanding of the clinical signs, mode of transmission and protection measures and were satisfied with governmental measures. According to the parents' responses, the resource they used the most about COVID-19 was social media (78%), followed by news channels. Many correctly stated that fever was a clinical sign, followed by cough (77%). Almost 90% of the parents have an appropriate attitude towards companioning children within crowds. Generally, people are more susceptible to the virus within crowds. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we believe that the findings reported here are important for understanding the clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in children, from the perspective of parents.

237917,Vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 variants: the urgent need for a correlate of protection,2021,"Purpose: When a large-scale outbreak such as the COVID-19 pandemic happens, organizations that are responsible for delivering relief may face a lack of both provisions and human resources Governments are the primary source for the humanitarian supplies required during such a crisis;however, coordination with humanitarian NGOs in handling such pandemics is a vital form of public-private partnership (PPP) Aid organizations have to consider not only the total degree of demand satisfaction in such cases but also the obligation that relief goods such as medicine and foods should be distributed as equitably as possible within the affected areas (AAs) Design/methodology/approach: Given the challenges of acquiring real data associated with procuring relief items during the COVID-19 outbreak, a comprehensive simulation-based plan is used to generate 243 small, medium and large-sized problems with uncertain demand, and these problems are solved to optimality using GAMS Finally, post-optimality analyses are conducted, and some useful managerial insights are presented Findings: The results imply that given a reasonable measure of deprivation costs, it can be important for managers to focus less on the logistical costs of delivering resources and more on the value associated with quickly and effectively reducing the overall suffering of the affected individuals It is also important for managers to recognize that even though deprivation costs and transportation costs are both increasing as the time horizon increases, the actual growth rate of the deprivation costs decreases over time Originality/value: In this paper, a novel mathematical model is presented to minimize the total costs of delivering humanitarian aid for pandemic relief With a focus on sustainability of operations, the model incorporates total transportation and delivery costs, the cost of utilizing the transportation fleet (transportation mode cost), and equity and deprivation costs Taking social costs such as deprivation and equity costs into account, in addition to other important classic cost terms, enables managers to organize the best possible response when such outbreaks happen © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Malmir, B.; Zobel, C.

At our institution, we attempt treatment of nearly all closed, isolated tibial shaft fractures. The purpose of this study was to report the results of 10 years of experience to develop a tool to identify patients for whom non-operative treatment of tibial shaft fractures may be a viable option METHOD: This was a retrospective review of patients with tibial shaft fracture seen at a level 1 trauma center over 10 years. Patients with closed, isolated injuries underwent sedation, closed reduction, long-leg casting, and outpatient follow-up. Patients were converted to surgery for inability to obtain or maintain acceptable alignment or patient intolerance. Radiographic characteristics and patient demographics were extracted. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a model to predict which patient and injury characteristics determined success of nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: 334 patients were identified with isolated, closed tibial shaft fractures, who were reduced and treated in a long leg cast. 234 patients (70%) converted to surgical treatment due to inability to maintain alignment, patient intolerance, and nonunion. In a regression model, coronal/sagittal translation, sagittal angulation, fracture morphology, and smoking status were shown to be significant predictors of success of nonoperative treatment (p < 0.05). We developed a Tibial Operative Outcome Likelihood (TOOL) score designed to help predict success or failure of closed treatment. The TOOL score can be used to identify a subsegment of patients with injuries amenable to closed treatment (38% of injuries) with a nonoperative success rate over 60%. CONCLUSION: Non-operative treatment of tibial shaft fractures is feasible, although there is a relatively high conversion rate to operative treatment. However, it is possible to use injury characteristics to identify a cohort of patients with a higher chance of success with closed treatment, which is potentially useful in a resource-constrained setting or for patients who wish to avoid surgery.

The recent global spread of COVID-19 has fostered diverse initiatives such as the 'Safe Hands' challenge led by the World Health Organization. Individuals are encouraged to regularly wash their hands for 40-60 s under running water with soap. This call for 'Safe Hands' comes at a time when water insecurity and limited access to handwashing facilities in Africa is heightened. In this article, Chitungwiza city in Zimbabwe is used as a case study to assess the implications of the 'Safe Hands' challenge for poor municipalities in developing countries and characterize the challenges they face. To do so, interviews were conducted at water points/boreholes used by residents during Zimbabwe's COVID-19 national lockdown. The calculation of water requirements for proper hand hygiene determined the capacity for water-stressed regions to effectively implement 'Safe Hands'. On average, it was established that one person consumes an extra 4.5 L per day of water when they practice WHO 'Safe Hands' in the context of COVID-19. This increases domestic water demand in Chitungwiza by 9%. Due to water scarcity, people in Chitungwiza were experiencing challenges with practicing 'Safe Hands'. With their 'dry taps' woes, they might not be able to meet the standards of this WHO challenge. Lack of soap also reduced the effectiveness of the 'Safe Hands' challenge. This paper proposes short- and long-term measures that would allow effective implementation of the 'Safe Hands' by means of sustainable potable water supply. These measures include extensive social awareness and temporary change of household water use behavior. Municipalities are recommended to establish public private partnerships (PPPs) to create immediate and long-term water investments. Structural and transformational reforms would enhance, through flexible planning, investments for both water infrastructure and governance. This narrative has the potential to improve the urban water systems resiliency against future pandemics.","Zvobgo, Luckson; Do, Pierre",Water Res X,,553

The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-20) and the Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) were administered as measures of depression and anxiety, respectively. The multi-variant logistic and multiple linear regression identified factors associated with depression and anxiety.Results: Probable depression and anxiety were reported by 26.47% and 70.78% of all respondents, respectively. After adjusting for demographic and community variables, quarantined respondents reported a higher likelihood to exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety than those not quarantined. Respondents living in communities where screening for COVID-19 was required were less likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms.Conclusion: The incidence of depression and anxiety among quarantined respondents was significantly higher than that of respondents not quarantined, and twice as common among quarantined respondents in unaffected areas as those in affected areas. Appropriate community screening may reduce the risk of depression and anxiety during an epidemic.","Tang, Fang; Liang, Jing; Zhang, Hai; Kelifa, Mohammedhamid Mohammedosman; He, Qiqiang; Wang, Peigang",Psychol Health,,553

Multidisciplinary public health rapid response teams (RRTs) are one mechanism used within a larger COVID-19 outbreak response strategy. As COVID-19 RRTs are deployed, countries are facing operational challenges in optimizing their RRT's impact, while ensuring the safety of their RRT responders. From March to May 2020, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received requests from 12 countries for technical assistance related to COVID-19 RRTs and emergency operations support. Challenges included: (1) an insufficient number of RRT responders available for COVID-19 deployments; (2) limited capacity to monitor RRT responders' health, safety, and resiliency; (3) difficulty converting critical in-person RRT operational processes to remote information technology platforms; and (4) stigmatization of RRT responders hindering COVID-19 interventions. Although geographically and socioeconomically diverse, these 12 countries experienced similar RRT operational challenges, indicating potential applicability to other countries. As the response has highlighted the critical need for immediate and effective implementation measures, addressing these challenges is essential to ensuring an impactful and sustainable COVID-19 response strategy globally.","Anantharam, Puneet; Hoffman, Adela; Noonan, Michelle; Bugli, Dante; Pechta, Laura; Bornemann, Jennifer; Victory, Kerton R; Greiner, Ashley L",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,553

252038,Increased mortality in community-tested cases of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7,2021,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a common commensal bacterium in adults but remains a leading source of invasive infections in newborns, pregnant women, and the elderly, and more recently, causes an increased incidence of invasive disease in nonpregnant adults. Reduced penicillin susceptibility and emerging resistance to non-ß-lactams pose challenges for the development and implementation of novel, nonantimicrobial strategies to reduce the burden of GBS infections. Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) via the production of singlet oxygen or other reactive oxygen species leads to the successful eradication of pathogenic bacteria, affecting numerous cellular targets of microbial pathogens and indicating a low risk of resistance development. Nevertheless, we have previously reported possible aPDI tolerance development upon repeated sublethal aPDI applications; thus, the current work was aimed at investigating whether aPDI tolerance could be observed for GBS and what mechanisms could cause it. To address this problem, 10 cycles of sublethal aPDI treatments employing rose bengal as a photosensitizer, were applied to the S. agalactiae ATCC 27956 reference strain and two clinical isolates (2306/02 and 2974/07, serotypes III and V, respectively). We demonstrated aPDI tolerance development and stability after 5 cycles of subculturing with no aPDI exposure. Though the treatment resulted in a stable phenotype, no increases in mutation rate or accumulated genetic alterations were observed (employing a RIF-, CIP-, STR-resistant mutant selection assay and cyl sequencing, respectively). qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that 10 sublethal aPDI exposures led to increased expression of all tested major oxidative stress response elements; changes in sodA, ahpC, npx, cylE, tpx and recA expression indicate possible mechanisms of developed tolerance. Increased expression upon sublethal aPDI treatment was reported for all but two genes, namely, ahpC and cylE. aPDI targeting cylE was further supported by colony morphology changes induced with 10 cycles of aPDI (increased SCV population, increased hemolysis, increased numbers of dark- and unpigmented colonies). In oxidant killing assays, aPDI-tolerant strains demonstrated no increased tolerance to hypochlorite, superoxide (paraquat), singlet oxygen (new methylene blue) or oxidative stress induced by aPDI employing a structurally different photosensitizer, i.e., zinc phthalocyanine, indicating a lack of cross resistance. The results indicate that S. agalactiae may develop stable aPDI tolerance but not resistance when subjected to multiple sublethal phototreatments, and this risk should be considered significant when defining efficient anti-S. agalactiae aPDI protocols.","Pieranski, Michal; Sitkiewicz, Izabela; Grinholc, Mariusz",Free radic. biol. med,,553

IGF-1 has been implicated in ARDS, yet its role in relation to COVID-19-related lung injury has not been investigated. We hypothesize that blockage of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mitigates lung injury and decreases the risk of death in patients COVID-19-related ARDS. Patients with fibroproliferative ARDS have been shown to have increased IGF-1 and IGF-1R staining in lung tissue specimens. Rising levels of IGF-1 in bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) and increased IGF-1 mRNA expression in lung tissues (but declining serum IGF-1 levels) have been found in late stage ARDS compared with early lung injury. Blockage of IGF-1R decreases lung tissue damage and increases survival in bleomycin-induced as well as H1N1 influenza-related lung injury in animal models. Teprotumumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1R that was FDA-approved in 2020 for the treatment of Graves' orbitopathy. In order to determine if teprotumumab may reduce lung injury and death related to ARDS in the setting of COVID-19, preliminary clinical data is needed. IGF-1 levels in serum and BAL fluid must be measured in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. Histopathology from lung samples from patients with COVID-19-related ARDS must be examined for increased expression of the IGF-1R. Once these are ascertained, and if the data support IGF-1 involvement, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2A trial of teprotumumab therapy in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS and non-COVID-19-related ARDS designed to generate initial data on short-term efficacy, safety, dosing and administration should be performed.","Winn, Bryan J",Med Hypotheses,,553
254477,Sensitivity and Efficiency of RNA Sample Pooling for RT-qPCR Testing for SARS-CoV-2 (preprint),2021,"The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has had a huge impact on people's lives all over the world, and the overwhelmingly negative information about the epidemic has made people panic for the future. This kind of panic spreads and develops through online social networks, and further spreads to the offline environment, which triggers panic buying behavior and has a serious impact on social stability. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, a two-layer propagation model of panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic is constructed. The model first analyzes the formation process of individual panic from a micro perspective, and then combines the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model to simulate the spread of group behavior. Then, through simulation experiments, the main factors affecting the spread of panic buying behavior are discussed. The experimental results show that: (1) the dissipating speed of individual panics is related to the number of interactions and there is a threshold. When the number of individuals involved in interacting is equal to this threshold, the panic of the group dissipates the fastest, while the dissipation speed is slower when it is far from the threshold; (2) The reasonable external information release time will affect the occurrence of the second panic buying, meaning providing information about the availability of supplies when an escalation of epidemic is announced will help prevent a second panic buying. In addition, when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second panic buying is to be suppressed, it is better to release positive information after the end of the first panic buying, rather than ahead of the end; and (3) Higher conformity among people escalates panic, resulting in panic buying. Finally, two cases are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.","Fu, Peihua; Jing, Bailu; Chen, Tinggui; Xu, Chonghuan; Yang, Jianjun; Cong, Guodong",Front Public Health,,553

The ravages of COVID-19 are leading to profound crises across the world. There is an urgent requirement for analyzing the current pandemic situation, predicting trends over time, and assessing the effectiveness of containment measures. Thus, numerous statistical models, primarily based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered or removed (SEIR) model, have been established. However, these models are highly technical, which are difficult for the public and governing bodies to understand and use. To address this issue, we developed a simple operating software based on our improved K-SEIR model termed as the kernelkernel SEIR simulator (K-SEIR-Sim). This software includes natural propagation parameters, containment measure parameters, and certain characteristic parameters that can deduce the effects of natural propagation and containment measures. Further, the applicability of the proposed software was demonstrated using the example of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States and the city of Wuhan, China. Operating results verified the potency of the proposed software in evaluating the epidemic situation and human intervention during COVID-19. Importantly, the software can perform real-time, backward-looking, and forward-looking analysis by functioning in data-driven and model-driven ways. All of them have considerable practical values in their applications according to the actual needs of personal use. Conclusively, K-SEIR-Sim is the first simple customized operating software that is highly valuable for the global fight against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","Wang, Hongzhi; Miao, Zhiying; Zhang, Chaobao; Wei, Xiaona; Li, Xiangqi",,,553

In this study, we compare twelve deep learning algorithms using a multi-center dataset, including both open-source and in-house developed algorithms. Results show that ensembling different methods can boost the overall test set performance for lung segmentation, binary lesion segmentation and multiclass lesion segmentation, resulting in mean Dice scores of 0.982, 0.724 and 0.469, respectively. The resulting binary lesions were segmented with a mean absolute volume error of 91.3 ml. In general, the task of distinguishing different lesion types was more difficult, with a mean absolute volume difference of 152 ml and mean Dice scores of 0.369 and 0.523 for consolidation and ground glass opacity, respectively.

All queries were collected and categorized. Responses to the queries were given according to the recommendations by the Ophthalmology association. Practices ability to deal with the COVID were also classified according to country and type of access to PPE. Statistical analyses of the association between these data and queries, where appropriate were carried out.Results: One thousand nine hundred sixteen ophthalmologists were invited to participate in a survey between April 10th and April 30th, 2020 of which 1207 responded, which is a response rate of approximately 63%. The majority of respondents were from India, Indonesia, China, Singapore and the USA. Our study indicates a precipitous drop in surgical procedures with 46% (n = 538) ophthalmologists ceased to operate on their patients and almost 40% (n = 486) were doing less than 25% of their original number of surgeries. The intent to resume elective surgeries was a consideration in 41% (n = 495) after an evaluation of the situation and in consultation with professional bodies. More than 2/3 of the respondents (n = 703) made it a priority to use and mandate their patients to practice physical distancing, wearing masks, and hand dis-infection for protection to limit the spread of infection.Conclusion: This global survey provides a real-world assessment of diverse practices that were in various forms of ""shut down mode"" and circumstances with varying capabilities to deal with COVID. It is unprecedented that the collective wisdom for a curtailment of practice has had an enormous immediate and far reaching implications on the livelihoods of ophthalmologists, their staff, and their families.

Purpose: This study analyzed and compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of COVID-19 and influenza A and B infections in children. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated the medical data of 206 pediatric COVID-19 and 411 pediatric seasonal influenza A or B patients. Results: COVID-19 patients were older than seasonal influenza patients (median 7.75 [interquartile range, 2-14] years vs. 4 [2-6] years). The frequency of fever and cough in COVID-19 patients was lower than that of seasonal influenza patients (80.6% vs. 94.4%, p < 0.001 and 22.8 % vs. 71.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). Ageusia (4.9%) and anosmia (3.4%) were present in only COVID-19 patients. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were encountered more frequently in influenza patients than in COVID-19 patients (22.1% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.029; 17.6% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.013; and 13.2% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.048, respectively). Both groups showed significantly elevated monocyte levels in the complete blood count (70.4% vs. 69.9%, p = 0.511). Major chest X-ray findings in COVID-19 patients included mild diffuse ground glass opacity and right lower lobe infiltrates. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in hospitalization or mortality rates; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients (2.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.045). Conclusion: In this study, pediatric COVID-19 patients showed a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe illness. We found no intergroup differences in hospitalization rates, oxygen requirements, or hospital length of stay; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients.","Siddiqui, Meraj; Gültekingil, Ayse; Bakirci, Oguz; Uslu, Nihal; Baskin, Esra",,,553
265745,Evaluation of sample pooling for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swabs and salivas on the Roche Cobas 6800,2021,"The mechanisms underlying pain relief following spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) are not understood fully although biomechanical and neurophysiological processes have been proposed. As such, we designed this randomized trial to elucidate the contributions of biomechanical and neurophysiological processes. A total of 132 participants with low back pain were randomly assigned to receive SMT at either the lumbar segment measured as the stiffest or the segment measured as having the lowest pain threshold. The primary outcome was patient reported low back pain intensity following treatment. Secondary outcomes were biomechanical stiffness and neurophysiological pressure pain threshold. All outcomes were measured at baseline, after the fourth and final session and at 2-weeks follow-up. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models, and demonstrated that the SMT application site did not influence patient reported low back pain intensity or stiffness. However, a large and significant difference in pressure pain threshold was observed between groups. This study provides support that SMT impacts neurophysiological parameters through a segment-dependent neurological reflex pathway, although this do not seem to be a proxy for improvement. This study was limited by the assumption that the applied treatment was sufficient to impact the primary outcome.","Nim, Casper Glissmann; Kawchuk, Gregory Neil; Schiøttz-Christensen, Berit; O039,; Neill, Søren",Sci Rep,,553
265770,Interim Considerations for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Correctional and Detention Facilities,2020,"Digestive cancers are the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and have high risks of morbidity and mortality. Histone methylation, which is mediated mainly by lysine methyltransferases, lysine demethylases, and protein arginine methyltransferases, has emerged as an essential mechanism regulating pathological processes in digestive cancers. Under certain conditions, aberrant expression of these modifiers leads to abnormal histone methylation or demethylation in the corresponding cancer-related genes, which contributes to different processes and phenotypes, such as carcinogenesis, proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and migration, during digestive cancer development. In this review, we focus on the association between histone methylation regulation and the development of digestive cancers, including gastric cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, as well as on its clinical application prospects, aiming to provide a new perspective on the management of digestive cancers.","Chen, Yuan; Ren, Bo; Yang, Jinshou; Wang, Huanyu; Yang, Gang; Xu, Ruiyuan; You, Lei; Zhao, Yupei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,553

DESIGN: A mixed-methods cross-sectional survey study design. Responses to the structured questionnaire were analysed using descriptive and non-parametric statistics. STUDY SAMPLE: UK based hearing care professionals (HCP) (n = 323) completed the survey (218 public sector; 89 private sector). RESULTS: Changes in working patterns varied greatly between different sectors, with 61% of national employed and 26% of independent HCPs being furloughed, compared with 1% in the public sector. Use of telehealth was under-utilised across all sectors and groups in UK hearing healthcare, despite 92% of public and 75% of private HCPs reporting feeling comfortable conducting remote consultations. CONCLUSION: This study highlights a variation in teleaudiology adoption and key barriers across sector in the UK. A collaborative approach between hearing device manufacturers, research centres, HCPs and professional bodies is required for the creation of targeted guidance and training materials according to sector, to support clinicians in effective teleaudiology provision.","Parmar, Bhavisha; Beukes, Eldre; Rajasingam, Saima",Int J Audiol,,553

This master thesis proposes to study this heterogeneity with a Bayesian hierarchical analysis. The analysis we carry out with two different hierarchical models leads to a very low amount of pooling of information between countries, indicating that this observed heterogeneity should be interpreted mostly as true heterogeneity, and not as sampling error. We analyze the first order behavior of our hierarchical models, in order to understand what leads to this very low amount of pooling. We try to give to this work a didactic approach, with an introduction of Bayesian analysis and an explanation of the different modeling and computational choices of our analysis.","Charlot, Louis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06759v1.pdf,553

Since then hospitals have reduced inpatient and outpatient workflow and cancelled or suspended all non-emergent and routine surgical procedures. Our objective is to determine whether, during the COVID-19 period, there has been any modification in urological services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the data from January-May 2020 and 2019 about the variables: number of operations, waiting list, visits in outpatient department, bladder instillations and urological emergencies and admission rates. RESULTS: Cancer cases high-risk for stage progression and surgical emergencies, were elected to proceed directly to treatment. The number of the operations was reduced by 43-65% from March-May 2020. Our surgical list had a waiting time of 6-8 weeks before the pandemic and now the waiting time has expanded to 12 weeks. Urological emergencies were reduced about 23-57%. Admission rates were dropped 10-51%. Visits in outpatient clinics were reduced 100-50% and outpatient procedures for elective cases were all deferred. Unfortunately, the hospital did not offer synchronous telehealth appointments. Bladder instillations of BCG or chemotherapeutics were not suspended but start of new cases had a delay of 2-3 weeks. There were no cases of COVID-19 in our department. CONCLUSION: All the variables of our urologic practice were affected during the COVID era. The impact of the reduced model of outpatient and inpatient workflow on the health of our patients is unknown. However, longer waiting lists are expected. It is obvious that healthcare providers should adopt a new healthcare model.","Efthimiou, Ioannis",Urol J,,553

The model predicts COVID-19 deaths happening in the United States of America. The experiment was carried out on machine learning model, minimum mean square error model, and maximum likelihood ratio model. The best-fitting model was selected according to the measures of mean square error, adjusted mean square error, mean square error, root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum likelihood ratio, and the statistical t-test was used to verify the results. Data sets are analyzed, cleaned up and debated before being applied to the proposed regression model. The correlation of the selected independent parameters was determined by the heat map and the Carl Pearson correlation matrix. It was found that the accuracy of the LR model best-fits the dataset when all the independent parameters are used in modeling, however, RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) are high as compared to PR models. The PR models of a high degree are required to best-fit the dataset when not much independent parameter is considered in modeling. However, the PR models of low degree best-fits the dataset when independent parameters from all dimensions are considered in modeling.","Singh, Hari; Bawa, Seema",Multimed Syst,,553

While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33% to 50.9%), depression (14.6% to 48.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7% to 53.8%), psychological distress (34.43% to 38%), and stress (8.1% to 81.9%) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (&#8804;40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. LIMITATIONS: A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress that, in many cases, would meet the threshold for clinical relevance. Mitigating the hazardous effects of COVID-19 on mental health is an international public health priority.","Xiong, Jiaqi; Lipsitz, Orly; Nasri, Flora; Lui, Leanna M W; Gill, Hartej; Phan, Lee; Chen-Li, David; Iacobucci, Michelle; Ho, Roger; Majeed, Amna; McIntyre, Roger S",J Affect Disord,,553

To measure the self-perceived impact of oral health on the quality of life of Brazilian women in detention. Methodology. A survey was carried out conducted in the penitentiary at Juiz de Fora (Minas Gerais, Brazil) using an instrument with semistructured questions and validated scales, including the Oral Health Impact Profile-14. 99 women were interviewed. The analysis was based on a theoretical model of determination, with hierarchical blocks of variables. Bivariate analysis was done using the Mann–Whitney, test and multivariate analysis was used using linear regression. The significance level was set at 5%. Results. 33% experienced tooth loss after incarceration, (3.70 ± 3.26 lost teeth). 65.6% rated the dental service as fair/poor. The highest prevalence of oral health impact was for the domains of psychological discomfort (50.5%) and physical pain (40.4%). There is a negative impact on psychological discomfort: the number of dental consultations in the past year and self-perceived general health. There is an impact on physical pain: self-declared color and anxiety. Self-perceived general health had an impact on the domains of psychological disability and social disadvantage. Depression had an impact on the total score. Conclusion. This study revealed a self-perceived impact of oral health on the quality of life of women inmates.

Data on vaccine safety and immunogenicity in these populations are therefore limited. Objective: To evaluate the immunogenicity of COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in pregnant and lactating women, including against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Design, Setting, and Participants: An exploratory, descriptive, prospective cohort study enrolled 103 women who received a COVID-19 vaccine from December 2020 through March 2021 and 28 women who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 2020 through March 2021 (the last follow-up date was March 26, 2021). This study enrolled 30 pregnant, 16 lactating, and 57 neither pregnant nor lactating women who received either the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccines and 22 pregnant and 6 nonpregnant unvaccinated women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibody responses from pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women were assessed following vaccination. Spike-specific T-cell responses were evaluated using IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot and multiparameter intracellular cytokine-staining assays. Humoral and cellular immune responses were determined against the original SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain as well as against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Results: This study enrolled 103 women aged 18 to 45 years (66% non-Hispanic White) who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. After the second vaccine dose, fever was reported in 4 pregnant women (14%; SD, 6%), 7 lactating women (44%; SD, 12%), and 27 nonpregnant women (52%; SD, 7%). Binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibody responses as well as CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were present in pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women following vaccination. Binding and neutralizing antibodies were also observed in infant cord blood and breast milk. Binding and neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern were reduced, but T-cell responses were preserved against viral variants. Conclusion and Relevance: In this exploratory analysis of a convenience sample, receipt of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was immunogenic in pregnant women, and vaccine-elicited antibodies were transported to infant cord blood and breast milk. Pregnant and nonpregnant women who were vaccinated developed cross-reactive antibody responses and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Collier, Ai-Ris Y; McMahan, Katherine; Yu, Jingyou; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Aguayo, Ricardo; Ansel, Jessica; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Patel, Shivani; Apraku Bondzie, Esther; Sellers, Daniel; Barrett, Julia; Sanborn, Owen; Wan, Huahua; Chang, Aiquan; Anioke, Tochi; Nkolola, Joseph; Bradshaw, Connor; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Feldman, Jared; Gebre, Makda; Borducchi, Erica N; Liu, Jinyan; Schmidt, Aaron G; Suscovich, Todd; Linde, Caitlyn; Alter, Galit; Hacker, Michele R; Barouch, Dan H",JAMA,,553

However, this relationship is complex, as self-efficacy is thought to influence and be influenced by physical activity. The directionality of the self-regulatory efficacy (SRE) and physical activity relationship was examined using a cross-lagged design. A secondary purpose was to examine these relationships across differing weather conditions. METHODS: Canadian adolescents (N = 337; aged between 13 and 18 years) completed the physical activity and SRE measures 4 times during a school year. Structural equation modeling was used to perform a cross-lag analysis. RESULTS: The relationships between physical activity and SRE appeared to be weather dependent. During a more challenging weather period (eg, cold weather), the relationship between physical activity and SRE was bidirectional. However, no relationship emerged when the 2 constructs were assessed during a more optimal weather period (eg, warm weather). CONCLUSIONS: Some support has been provided for the bidirectional nature of the relationship between physical activity and SRE. The relationship appeared to be qualified by climate considerations, suggesting that future research examine how weather may relate not just to physical activity but also to the correlates of physical activity.","Wilson, Kathleen S; Spink, Kevin S",Pediatr Exerc Sci,,553

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. METHODS: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models' performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. RESULTS: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model. CONCLUSIONS: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy&#8805;89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing.","Viana Dos Santos Santana, Íris; Cm da Silveira, Andressa; Sobrinho, Álvaro; Chaves E Silva, Lenardo; Dias da Silva, Leandro; Santos, Danilo F S; Gurjão, Edmar C; Perkusich, Angelo",J Med Internet Res,,553

314053,How the US Failed to Prioritize SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance,2021,"Atypicalities in psychophysical thresholds for global motion processing have been reported in many neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism and dyslexia. Cross-syndrome comparisons of neural dynamics may help determine whether altered motion processing is a general marker of atypical development or condition-specific. Here, we assessed group differences in N2 peak amplitude (previously proposed as a marker of motion-specific processing) in typically developing (n = 57), autistic (n = 29) and dyslexic children (n = 44) aged 6-14 years, in two global motion tasks. High-density EEG data were collected while children judged the direction of global motion stimuli as quickly and accurately as possible, following a period of random motion. Using a data-driven component decomposition technique, we identified a reliable component that was maximal over occipital electrodes and had an N2-like peak at ~160 msec. We found no group differences in N2 peak amplitude, in either task. However, for both autistic and dyslexic children, there was evidence of atypicalities in later stages of processing that require follow up in future research. Our results suggest that early sensory encoding of motion information is unimpaired in dyslexic and autistic children. Group differences in later processing stages could reflect sustained global motion responses, decision-making, metacognitive processes and/or response generation, which may also distinguish between autistic and dyslexic individuals.","Toffoli, Lisa; Scerif, Gaia; Snowling, Margaret J; Norcia, Anthony M; Manning, Catherine",Cortex,,553

These changes can affect the training that gastroenterology trainees undergo, especially endoscopy since these are aerosol-generating procedures. The aim of this survey was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastroenterology training across the European countries. Methodology: A questionnaire was set up whereby the different elements of training were analysed. The questionnaire (online) was distributed among trainees through the National Representatives of the European Board of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Results: In total, 86 trainees (females: 55%;mean age: 32.5 years [SD +/- 4.57 years];mean training duration of 2.68 years [SD +/- 1.63]) from 22 different countries were recruited. From the cohort, 10.5% were considered as vulnerable for acquiring COVID-19. During their job, 4.7% acquired the infection and 26.7% were placed in quarantine. Most trainees noted that their various aspects of gastroenterology training were moderately or severely affected during the initial height of the pandemic: clinical gastroenterology training (67.4%), outpatients (75.5%), didactic teaching (88.3%), multidisciplinary team meetings (65.2%) and endoscopy training (75.6%). Later, when the number of COVID-19-related infections decreased across Europe, the above modalities returned to normal for Conclusion: This European-wide survey has demonstrated that gastroenterology training has been severely impacted during both the initial height of the pandemic and afterwards. Furthermore, the psychological impact on trainees, in terms of training quality, duration and exposure to COVID-19, is unknown. A re-assessment of each centre training programme should be done as to ensure that a high standard of training is still being delivered.","Pisani, A.; Cremers, I.; Ellul, P.",Ge Portuguese Journal of Gastroenterology,,553

However, to date, quantitative research that has investigated the strategies online groomers employ to gain their victim's trust is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To this end, the main aim of this study was to distinguish and measure different strategies of the online grooming process by developing and examining the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Online Grooming Questionnaire (MOGQ). We also analyzed the prevalence of different strategies of online grooming among a sample of minors and their associations with grooming outcomes (i.e., online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The sample consisted of 1704 participants between 12 and 15 years of age (864 girls; Mage = 13.77, SD = 1.13). METHODS: Examination of the structure of the MOGQ was accomplished using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). For this purpose, the sample was randomly divided into two subsamples. RESULTS: EFA and CFA showed a structure composed of five factors, including Use of Deception, Gift giving, Study of victim's environment, Sexualization, and Aggression. Second, the analysis of the relationship of online grooming with grooming outcomes (online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety) provided evidence for the concurrent validity of the instrument. Finally, the prevalence of grooming strategies within the sample ranged between 7% for aggression to 18% for interest in the victim's environment. Overall grooming strategies were more prevalent for girls than boys and increased with age. CONCLUSION: Distinguishing between different strategies of online grooming is recommended in order to advance research and the prevention of this type of child abuse.","Gámez-Guadix, Manuel; De Santisteban, Patricia; Wachs, Sebastian; Wright, Michelle",Child Abuse Negl,,553

This paper reports on the perceived environmental barriers of the German study population and their associations with quality of life. DESIGN: Cross-sectional explorative observational study using survey data. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,479 persons with spinal cord injury aged 18 years and older. METHODS: After descriptive analyses, exploratory factor analysis was used to build groups of environmental barriers. Logistic regressions were performed to assess correlates of perceived environmental barriers. Spearman's correlations were used to analyse the association between perceived barriers and quality of life. RESULTS: Barriers regarding infrastructure had a relatively large impact. Barriers in relation to people's attitudes towards spinal cord injury and the equipment of people with spinal cord injury had a relatively small impact on the lives of people with spinal cord injury. Several subpopulations showed a higher risk in experiencing barriers. Quality of life decreased with increasing experience of barriers. CONCLUSION: The most life-hardening barriers were identified related to infrastructure, a category in which most barriers are modifiable, for example, buildings or transportation.","Bökel, Andrea; Dierks, Marie-Luise; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Weidner, Norbert; Geng, Veronika; Kalke, Yorck-Bernhard; Liebscher, Thomas; Abel, Frank-Rainer; Sturm, Christian",J. rehabil. med,,553

Results: Among 101 participants with substance use (88.1% males and 11.8% females), approximately 50% of participants were professionals by occupation and nearly half of the study population were postgraduates (48.5%). Majority of study participants were from urban areas (61.3%) and belonged to lower socioeconomic status (28.7%). Two third (68.3%) of the total study population belong to the nuclear family. Of 101 study participants, 63 (62.3%) of them presented with depressive symptoms. Majority of male participants [56 (88.8%)] expressed that they have depressive symptoms. Of these 56 participants, depressive symptoms were seen in participants consuming both alcohol and nicotine [26 (46.4%)] followed by only alcohol [22 (39.2%)] and only nicotine [8 (14.2%)]. A total of 7 (6.9%) females experienced depressive symptoms, with the majority of them had a history of consuming alcohol [4 (57.1%)] followed by both alcohol and nicotine [2 (28.5%)] and only nicotine [1 (14.2%)]. Conclusions: This study observed the impact lockdown on substance use participants to develop depression symptoms. It was found that males with both alcohol and nicotine use experienced more depression symptoms than females.","Samaksha, P. B.; Puvvada, R. K.",Value in Health,,553

333166,Epidemiology and precision of SARS-CoV-2 detection following lockdown and relaxation measures,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on French Poison Control Centre (PCC) call characteristics. METHODS: Reported cases of xenobiotic exposures from 1 March to 30 April in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were extracted from the French National Database of Poisonings. The collected data included call, patient, and exposure characteristics for both general calls and for calls involving sentinel xenobiotic categories related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 exposures were compared to 2018-2019 exposures by using simple logistic models in order to provide effect size with odds ratios. RESULTS: From March to April 2020, 32,182 exposures were reported to French PCCs with an overall increase of 5.6% compared to exposures in the same time frame in 2018-2019. A similar increase in calls was observed in non-epidemic and epidemic COVID-19 areas with an increase in calls from the public (+13.6%) while calls from health-professionals decreased (-7.5%). Despite the increase in exposures, the incidence of symptomatic exposures remained stable (-0.4%) with a decrease in severity (moderate/severe -17.2%). A significant increase in exposures to home cleaning products containing biocides, essential oils, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers (odds ratio >1.3, p < .0001) was observed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic altered calls to French PCCs with a small increase in calls during the study period and changes in the pattern of exposure. These changes possibly reflected the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic i.e., limited access to primary care, fear of contracting COVID-19 and anxiety related to home isolation.","Le Roux, Gaël; Sinno-Tellier, Sandra; Puskarczyk, Emmanuel; Labadie, Magali; von Fabeck, Katharina; Pélissier, Fanny; Nisse, Patrick; Paret, Nathalie; Descatha, Alexis; Vodovar, Dominique",Clin Toxicol (Phila),,553

Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations: No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.","Sanders, James M; Monogue, Marguerite L; Jodlowski, Tomasz Z; Cutrell, James B",JAMA,,553

The development of devices to specifically mitigate cross-contamination by droplet/splatter is crucial to stop infection transmission. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a perioral suction device (Oral BioFilter, OBF) to reduce biological contamination spread during dental procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomized 1:1 to a standard professional dental hygiene treatment with OBF and without. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assay was used to evaluate the spread of potential contaminants. The total number of relative light units (RLU) from key dental operatory locations: operator's face-shield, back of the surgical operator's-gloves, patient's safety-goggles, and instrumental table were measured. Percentage contamination reductions between control and OBF were compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Primary outcome, total RLU, was analyzed by comparing the means of logged data, using a two-sided two-sample t-test. Secondary outcomes as RLU of logged data for the different locations were analyzed in the same way. Proportion of patients from whom different locations reported events (clean, acceptable, and failure) were analyzed by using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: For the whole dental environment, RLUs reduction (<150 units) achieved with OBF was 98.4% (97.4-99%). By dental operatory location the reduction in RLUs was from 99.6%, on the operator face-shield, to 83% on instrumental table. The control group reported a very high percentage of failures, (>300) being 100% on the surfaces closer to the patient's mouth and decreasing to 70% on instrumental table. In contrast, the higher failure percentage in the OBF group was found on the patient's goggles (40%), while the operator face-shield showed an absence of contamination. CONCLUSION: OBF device has shown efficient reduction of biological aerosol cross-contamination during dental procedures as proved by ATP-bioluminescence assay. Nevertheless, for maximum safety, its use must be combined with standard protective gear such as goggles, face shield, and surgical gloves.","Lloro, Víctor; Giovannoni, Maria Laura; Luaces, Vicente Lozano-de; Manzanares, Maria Cristina",European journal of dentistry,,553

OBJECTIVES: Assessing the effect of early tracheostomy on mortality and decannulation; elucidating changes in ventilation parameters, vasopressors and sedatives dosages immediately following the procedure. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 38 ventilated COVID-19 patients, 19 of them (50%) underwent tracheostomy within 7 days of intubation (early tracheostomy group) and the rest underwent tracheostomy after 8 days or more (late tracheostomy group). RESULTS: Decannulation rates were significantly higher while mortality rates were non-significantly lower in the early tracheostomy group compared with the late tracheostomy group (58% vs 21% p < 0.05; 42% vs 74% p = 0.1, respectively). Tidal volume increased (446 ml vs 483 ml; p = 0.02) while PEEP (13 cmH20 vs 11.6 cmH2O, p = 0.04) decreased at the immediate time following the procedure. No staff member participating in the procedures was infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. CONCLUSION: Early tracheostomy might offer improved outcomes with higher decannulation rates and lower mortality rates in ventilated COVID-19 patients, yet larger scale studies are needed. Most likely, early exposure to COVID-19 patients with appropriate personal protective equipment during open tracheostomy does not put the surgical team at risk.","Livneh, Nir; Mansour, Jobran; Kassif Lerner, Reut; Feinmesser, Gilad; Alon, Eran",Am J Otolaryngol,,553

357126,Real-Life Head-to-Head Comparison of Performance of Two High-Throughput Automated Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Nasopharyngeal Swabs: The Alinity m and cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 Assays,2021,"The formalism in testamentary law is a result of the need to protect thefreedom of testamentary disposition and the authenticity of the last will of the testator. Proposed formalities are supposed to serve multiple purposes in testamentary law: evidentiary, cautionary and protective. Having in mind the level of modern society development and technologies, as well as the new challenges we face with today (such as pandemics, natural disasters, etc.), the question arises: whether the prescribed formalities in testamentary disposition are justified in terms of purposes they are suposed to serve? Modern testamentary law is characterized by the trend of liberalization of testamentary forms, mitigation of formalities, abolition of certain obsolete forms of testament, but also introduction of new forms dictated by new social and economic, political circumstances and new requirements of legal trade mortis causa. The experience with the Covid pandemic confirmed the importance of these issues. The state of the pandemic indisputably restricts the freedom of testation in several directions: limited contacts prevent the presence of notaries or judges as representatives of public authorities as a mandatory element of form in public testamentary forms, and the possibility of their composition;it is impossible or difficult to ensure the presence of testamentary witnesses in allographic testament and thus difficult to implement the principle of unitu actu as a key feature of the testamentary form;finally, illiterate people and people with disabilities remain deprived of the opportunity to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed freedom oftesting due to being unable to make an holographic legacy, as their sole option available within the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic, due to above mentioned restrictions. As the basic purpose of the testamentary right is to enable a testamentarily capable person to manifest his last will in whatever circumstances he finds himself, extraordinary circumstances during a pandemic indisputably restrict the freedom of testing. The new pandemic circumstances have prompted the legal public to think in the following directions: whether there is a need to introduce new forms of testament during a pandemic (as was done in Spain, which regulated testament during a pandemic);should certain elements of the form of the will be modernized (e.g. allow the possibility of the participation of the witness of the cess of making the will online via audio-video link) ?;and finally, should the door be opened to the digitalization of the will and the possibility of compiling an electronic will and mark the beginning of a new era of testamentary law? These and related issues are the subject of analysis in this paper, and will be viewed through the prism of comparative legislation, with special emphasis on the legislation of the countries of the Roman legal tradition that precedes the form of bequest during a pandemic. In order to determine the guidelines for further development of testamentary law and its rationalization, the situation in common law countries will be pointed out, and some examples from their case law will be analyzed, considering that a significant step towards digitalization of testamentary law has already been made in these legal systems. Based on this comparative analysis, which implies the application of primarily comparative law and dogmatic methods, as well as axiological through a new approach to the testamentary form, we try to determine whether testamentary forms and formalities are harmonized with the needs of modern society, especially in pandemics. Finally, at the end of the paper, the author tries to give proposed solutions in the direction of reforming the testamentary formalities de lege ferenda, trying to establish a balance between legal certainty and freedom of testing.","Đurđić-Milošević, Tamara",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,553
359247,Temporal Increase in Neutralization Potency of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Reduced Viral Variant Escape after Sputnik V Vaccination,2021,"The case of 21-year-old man with an asthma history from childhood presenting severe respiratory distress associated with a right lower thoracic pain has been studied. The non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT)-chest scan showed a basal ground-glass opacity (GGO) of the right lung leading to suspicion of COVID-19's pneumonia. However, the molecular RT-PCR test and blood serology were negative while laboratory analyses revealed high levels of D-dimers (D-D). In addition, two repeated COVID-19 tests were negative. A thoracic CT angiography was disclosed due to the persistence of pain at the lower right thoracic side and hemoptysis that shows a bilateral distal pulmonary embolism with a right-sided basal subsegmental ischemia. We discuss a fortuitous discovery of pulmonary embolism associated with peripheral basal ground-glass opacities similar to radiological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. artery embolism; CT chest angiography; Covid-19; ground-glass opacity; pneumonia; chest pain.","Benslima, N; Kassimi, M; Berrada, S; Jaouad, M R Cherkaoui; Hajjij, A; Dini, N; Mahi, M",,,553

360900,Performance of the RT-LAMP-based eazyplex® SARS-CoV-2 as a novel rapid diagnostic test,2021,"As global health services respond to the coronavirus pandemic, many prescribers are turning to experimental drugs. This review aims to assess the risk of drug-drug interactions in the severely ill COVID-19 patient. Experimental therapies were identified by searching ClinicalTrials.gov for 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', '2019 novel coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. The last search was performed on 30 June 2020. Herbal medicines, blood-derived products and in vitro studies were excluded. We identified comorbidities by searching PubMed for the MeSH terms 'COVID-19', 'Comorbidity' and 'Epidemiological Factors'. Potential drug-drug interactions were evaluated according to known pharmacokinetics, overlapping toxicities and QT risk. Drug-drug interactions were graded GREEN and YELLOW: no clinically significant interaction; AMBER: caution; RED: serious risk. A total of 2378 records were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov, which yielded 249 drugs that met inclusion criteria. Thirteen primary compounds were screened against 512 comedications. A full database of these interactions is available at www.covid19-druginteractions.org. Experimental therapies for COVID-19 present a risk of drug-drug interactions, with lopinavir/ritonavir (10% RED, 41% AMBER; mainly a perpetrator of pharmacokinetic interactions but also risk of QT prolongation particularly when given with concomitant drugs that can prolong QT), chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (both 7% RED and 27% AMBER, victims of some interactions due to metabolic profile but also perpetrators of QT prolongation) posing the greatest risk. With management, these risks can be mitigated. We have published a drug-drug interaction resource to facilitate medication review for the critically ill patient.","Hodge, Catherine; Marra, Fiona; Marzolini, Catia; Boyle, Alison; Gibbons, Sara; Siccardi, Marco; Burger, David; Back, David; Khoo, Saye",J Antimicrob Chemother,,553
361147,First confirmation of importation and transmission in Spain of the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mealtimes occur six times a day on eating disorder (ED) inpatient units and are a mainstay of treatment for EDs. However, these are often distressing and anxiety provoking times for patients and staff. A product of patients' distress is an increase in ED behaviours specific to mealtimes. The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease the number of ED behaviours at mealtimes in the dining room through the implementation of initiatives identified through diagnostic work. METHODS: The Model for Improvement was used as the systematic approach for this project. Baseline assessment included observations in the dining room, gathering of qualitative feedback from staff and patients and the development of an ED behaviours form used by patients and staff. The first change idea of a host role in the dining room was introduced, and the impact was assessed. RESULTS: The introduction of the host role has reduced the average number of ED behaviours per patient in the dining room by 35%. Postintervention feedback demonstrated that the introduction of the host role tackled the disorganisation and chaotic feeling in the dining room which in turn has reduced distress and anxiety for patients and staff. CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the realities of a quality improvement (QI) project on an ED inpatient unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are positive for changes made; however, a large challenge, as described has been staff engagement.","Gardner, Lucy; Trueman, Hayley",,,553
361191,Emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant observed at the Poitiers University Hospital,2021,"The present is a comprehensive review of the immunopathology of Covid-19. The immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by differentiation and proliferation of a variety of immune cells with immune mediator production and release, and activation of other pathogen resistance mechanisms. We fully address the humoral and cellular immune changes induced by the virus, with particular emphasis on the role of the ""cytokine storm"" in the evolution of the disease. Moreover, we also propose some immune alterations (i.e., inflammatory parameters, cytokines, leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations) as prognostic markers of the disease. Furthermore, we discuss how immune modifying drugs, such as tocilizumab, chloroquine, glucocorticoids and immunoglobulins, and blood purification therapy, can constitute a fundamental moment in the therapy of the infection. Finally, we made a critical analysis of a number of substances, not yet utilized, but potentially useful in SARS-CoV-2 patients, such as IFN lambda, TNF blockers, ulinastatin, siponimod, tacrolimus, mesenchymal stem cells, inhibitors of mononuclear macrophage recruitment, IL-1 family antagonists, JAK-2 or STAT-3 inhibitors.","Allegra, Alessandro; Di Gioacchino, Mario; Tonacci, Alessandro; Musolino, Caterina; Gangemi, Sebastiano",,,553
361192,Emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant observed at the Poitiers University Hospital,2021,"Background: Social distancing policies aimed to limit Covid-19 across the UK were gradually relaxed between May and August 2020, as peak incidences passed. Population density is an important driver of national incidence rates; however peak incidences in rural regions may lag national figures by several weeks. We aimed to forecast the timing of peak Covid-19 mortality rate in rural North Wales. Methods: Covid-19 related mortality data up to 7/5/2020 were obtained from Public Health Wales and the UK Government. Sigmoidal growth functions were fitted by non-linear least squares and model averaging used to extrapolate mortality to 24/8/2020. The dates of peak mortality incidences for North Wales, Wales and the UK; and the percentage of predicted mortality at 24/8/2020 were calculated. Results: The peak daily death rates in Wales and the UK were estimated to have occurred on the 14/04/2020 and 15/04/2020, respectively. For North Wales, this occurred on the 07/05/2020, corresponding to the date of analysis. The number of deaths reported in North Wales on 07/05/2020 represents 33% of the number predicted to occur by 24/08/2020, compared with 74 and 62% for Wales and the UK, respectively. Conclusion: Policies governing the movement of people in the gradual release from lockdown are likely to impact significantly on areas-principally rural in nature-where cases of Covid-19, deaths and immunity are likely to be much lower than in populated areas. This is particularly difficult to manage across jurisdictions, such as between England and Wales, and in popular holiday destinations.","Hughes, Rhodri P; Hughes, Dyfrig A",Front Public Health,,553
365352,European multicenter evaluation of Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV test,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients who would usually have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, cardiac surgery for coronary artery disease (CAD) was dramatically reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients with ""surgical disease"" instead underwent PCI. METHODS: Between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020, 215 patients with recognized ""surgical"" CAD who underwent PCI were enrolled in the prospective UK-ReVasc Registry (ReVR). 30-day major cardiovascular event outcomes were collected. Findings in ReVR patients were directly compared to reference PCI and isolated CABG pre-COVID-19 data from British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) and National Cardiac Audit Programme (NCAP) databases. RESULTS: ReVR patients had higher incidence of diabetes (34.4% vs 26.4%, P = .008), multi-vessel disease with left main stem disease (51.4% vs 3.0%, P < .001) and left anterior descending artery involvement (94.8% vs 67.2%, P < .001) compared to BCIS data. SYNTAX Score in ReVR was high (mean 28.0). Increased use of transradial access (93.3% vs 88.6%, P = .03), intracoronary imaging (43.6% vs 14.4%, P < .001) and calcium modification (23.6% vs 3.5%, P < .001) was observed. No difference in in-hospital mortality was demonstrated compared to PCI and CABG data (ReVR 1.4% vs BCIS 0.7%, P = .19; vs NCAP 1.0%, P = .48). Inpatient stay was half compared to CABG (3.0 vs 6.0 days). Low-event rates in ReVR were maintained to 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PCI undertaken using contemporary techniques produces excellent short-term results in patients who would be otherwise CABG candidates. Longer-term follow-up is essential to determine whether these outcomes are maintained over time.","Kite, Thomas A; Ladwiniec, Andrew; Owens, Colum G; Chase, Alexander; Shaukat, Aadil; Mozid, Abdul M; O039,; Kane, Peter; Routledge, Helen; Perera, Divaka; Jain, Ajay K; Palmer, Nick; Hoole, Stephen P; Egred, Mohaned; Sinha, Manas K; Cahill, Thomas J; Candilio, Luciano; Anantharam, Brijesh; Byrne, Jonathan; Walsh, Simon J; McEntegart, Margaret; Kean, Sharon; Siddique, Laraib; Budgeon, Charley; Curzen, Nick; Berry, Colin; Ludman, Peter; Gershlick, Anthony H",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,553
365687,Comparison of the simultaneous conjunctiva and oropharynx-nasopharynx swab results in patients applying to the SARS-CoV-2 outpatient clinic for the first time,2021,"On April 17th 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration granted Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency use authorizations for the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity Blood Filter. The medical device is aimed to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure. The aim of this life size in vitro pharmacokinetic study was to investigate the in-vitro adsorption of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from human plasma using equipment that is also used at the bedside. After start of the hemoperfusion Pre (Cpre ) Seraph® plasma levels were obtained at 5 (C5 ), 10 (C10 ), 15 (C15 ), 30 (C30 ), 60 (C60 ) and 120 (C120 ) minutes into the procedure. At two timepoints (5 min and 120 min) post (Cpost ) Seraph® plasma levels were determined that were used to calculate the plasma clearance. Both drugs were determined using a validated HPLC method Median [IQR] plasma clearance of the Seraph for chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine was 1.71 [0.51-4.38] ml/min / 1.79 [0.21-3.68] ml/min respectively. The lack of elimination was also confirmed by the fact that plasma levels did not change over the 120 min treatment. As neither chloroquine nor hydroxychloroquine were removed by the treatment with the Seraph dose adjustments in COVID-19 patients undergoing this treatment are not necessary.

Once formed, all vessels of the vasculature system present an endothelial monolayer (the endothelium), lining the luminal wall of the vessels, that regulates gas and nutrient exchange between the circulating blood and tissues, contributing to maintaining tissue and vascular homeostasis. To perform their functions, endothelial cells integrate signalling pathways promoted by growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix components and signals from mechanosensory complexes sensing the blood flow. New evidence shows that endothelial cells rely on specific metabolic pathways for distinct cellular functions and that the integration of signalling and metabolic pathways regulates endothelial-dependent processes such as angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. In this review, we provide an overview of endothelial functions and the recent advances in understanding the role of endothelial signalling and metabolism in physiological processes such as angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis and vascular diseases. Also, we focus on the signalling pathways promoted by the transmembrane protein Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in endothelial cells, its recently discovered role in regulating mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and iron in atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases.","Bosseboeuf, Emy; Raimondi, Claudio",,,553

Haiti represents a resource-constrained setting, limited by a paucity of resources and trained cardiovascular professionals equipped to address the increasing burden of CVD. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe the creation of a comprehensive cardiology curriculum delivered through a virtual classroom. The curriculum was created to augment cardiovascular education in LMICs such as Haiti. METHODS: Over one academic year (May 2019-2020), International Cardiology Curriculum Accessible by Remote Distance Learning-Haiti consisted of biweekly, live-streamed, synchronous didactic lectures, seminars and case presentations broadcasted to 16 internal medicine (IM) residents at Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais, one of only four IM training programmes in Haiti. The virtual classroom was created using commercially available videoconferencing and data-sharing platforms. Prelecture and postlecture surveys and an end of the year survey were administered to assess the impact of the curriculum. RESULTS: Participant performance analysis revealed that 80% of the curriculum demonstrated a positive trend in knowledge acquisition postintervention. Based on the end of the year evaluation, 94% of participants reported that the curriculum was educational and relevant to medical practice in Haiti and 100% reported that the curriculum was good to excellent. Additionally, the curriculum was cited as an effective means of maintaining trainee education during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: This international medical education pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of augmenting cardiology education in LMICs by creating a virtual curriculum made possible by local partnerships, internet access and technology.","Haynes, Norrisa Adrianna; Saint-Joy, Veauthyelau; Swain, JaBaris; Ezekwesili, Agnes; Vernet, Fritz Verly; Dawson, Calixte; Laneau, Davidson; Tierney, Ann; Shea, Judy A; Ambrose, Marietta S",BMJ Open,,553

We aimed at verifying the level of bronchodilator reversibility in COVID-19 patients undergoing multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation after the acute phase. METHODS: We enrolled 105 consecutive patients referring to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri Spa SB, IRCCS of Telese Terme, Benevento, Italy after being discharged from the COVID-19 acute care ward and after recovering from acute COVID-19 pneumonia. All subjects performed a spirometry before and after inhalation of salbutamol 400 µg to determine the bronchodilation response within 48 h of admission to the unit. RESULTS: All patients had suffered from a moderate to severe COVID-19, classified 3 or 4 according to the WHO classification, Seventeen patients had concomitant obstructive lung disease (14 suffering from COPD and 3 from asthma). FEV1 after salbutamol improved on average by 41.7 mL in the entire examined sample, by 29.4 mL in subjects without concomitant obstructive lung diseases, by 59.3 mL in COPD patients and by 320.0 mL in asthma patients. Mean FVC after salbutamol improved by 65.7 mL in the entire examined sample, by 52.5 mL in subjects without concomitant obstructive lung diseases, by 120.0 mL in COPD patients, and by 200.0 mL in asthma patients.

381681,Interpreting Sars-Cov-2 Fatality Rate Estimates — A Case for Introducing Standardized Reporting to Improve Communication,2020,"Studies on residents' attitudes toward tourism development either assume that residents are unemotional “homo economics” or frame their emotions as forming rigid patterns. Following emotional approach, this study on Bama in China argues that residents' emotions toward tourism development and its environmental impacts are dynamic and ambivalent. Qualitative methods such as semi-structured interview and observation were used to collect data. The results show that during tourism development, interactions with outsiders encouraged the residents to realize the symbolic healing effects of their living environment and develop feelings of amazement and pride. However, continuous development had negative effects on the physical and symbolic environments, which induced complex emotional responses in the residents, including dislike, dissatisfaction, tolerance, anger, and fear. However, in this wealth-building stage, the residents’ ecological grief is compensated by economic growth and has not evolved to resisting actions against development. The emotional ambivalence between eagerness to economic prosperity and concern of ecological loss still exists in Bama and was enhanced in the shutdown of tourism caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should explore whether, and how ecological concerns about a tourism location may override potential economic gains and encompass anti-development actions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Huang, X.; Lin, S.; Cui, Q.","Emotion, Space and Society",,553

These patients generally have problems in mounting effective immune responses against pathogens such as viruses. On the other hand they typically have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in their peripheral blood. Both of these features may work in favor of COVID-19. Since robust immune responses are needed to prevent infection in the initial stages of COVID-19, the impaired immune system may not be able to cope effectively with the highly replicating SARS-CoV2. In advanced stages of the disease wherein the inflammation as well as the cytokine storm are the core players, a high baseline inflammatory cytokines could intensify and substantially exacerbate the immunopathological situation. Presence of COVID-19 in HD patients may also be a complex immunological condition.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided into mild, severe or critical groups according to disease condition. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve. RESULTS: Significantly, disease severity was associated with age (R = -0.564, P < 0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R = -0.534, P < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R = -0.535, P < 0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R = -0.308, P < 0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R = -0.422, P < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#945;) (R = -0.322, P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R = -0.604, P < 0.001), ferroprotein (R = -0.508, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (R = -0.650, P < 0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R = -0.54, P < 0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R = 0.56, P < 0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R = -0.585, P < 0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R = 0.299, P < 0.001).

The only way left to this situation is to slow down or eradicate the spreading by adopting preventing measures. Objective: The purpose of the study is to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices toward COVID-19 among Bangladeshi internet users. Material and Methods: A total of 441 respondents voluntarily participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey. A structured questionnaire was created using Google Forms and the link was shared through authors’ networks. Collected information was analyzed using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques. Results: Respondent of age 30 and above are more optimistic (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] =1.96, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.13 to 3.41; P=0.016) compared to respondent of age 18-29.

From the linear regression analysis, we see that urban residence type (vs. rural, β=0.274; P=0.024) are significantly associated with higher knowledge scores. Additionally, a significant positive correlation exists between the COVID-19 knowledge score and the preventive practice score (r=0.291, P &lt;0.01). Conclusion: Although knowledge and preventive practices among Bangladeshi internet users are encouraging, this study suggests updated knowledge be provided by healthcare authorities to enhance appropriate preventive practices throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.","Rahman, Abdur; Sathi, Nusrat Jahan",Electro.

404748,Frequency of surveillance testing necessary to reduce transmission of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact at all stages of cancer treatment. Risk of death from COVID-19 in patients treated for a cancer is high. COVID-19 vaccines represent a major issue to decrease the rate of severe forms of the COVID-19 cases and to maintain a normal cancer care. It is difficult to define the target population for vaccination due to the limited data available and the lack of vaccine doses available. It appears theoretically important to vaccinate patients with active cancer treatment or treated since less than three years, as well as their family circle. In France, patients actually defined at ""high risk"" for priority access to vaccination are those with a cancer treated by chemotherapy. A panel of experts recently defined another ""very high-priority"" population, which includes patients with curative or palliative first or second-line chemotherapy, as well as patients requiring surgery or radiotherapy involving a large lung volume, lymph nodes and/or of hematopoietic tissue. Ideally, it is best to vaccinate before cancer treatment. Despite the lack of published data, COVID-19 vaccines can also be performed during chemotherapy by avoiding periods of bone marrow aplasia and if possible, to do it in cancer care centers. It is necessary to implement cohorts with immunological and clinical monitoring of vaccinated cancer patients. To conclude, considering the current state of knowledge, the benefit-risk ratio strongly favours COVID-19 vaccination of all cancer patients.","Tougeron, David; Seitz-Polski, Barbara; Hentzien, Maxime; Bani-Sadr, Firouze; Bourhis, Jean; Ducreux, Michel; Gaujoux, Sébastien; Gorphe, Philippe; Guiu, Boris; Hardy-Bessard, Anne Claire; Hoang Xuan, Khê; Huguet, Florence; Lecomte, Thierry; Lièvre, Astrid; Louvet, Christophe; Maggiori, Léon; Mariani, Pascale; Michel, Pierre; Servettaz, Amélie; Thariat, Juliette; Westeel, Virginie; Aparicio, Thomas; Blay, Jean Yves; Bouché, Olivier",Bull. cancer,,553

411553,Genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates occurring in India: Present scenario,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries. Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms. However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time. We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms. Methods: We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls. We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (&#8804;9â¢5 109/L) or lymphopenia (<1â¢1 109/L). Findings: Normal or decreased number of leukocytes (&#8804;9â¢5 109/L), lymphopenia (<1â¢1 109/L), eosinopenia (<0â¢02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (&#8805;4 mg/L) were presented in 95â¢0%, 52â¢2%, 74â¢7% and 86â¢7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87â¢2%, 28â¢8%, 31â¢3% and 45â¢2% of the controls, respectively. The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74â¢7% and specificity of 68â¢7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0â¢717. The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67â¢9% and specificity of 78â¢2% (AUC=0â¢730). The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Interpretation: The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms. This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.

We conducted a study comparing patients in the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic in Norway (weeks 11 and 12) with the average number of patient visits. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from patients at the Emergency Department of St Olav's Hospital in the period 6 January 2020-22 March 2020 were retrieved from the Emergency Department's database. Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed. RESULTS: In week 12, 331 patients were referred to the Emergency Department, a reduction of 39 % compared with the average of 541 patients in weeks 2-10. There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department. In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients. INTERPRETATION: There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic. The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients. The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.","Bjørnsen, Lars Petter; Næss-Pleym, Lars Eide; Dale, Jostein; Laugsand, Lars Erik",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,553

422885,Extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection by rapid RT-qPCR universal for all primary respiratory materials,2020,"In the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the 5'-terminus encodes a polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins whereas the 3' terminus encodes four structural proteins and eight accessory proteins. Among these 27 proteins, the present study aimed to discover likely antigenic proteins and epitopes to be used for the development of a vaccine or serodiagnostic assay using an in silico approach. For this purpose, after the full genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate and variant proteins that are detected frequently, surface proteins including spike, envelope, and membrane proteins as well as proteins with signal peptide were determined as probable vaccine candidates whereas the remaining were considered as possible antigens to be used during the development of serodiagnostic assays. According to results obtained, among 27 proteins, 26 of them were predicted as probable antigen. In 26 proteins, spike protein was selected as the best vaccine candidate because of having a signal peptide, negative GRAVY value, one transmembrane helix, moderate aliphatic index, a big molecular weight, a long-estimated half-life, beta wrap motifs as well as having stable, soluble and non-allergic features. In addition, orf7a, orf8, and nsp-10 proteins with signal peptide were considered as potential vaccine candidates. Nucleocapsid protein and a highly antigenic GGDGKMKD epitope were identified as ideal antigens to be used in the development of serodiagnostic assays. Moreover, considering MHC-I alleles, highly antigenic KLNDLCFTNV and ITLCFTLKRK epitopes can be used to develop an epitope-based peptide vaccine.","Can, Hüseyin; Köseoglu, Ahmet Efe; Erkunt Alak, Sedef; Güvendi, Mervenur; Döskaya, Mert; Karakavuk, Muhammet; Gürüz, Adnan Yüksel; Ün, Cemal",Sci Rep,,553

We aimed to examine whether the effect of escitalopram on PSD differs according to individual depressive symptoms and stroke lesion location. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of EMOTION (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01278498), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that examined the efficacy of escitalopram on depression in acute stroke patients (237 with placebo, 241 with escitalopram). Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the 10-item Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Changes in MADRS and individual item scores at 12 weeks were compared between the treatment groups and among the stroke lesion location groups. Stroke lesion locations were grouped according to the anatomical distribution of serotonin fibers that originate from the midbrain/pons and spread to the forebrain via subcortical structures: ""Midbrain-Pons,"" ""Frontal-Subcortical,"" and ""Others."" Least-squares means were calculated to demonstrate the independent effect of lesion location. RESULTS: Total MADRS scores decreased more significantly in the escitalopram than in the placebo group, while a significant effect of escitalopram was observed in only 3 items: apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts. In the lesion location analyses, escitalopram users in the Frontal-Subcortical group showed significant improvement in total MADRS scores (placebo [n = 130] vs. escitalopram [n = 148], least-square mean [95% CI]: -2.3 [-3.5 to -0.2] vs. -4.5 [-5.5 to -3.4], p = .005), while those in the Midbrain-Pons and Others groups did not. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of escitalopram on PSD may be more prominent in patients with particular depressive symptoms and stroke lesion locations, suggesting the need for tailored treatment strategies.","Lee, Eun-Jae; Kim, Jong S; Chang, Dae-Il; Park, Jong-Ho; Ahn, Seong Hwan; Cha, Jae-Kwan; Heo, Ji Hoe; Sohn, Sung-Il; Lee, Byung-Chul; Kim, Dong-Eog; Kim, Hahn Young; Kim, Seongheon; Kwon, Do-Young; Kim, Jei; Seo, Woo-Keun; Lee, Jun; Park, Sang-Won; Koh, Seong-Ho; Kim, Jin Young; Choi-Kwon, Smi; Kim, Min-Sun; Lee, Ji-Sung",J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol,,553

METHODS: We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations. The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers. English abstracts of Chinese language papers were included. Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted. RESULTS: 24 studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review. Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies. Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection. Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted. Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.","Mehta, Nisha S; Mytton, Oliver T; Mullins, Edward W S; Fowler, Tom A; Falconer, Catherine L; Murphy, Orla B; Langenberg, Claudia; Jayatunga, Wikum J P; Eddy, Danielle H; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S",Clin. infect. dis,,553

Amongst these, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the emerging SARS-cov-2 are known to cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, especially, in vulnerable individuals like immunocompromised patients or the elderly, leading to a considerable economic burden worldwide. In this context, resveratrol may have potential value for its anti-inflammatory activity, since most of the severe virus-associated complications are related to the overactivation of the host-immune response, leading to lung damage. Herein, we present an overview of the antiviral activity and potential mechanisms of resveratrol against the respiratory tract viruses considered as a public threat for their rapid transmission and high morbidity and mortality in the general population.","Filardo, Simone; Di Pietro, Marisa; Mastromarino, Paola; Sessa, Rosa",Pharmacol Ther,,553

He is known to have a severe intellectual disability of unknown cause as well as schizophrenia, for which he takes 200 mg of clozapine twice daily. The clozapine trough level at steady state was 553mg/L, the clozapine level/dose (C/D) ratio 1.4, and the clozapine/norclozapine (C/N) ratio 1.7. COVID-19 may be associated with hyper inflammation and extremely severe pneumonia. This case illustrates that this can lead to an unexpectedly high increase in the clozapine level, with the danger of intoxication. The recommendation to reduce the dosage of clozapine by half is therefore probably not cautious enough. Frequent monitoring of the patient for any symptoms of intoxication and monitoring the clozapine levels may help to determine the dose day by day to avoid both underdosing, with the risk of psychotic relapse, and overdosing, with the risk of intoxication. Calculating the C/D ratio may help with this. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Tio, Niels Schulte Peter F.; Martens, Harrie J.",The American Journal of Psychiatry,,553

Evidence for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) was uncertain (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.69 - 100.03). Two RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may make little to no difference to ILI infection risk versus no masks (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.81 - 1.19) in the community setting. Five RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may slightly reduce infection risk v. no masks (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.55 - 1.20) in the household setting. CONCLUSIONS: Direct evidence for cloth and medical mask efficacy and effectiveness in the community is limited. Decision-making for mask use may consider other factors such as feasibility and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics; however, well-designed comparative effectiveness studies are required.","Chetty, T; Ramokolo, V; Rees, K; Kredo, T; Balakrishna, Y; Mathews, C; Siegfried, N",S Afr Med J,,553

PLPs are likely involved in bacterial interaction with plants and animals as well as in bacterial pathogenesis. We demonstrated that the PLP genes in bacteria colocalize with the genes of putative conserved proteins. In S. proteamaculans, these two genes form a bicistronic operon. The putative S. proteamaculans protein that we called emfourin (M4in) was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. M4in forms a complex with protealysin with a 1:1 stoichiometry and is a potent slow-binding competitive inhibitor of protealysin (Ki = 52 ± 14 pM); besides, M4in is not secreted from S. proteamaculans constitutively. A comparison of amino acid sequences of M4in and its homologs with those of known inhibitors suggests that M4in is the prototype of a new family of protein inhibitors of proteases.","Chukhontseva, Ksenia N; Berdyshev, Igor M; Safina, Dina R; Karaseva, Maria A; Bozin, Timur N; Salnikov, Vadim V; Konarev, Petr V; Volkov, Vladimir V; Grishin, Alexander V; Kozlovskiy, Viacheslav I; Kostrov, Sergey V; Demidyuk, Ilya V",Int. j. biol. macromol,,553

To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatiotemporal mechanistic framework to integrate individual surveillance data with geolocation data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We analyze reported cases, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the state of Georgia. First, our results show that the reproductive number reduced to below one in about 2 wk after the shelter-in-place order. Superspreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in rural areas and an increasing importance toward later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases were directly responsible for 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected nonelderly cases (<60 y) may be 2.78 [2.10, 4.22] times more infectious than the elderly, and the former tend to be the main driver of superspreading. Our results improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectiousness and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of superspreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.","Lau, Max S Y; Grenfell, Bryan; Thomas, Michael; Bryan, Michael; Nelson, Kristin; Lopman, Ben",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,553

This was a case series observed during May 2020 in two referral centers for COVID-19 treatment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 47 eyes from 25 hospitalized patients with severe or critical confirmed illness were evaluated. A handheld retinal camera was used to acquire bilateral fundus images at several time points after symptoms onset. Electronic health records were retrospectively analyzed and clinical data collected. Severe and critical diseases were noticed in 52% (13/25) and 48% (12/25) of enrolled patients, respectively. Retinal changes were present in 12% (3/25) of patients: a 35 year-old male demonstrated bilateral nerve fiber layer infarcts and microhemorrhages in the papillomacular bundle, but required mechanical ventilation and developed severe anemia and systemic hypotension, acute kidney injury and neurologic symptoms during the course of the disease (critical illness); a 56 year-old male, who required full enoxaparin anticoagulation due to particularly elevated D-dimer (>5.0 mcg/mL), demonstrated unilateral and isolated flame-shaped hemorrhages; and a 49 year-old hypertensive male showed bilateral and discrete retinal dot and blot microhemorrhages. The other 22 patients evaluated did not demonstrate convincing retinal changes upon examination. There was no correlation between disease severity and admission serum levels of CRP, D-dimer and ferritin. This was the first study to show that vascular retinal changes may be present in not insignificant numbers of severe or critical COVID-19 inpatients. These retinal changes, only seen after morbid developments, were likely secondary to clinical intercurrences or comorbidities instead of a direct damage by SARS-CoV-2, and may be important and easily accessible outcome measures of therapeutic interventions and sentinels of neurologic and systemic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic.","Lani-Louzada, Rafael; Ramos, Carolina do Val Ferreira; Cordeiro, Ricardo Mello; Sadun, Alfredo A",PLoS One,,553

We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on trends in hospital admissions and workflow parameters of acute stroke care in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. METHODS: We used data from the three hospitals that provide acute stroke care for the Amsterdam region. We compared two 7-week periods: one during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak (March 16th-May 3th 2020) and one prior to the outbreak (October 21st-December 8th 2019). We included consecutive patients who presented to the emergency departments with a suspected stroke and assessed the change in number of patients as an incidence-rate ratio (IRR) using a Poisson regression analysis. Other outcomes were the IRR for stroke subtypes, change in use of reperfusion therapy, treatment times, and in-hospital complications. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, 309 patients presented with a suspected stroke compared to 407 patients in the pre-COVID-19 period (IRR 0.76 95%CI 0.65-0.88). The proportion of men was higher during the COVID-19 period (59% vs. 47%, p < 0.001). There was no change in the proportion of stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.58) or endovascular thrombectomy (11% vs 12%, p = 0.82) or associated treatment times. Seven patients (all ischemic strokes) were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We observed a 24% decrease in suspected stroke presentations during the COVID-19 outbreak, but no evidence for a decrease in quality of acute stroke care.","Rinkel, L A; Prick, J C M; Slot, R E R; Sombroek, N M A; Burggraaff, J; Groot, A E; Emmer, B J; Roos, Y B W E M; Brouwer, M C; van den Berg-Vos, R M; Majoie, C B L M; Beenen, L F M; van de Beek, D; Visser, M C; van Schaik, S M; Coutinho, J M",J. neurol,,553

Proper knowledge, perception, and practices towards COVID-19 are essential for these patients during pandemic. This study aimed to know their knowledge, perception, and practices regarding COVID-19. METHODS: cross sectional study using online survey was conducted from April to May 2020. Patients with autoimmune disease were asked about demographic characteristics, diagnosis, history of treatment, knowledge, perception, and practice regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: there were 685 respondents. Most of them were female and had systemic lupus erythematosus with median age of 37 years old. Almost all respondents had good knowledge regarding transmission of COVID-19 and did proper prevention practices. Adequacy of information and steroid or mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (MMF/MPA) use were related to perception of the effect of pandemic to their own health. Visiting private clinic and receiving hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine sulfate or sulfasalazine were related to perception that autoimmune conditions would make them more prone to COVID-19. Work from home was related to perception that when contracting COVID-19, the symptoms would be more severe. Living in Sumatra region and getting hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine sulfate or MMF/MPA were related to perception that autoimmune medications could reduce risk of getting COVID-19. Adequate information, university education, private clinic visit, and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine sulfate use were related to perception that COVID-19 pandemic would cause difficulties in getting medications. CONCLUSION: almost all respondents had good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19. Adequacy of information, autoimmune treatment, work from home, educational background, area of living, and health care facilities contributed to perception regarding COVID-19 pandemic.","Widhani, Alvina; Rengganis, Iris; Susanto, Agus Joko; Surachmanto, Eko E; Hasibuan, Anshari Saifuddin; Fetarayani, Deasy; Mulya, Deshinta Putri; Kurniati, Nova; Yunihastuti, Evy; Masri, Raveinal; Karjadi, Teguh Harjono; Koesnoe, Sukamto; Zubir, Zuhrial; Alimudin, Suriani; Estiasari, Riwanti; Safri, Ahmad Yanuar; Maria, Suzy",Acta Med Indones,,553

463024,SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy: A comparison of restricted and extended strategies in a Swiss outpatient cohort from the community and hospital employees,2021,"BACKGROUND: In case of a population-wide infectious disease outbreak, such as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), people's online activities could significantly affect public concerns and health behaviors due to difficulty in accessing credible information from reliable sources, which in turn causes people to seek necessary information on the web. Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of people's anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. METHODS: We collected 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from Naver, the most popular Korean web portal (January 20, 2020, to March 2, 2020). Three main methods were used in this study: (1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions; (2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions; and (3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 50 topics and 6 cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. Although relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries. A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19. Our research also contributes to developing methods for measuring public opinion and sentiment in an epidemic situation based on natural language data on the internet.","Jo, Wonkwang; Lee, Jaeho; Park, Junli; Kim, Yeol",J Med Internet Res,,553

RESULTS: In April 2020, 53% of the clinics provided only emergency treatment and 24% had closed. Reasons included unavailability of anaesthetists, infection control measures and staff sickness. Restrictions persisted in July, with disruption to an estimated 437 individuals' treatment and poor outcomes, including clinical deterioration and readmission. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Risk stratification, longer clinic sessions, improvements in ventilation, regular virus testing, pragmatic staff rostering and availability of personal protective equipment will protect against service disruption in subsequent waves of the pandemic.","Braithwaite, Richard; Chaplin, Robert; Sivasanker, Vimal",BJPsych Bull,,553
463807,Modelling the impact of the tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns,2021,"BACKGROUND: Oral healthcare education for health professional students is important to promote collaborative oral healthcare practice among health professionals. The purpose of this follow-up, cross-sectional study was to investigate attitudes, awareness, and perceptions regarding oral healthcare among dental and nursing students and to compare them both between baseline and the completion of the education programme and between dental and nursing students to identify problems with oral healthcare programmes in dental education. METHOD: The subjects included 88 dental and 119 nursing students. The dental students participated in geriatric and preventive dentistry courses for oral healthcare education. The nursing students participated in independent oral healthcare courses comprising 45 h of training with case-based learning and were taught and instructed by multiple health professionals, including dentists. Questionnaires were distributed to the participants to compare attitudes, awareness, and perceptions regarding oral healthcare between baseline and the completion of the education programme and between dental and nursing students. A chi-square test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the data. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The data of 48 (28 male and 20 female) dental students and 103 (9 male and 94 female) nursing students who completed the questionnaires both at baseline and after the education programme were used for the comparisons. After the education programme, more than 90% of the students were interested in oral healthcare practice; hoped to practise oral healthcare post-qualification; and perceived oral healthcare to be effective for preventing dental caries, periodontal diseases, and aspiration pneumonia. These attitudes and perceptions were statistically significantly improved after the education. However, the level of awareness of oral healthcare and the level of perception of the importance of collaboration with healthcare workers in oral healthcare practice after education were lower in the dental students than in the nursing students. Multi-professional oral healthcare education with case-based learning has the potential to improve awareness of oral healthcare and perceptions of the importance of collaborative oral healthcare practice.","Haresaku, Satoru; Umezaki, Yojiro; Egashira, Rui; Naito, Toru; Kubota, Keiko; Iino, Hidechika; Aoki, Hisae; Nakashima, Fuyuko",BMC Oral Health,,553

METHODS: Retrospective study collecting demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted at Southend University Hospital from 20th February to 7th May 2020. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort admitted to hospital with Covid-19 was 69.4 and 58% were over 70. Comorbidities were more frequently observed in non-survivors, whose mean Clinical Frailty Scale was significantly higher (5 vs 3) than survivors, p < 0.001. In addition, mean C-reactive protein was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: Older and frailer patients with high inflammatory markers were at risk of poor outcomes. Integrated frailty and age-based risk stratification is essential, in addition to monitoring saturation /FiO2 ratio (SFR) and inflammatory markers throughout the disease course to allow for early intervention to improve patient outcomes. A frailty-based risk-stratification approach, rather than age may prove more valuable when considering interventions in patients with multiple comorbidities.","Koduri, Gouri; Gokaraju, Sriya; Darda, Maria; Warrier, Vinod; Duta, Irina; Hayes, Fiona; Sayed, Iman El; Noeman-Ahmed, Yasser",,,553

The objective of this study is to assess the status of the Government of Nepal designated COVID hospitals and COVID clinics to respond against COVID-19. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted with the focal persons of COVID hospitals and COVID clinics using a semi-structured questionnaire from April 26, 2020 to May 27, 2020 via face to face interview with onsite observation and telephonic interview in few unreachable health facilities. Results: Government of Nepal designated COVID hospitals and COVID clinics demonstrated efforts in establishing preparedness plans and committees such as COVID management core team (96.7% and 86%), provision of coordination with the government authority (both 100% ), preparedness response plan (93.3% and 84%), and infection prevention and control committee (63.3% and 65.6%) to respond to COVID-19 respectively. The participants reported differences in training provided to their health care workers with maximum COVID hospitals (80%) providing training on use of personal protective equipment and least (43.3%) on handling dead bodies. Only half of the COVID clinics (49.5%) had provision of triage systems. CONCLUSIONS: COVID hospitals and COVID clinics in Nepal demonstrated different status of COVID pandemic preparedness and readiness. In case of surge, Nepalese hospitals would struggle due to lack of trained workforce and infrastructure.

479789,SARS-CoV-2 transmission without symptoms,2021,"The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model offers the simplest framework to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19, however, it does not factor in its early depleting trend observed during a lockdown. We modified the SIR model to specifically simulate the early depleting transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to better predict its temporal trend in Malaysia. The classical SIR model was fitted to observed total (I total), active (I) and removed (R) cases of COVID-19 before lockdown to estimate the basic reproduction number. Next, the model was modified with a partial time-varying force of infection, given by a proportionally depleting transmission coefficient, [Formula: see text] and a fractional term, z. The modified SIR model was then fitted to observed data over 6 weeks during the lockdown. Model fitting and projection were validated using the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 was interrupted immediately by the lockdown. The modified SIR model projected the depleting temporal trends with lowest MAPE for I total, followed by I, I daily and R. During lockdown, the dynamics of COVID-19 depleted at a rate of 4.7% each day with a decreased capacity of 40%. For 7-day and 14-day projections, the modified SIR model accurately predicted I total, I and R. The depleting transmission dynamics for COVID-19 during lockdown can be accurately captured by time-varying SIR model. Projection generated based on observed data is useful for future planning and control of COVID-19.","Law, Kian Boon; Peariasamy, Kalaiarasu M; Gill, Balvinder Singh; Singh, Sarbhan; Sundram, Bala Murali; Rajendran, Kamesh; Dass, Sarat Chandra; Lee, Yi Lin; Goh, Pik Pin; Ibrahim, Hishamshah; Abdullah, Noor Hisham",Sci Rep,,553

Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling stereoselectivity in such a complex system, the products are obtained in enantiomeric excesses ranging up to > 99% ee, exceeding those obtained from either of the individual asymmetric reactions. In addition, since the stereoselectivity of both steps is under catalyst-control, this one-pot reaction is enantio- and diastereodivergent, enabling facile access to all stereoisomers starting from the same set of starting materials.","Masson-Makdissi, Jeanne; Prieto, Liher; Abel-Snape, Xavier; Lautens, Mark",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,553

Previous works assumed either no or very low corruption. Our method trains a robust variational autoencoder (VAE), which aims to generate a model for the uncorrupted training points. To gain robustness to corruption, we incorporate three changes to the common VAE: 1. Modeling the latent distribution as a mixture of Gaussian inliers and outliers, while using only the inlier component when testing; 2. Applying the Wasserstein-1 metric for regularization, instead of Kullback-Leibler divergence; and 3. Using a least absolute deviation error for reconstruction, which is equivalent to assuming a heavy-tailed likelihood. We illustrate state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark datasets for novelty detection.","Lai, Chieh-Hsin; Zou, Dongmian; Lerman, Gilad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05534v1.pdf,553

The complete lack of specific treatment forced clinicians to use old drugs, chosen for their efficacy against similar viruses or their in vitro activity. Trials on patients are ongoing but the majority of information comes from small case series and single center reports. We aimed to provide a literature review on the putative effectiveness and safety of available treatments for COVID-19 in pregnant women.Methods: We reviewed all the available literature concerning the drugs that have been used in the treatment of COVID-19 during pregnancy and whose safe assumption during pregnancy had been demonstrated by clinical studies (i.e. including studies on other infectious diseases). Drugs contra-indicated during pregnancy or with unknown adverse effects were not included in our review.Results and conclusions: Clinical trials are not often conducted among pregnant patients for safety reasons and this means that drugs that may be effective in general population cannot be used for pregnant women due to the lack of knowledge of side effects in this category of people .The choice to use a specific drug for COVID-19 in pregnancy should take into account benefits and possible adverse events in each single case. In the current situation of uncertainty and poor knowledge about the management of COVID-19 during pregnancy, this present overview may provide useful information for physicians with practical implications.","Favilli, Alessandro; Mattei Gentili, Marta; Raspa, Francesca; Giardina, Irene; Parazzini, Fabio; Vitagliano, Amerigo; Borisova, Anna V; Gerli, Sandro",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,553

This hinders the application of inorganic-organic biohybrid materials in various fields, including bioelectronics, energy generation, and biomedicine. Silicatein, an enzyme found in siliceous sponges, catalyzes the polymerization of silica under mild conditions, that is, at room temperature and neutral pH. Silicatein was fused with a chitin-binding domain (ChBD) to selectively bind the fusion silicatein on the chitin material and with a small soluble tag called InakC, a hydrophilic protein from Pseudomonas syringae, to control the unfavorable aggregation of silicatein. The fusion silicatein was soluble in aqueous media and was successfully found to be adsorbed on the chitin material. The immobilized fusion silicatein acted as an interfacial catalyst to fabricate silica on chitin under ambient conditions. This technique can be used to fabricate inorganic-organic hybrid materials to immobilize biomolecules and can be applied to develop novel biocatalytic systems, biosensors, and tissue culture scaffolds.","Godigamuwa, Kasun; Nakashima, Kazunori; Tsujitani, Sota; Kawasaki, Satoru",Bioprocess biosyst. eng,,553

Some universities could only provide emergency online learning since they were not ready to conduct proper online learning. This switching may decrease the students' engagement with learning and impact their perceived competencies. Operational accounting competencies (OAC) are important basic competencies which allow accounting graduates to perform generic jobs in their field. Hence, this study attempts to identify the impact of emergency online learning on students' perceived OAC. A survey was used to collect data on the students' engagement with synchronous and asynchronous learning and OAC. The study collected 122 items of data and analysed them using descriptive and path analyses. The students have reported that synchronous learning-online classroom engagement-only had a small impact on improving their perceived OAC. The improvement in the students' perceived OAC was mainly caused by asynchronous learning in terms of active, collaborative and enrichment learning. Lecturers should improve their skills in organising online learning to increase their students' engagement. Accounting departments need to provide a more complete structure, better infrastructure, and other necessary technologies to improve online learning, as the pandemic's duration cannot be predicted.","Yanto, H.; Hidayah, R.; Hajawiyah, A.; Baroroh, N.; Wibowo, A.",Cogent Education,,553

Outpatient diagnosis and treatment of metabolically stable young persons with new-onset T1D have been shown to be equivalent to inpatient. We describe an approach to outpatient management of newly diagnosed T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic using an interdisciplinary team, telemedicine, and diabetes technologies including rapid implementation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Methods: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, new-onset cases of T1D were tracked. After laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and metabolic stability, patients and families were referred for ambulatory initiation of insulin therapy and diabetes education. These cases were reviewed using data extracted from the electronic health record, comments from multidisciplinary team members, and cloud-based glucose data. Results: We report on seven young people with new-onset T1D without diabetic ketoacidosis from April to June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ages ranged 9-23 years with presenting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values 10-14.5%. Initial evaluation was generally face-to-face, followed by frequent telemedicine visits. Five patients had a family history of T1D. Two patients had access to at-home HbA1c kits prompting evaluation in the absence of symptoms. Four patients required emergency department evaluation.

Cell viability (by Calcein-AM staining) and ECD of five grafts originally scheduled for transplantation were evaluated on the originally planned surgery day, whereas 22 grafts from paired donor corneas were evaluated either directly post-preparation or after 3-7 days of storage. ECD was analyzed by light microscopy (LM ECD) and Calcein-AM staining (Calcein-ECD).Results: Light microscopy (LM) evaluation of all grafts showed an unremarkable endothelial cell monolayer directly after preparation. However, median Calcein-ECD for the five grafts initially allocated for transplantation was 18% (range 92-73%) lower than median LM ECD. For the paired DMEK grafts, Calcein-ECD determined by Calcein-AM staining on the day of graft preparation and after 3-7 days of graft storage showed a median decrease of 1% and 2%, respectively. Median percentage of central graft area populated by viable cells after preparation and after 3-7 days of graft storage was 88% and 92%, respectively.Conclusion: Cell viability of most of the grafts will not be affected by preparation and storage. Endothelial cell damage may be observed for some grafts within hours after preparation, with insignificant additional ECD changes during 3-7 days of graft storage. Implementing an additional post-preparation step in the eye bank to evaluate cell density before graft release for transplantation may help to reduce postoperative DMEK complications.","Miron, Alina; Sajet, Anita; Groeneveld-van Beek, Esther A; Kok, Jet S; Dedeci, Mehtap; de Jong, Maloeke; Amo-Addae, Vicky; Melles, Gerrit R J; Oellerich, Silke; van der Wees, Jacqueline",Curr Eye Res,,553

This review was conducted in a way which placed emphasis on the need for mental healthcare strategies which are mindful of the cultural and social needs of indigenous and ethnic minority populations, particularly those situated in the Global South. The review was undertaken using an inverse funnelling approach which sought to prioritise literature on videoconference-based therapy literature which specifically focused on indigenous and ethnic minority populations. A series of general and population specific searches across relevant health databases were supplemented by a simultaneous search of Google Scholar. The PICOS search tool was used in developing the search terms, and data was processed using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. A final dataset of 43 articles were included in the review. This body of literature encompassed an international range of studies and included perspectives informed by quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods research. Four key themes were identified across the reviewed literature: indigenous and ethnic minority populations, therapeutic relationships, clinical outcomes and technical and logistical considerations. Based on our findings, there is reason to believe that videoconference-based therapy can be made to be just as effective as offline, face-to-face modes of delivery. However, research into the efficacy, impact and cultural implications of this technology in relation to indigenous and ethnic minority populations represents a significant gap within contemporary literature.","Classen, Ben; Tudor, Keith; du Preez, Elizabeth; Day, Elizabeth; Ioane, Julia; Rodgers, Brian",J Technol Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898737/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-021-00209-3,553

Hallway healthcare or hallway medicine is defined as the use of unconventional spaces, such as hallways, to provide patient care in the acute care setting. Negative effects associated with the prevalence of hallway healthcare may hinder the healing trajectory of vulnerable and ageing populations. Nurses have an intimate role in the provision of care and can offer valuable insight for the advocacy of high quality and safe patient care. Moreover, hallway healthcare is associated with the development of suboptimal working conditions that have resulted in negative impacts on the nursing profession. The authors seek to better understand the occurrence of this phenomenon by exploring the development of healthcare policies in relation to the neoliberal tenets of, individualism, free market via deregulation and privatization, and decentralization. This article provides an analysis of the historical evolution of hallway healthcare and neoliberalism. Furthermore, the authors aim to explore and demonstrate how the COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the inefficiency of neoliberalism ideologies for healthcare.

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this including issues of genetics, physiology, nutrition and management, and these factors have been investigated at the animal, organ and cellular level at critical time points of the productive life of dairy cows. This paper reviews the physiological events and their causes and consequences affecting fertility in dairy cows and summarises these in a downloadable poster. We consider the following points to have the greatest negative impact on fertility and that they need to be prioritised in efforts to ameliorate the problem (others have been included in the review). Firstly, minimise negative energy balance and resolve any infection of the post partum uterus. Secondly, expression and detection of oestrus followed by insemination with high quality semen (day 0). Thirdly, ovulation and fertilisation of a high quality oocyte (day 1). Fourthly, an early increase in progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum (days 3–7). Fifthly, the uterine endometrium must produce an early and appropriate environment to stimulate embryo development (days 6–13). This leads to sixthly, a large embryo producing adequate quantities of interferon tau (days 14–18) that alters uterine prostaglandin secretion and signals maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 16–18). Future strategies to improve dairy cow fertility are needed for the benefit of the dairy industry and for cow welfare and should be based upon an integrative approach of these events.","Walsh, S.W.; Williams, E.J.; Evans, A.C.O.",Anim Reprod Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21255947/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037843201000480X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.12.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843201000480X,553

In this article, we have provided tips and helpful pointers to medical students and residents, based on available literature and authors’ expertise in managing formative, summative, and virtual OSCE experiences. In virtual OSCEs, in-person learning objectives need to be modified to the virtual milieu and new competencies such as “webside manner” need to be introduced.

The present study aimed to investigate the predictors of disease severity and thus determine the trends for disease progression early. MATERIAL/METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from Fuyang Second People’s Hospital from January to February 2020. Patients’ demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected, and the relationships between these variables and disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 158 cases were included according to COVID-19 diagnosis, and the treatment schemes were analyzed for identification of early indicators affecting COVID-19 progression. Severe cases accounted for 18.99% of the diagnosed cases. Analysis showed that patients’ age (χ(2)=10.640,=0.041); the time interval between onset and diagnosis (χ(2)=7.278, P=0.026); the source of cases (χ(2)=5.557, P=0.018); fever (χ(2)=5.676, P=0.014); dyspnea (χ(2)=113.085, P<0.001); muscle or joint pain (χ(2)=3.900, P=0.048); chest pain (χ(2)=13.446, P=0.006); the levels of lymphocytes (t=2.917, P=0.014), C-reactive protein (U=730.00, P<0.001), and aspartate aminotransferase (U=1235.00, P=0.002); damage in both lungs within 3 days of admission (χ(2)=7.632, P=0.003); and diabetes (χ(2)=6.675, P=0.010) were significantly correlated with the trend of intensification. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, a long time interval from onset to diagnosis, imported cases from an affected area, dyspnea, muscle or joint pain, chest pain during the course of the disease, reduced lymphocytes, elevated C-reactive protein, computed tomography scan showing damage to both lungs within 3 days of admission, and diabetes mellitus are predictors for severe COVID-19.","Li, Liang; Sun, Wei; Han, Mingfeng; Ying, Yunli; Wang, Quanzhi",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.927167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32963215/,553

Different versions of the RBD protein have been developed and utilized in assays, with higher sensitivity attributed to particular forms of the protein. To improve the yield of these high-sensitivity forms of RBD and support the increased demand for this antigen in serology assays, we investigated several protein expression variables including DNA elements such as promoters and signal peptides, cell culture expression parameters, and purification processes. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently resulted in high levels of the high-sensitivity form of RBD and demonstrated that a carboxyterminal tag is responsible for the increased sensitivity in the ELISA. These improved reagents and processes produce high-quality proteins which are functional in serology assays and can be used to investigate seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Mehalko, Jennifer; Drew, Matthew; Snead, Kelly; Denson, John-Paul; Wall, Vanessa; Taylor, Troy; Sadtler, Kaitlyn; Messing, Simon; Gillette, William; Esposito, Dominic",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236017/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.18.388868,553

Lockdown is often an unpleasant experience due to a separation from loved ones, loss of freedom, and uncertainty over the disease status. To adjust, individuals and groups have had to adapt their perceptions of the event to the current scenario. This study aims to describe the perceptions of confined people on the changes occurring in their lives in the aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: A total of 1,534 individuals (26.6% men; 73.4% women; mean age 41.6) responded to the questionnaire comprising 19 closed and five open-ended questions about the changes they anticipated in their lives in the immediate post-confinement era. Results: Two definite groups appeared in the results: those who lived the confinement pleasantly, and those for which it was painful. They differ according to their confinement conditions and perceived degree of exposure to the virus. There seems to be a link for those who had a pleasant experience to a lower perceived exposure to the virus and less burdensome confinement conditions (young children, surface area, etc.). Lockdown conditions seem to influence the respondents' perceptions: a pleasant experience is associated with a vision of the society's evolution at large, and the care about its economic and professional progress; a painful one is associated more with focusing on the immediate needs of social support and personal well-being. Discussion: Emotional experience during lockdown impacts the perception of its aftermath, with hope and anxiety becoming two ways of coping with uncertainty.","Fouques, Damien; Castro, Dana; Mouret, Marion; Julien-Sweerts, Sabrina; Romo, Lucia",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262509/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.668961,553

Despite many studies predicting the likelihood of bacteremia in CAP patients, those results have been rarely implemented in clinical practice, and use of blood culture in CAP is still increasing. This study evaluated impact of implementing a previously derived and validated bacteremia prediction rule. METHODS: In this registry-based before and after study, we used piecewise regression analysis to compare the blood culture rate before and after implementation of the prediction rule. We also compared 30-day mortality, emergency department (ED) length of stay, time-interval to initial antibiotics after ED arrival, and any changes to the antibiotics regimen as results of the blood cultures. In subgroup analysis, we compared two groups (with or without the use of the prediction rule) after implementation period, using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Following the implementation, the blood culture rate declined from 85.5% to 78.1% (P = 0.003) without significant changes in 30-day mortality and antibiotics regimen. The interval to initial antibiotics (231 min vs. 221 min, P = 0.362) and length of stay (1019 min vs. 954 min, P = 0.354) were not significantly changed. In subgroup analysis, the group that use the prediction rule showed 25 min faster antibiotics initiation (P = 0.002) and 48 min shorter length of stay (P = 0.007) than the group that did not use the rule. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the bacteremia prediction rule in CAP patients reduced the blood culture rate without affecting the 30-day mortality and antibiotics regimen.","Kim, Byunghyun; Kim, Kyuseok; Lee, Jieun; Kim, Joonghee; Jo, Yoo Hwan; Lee, Jae Hyuk; Hwang, Ji Eun",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988847/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675717308070; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675717308070; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2017.10.005,553

We investigated how alterations in spike affect neurovirulence using two isogenic recombinant viruses differing exclusively in spike. S4R, containing the MHV-4 spike gene, is dramatically more neurovirulent than SA59R, containing the MHV-A59 spike gene (J. J. Phillips, M. M. Chua, E. Lavi, and S. R. Weiss, 1999, J. Virol. 73, 7752–7760). We examined the contribution of differences in cellular tropism, viral spread, and the immune response to infection to the differential neurovirulence of S4R and SA59R. MHV-4 spike-mediated neurovirulence was associated with extensive viral spread in the brain in both neurons and astrocytes. Infection of primary hippocampal neuron cultures demonstrated that S4R spread more rapidly than SA59R and suggested that spread may occur between cells in close physical contact. In addition, S4R infection induced a massive influx of lymphocytes into the brain, a higher percentage of CD8+ T cells, and a higher frequency of MHV-specific CD8+ T cells relative SA59R infection. Despite this robust and viral-specific immune response to S4R infection, infection of RAG1−/− mice suggested that immune-mediated pathology also contributes to the high neurovirulence of S4R.","Phillips, Joanna J.; Chua, Ming Ming; Rall, Glenn F.; Weiss, Susan R.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202915515; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202915515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12359451/,553

Here, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (R0); (d) the ""effective"" per-day disease transmission; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death, the case fatality ratio, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the ``effective"" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy and of all Italy. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. Furthermore, based on an estimation for the reduction in the ""effective"" transmission rate of the disease as of March 8 that reflects the suspension of almost all activities in Italy, we ran the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, the effect of social distancing, and the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results. Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the DAY-ZERO was most likely between January 5 and January 23 with the most probable date the 15th of January 2020. The actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. The ""effective"" per-day disease transmission rate for the period until March 8 was found to be 0.686 (95% CI:0.660, 0.713), while the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.51 (95% CI: 4.14, 4.90). Importantly, simulations show that the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy is expected to fade out by the end of May - early June, 2020, if the draconian, as of March 20 and March 21, measures are maintained.","Russo, Lucia; Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Tsakris, Athanassios; Bifulco, Gennaro Nicola; Campana, Emilio Fortunato; Toraldo, Gerardo; Siettos, Constantinos",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037689,553

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD). Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals. Summing all, the designed MEPVC has tremendous potential of providing protective immunity against COVID-19 and thus has the potential to be considered in experimental studies.","Ismail, Saba; Ahmad, Sajjad; Azam, Syed Sikander",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026005,553
600927,EXPRESSION OF CONCERN: Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the prepandemic period in Italy.,2021-03-22,"The presented data clearly demonstrate that multinuclear MRI has a great potential in research and clinical fields. The biomedical value of many heavy nuclei that are part of drugs, contrast agents, and molecular complexes in live tissues emphasizes the need for creating and using MRI scanners tuned to the Larmor frequencies of such nuclei. This article discusses a number of specific problems solved with the use of multinuclear MRI. Since the sensitivity of the MRI on heavy nuclei, as a rule, is insufficient for obtaining images of satisfactory quality, it is proposed to use hyperpolarization techniques for preparing objects for the MRI diagnostics. However, bearing in mind the high cost of hyperpolarization techniques, alternative approaches using contrast agents normally absent in tissues can be more suitable in certain situations. For instance, due to the absence of fluorine in the body, (19)F MRI allows for successful diagnostics of the respiratory tract and lungs filled with fluorine-containing gas, detecting the location of the blood substitute Perftoran® in the body, monitoring the transport along the gastrointestinal tract of a capsule filled with a preparation containing fluorine-19 nuclei, etc. The possibility of non-invasive local measurements of the concentration of sodium-23 in the body, which, in case of a deviation from the norm, is linked to such pathologies as diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, and many others, is also demonstrated. Reported as well is the creation of transmitting and receiving infrastructure that makes possible effective MRI measurements at low fields (of about 0.5 T) at 10 Larmor frequencies corresponding to the nuclei of hydrogen, deuterium, fluorine, boron, chlorine, sodium, carbon, phosphorus, silicon and oxygen.","Pirogov, Yu.

We sought to characterize the neurologic manifestations, their risk factors, and associated outcomes in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19. METHODS: We examined neurologic manifestations in 509 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed Covid‐19 within a hospital network in Chicago, Illinois. We compared the severity of Covid‐19 and outcomes in patients with and without neurologic manifestations. We also identified independent predictors of any neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy, and functional outcome using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 (42.2%), at hospitalization in 319 (62.7%), and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%). The most frequent neurologic manifestations were myalgias (44.8%), headaches (37.7%), encephalopathy (31.8%), dizziness (29.7%), dysgeusia (15.9%), and anosmia (11.4%). Strokes, movement disorders, motor and sensory deficits, ataxia, and seizures were uncommon (0.2 to 1.4% of patients each). Severe respiratory disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 134 patients (26.3%). Independent risk factors for developing any neurologic manifestation were severe Covid‐19 (OR 4.02; 95% CI 2.04–8.89; P < 0.001) and younger age (OR 0.982; 95% CI 0.968–0.996; P = 0.014). Of all patients, 362 (71.1%) had a favorable functional outcome at discharge (modified Rankin Scale 0–2). However, encephalopathy was independently associated with worse functional outcome (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11–0.42; P < 0.001) and higher mortality within 30 days of hospitalization (35 [21.7%] vs. 11 [3.2%] patients; P < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Neurologic manifestations occur in most hospitalized Covid‐19 patients. Encephalopathy was associated with increased morbidity and mortality, independent of respiratory disease severity.","Liotta, Eric M.; Batra, Ayush; Clark, Jeffrey R.; Shlobin, Nathan A.; Hoffman, Steven C.; Orban, Zachary S.; Koralnik, Igor J.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.51210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33016619/,553
605348,Nanobody Repertoires for Exposing Vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2,2021-04-10,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We aimed to predict the targets and signal pathways of Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (XCHT) in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on network pharmacology, just as well as to further analyze its anti-CRC material basis and mechanism of action. METHODS: We adopted Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID) databases to screen the active ingredients and potential targets of XCHT. CRC-related targets were retrieved by analyzing published microarray data (accession number GSE110224) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The common targets were used to construct the “herb-active ingredient-target” network using the Cytoscape 3.8.0 software. Next, we constructed and analyzed protein-to-protein interaction (PPI) using BisoGenet and CytoNCA plug-in in Cytoscape. We then performed Gene Ontology (GO) functional and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of target genes using the R package of clusterProfiler. Furthermore, we used the AutoDock Tools software to conduct molecular docking studies on the active ingredients and key targets to verify the network pharmacological analysis results. RESULTS: We identified a total of 71 active XCHT ingredients and 20 potential anti-CRC targets. The network analysis revealed quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, baicalein, and acacetin as potential key compounds, and PTGS2, NR3C2, CA2, and MMP1 as potential key targets. The active ingredients of XCHT interacted with most CRC disease targets. We showed that XCHT’s therapeutic effect was attributed to its synergistic action (multi-compound, multi-target, and multi-pathway). Our GO enrichment analysis showed 46 GO entries, including 20 biological processes, 6 cellular components, and 20 molecular functions. We identified 11 KEGG signaling pathways, including the IL-17, TNF, Toll-like receptor, and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Our results showed that XCHT could play a role in CRC treatment by regulating different signaling pathways. The molecular docking experiment confirmed the correlation between five core compounds (quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, baicalein, and acacetin) just as well as PTGS2, NR3C2, CA2, and MMP1. CONCLUSION: In this study, we described the potential active ingredients, possible targets, and key biological pathways responsible for the efficacy of XCHT in CRC treatment, providing a theoretical basis for further research.","Jin, Jingyun; Chen, Bin; Zhan, Xiangyang; Zhou, Zhiyi; Liu, Hui; Dong, Yun",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125845/,553

Based on Lacanian psychoanalysis theory, this study analyzes the decision-making mechanism of the willingness of rural populations settling in cities (RPSC), and analyzes the key factors that affect the willingness of RPSC by using the binary Logit regression method based on survey data in Changyi, China. The results show that the willingness of RPSC is a realistic choice under the joint action of the ‘mirrored’ incarnation and the ‘non-mirrored’ order. Among the factors, ‘age’, ‘ethnic groups’, ‘educational attainment’, and ‘social intercourse’, representing the ‘mirrored’ incarnation, and ‘communities’ safety gap’, ‘healthcare services policy’, ‘public housing policy’ and ‘employment insurance gap’, representing the ‘non-mirrored’ order, are significant in affecting the willingness of RPSC. These findings validate the adaptability of psychoanalysis to analyze the willingness of RPSC, and increases the understanding of individual willingness and behavioral choice in the context of a specific social background, which can provide decision-making reference for urban and rural planning and public policy makers.","Yang, Zhiheng; Shen, Nengneng; Li, Chenxi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351811/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243775,553

However, when mechanical ventilation and prone positioning are unsuccessful, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) may be used. We present a case of a 41-year-old female, with no significant medical history and no recent history of exposure to sick contacts, presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, severe shortness of breath, and flu-like symptoms with a positive COVID-19 test. Ultimately, she worsened on mechanical ventilation and prone positioning and required VV-ECMO. The use of VV-ECMO in COVID-19 infected patients is still controversial.

We examined trends in markers of neonatal care before and during the pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi. Methods: We analysed data collected prospectively via the NeoTree app at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital (SMCH), Zimbabwe, and Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), Malawi. Neonates admitted from 1 June 2019 to 25 September 2020 were included. We modelled the impact of the first cases of COVID-19 (Zimbabwe: 20 March 2020; Malawi: 3 April 2020) on number of admissions, gestational age and birth weight, source of admission referrals, prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy, and overall mortality. Findings: The study included 3,450 neonates at SMCH and 3,350 neonates at KCH. Admission numbers at SMCH did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by 48% during a nurses' strike (Relative risk (RR) 0.52, 95%CI 0.40-0.68, p < 0.002). At KCH, admissions dropped by 42% (RR 0.58; 95%CI 0.48-0.70; p < 0.001) soon after the first case of COVID-19. At KCH, gestational age and birth weight decreased slightly (1 week, 300 grams), outside referrals dropped by 28%, and there was a slight weekly increase in mortality. No changes in these outcomes were found at SMCH. Interpretation: The indirect impacts of COVID-19 are context-specific.

No single therapeutic agent can target all these pathophysiologic substrates. Moreover, the current therapies are not fully effective in reducing mortality in moderate and severe disease. Hence, we aim to evaluate the combination of drugs (aspirin, atorvastatin, and nicorandil) with anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, immunomodulatory, and vasodilator properties as adjuvant therapy in covid- 19. TRIAL DESIGN: Single-centre, prospective, two-arm parallel design, open-label randomized control superiority trial.

All patients will receive symptomatic treatment with antipyretics, adequate hydration, anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin, intravenous remdesivir, corticosteroids (intravenous dexamethasone for 5 days or more duration if oxygen requirement increasing or inflammatory markers are raised), and oxygen support. Patients will receive treatment for comorbid conditions as per guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES: The patients will be followed up for outcomes during the hospital stay or for ten days whichever is longer. The primary outcome will be in-hospital mortality. Any progression to ARDS, shock, acute kidney injury, impaired consciousness, length of hospital stay, length of mechanical ventilation (invasive plus non-invasive) will be secondary outcomes. Changes in serum markers (CRP, D –dimer, S ferritin) will be other secondary outcomes. The safety endpoints will be hepatotoxicity (ALT/AST > 3x ULN; hyperbilirubinemia), myalgia—muscle ache, or weakness without creatine kinase (CK) elevation, myositis—muscle symptoms with increased CK levels (3-10) ULN, rhabdomyolysis—muscle symptoms with marked CK elevation (typically substantially greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and with creatinine elevation (usually with brown urine and urinary myoglobin) observed during the hospital stay. RANDOMIZATION: Computer-generated block randomization will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1 ratio to the active intervention group A (Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Nicorandil) plus conventional therapy and control group B conventional therapy only.

616050,Evaluation of Sample Pooling for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Detection in Nasopharyngeal Swabs and Salivas on the Roche Cobas 6800,2021-03-10,"Caregiving has been associated with increased levels of fear and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze when the relationship between fear and PTSS occur, using informal caregiving as a moderator variable. To explore this moderating role, we conducted a cross-sectional online study between November 2020 and January 2021. A total of 503 men and women from the Spanish general population completed the survey. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data, fear of COVID-19, PTSS symptoms, and current psychological history were assessed. Prevalence of informal caregiving in the sample was 16.5%. Increased levels of fear and PTSS were found in caregivers compared to non-caregivers. Female gender and high number of COVID-19 related risk factors was also associated with fear and PTSS severity. The moderation analyses showed an interaction effect between caregiving and fear of COVID-19 when predicting PTSS symptoms. Particularly, results showed that informal caregivers reported greater PTSS symptoms, when compared to non-caregivers with same levels of fear of COVID-19. This evidence suggests that being a caregiver could increase the fear’s impact on PTSS severity in the context of pandemics. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.","Carballo, José Luis; Coloma-Carmona, Ainhoa; Arteseros-Bañón, Sara; Pérez-Jover, Virtudes",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204088/,553

CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old non-smoking man presented with a cough and fever. He suddenly deteriorated five days later. When the basic life support team arrived, his peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) in ambient air was 56% and respiratory rate 46 per minute. The man was weak with thoracoabdominal asynchrony. An emergency medical team with a physician was sent. As France was still under lockdown for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19 was suspected. Despite 15 L/min of oxygen delivered with a non-rebreathing mask, the patient's SpO(2) tended to drop below 90% at the slightest effort and during transport from home to the ambulance. It was therefore decided to start HFNO therapy. The patient was transferred to an intensive care unit where HFNO was continued. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? As trend in emergency medical services may move toward prehospital HFNO, this case report is an opportunity to question the feasibility of HFNO therapy in the prehospital setting.","Kedzierewicz, Romain; Derkenne, Clément; Fraudin, Adrien; Vanhaecke, Paola; Jouffroy, Romain; Jost, Daniel; Prunet, Bertrand",J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467921001918; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467921001918?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994257/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.03.006,553

Although serological surveys show that BVDV exposure is widespread in cattle in Uruguay, BVDV-associated diseases are greatly underreported. The aim of this work is to describe the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, and virological findings from spontaneous outbreaks of BVDV-associated diseases in cattle in Uruguay. Diagnostic investigations were performed during 6 spontaneous disease outbreaks on beef and dairy cattle farms in the departments of Colonia, Rio Negro, and Soriano between November 2016 and April 2018. Carcasses of 8 naturally deceased cattle from these outbreaks were necropsied and subjected to histological examination and immunohistochemistry to detect BVDV antigen in the tissues. Reverse transcription real-time PCR and genomic sequencing were also performed to identify BVDV at the species and subtype levels. Other ancillary diagnostic tests, including bacterial cultures, were performed on a case-by-case basis to rule in/out differential diagnoses based on initial clinicopathological presumptive diagnoses. BVDV-associated conditions that were diagnosed in the 8 cases included mucosal disease, transient postnatal BVDV infections associated with digestive/septicemic salmonellosis by Salmonella serovar typhimurium, Histophilus somni bronchopneumonia, urinary tract coinfections with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sp., enteric coinfection with coccidia, and transplacental fetal infections and abortions with Neospora caninum coinfection. BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b were each identified in four of the eight cases. We conclude that BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b contribute significantly to disease and mortality in cattle in Uruguay. Future research should estimate the economic impact of BVDV in the Uruguayan livestock sector.

METHODS: This was the final day 28 comparative analysis of data from a phase 3, randomized, open-label study comparing 2 remdesivir regimens (5 vs 10 days, combined for this analysis [remdesivir cohort]) and a real-world retrospective longitudinal cohort study of patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (non-remdesivir cohort). Eligible patients, aged ≥18 years, had confirmed SARSCoV-2, oxygen saturation ≤94% on room air or required supplemental oxygen, with pulmonary infiltrates. Propensity score matching (up to 1:10 ratio) was used to ensure comparable populations. We assessed day 14 clinical recovery (determined using a 7-point ordinal scale) and day 28 all-cause mortality (coprimary endpoints). RESULTS: Altogether, 368 (remdesivir) and 1399 (non-remdesivir) patients were included in the matched analysis. The day 14 clinical recovery rate was significantly higher among the remdesivir versus the non-remdesivir cohort (65.2% vs 57.1%; OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16–1.90; P = .002). The day 28 mortality rate was significantly lower in the remdesivir cohort versus the non-remdesivir cohort (12.0% vs 16.2%; OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47–0.95; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir was associated with significantly higher rates of day 14 clinical recovery, and lower day 28 mortality, compared with standard-of-care treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Collectively, these data support the use of remdesivir to improve clinical recovery and decrease mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Olender, Susan A; Walunas, Theresa L; Martinez, Esteban; Perez, Katherine K; Castagna, Antonella; Wang, Su; Kurbegov, Dax; Goyal, Parag; Ripamonti, Diego; Balani, Bindu; De Rosa, Francesco G; De Wit, Stéphane; Kim, Shin-Woo; Diaz, George; Bruno, Raffaele; Mullane, Kathleen M; Chien Lye, David; Gottlieb, Robert L; Haubrich, Richard H; Chokkalingam, Anand P; Wu, George; Diaz-Cuervo, Helena; Brainard, Diana M; Lee, I-Heng; Hu, Hao; Lin, Lanjia; Osinusi, Anu O; Bernardino, Jose I; Boffito, Marta",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282406/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab278,553

Socially sustainable care systems will recognize that systemic factors and processes (social, economic, environmental, cultural) need to be addressed simultaneously in order to achieve health equity. Moreover, these systems are likely to be of paramount importance for post-COVID-19, because of the potential increase in demand for health care due to forgone health care and the increased burden of chronic diseases as spillover effects related to COVID-19 mitigation interventions.","Macassa, Gloria; Tomaselli, Gianpaolo",J Public Health Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209860/; https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2020.1834,553

Methods: We modeled the impact of public and private sector contributions to developing diagnostic testing and treatments on COVID-19-related healthcare resource use. Results: We estimated that public sector contributions lead to [≥]30% reductions in COVID-19-related healthcare resource utilization. Private sector contributions to expanded diagnostic testing and treatments lead to further reductions in mortality (-44%), intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospital beds (-30% and -28%, respectively), and ventilator use (-29%). The combination of lower diagnostic test sensitivity and proportions of patients self-isolating may exacerbate case numbers, and policies that encourage self-isolating should be considered. Conclusion: While mechanisms exist to facilitate research, development, and patient access to diagnostic testing, future policies should focus on ensuring equitable patient access to both diagnostic testing and treatments which, in turn, will alleviate COVID-19-related resource constraints.","Sheinson, D.; Wong, W.; Solon, C.; Cheng, M.; Elsea, D.; Meng, Y.; Shah, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.09.20228452v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.09.20228452,553

We assess mental health with a 10-item scale from the Symptom Checklist 90 and Internet use with a 4-item scale and obtain information of neighborhood environment from an online map platform. Results from multilevel models show that both neighborhood environment and Internet use are significantly related to mental distress. Moreover, a worse neighborhood environment may strengthen the correlation between Internet use and mental distress, indicating the strong moderating role of the neighborhood environment.

We analysed the temporal trend in total excess mortality and deaths among positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 by geographical area (north and centre-south), age and sex, taking into account the deficit in mortality in previous months. METHODS Data from the Italian rapid mortality surveillance system was used to quantify excess deaths during the epidemic, to estimate the mortality deficit during the previous months and to compare total excess mortality with deaths among positive cases of SARS-CoV-2. Data were stratified by geographical area (north vs centre and south), age and sex. RESULTS COVID-19 had a greater impact in northern Italian cities among subjects aged 75-84 and 85+ years. COVID-19 deaths accounted for half of total excess mortality in both areas, with differences by age: almost all excess deaths were from COVID-19 among adults, while among the elderly only one third of the excess was coded as COVID-19. When taking into account the mortality deficit in the pre-pandemic period, different trends were observed by area: all excess mortality during COVID-19 was explained by deficit mortality in the centre and south, while only a 16% overlap was estimated in northern cities, with quotas decreasing by age, from 67% in the 15-64 years old to 1% only among subjects 85+ years old. CONCLUSIONS An underestimation of COVID-19 deaths is particularly evident among the elderly. When quantifying the burden in mortality related to COVID-19, it is important to consider seasonal dynamics in mortality.

For years it was believed that they share receptor specificity, utilizing sialic acids for cell surface attachment, internalization, and entry. Interestingly, careful literature analysis shows that viruses indeed bind to the cell surface via sialic acids, but there is no solid data that these moieties mediate virus entry. In our study, using a number of techniques, we showed that all three viruses are indeed able to bind to sialic acids to a different extent, but these molecules render the cells permissive only for the clinical strain of HCoV-OC43, while for others they serve only as attachment receptors. CRCoV and BCoV appear to employ human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-1) as the entry receptor. Furthermore, we identified heparan sulfate as an alternative attachment factor, but this may be related to the cell culture adaptation, as in ex vivo conditions, it does not seem to play a significant role.

Inappropriate health-seeking behaviours contribute to adverse outcomes, and community engagement is key in driving behavioural change. WHO has highlighted East Africa as a geographical area of concern for snakebite envenoming. The overall aim of the project is to develop a community engagement toolkit for snakebite envenoming and other NTDs. The objective of this scoping review was to identify current practices in recent community engagement in rural East Africa; the applicability of these results to snakebite envenoming are discussed. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2017 to 3 September 2020. Search terms were used to identify publications which related to rural communities and health or disease, for both humans and animals. After reviewing the full papers for all geographical areas, 112 publications were included, 30 of which were conducted in East Africa. Papers included nine different countries and covered a broad range of health topics; notably, water, sanitation and hygiene, nutrition, and maternal and child health. Only one publication considered animal health. The most common form of engagement was in the context of a group meeting, lecture, presentation, discussion or question and answer session (63.3%). A variety of locations within the community were used to engage with people, the most common being an individual's household (23.3%). Communication factors was the key influencer for engagement, both positively and negatively. Key barriers to engagement include local languages and health beliefs, literacy levels, mobile phone ownership and the level of mobile Internet coverage, burden of agricultural work and weather conditions. This study provides an extensive overview of recent public health community engagement in East Africa, which will serve as a useful resource for any group seeking to plan an intervention in remote and rural areas in East Africa.

638000,Reducing SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission in the UK: A behavioural science approach to identifying options for increasing adherence to social distancing and shielding vulnerable people,2020-05-19,"The genome of Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) consists of RNA1 and RNA2. RNA1 encodes N-terminally overlapping replication proteins, p27 and p88, which are translated in a cap-independent manner. The 3′ untranslated region of RNA1 contains RNA elements essential for cap-independent translation and negative-strand RNA synthesis. In this study, we investigated how p27 and p88 were engaged in the replication of RCNMV genomic RNAs by using DNA vectors or in vitro transcribed RNAs in protoplasts and in a cell-free extract of evacuolated BY-2 protoplasts. Our results show a cis-preferential requirement of p88, but not of p27, for the replication of RNA1. This mechanism might help to facilitate a switch in the role of RNA1 from mRNA to a replication template.","Okamoto, Kimiyuki; Nagano, Hideaki; Iwakawa, Hirooki; Mizumoto, Hiroyuki; Takeda, Atsushi; Kaido, Masanori; Mise, Kazuyuki; Okuno, Tetsuro",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18308359/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208001049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208001049; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.02.004,553

We utilised whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify outbreaks and focus infection control resources and intervention during the UK's second pandemic wave in late 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of WGS and epidemiological data pinpointed an initial transmission event to an admission ward, with immediate prior community infection linkage documented. High incidence of asymptomatic staff infection with genetically identical viral sequences was also observed, which may have contributed to the propagation of the outbreak. WGS allowed timely nosocomial transmission intervention measures, including admissions ward point of care testing and introduction of portable HEPA14 filters. Conversely WGS excluded nosocomial transmission in two instances with temporospatial linkage, conserving time and resources. In summary, WGS significantly enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 clusters in a hospital setting, both identifying high risk areas and conversely validating existing control measures in other units, maintaining clinical service overall.","Francis, Rodric V; Billam, Harriet; Clarke, Mitch; Yates, Carl; Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Berry, Louise; Mahida, Nikunj; Irving, William L; Moore, Christopher; Holmes, Nadine; Ball, Jonathan; Loose, Matthew; McClure, C Patrick",J. infect. dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555152/,553

The diversity of viruses in these animals remains largely unknown, however, because studies are limited by species, location, virus target, or sample type. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect fragments of viral genomes in bat samples. We performed high-throughput sequencing analysis and specific PCR and RT-PCR on pools of anal and oropharyngeal swabs from Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium collected in southern Brazil. As a result, a member of the family Adenoviridae related to human adenovirus C was detected in anal swabs from S. lilium. In addition, we detected a papillomavirus in an anal swab from A. lituratus. Our analyses also allowed the detection of adenoviruses and parvoviruses in oropharyngeal swabs collected from A. lituratus. These results increase our knowledge about viral diversity and illustrate the importance of conducting virus surveillance in bats.","Finoketti, Fernando; dos Santos, Raíssa Nunes; Campos, Aline Alves Scarpellini; Zani, André Luís da Silva; Barboza, Camila Mosca; Fernandes, Marcélia Emanuele Sad; de Souza, Tatiane de Cassia Pardo; dos Santos, Driele Delanira; Bortolanza, Giovana Werneck; Filho, Henrique Ortêncio; Roehe, Paulo Michel; Franco, Ana Cláudia; de Carvalho Ruthner Batista, Helena Beatriz",Arch Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-04129-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30740637/,553
644535,Quantifying the impact of public health protection measures on the spread of SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-28,"Background: The imperative for physical distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may deteriorate physical and mental health. We aimed at summarizing the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of social isolation and loneliness with physical and mental health. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone, and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social isolation and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarized in a narrative synthesis. Results: Twenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. A total of more than 3 million individuals had participated in the 692 primary studies. The results suggest that social isolation is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The existing evidence clearly indicates that social isolation is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.","Morina, N.; Kip, A.; Hoppen, T.

644752,Significance of IgA antibody testing for early detection of SARS‐CoV‐2,2020-12-17,"Individuals affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may experience psychiatric symptoms, including depression and suicidal ideation, that could lead to chronic impairment and a reduction in quality of life. Specifically, depressive disorder shows high incidence and may lead to chronic impairment and a reduction in the quality of life. To date, no studies on the presence of suicidality and quantitative analysis of depressive symptoms and their risk factors have yet been published. In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms and related risk factors at 3 months after discharge to home care following hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. Methods: Participants were contacted three months after hospital discharge from one of the five COVID-19 hospitals in Rome, as part of a larger project on health outcomes in COVID-19 inpatients (Long Term Neuropsychiatric Disorder in COVID-19 Project), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was administered by telephone interview. Results: Of 115 participants, 14.8% (N = 17) received a PHQ-9-based diagnosis of depression, and n = 7 of them scored 1 or more on the item on suicidality. A linear regression model showed the predictive role of female sex, pulmonary chronic condition and previous mental disorder in the development of depressive disorder; the latter was confirmed also by binary logistic regression. Severity indexes of disease (length of hospitalization and intensive care treatment) were found not to be associated with the development of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: A small but clinically meaningful number of participants in the current study reported that they experienced symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation 3 months post-discharge from their COVID-19 hospitalization. In particular, given the findings that a history of prior psychiatric disorders was predictive of the development of depression symptoms, clinicians should carefully monitor for the presence of all psychiatric symptoms at follow-up visits.","Vassalini, Paolo; Serra, Riccardo; Tarsitani, Lorenzo; Koukopoulos, Alexia E.; Borrazzo, Cristian; Alessi, Federica; Di Nicolantonio, Chiara; Tosato, Cecilia; Alessandri, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; d’Ettorre, Gabriella",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573196/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091175,553
645195,SARS-CoV-2 Variant Under Investigation 202012/01 has more than twofold replicative advantage,2021,"In multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disease of young adults, there is a paucity of myelin repair in the central nervous system (CNS) which is necessary for the restoration of fast saltatory conduction in axons(1,2). Consequently, this relapsing disease often causes marked disability. In similar diseases of small rodents, however, remyelination can be quite extensive, as in the demyelinating disease caused by the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59)(3,4), a coronavirus of mice. To investigate when and where oligodendrocytes are first triggered to repair CNS myelin in such disease, we have used a complementary DNA probe specific for one major myelin protein gene, myelin basic protein (MBP), which hybridizes with the four forms of MBP messenger RNA in rodents(5). Using Northern blot and in situ hybridization techniques, we previously found that MBP mRNA is first detected at about 5 days after birth, peaks at 18 days and progressively decreases to 25% of the peak levels in the adult(5–7). We now report that in spinal cord sections of adult animals with active demyelination and inflammatory cells, in situ hybridization reveals a dramatic increase in probe binding to MBP-specific mRNA at (2–3) weeks after virus inoculation and before remyelination can be detected by morphological methods. This increase of MBP-specific mRNA is found at the edge of the demyelinating area and extends into surrounding areas of normal-appearing white matter. Thus, in situ hybridization with myelin-specific probes appears to be a useful method for detecting the timing, intensity and location of myelin protein gene reactivation preceding remyelination. This method could be used to elucidate whether such a reactivation occurs in multiple sclerosis brain tissue. Our results suggest that in mice, glial cells react to a demyelinating process with widespread MBP mRNA synthesis which may be triggered by a diffusible factor released in the demyelinated areas.","Kristensson, K.; Holmes, K.

645384,Screening for the alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) and the impact of this variant on circulating biomarkers in hospitalised patients,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND: The COVID(coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic is characterized by high infectivity, droplet transmission, and high viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Severe disease courses are associated with interstitial pneumonia and ventilated patients, in whom tracheotomy (TT)—a droplet- and aerosol-producing medical intervention—is regularly necessary. TT as a potential infection risk for medical staff is scarcely found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify droplet exposure of the surgical team during TT, to better define the requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical TT was performed in four non-infectious patients, during which the surgeon and his assistant both wore a surgical nasal mask with a transparent visor. After the procedure, the type, distribution, and number of droplets on the visor were determined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS: An average of 29 droplets were found on the middle third of the visor, 4 on the right third, and 13 on the left third, with an average droplet size of 571 µm (± 381 µm). The smallest droplets were 55 µm, the largest 1431 µm. An increase in the number of droplets was found with increased ventilation during the procedure. Blood droplets were more common than secretion droplets. CONCLUSION: Contamination of the visor with droplets was demonstrated. Especially in the case of TT in highly infectious patients, e.g., COVID-19 patients, the use of hooded headgear in combination with breathing apparatus with air purification and power supply is recommended to ensure best protection from infection for the surgeon and the surgical assistant.","Plettenberg, C.; Geipel, K.; Stenin, I.; Klenzner, T.; Wagenmann, M.; Schipper, J.; Scheckenbach, K.",HNO,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852060/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-021-01050-z,553
647018,Betacoronaviruses genome analysis reveals evolution toward specific codons usage: Implications for SARS‐CoV‐2 mitigation strategies,2021-05-24,"On March 17, 2020, the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended the suspension of all direct patient contact responsibilities for medical students because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this change, medical students nationwide had to grapple with how and where they could fill the evolving needs of their schools’ affiliated clinical sites, physicians, and patients and the community. APPROACH: At Harvard Medical School (HMS), student leaders created a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team to: (1) develop a student-led organizational structure that would optimize students’ ability to efficiently mobilize interested peers in the COVID-19 response, both clinically and in the community, in a strategic, safe, smart, and resource-conscious way; and (2) serve as a liaison with the administration and hospital leaders to identify evolving needs and rapidly engage students in those efforts. OUTCOMES: Within a week of its inception, the COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team had more than 500 medical student volunteers from HMS and had shared the organizational framework of the response team with multiple medical schools across the country. The HMS student volunteers joined any of the 4 virtual committees to complete this work: Education for the Medical Community, Education for the Broader Community, Activism for Clinical Support, and Community Activism. NEXT STEPS: The COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team helped to quickly mobilize hundreds of students and has been integrated into HMS’s daily workflow. It may serve as a useful model for other schools and hospitals seeking medical student assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps include expanding the initiative further, working with the leaders of response teams at other medical schools to coordinate efforts, and identifying new areas of need at local hospitals and within nearby communities that might benefit from medical student involvement as the pandemic evolves.","Soled, Derek; Goel, Shivangi; Barry, Danika; Erfani, Parsa; Joseph, Nicholos; Kochis, Michael; Uppal, Nishant; Velasquez, David; Vora, Kruti; Scott, Kirstin Woody",Acad Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282373/,553

Among all the solutions proposed to treat this new strain of coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, the vaccine seems a promising way but the delays are too long to be implemented quickly. In the emergency, a dual therapy has shown its effectiveness but has also provoked a set of debates around the dangerousness of a particular molecule, hydroxychloroquine. In particular, the doses to be delivered, according to the studies, were well beyond the acceptable doses to support the treatment without side effects. We propose here to use all the advantages of nanovectorization to address this question of concentration. Using quantum and classical simulations we will show in particular that drug transport on boron nitrogen oxide nanosheets increases the effectiveness of the action of these drugs. This will definitely allow to decrease the drug quantity needing to face the disease.","Duverger, Eric; Herlem, Guillaume; Picaud, Fabien",J Mol Graph Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33516966/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107834; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326321000036?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326321000036,553
650356,Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test (ALERT) for detecting SARS-CoV-2,2021-02-20,"As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues, unabated and clinical trials demonstrate limited effective pharmaceutical interventions, there is a pressing need to accelerate treatment evaluations. Among options for accelerated development is the evaluation of drug combinations in the absence of prior monotherapy data. This approach is appealing for a number of reasons. First, combining two or more drugs with related or complementary therapeutic effects permits a multipronged approach addressing the variable pathways of the disease. Second, if an individual component of a combination offers a therapeutic effect, then in the absence of antagonism, a trial of combination therapy should still detect individual efficacy. Third, this strategy is time saving. Rather than taking a stepwise approach to evaluating monotherapies, this strategy begins with testing all relevant therapeutic options. Finally, given the severity of the current pandemic and the absence of treatment options, the likelihood of detecting a treatment effect with combination therapy maintains scientific enthusiasm for evaluating repurposed treatments. Antiviral combination selection can be facilitated by insights regarding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and cell cycle dynamics, supported by infectious disease and clinical pharmacology expert advice. We describe a clinical evaluation strategy using adaptive combination platform trials to rapidly test combination therapies to treat COVID-19.","Rayner, Craig R.; Dron, Louis; Park, Jay J.

The aim of this research note is to introduce the concept of forgetfulness alongside memory within tourism scholarship to discuss the way in which it may be integrated with future research. In so doing, the discussion focused on a tourist crisis context as tourists’ post-crisis behaviour often reflects forgetfulness as evidenced by their travel resumption patterns. Overall, by linking the concepts of forgetfulness and tourism, this research note contributes to knowledge advancement on tourism crises by shifting attention away from risk perceptions towards an understanding of the cognitive and emotional processes influencing tourist behaviour. The research note also illuminates understanding of how crises are forgotten; hence, contributes to the improvement of crisis management strategies.

651084,"Modeling vaccination rollouts, SARS-CoV-2 variants and the requirement for non-pharmaceutical interventions in Italy",2021-04-16,"In time, dental health care has slowly expanded beyond emergency treatment to treat oral diseases. How to reduce the cross-transmission risk in dental surgery has raised much more attention. Considering the lack of consistency of fallow time (FT) in its necessity and duration, the highly sensitive laser light scattering method has been proposed to visualize the airborne lifetime and decay rate of suspended particles in the dental surgery environment. The FT is defined as when the number of suspended particles drops to the level that the next patient can safely enter after the aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). The ultrasonic scaling was performed in the mock-up experimental dental clinic with 6 air changes per hour (ACH), and the instantaneous moments of the droplets were recorded by a high-speed camera. Without any mitigation measures, the estimated FT in the single dental surgery environment with 6 ACH was in the range of 27–35 min, significantly affecting the number of daily dental services. Despite the cooperation of high-volume evacuation (HVE [IO]) cannot eliminate the FT to zero minutes, the equipment could reduce the required FT by 3–11 min for the suspended particles reducing the baseline levels. Owing to the longer airborne lifetime of suspended particles, the relevant protection equipment, especially respiratory protection, is quite essential in dental surgery. The obtained results of this study will provide evidence to establish the revised FT in dental surgery guidelines and protect the health and wellbeing of urban dwellers.","Li, Xiujie; Mak, Cheuk Ming; Ma, Kuen Wai; Wong, Hai Ming",Sustain Cities Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540565/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103134; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721004169; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670721004169,553

651550,Evolutionary and genomic analysis of four SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in March 2020 in Sri Lanka; Additional evidence on multiple introduction and further transmission,2021-03-16,"Treatment with Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells (MSCs) in clinical trials is becoming one of the most-popular and fast-developing branches of modern regenerative medicine, as it is still in an experimental phase. The cross-section of diseases to which these cells are applied is very wide, ranging from degenerative diseases, through autoimmune processes and to acute inflammatory diseases, e.g., viral infections. Indeed, now that first clinical trials applying MSCs against COVID-19 have started, important questions concern not only the therapeutic properties of MSCs, but also the changes that might occur in the cell features as a response to the “cytokine storm” present in the acute phase of an infection and capable of posing a risk to a patient. The aim of our study was thus to assess changes potentially occurring in the biology of MSCs in the active inflammatory environment, e.g., in regards to the cell cycle, cell migration and secretory capacity. The study using MSCs derived from Wharton’s jelly (WJ-MSCs) was conducted under two aerobic conditions: 21% O(2) vs. 5% O(2), since oxygen concentration is one of the key factors in inflammation. Under both oxygen conditions cells were exposed to proinflammatory cytokines involved significantly in acute inflammation, i.e., IFNγ, TNFα and IL-1β at different concentrations. Regardless of the aerobic conditions, WJ-MSCs in the inflammatory environment do not lose features typical for mesenchymal cells, and their proliferation dynamic remains unchanged. Sudden fluctuations in proliferation, the early indicator of potential genetic disturbance, were not observed, while the cells’ migration activity increased. The presence of pro-inflammatory factors was also found to increase the secretion of such anti-inflammatory cytokines as IL-4 and IL-10. It is concluded that the inflammatory milieu in vitro does not cause phenotype changes or give rise to proliferation disruption of WJ-MSCs, and nor does it inhibit the secretory properties providing for their use against acute inflammation.","Wedzinska, Aleksandra; Figiel-Dabrowska, Anna; Kozlowska, Hanna; Sarnowska, Anna",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919308/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10091813,553

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has created a major physical and psychological burden on nursing staff in the United States and worldwide. A better understanding of these conditions will lead to tailored support and resources for nursing staff during and after the pandemic. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional study. METHODS: Hospital nurses and nursing assistants (N = 587) were recruited online between May–June 2020. The survey included measures on insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) fatigue and intershift recovery (Occupational Fatigue and Exhaustion Recovery‐15), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory‐Human Services Survey), post‐traumatic stress (Short Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder Rating Interview) and psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire‐4), and questions on work and demographics. The STROBE checklist was followed for reporting. RESULTS: The sample had subthreshold insomnia, moderate‐to‐high chronic fatigue, high acute fatigue and low‐to‐moderate intershift recovery. The sample experienced increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, increased personal accomplishment, moderate psychological distress and high post‐traumatic stress. Nurses who cared for COVID‐19 patients had significantly scored worse on almost all measures than their co‐workers. Certain factors such as working hours per week and the frequency of 30‐min breaks were significant. CONCLUSION: Nursing staff experienced poor sleep, fatigue and multiple psychological problems during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Moreover, staff who were involved in the care of COVID‐19 patients, worked more than 40 h per week and skipped 30‐min breaks showed generally worse self‐reported outcomes.

DESIGN: Web-based cross-sectional survey. SETTING: This study was conducted in March 2020, nearly 10 years into the Syrian war crisis. The Arabic-language survey was posted on various social media platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram and Facebook targeting various social groups. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4495 participants completed the survey. Participants with a history of COVID-19 infection, residing outside Syria or who did not fully complete the survey were excluded from the study.

This paper explores the time–space geographies of COVID-19 infection focusing on Africa and Nigeria especially. We appraise the global-to-local situation of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries as well as measures engaged in response to the pandemic. Findings reveal that South Africa accounts for 40% of the total confirmed cases in Africa, followed by Egypt (18%), Nigeria (6.8%), Ghana (4.6%) and Algeria (3.6). Our study shows a significant relationship between population density and COVID-19 cases in Nigeria (R(2) = 0.76; y = 2.43x − 268.7).

While Nigeria has only recorded about 25,964 cases as at the time of writing, the country is struggling to match pressures from rising cases as a result of existing disparities in health care systems.","Olusola, Adeyemi; Olusola, Babatunde; Onafeso, Olumide; Ajiola, Felix; Adelabu, Samuel",GeoJournal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-020-10278-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836703/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10708-020-10278-1.pdf,553
655631,Rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 detected in sewage samples from England between October 2020 and January 2021,2021-03-07,"While studies of urban acoustics are typically restricted to the audio range, anthropogenic activity also generates infrasound (<20 Hz, roughly at the lower end of the range of human hearing). Shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic unintentionally created ideal conditions for the study of urban infrasound and low frequency audio (20–500 Hz), as closures reduced human-generated ambient noise, while natural signals remained relatively unaffected. An array of infrasound sensors deployed in Las Vegas, NV, provides data for a case study in monitoring human activity during the pandemic through urban acoustics. The array records a sharp decline in acoustic power following the temporary shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential by the state of Nevada. This decline varies spatially across the array, with stations close to McCarran International Airport generally recording the greatest declines in acoustic power. Further, declines in acoustic power fluctuate with the time of day. As only signals associated with anthropogenic activity are expected to decline, this gives a rough indication of periodicities in urban acoustics throughout Las Vegas. The results of this study reflect the city's response to the pandemic and suggest spatiotemporal trends in acoustics outside of shutdowns.","Bird, Elijah J.; Bowman, Daniel C.; Seastrand, Douglas R.; Wright, Melissa A.; Lees, Jonathan M.; Dannemann Dugick, Fransiska K.",J Acoust Soc Am,https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0003777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765803/,553

We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined 629,953 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and December 31, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 570,298 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 27.8% were non-White minorities. 54,645 individuals tested positive, with minorities representing 50.1%. Hispanics represented 34.3% of infections but only 13.4% of tests. While generally younger than White patients, Hispanics had higher rates of diabetes but fewer other comorbidities. 8,536 patients were hospitalized and 1,246 died, of whom 56.1% and 54.4% were non-White, respectively. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increased odds of testing positive and hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities. Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity, and Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.14-1.70]). CONCLUSION: Major healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a higher rate, required excess hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, and had higher odds of in-hospital mortality despite younger age. Targeted, culturally-responsive interventions and equitable vaccine development and distribution are needed to address the increased risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes among minority populations.","Dai, Chengzhen L; Kornilov, Sergey A; Roper, Ryan T; Cohen-Cline, Hannah; Jade, Kathleen; Smith, Brett; Heath, James R; Diaz, George; Goldman, Jason D; Magis, Andrew T; Hadlock, Jennifer J",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608710/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab154,553

Since there is a lack of specific receptors for bacteriophages on eukaryotic cells, these viruses were for a long time considered to be neutral to animals and humans. However, studies of recent years provided clear evidence that bacteriophages can interact with eukaryotic cells, significantly influencing the functions of tissues, organs, and systems of mammals, including humans. In this review article, we summarize and discuss recent discoveries in the field of interactions of phages with animal and human organisms. Possibilities of penetration of bacteriophages into eukaryotic cells, tissues, and organs are discussed, and evidence of the effects of phages on functions of the immune system, respiratory system, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, urinary tract, and reproductive system are presented and discussed. Modulations of cancer cells by bacteriophages are indicated. Direct and indirect effects of virulent and temperate phages are discussed. We conclude that interactions of bacteriophages with animal and human organisms are robust, and they must be taken under consideration when using these viruses in medicine, especially in phage therapy, and in biotechnological applications.","Podlacha, Magdalena; Grabowski, Łukasz; Kosznik-Kawśnicka, Katarzyna; Zdrojewska, Karolina; Stasiłojć, Małgorzata; Węgrzyn, Grzegorz; Węgrzyn, Alicja",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445641/,553

RECENT FINDINGS: MIS-C emerged in spring 2020 as a hyperinflammatory syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 exposure in children. Despite growing awareness of MIS-C, diagnosis remains challenging due to the range of phenotypes and severity. Fever accompanied by shock, cardiac dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, or mucocutaneous signs suggestive of Kawasaki disease, especially in the presence of known or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 exposure, should trigger consideration of MIS-C. However, clinical presentations are highly varied and may overlap with other infectious diseases. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for MIS-C and be aware that patients may develop coronary artery aneurysms and myocarditis even with few or no Kawasaki disease symptoms. More precise diagnostic criteria and specific biomarkers are needed to aid diagnosis. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is first-line therapy, and steroids should be considered as initial adjunctive treatment for patients with severe manifestations or other risk factors. Prompt treatment is essential, as patients may worsen acutely, though overall prognosis is reassuring. SUMMARY: MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 has varied clinical manifestations. Clinicians must be aware of the common presentation and potential for decompensation and cardiac sequalae to guide appropriate evaluation and treatment.","Roberts, Jordan E; Henderson, Lauren A",Curr Opin Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34261116/; https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000818,553

Although a deeper understanding of this relationship is vital, it is also important to inform the general public about the risks and, ideally, offer strategies to mitigate the risks. As “resolution” of obesity in the short-term is not feasible, it is indeed possible that smaller weight losses and increase in physical activity can actually reduce the risks. In this context, we propose that a term called “controlled obesity” be more often used and studied, in which those who have lost over 10% of their maximal weight and, ideally, are physically active are considered healthier. This context can have much broader usefulness, beyond the pandemics, as evidence points that weight loss over 10% can significant reduce overall health risks, irrespective of final BMI.","Halpern, B.; Mancini, M.

In contrast, the techniques of the other strategy are aimed at the destruction of tumors as a whole using the features shared by all cancers, for example relatively fast mitotic cell division or active angiogenesis. While the first strategy is “true” gene therapy, the second one is more like genetic surgery when a surgeon just cuts off a tumor with his scalpel and has no interest in knowing delicate mechanisms of cancer emergence and progression. I will try to substantiate the idea that the last strategy is the only right one, and its simplicity is paradoxically adequate to the super-complexity of tumors that originates from general complexity of cell regulation, strongly disturbed in tumor cells, and especially from the complexity of tumors as evolving cell populations, affecting also their ecological niche formed by neighboring normal cells and tissues. An analysis of the most widely used for such a “surgery” suicide gene/prodrug combinations will be presented in some more details.","Sverdlov, E.

We found that direct induction of IL-6 and TNF-α release in the supernatant in a dose-, time-dependent manner and highly spike protein-specific, but no induction of IL-8 was detected. Further experiments showed that IL-6 and TNF-α production were dependent on NF-κB, which was activated through I-κBα degradation. These results suggest that SARS-CoV spike protein may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS, especially in inflammation and high fever.","Wang, Wei; Ye, Linbai; Ye, Li; Li, Baozong; Gao, Bo; Zeng, Yingchun; Kong, Lingbao; Fang, Xiaonan; Zheng, Hong; Wu, Zhenghui; She, Yinglong",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207000470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532082/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207000470,553

The k‐nearest neighbor (KNN) model can predict the human‐infecting viruses with an accuracy of over 90%. The performance of this KNN model built on the short contigs (≥1 kb) is comparable to those built on the viral genomes. We used a reported human blood virome to further validate this KNN model with an accuracy of over 80% based on very short raw reads (150 bp).

Ten miRNAs were further examined by quantitative PCR assays, and seven of these were confirmed. In addition, correlation analysis was performed between paired organ miRNA expressions and diverse body fluid miRNA expressions.

It is not known which methods of communication to use, nor how effectively they facilitate the transition of care when a patient is discharged home from hospital. Our systematic review aims to investigate the methods and effectiveness of communication between hospital allied health and primary care practitioners. METHODS: Systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies with narrative synthesis. Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo and Proquest Nursing and Allied Health Sources were searched from January 2003 until January 2020 for studies that examined hospital-based allied health professionals communicating with community-based primary care practitioners. Risk of bias in the different study designs was appraised using recognized tools and a content analysis conducted of the methodologies used. RESULTS: From the located 12,281 papers (duplicates removed), 24 studies met the inclusion criteria with hospital allied health communicating in some form with primary care practitioners. While none of the included studies specifically investigated the methods or effectiveness of communication between hospital allied health and primary care practitioners, 12 of the 24 studies described processes that addressed components of their discharge communication. Four enablers to effective communication between hospital allied health and primary care practitioners were identified: multidisciplinary care plans, patient and caregiver involvement, health information technology and a designated person for follow up/care management. CONCLUSION: There is currently no “gold standard” method or measure of communication between hospital allied health and primary care practitioners.

The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio). The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65.4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15.6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39.5 years, SD = 14.8) (p ≦ 0.001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0.06).

Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.

Patients in the Neonatal Surgery Department have rapidly progressing diseases and immature immunity, which makes them vulnerable to pulmonary infection and a relatively higher mortality. This means that these patients require multidisciplinary treatment including early diagnosis, timely transport, emergency surgery and intensive critical care. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to carrying out these treatments. To provide support for the health protection requirements of the medical services in the Neonatal Surgery Department, we developed recommendations focusing on patient transport, surgery selection and protection requirements with the aim of improving treatment strategies for patients and preventing infection in medical staff during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Ma, Li-Shuang; Zhao, Yun-Long; Wei, Yan-Dong; Liu, Chao",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32775372/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i14.2893,553

The polypropylene (PP) filter is a representative disposable mask material that traps virus-containing bioaerosols, preventing secondary transmission. In this study, a copper thin film (20 nm) was deposited via vacuum coating on a spunbond PP filter surrounding a KF94 face mask to provide additional protection and lower the risk of secondary transmission. Film adhesion was improved using oxygen ion beam pretreatment, resulting in cuprous oxide formation on the PP fiber without structural deformation. The copper-coated mask exhibited filtration efficiencies of 95.1 ± 1.32% and 91.6 ± 0.83% for NaCl and paraffin oil particles, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 inactivation was evaluated by transferring virus-containing media onto the copper-coated PP filters and subsequently adding Vero cells. Infection was verified using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunochemical staining. Vero cells added after contact with the copper-coated mask did not express the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope genes of SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid immunofluorescence results indicated a reduction in the amount of virus of more than 75%. Therefore, copper-coated antiviral PP filters could be key materials in personal protective equipment, as well as in air-conditioning systems.","Jung, Sunghoon; Yang, Jun-Yeoung; Byeon, Eun-Yeon; Kim, Do-Geun; Lee, Da-Gyum; Ryoo, Sungweon; Lee, Sanggu; Shin, Cheol-Woong; Jang, Ho Won; Kim, Hyo Jung; Lee, Seunghun",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922136/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13091367,553

Search engines such as PubMed provide a means to search and retrieve published literature, given a query. However, they are limited in how users can control the processing of queries and articles—or as we call them documents—by the search engine. To give this control to both biomedical researchers and computer scientists working in biomedical information retrieval, we introduce a public online tool for searching over biomedical literature. Our setup is guided by the NIST setup of the relevant TREC evaluation tasks in genomics, clinical decision support, and precision medicine. RESULTS: To provide benchmark results for some of the most common biomedical information retrieval strategies, such as querying MeSH subject headings with a specific weight or querying over the title of the articles only, we present our evaluations on public datasets. Our experiments report well-known information retrieval metrics such as precision at a cutoff of ranked documents. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce the A2A search and benchmarking tool which is publicly available for the researchers who want to explore different search strategies over published biomedical literature. We outline several query formulation strategies and present their evaluations with known human judgements for a large pool of topics, from genomics to precision medicine.","Rybinski, Maciej; Karimi, Sarvnaz; Nguyen, Vincent; Paris, Cecile",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349237/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03894-8,553
680922,"Case series of four re-infections with a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, Luxembourg, February 2021",2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary tumor boards play a pivotal role in the patient-centered clinical management and in the decision-making process to provide best evidence-based, diagnostic, and therapeutic care to patients with cancer. Among the barriers to achieve an efficient multidisciplinary tumor board, lack of time and geographical distance play a major role. Therefore, the elaboration of an efficient virtual multidisciplinary tumor board (VMTB) is a key point to successfully obtain an oncology team and implement a network among health professionals and institutions. This need is stronger than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a research protocol for an observational study focused on exploring the structuring process and the implementation of a multi-institutional VMTB in Sicily, Italy. Other endpoints include analysis of cooperation between participants, adherence to guidelines, patients’ outcomes, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: This protocol encompasses a pragmatic, observational, multicenter, noninterventional, prospective trial. The study’s programmed duration is 5 years, with a half-yearly analysis of the primary and secondary objectives’ measurements. Oncology care health professionals from various oncology subspecialties at oncology departments in multiple hospitals (academic and general hospitals as well as tertiary centers and community hospitals) are involved in a nonhierarchic manner. VMTB employs an innovative, virtual, cloud-based platform to share anonymized medical data that are discussed via a videoconferencing system both satisfying security criteria and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. RESULTS: The protocol is part of a larger research project on communication and multidisciplinary collaboration in oncology units and departments spread in the Sicily region. The results of this study will particularly focus on the organization of VMTBs, involving oncology units present in different hospitals spread in the area, and creating a network to allow best patient care pathways and a hub-and-spoke relationship. The present results will also include data concerning organization skills and pitfalls, barriers, efficiency, number, and types with respect to clinical cases and customer satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: VMTB represents a unique opportunity to optimize patient management through a patient-centered approach. An efficient virtualization and data-banking system is potentially time-saving, a source for outcome data, and a detector of possible holes in the hull of clinical pathways. The observations and results from this VMTB study may hopefully be useful to design nonclinical and organizational interventions that enhance multidisciplinary decision-making in oncology.

682203,The importance of time post-vaccination in determining the decrease in vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,2021-06-09,"Three types of respiratory masks viz N95, non-woven fabric and double layer cotton cloth are being used as an essential inhalation protective measure against COVID-19 by suppressing the entry of respiratory droplets. The filtering efficiency of these masks were tested before and after sterilisation using gamma radiation for the two flow rate conditions corresponding normal breath rate (20lpm) and during sneezing/coughing (90lpm).Sterilisation is carried out using a gamma irradiator containing Co-60 source for the two dose exposures viz. 15kGy and 25kGy. The filtering efficiency for surgical (non-woven fabric) and double layer cotton cloth mask is found to vary from 18% to 22% for the cumulative particle of size [≥] 0.3 micron in both un-irradiated and irradiated condition. The filtration efficiency of N95 mask is found to be reduced to 70% for the most penetrating particle size (0.3 micron) with the flow rate of 20lpm and further reduced for particles in the range of 0.1 and 0.2 micron with flow rate of 90 lpm. The reduction in efficiency after gamma sterilization is associated with reduction of electrostatic interaction of filter medium with particles laden in the air stream. Even with reduced filtering efficiency due to gamma sterilisation, the N95 masks are much superior than the surgical and cloth masks. Instead of disposing N95 mask after single use, they can be reused a few times as N70 mask during this pandemic crisis after sterilisation using gamma radiation.","Kumar, A.; Saneetha, D.

684529,"Evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test for detection of antibody in human, canine, cat and hamster sera",2020-07-29,"SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV M(pro)) is essential for the replication of the virus and regarded as a major antiviral drug target. The enzyme is a cysteine protease, with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145/His-41) in the active site. Aldehyde inhibitors can bind reversibly to the active-site sulfhydryl of SARS-CoV M(pro). Previous studies using peptidic substrates and inhibitors showed that the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV M(pro) requires glutamine in the P1 position and a large hydrophobic residue in the P2 position. We determined four crystal structures of SARS-CoV M(pro) in complex with pentapeptide aldehydes (Ac-ESTLQ-H, Ac-NSFSQ-H, Ac-DSFDQ-H, and Ac-NSTSQ-H). Kinetic data showed that all of these aldehydes exhibit inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV M(pro), with K(i) values in the μM range. Surprisingly, the X-ray structures revealed that the hydrophobic S2 pocket of the enzyme can accommodate serine and even aspartic-acid side-chains in the P2 positions of the inhibitors. Consequently, we reassessed the substrate specificity of the enzyme by testing the cleavage of 20 different tetradecapeptide substrates with varying amino-acid residues in the P2 position. The cleavage efficiency for the substrate with serine in the P2 position was 160-times lower than that for the original substrate (P2 = Leu); furthermore, the substrate with aspartic acid in the P2 position was not cleaved at all. We also determined a crystal structure of SARS-CoV M(pro) in complex with aldehyde Cm-FF-H, which has its P1-phenylalanine residue bound to the relatively hydrophilic S1 pocket of the enzyme and yet exhibits a high inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M(pro), with K(i) = 2.24 ± 0.58 μM. These results show that the stringent substrate specificity of the SARS-CoV M(pro) with respect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overruled by the highly electrophilic character of the aldehyde warhead, thereby constituting a deviation from the dogma that peptidic inhibitors need to correspond to the observed cleavage specificity of the target protease.","Zhu, Lili; George, Shyla; Schmidt, Marco F.; Al-Gharabli, Samer I.; Rademann, Jörg; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211003901; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211003901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854807/,553

Here, we assessed the differentiated effects of the application of an RNA vaccine using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes on the results of both anti-spike protein–based serology (EUROIMMUN) and anti-nucleocapsid-based serology (VIROTECH). A total of 80 serum samples from vaccinees acquired at different time points after vaccination was assessed. While positive or borderline serological response in the anti-spike protein assay was observed for all samples (90% both IgG and IgA, 6.3% IgA only, 3.8% borderline IgG only), only a single case of a falsely positive IgM was observed for the anti-nucleocapsid assay as expected due to this assay’s specificity. Positive anti-spike protein antibodies were already detectable in the second week after the first dose of vaccination, with higher titers after the second dose of the vaccine. In conclusion, the combined application of anti-spike protein–based serology and anti-nucleocapsid-based serology will provide a useful option for the discrimination of vaccination response and natural infection.","Dörschug, Anja; Frickmann, Hagen; Schwanbeck, Julian; Yilmaz, Elif; Mese, Kemal; Hahn, Andreas; Groß, Uwe; Zautner, Andreas E.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11030426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802453/,553

This paper reports on co-production undertaken by nursing students, early career nurses and researchers as part of a larger study to design an intervention to increase retention of early career nurses. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the co-production process in a UK university. Data were collected prospectively, concurrently and retrospectively via interview and questionnaire, between April 2018 and January 2019. Twelve co-production group members completed the questionnaire and six group members and facilitators were interviewed. Students and early career nurses reported personal benefit from participating; they developed and practised transferrable communication and problem-solving skills, believed they were able to make a difference, enjoyed contributing, found benefit from using the group as a reflective space and considered that co-production produced a credible intervention. Findings indicated co-production equipped participants to function more effectively in their nursing roles; incorporating co-production into the development of future interventions may prove beneficial. The relative novelty of this approach, and the potential application of the findings to a diverse range of geographical and organisational settings, add to the utility of the findings.","Brook, Judy; Leanne Aitken; MacLaren, Dr Julie; Debra Salmon",Nurse Educ Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858300/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2020.102861; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471595319307139; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471595319307139?v=s5,553

So far, Ghana has recorded 48,643 confirmed cases with 320 associated deaths. Although summaries of data are usually provided by the Ministry of Health, detailed epidemiological profile of cases are limited. This study sought to describe the socio-demographic features, pattern of COVID-19 spread and the viral load dynamics among subjects residing in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study that reviewed records of samples collected from February to July, 2020. Respiratory specimens such as sputum, deep-cough saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected COVID-19 subjects in 12 regions of Ghana for laboratory analysis and confirmation by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 72,434 samples were collected during the review period, with majority of the sampled individuals being females (37,464; 51.9%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 identified in the study population was 13.2% [95%CI: 12.9, 13.4). Males were mostly infected (4,897; 51.5%) compared to females. Individuals between the ages 21–30 years recorded the highest number of infections (3,144, 33.4%). Symptomatic subjects had higher viral loads (1479.7 copies/μl; IQR = 40.6–178919) than asymptomatic subjects (49.9; IQR = 5.5–3641.6). There was significant association between gender or age and infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05).

We observed an average reproductive number of 1.36 with a minimum of 1.28 and maximum of 1.43. The virus trajectory shows a gradual reduction of the virus reproductive number. CONCLUSION: This study has described the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 cases in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana, with males and younger individuals at greater risk of contracting the disease. Health professionals should be conscious of individuals presenting with anosmia since this was seen as the strongest predictor of virus infection.","Owusu, Michael; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; Ankrah, Sampson Twumasi; El-Duah, Philip; Ayisi-Boateng, Nana Kwame; Yeboah, Richmond; Gorman, Richmond; Asamoah, Jesse; Binger, Tabea; Acheampong, Godfred; Bekoe, Franklin Asiedu; Ohene, Sally-Ann; Larsen-Reindorf, Rita; Awuah, Anthony Afum-Adjei; Amuasi, John; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Phillips, Richard Odame",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301533/,553
