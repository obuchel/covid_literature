1504,1504,1504,Prediction of mortality in adult patients with severe acute lung failure receiving veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a prospective observational study,18.26317,12.218366,2014-04-09,"INTRODUCTION: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) can be a life-saving therapy in patients with severe acute lung failure refractory to conventional therapy. Nevertheless, vvECMO is a procedure associated with high costs and resource utilization. The aim of this study was to assess published models for prediction of mortality following vvECMO and optimize an alternative model. METHODS: Established mortality risk scores were validated to assess their usefulness in 304 adult patients undergoing vvECMO for refractory lung failure at the University Medical Center Regensburg from 2008 to 2013. A parsimonious prediction model was developed based on variables available before ECMO initiation using logistic regression modelling. We then assessed whether addition of variables available one day after ECMO implementation enhanced mortality prediction. Models were internally validated and calibrated by bootstrapping (400 runs). Predictive ability, goodness-of-fit and model discrimination were compared across the different models. RESULTS: In the present study population, existing mortality prediction tools for vvECMO patients showed suboptimal performance. Evaluated before vvECMO initiation, a logistic prediction model comprising age, immunocompromised state, artificial minute ventilation, pre-ECMO serum lactate and hemoglobin concentrations showed best mortality prediction in our patients (area under curve, AUC: 0.75). Additional information about norepinephrine dosage, fraction of inspired oxygen, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen concentrations the first day following ECMO initiation further improved discrimination (AUC: 0.79, P = 0.03) and predictive ability (likelihood ratio test, P < 0.001). When classifying patients as lower (<40%) or higher (>80%) risk based on their predicted mortality, the pre-ECMO and day1-on-ECMO models had negative/positive predictive values of 76%/82% and 82%/81%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While pre-ECMO mortality prediction remains a challenge due to large patient heterogeneity, evaluation one day after ECMO initiation may improve the ability to separate lower- and higher-risk patients. Our findings support the clinical perception that chronic health condition, high comorbidity and reduced functional reserves are strongly related to survival during and following ECMO support. Renewed evaluation the first day after ECMO initiation may provide enhanced guidance for further handling of ECMO patients. Despite the usefulness of prediction models, thorough clinical evaluation should always represent the cornerstone in decision for ECMO.","Enger, Tone Bull; Philipp, Alois; Videm, Vibeke; Lubnow, Matthias; Wahba, Alexander; Fischer, Marcus; Schmid, Christof; Bein, Thomas; Müller, Thomas",Crit Care,302,12

However, its clinical utility in endocrine emergencies remains unclear. Herein, we describe a case series of 12 patients presenting with refractory shock secondary to endocrine emergencies who were rescued by ECMO support. Patients were identified between 2005 and 2012 from our ECMO registry. The diagnostic distribution was as follows: pheochromocytoma crisis (n = 4), thyroid storm (n = 5), and diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 3). The initial presentation of pheochromocytoma crisis was indistinguishable from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and frequently accompanied by paroxysmal hypertension and limb ischemia. Thyroid storm was characterized by hyperbilirubinemia and severe gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas neurological symptoms were common in diabetic ketoacidosis. The clinical outcomes of patients with endocrine emergencies were compared with those of 80 cases with AMI who received ECMO because of cardiogenic shock. The cardiac function and the general conditions showed a significantly faster recovery in patients with endocrine emergencies than in those with AMI. We conclude that ECMO support can be clinically useful in endocrine emergencies. The screening of endocrine diseases should be considered during the resuscitation of patients with refractory circulatory shock.","Chao, Anne; Wang, Chih-Hsien; You, Hao-Chun; Chou, Nai-Kwoun; Yu, Hsi-Yu; Chi, Nai-Hsin; Huang, Shu-Chien; Wu, I-Hui; Tseng, Li-Jung; Lin, Ming-Hsien; Chen, Yih-Sharng",Sci Rep,302,1

As of July 7th, 2020, almost seven months into the outbreak, there are no approved vaccines and few treatments available. Developing drugs that target multiple points in the viral life cycle could serve as a strategy to tackle the current as well as future coronavirus pandemics. Here we leverage the power of our recently developed in silico screening platform, VirtualFlow, to identify inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2. VirtualFlow is able to efficiently harness the power of computing clusters and cloud-based computing platforms to carry out ultra-large scale virtual screens. In this unprecedented structure-based multi-target virtual screening campaign, we have used VirtualFlow to screen an average of approximately 1 billion molecules against each of 40 different target sites on 17 different potential viral and host targets in the cloud. In addition to targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, we also target critical auxiliary sites such as functionally important protein-protein interaction interfaces. This multi-target approach not only increases the likelihood of finding a potent inhibitor, but could also help identify a collection of anti-coronavirus drugs that would retain efficacy in the face of viral mutation. Drugs belonging to different regimen classes could be combined to develop possible combination therapies, and top hits that bind at highly conserved sites would be potential candidates for further development as coronavirus drugs. Here, we present the top 200 in silico hits for each target site. While in-house experimental validation of some of these compounds is currently underway, we want to make this array of potential inhibitor candidates available to researchers worldwide in consideration of the pressing need for fast-tracked drug development.","Gorgulla, Christoph; PadmanabhaDas, Krishna; Leigh, Kendra E.; Cespugli, Marco; Fischer, Patrick D.; Wang, Zi-Fu; Tesseyre, Guilhem; Pandita, Shreya; Shnapir, Alec; Calderaio, Anthony; Hutcheson, Colin; Gechev, Minko; Rose, Alexander; Lewis, Noam; Yaffe, Erez; Luxenburg, Roni; Herce, Henry D.; Durmaz, Vedat; Halazonetis, Thanos D.; Fackeldey, Konstantin; Patten, Justin J.; Chuprina, Alexander; Dziuba, Igor; Plekhova, Alla; Moroz, Yurii; Radchenko, Dmytro; Tarkhanova, Olga; Yavnyuk, Irina; Gruber, Christian C.; Yust, Ryan; Payne, Dave; Näär, Anders M.; Namchuk, Mark N.; Davey, Robert A.; Wagner, Gerhard; Kinney, Jamie; Arthanari, Haribabu",ChemRxiv,302,26

DNA sequencing and homology analysis were performed on specifically bound phages. The binding ability of the selected peptides to SKOV3 cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. After four rounds of optimized biological panning, phage recovery was 34-fold higher than that of the first round, and the specific phage clones bound to SKOV3 cells were significantly enriched. A total of 32 positive phage clones were preliminarily identified by ELISA from 54 randomly selected clones, and the positive rate was 59.3%. S36 was identified as the clone with best affinity to SKOV3 cells via fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. A representative clone of OSP2, S36 is expected to be an effective probe for diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer.","Zhao, Shuhui; Li, Chunyan; Gao, Yunge; Qian, Luomeng; Dong, Jian; Zhai, Lianghao; Chen, Biliang; Zhang, Jianfang",Int J Pept Res Ther,302,17

Vicarious post-traumatic growth has also been identified in the literature. This article aimed to contribute to understanding the experiences of these constructs of trainee helping professionals. Emphasis was placed on how to foster vicarious post-traumatic growth. METHODS: A qualitative semi-structured interview was designed to enable the researchers to explore the experiences of 14 trainee psychologists from an Australian Master of Clinical Psychology program. RESULTS: It was identified that burnout, and beginning stages of vicarious trauma, moral injury, compassion fatigue, and secondary traumatic stress might occur during psychologists’ training. Five elements underpin vicarious post-traumatic growth, four of which were reflected in this article. A need and suggestions for how to further develop vicarious post-traumatic growth are discussed. CONCLUSION: This research could go on to be applied to curriculum development and practice policy, ultimately leading to improved early-intervention and ongoing systems of support for helping professionals.

Uncontrolled hypertension confers the highest attributable risk of CVD and remains a significant public health issue with sub-optimal blood pressure (BP) control rates. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention (MCI) versus usual care on lowering BP among adults with uncontrolled hypertension visiting primary care clinics in Singapore. This article describes the statistical analysis plan for the primary and secondary objectives related to intervention effectiveness. METHODS: The study is a cluster randomized trial enrolling 1000 participants with uncontrolled hypertension aged ≥ 40 years from eight primary care clinics in Singapore. The unit of randomization is the clinic, with eight clusters (clinics) randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either MCI or usual care. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months with measurements of systolic and diastolic BP, antihypertensive and statin medication use, medication adherence, physical activity level, anthropometric parameters, smoking status, and dietary habits. The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of MCI versus usual care on mean SBP at the 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome is SBP at 24 months. SBP at baseline, 12, and 24 months will be modeled at the subject level using a likelihood-based, linear mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with treatment group and follow-up as fixed effects, random cluster (clinic) effects, Gaussian error distribution, and adjustment to degrees of freedom using the Satterthwaite approximation. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using a similar modeling approach incorporating generalized techniques appropriate for the type of outcome. DISCUSSION: The trial will allow us to determine whether the MCI has an impact on BP and cardiovascular risk factors over a 2-year follow-up period and inform recommendations for health planners in scaling up these strategies for the benefit of society at large. A pre-specified and pre-published statistical analysis plan mitigates reporting bias and data driven approaches. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02972619.

Four hundred (200 controls and 200 cases of essential hypertension) participants from general Indian population were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood samples were collected for genotyping Fok I-VDR gene polymorphism using PCR–RFLP method whereas 25-OH vitamin D levels in serum were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Significantly reduced 25-OH vitamin D levels were observed in patients with EH (24.04 ± 8.62 vs 50.46 ± 15.46) compared to control subjects (p = 0.0001). Homozygous recessive genotype ‘ff’ frequency was increased by 8.06 fold (CI: 3.71–17.47, p = 0.0001) in patients with EH compared to dominant ‘FF’ genotype frequency. In conclusion, recessive ‘ff’ genotype frequency correlates with reduced serum vitamin D levels and results in significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures leading to predisposition of EH.","Prasad, M.; Rajarajeswari, D.; Aruna, P.; Ramalingam, K.; Viswakumar, R.; Fathima, Nusrath; Vishwakarma, Sandeep Kumar; Khan, Aleem Ahmed",Indian J Clin Biochem,302,22

The article substantiates the growth in the importance of maritime economic activity for the Russian Federation and emphasizes the peculiarities of realizing its interests in the World Ocean, taking into account foreign policy, marketing and economic, technical and technological, financial and investment, infrastructural, and institutional opportunities and limitations. Attention is focused on the factors and features of the dynamics and spatial localization of such important industries for Russia as seaports and logistics, hydrocarbon production on sea shelves, production and processing of marine biological resources, shipbuilding, and coastal industry. It is shown that, on the one hand, Russia’s sphere of potential (declared) interests is the waters of the entire World Ocean and, on the other, the country’s maritime activity has a predominantly Circumeurasian (delimiting the mainland confined to its marginal seas) character, consistently shifting (under the influence of climatic, market, and geopolitical factors) into the Arctic, as well as the coastal zones and water areas of the Far East.

Critically ill patients comprise a sizable proportion of wait-list mortality and are known to experience increased posttransplant complications. These critically ill patients have been successfully bridged to lung transplantation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but historically these patients have required excessive sedation, been immobile, and have had difficult functional recovery in the posttransplant period and high mortality. One solution to the deconditioning often seen in critically ill patients is the implementation of rehabilitation and ambulation while awaiting transplantation on ECMO. Ambulatory ECMO programs of this nature have been developed in an attempt to provide rehabilitation, physical therapy, and minimization of sedation prior to lung transplantation to improve both surgical and posttransplant outcomes. Favorable outcomes have been reported using this novel approach, but how and where this strategy should be implemented remain unclear. In this commentary, we review the currently available literature for ambulation and rehabilitation during ECMO support as a bridge to lung transplantation, discuss future directions for this technology, and address the important issues of resource allocation and regionalization of care as they relate to ambulatory ECMO.","Lehr, Carli J; Zaas, David W; Cheifetz, Ira M; Turner, David A",Chest,302,1

Population studies have shown that lower cognitive function is associated with worse self-care abilities. Several guidelines have emphasized the importance of assessing cognitive function in older people with diabetes and tailoring treatment plan accordingly. Those guidelines do not specify which tools are the most appropriate for this population. One approach to delineate which tools should be used is to assess which tools best correlate with self-care capacity. Objective: To assess which cognitive assessment tools best correlate with self-care capacity in older people with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Cross-sectional study, conducted amongst individuals with diabetes over the age of 60. The association between self-care capacity indices and different cognitive assessment tools was examined. Principal Component self-care constructs were determined and the association between these and the different cognitive assessment tools was examined. Results: A significant association was found between the Principal Component self-care construct and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and MindstreamsTM scores. In a stepwise regression model including only the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, a significant association was found between this score and the Principal Component self-care construct. The same was not found in a model that included only the MindstreamsTM scores. Conclusions: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, previously validated as a brief cognitive screening tool, may be useful as an adjunct to assess the self-care capacity of older individuals with diabetes. Future studies in the clinic are needed to evaluate if using this tool may improve treatment plans.","Mordenfeld, Nadia; Gayus, Noa; Azmon, Michal; Guri-Twito, Omri; Yahalom Peri, Tal; Natovich, Rachel; Cukierman-Yaffe, Tali",Frontiers in endocrinology,302,11

LaTME can be difficult in the lowermost part of the rectum, leading potentially to higher rates of complications, conversion to open surgery and probably suboptimal oncological quality. Transanal TME (TaTME) can potentially solve these problems. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term results after TaTME with those after LaTME. METHOD A prospectively collected database of consecutive patients who underwent TaTME was maintained. Results were compared with those who underwent LaTME in the preceding period. Patients who underwent low anterior resection or intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision were included. Primary end-points were radical resection and specimen quality. Secondary end-points were complications, rates of conversion, operating time and hospital stay. RESULTS In total, 50 patients were included (TaTME = 25, LaTME = 25). The groups were comparative in demographic data and tumour characteristics. Circumferential resection margin was positive in one patient in the TaTME group vs four patients in the LaTME group (P = 0.349). All patients in the TaTME group had either complete or nearly complete specimen quality, while four patients in the LaTME group had incomplete specimen quality (P = 0.113). Less blood loss, shorter operating time and shorter hospital stay were found in the TaTME group (P values 0.016, 0.002 and 0.020 respectively). Intra-operative complications were comparable (P = 0.286). CONCLUSION The TaTME procedure had comparable pathological results and acceptable short-term postoperative outcomes compared to LaTME.","Perdawood, S K; Al Khefagie, G A A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,302,31

Yet rural communities-which make up tens of millions of people from diverse backgrounds in the United States-are among the nation's most vulnerable populations and may be less resilient to the effects of such a large-scale exogenous shock. We address this critical knowledge gap with data from a new survey designed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on health-related and economic dimensions of rural well-being in the North American West. Notably, we find that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural populations have been severe, with significant negative impacts on unemployment, overall life satisfaction, mental health, and economic outlook. Further, we find that these impacts have been generally consistent across age, ethnicity, education, and sex. We discuss how these findings constitute the beginning of a much larger interdisciplinary COVID-19 research effort that integrates rural areas and pushes beyond the predominant focus on cities and nation-states.","Mueller, J Tom; McConnell, Kathryn; Burow, Paul Berne; Pofahl, Katie; Merdjanoff, Alexis A; Farrell, Justin",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,302,1

For lesions adjacent to the perirolandic area and descending motor tracts, mapping can be done with both awake craniotomy (AC) and under general anesthesia (GA). OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine which anesthetic protocol-AC vs. GA-provides better patient outcomes by comparing EOR and postoperative morbidity for surgeries using IS mapping in gliomas located near or in motor areas of the brain. METHODS A systematic literature search was carried out to identify relevant studies from 1983 to 2019. Seven databases were screened. A total of 2351 glioma patients from 17 studies were analyzed. RESULTS A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a trend towards a higher mean EOR in AC [90.1% (95% C.I. 85.8-93.8)] than with GA [81.7% (95% C.I. 72.4-89.7)] (p = 0.06). Neurological deficits were divided by timing and severity for analysis. There was no significant difference in early neurological deficits [20.9% (95% C.I. 4.1-45.0) vs. 25.4% (95% C.I. 13.6-39.2)] (p = 0.74), late neurological deficits [17.1% (95% C.I. 0.0-50.0) vs. 3.8% (95% C.I. 1.1-7.6)] (p = 0.06), or in non-severe [28.4% (95% C.I. 0.0-88.5) vs. 20.1% (95% C.I. 7.1-32.2)] (p = 0.72), and severe morbidity [2.6% (95% C.I. 0.0-15.5) vs. 4.5% (95% C.I. 1.1-9.6)] (p = 0.89) between patients who underwent AC versus GA, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate clinicopathologic characteristics of colorectal NECs and elucidate genomic differences and similarities between colorectal NECs and colorectal adenocarcinomas (ACs). A total of 30 colorectal NECs were screened for frequently identified CRC oncogenic driver genes by targeted next-generation sequencing of 382 genes. The median age of the patients was 67 years (range, 44 to 88 years). NECs occurred predominantly in the rectum (47%) and exhibited multiple adverse prognostic pathologic factors, including frequent lymphatic and vascular invasions, high rates of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis and advanced TNM stage. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates of NEC patients were 46.7%, 36.4%, and 32.7%, respectively, with a median overall survival period of 11.5 months. In a molecular analysis, NECs showed high rates of BRAF mutation (23%), predominantly p.V600E (71%), and alterations in RB1 (47%), particularly deletion (57%).

DESIGN Step-by-step explanation of the technique in a narrated video. INTERVENTION Contained In Bag Morcellation of myoma after laparoscopic myomectomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Recent controversy regarding the risk of disseminating occult leiomyosarcomatous tissue during morcellation means we need to revise our current approach to tissue extraction at laparoscopic myomectomy and morcellation in general. Herein we present a novel technique, conceived by Dr. Danny Chou, called the Sydney Contained In Bag Morcellation technique for laparoscopic myomectomy. In this technique an EndoCatch bag (EndoCatch II Auto Suture Specimen Retrieval Pouch; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) is introduced in the typical fashion, the myoma is retrieved, and the mouth of the bag is exteriorized onto the abdominal wall. A 12-mm trocar is then introduced within the bag, and pneumoperitoneum is created before introducing an optical balloon tip port (KII Balloon Blunt Tip System; Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) and the power morcellator device. Morcellation is then performed within the bag, under direct vision. This technique may offer a safer approach to morcellation because the bowel is not within the morcellation field and there is lower risk of disseminating occult leiomyosarcomatous tissue during morcellation. Subsequent to the morcellation process, suctioning of the bag removes any aerosolized particles of myoma, further minimizing the risk of possible dissemination. CONCLUSION This technique may enable a minimally invasive approach to myomectomy to continue as a viable option in the era since the warning by the US Food and Drug Administration.","Kanade, Trupti Tanaji; McKenna, Joanne B; Choi, Sarah; Tsai, Brian P; Rosen, David M; Cario, Gregory M; Chou, Danny",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,302,1

Both the natural course of the disease and the treatment drugs used have effects on ventricular repolarization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of repolarization parameters obtained from surface electrocardiography (ECG) on prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Participants were 205 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis. The 12-lead surface ECG was obtained from each patient on admission. The ECG results were evaluated against the patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes by experienced cardiology specialists. RESULTS The mean age was higher in the non-survivor group compared to the survivor group (57.4 ± 15.7 vs. 65.6 ± 16.6; p = 0.001). The demographical characteristics were similar between the survivor and non-survivor groups.

The aim of the study is to assess if R-LESS is feasible with standard robotic instruments via a single incision and whether the approach could reduce the difficulty of the procedure and confer additional benefits over conventional LESS. METHODS This was a prospective randomized controlled study investigating the workload performance, efficacy, and risks of performing R-LESS when compared with human LESS (H-LESS) in a survival porcine model for cholecystectomy and gastrojejunostomy. The primary outcome is the NASA task load index. Secondary outcomes included the difficulty of the procedures, procedural time, morbidities, and mortalities. RESULTS Twenty-four cholecystectomies and gastrojejunostomies using the R-LESS or H-LESS approach (12:12) were performed. None of the swine suffered from procedural adverse events and none of the procedures required conversion. In both the cholecystectomy and gastrojejunostomy groups, R-LESS was associated with significantly lower NASA task load index (P < 0.001) and reduced difficulties in various steps of the procedures. No differences in the overall procedure times of the two procedures were observed (P = 0.315).

Objective To describe the incidence of bleeding complications among patients undergoing contemporary endovascular interventions involving large-bore catheters and its association with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and health care cost. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study analyzed all 17 672 patients from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample database who were recorded as having undergone a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n = 3223), an endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 12 633), or a percutaneous left ventricular assist device implant (n = 1816) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013. Bleeding complication was defined as any transfusion, any hemorrhage or hematoma, or the need for percutaneous or surgical intervention to control the bleeding event. Health care costs were determined by multiplying the total charge for each visit by the cost to charge ratios reported for each hospital code in the database. Data were collected from the database on April 29, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures Adjusted association between bleeding complications and mortality was determined by multivariable logistic regression. Length of stay and total health care costs were compared using multivariable linear regression between patients who did and patients who did not have bleeding complications. Results Bleeding complications occurred in 3128 patients (17.7%) (1984 men and 1144 women, with a mean [SD] age of 75.6 [11.9] years).

OBJECTIVE This study proposes and evaluates a de-identification strategy, which comprises several rules along with privacy models such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness. The evaluation of the proposed strategy has been performed using the actual CDM database. METHODS This study proposes and evaluates a de-identification strategy, which comprises several rules along with privacy models such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness. The evaluation of the proposed strategy has been performed using the actual CDM database. RESULTS The CDM database, which was constructed according to the rules established by OHDSI, exhibited a low re-identification risk: the highest re-identifiable record rate (""11.3%"") in the dataset was exhibited by the DRUG_EXPOSURE table, with a re-identification success rate of 0.03%. However, because all tables include at least one ""highest risk"" value of 100%, suitable anonymizing techniques are required; moreover, the CDM database preserves the ""source values"" (raw data), a combination of which could increase the risk of re-identification. Therefore, this study proposes an enhanced strategy to de-identify the source values to significantly reduce not only the highest risk in the k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness privacy models, but also the overall possibility of re-identification. CONCLUSIONS Our proposed de-identification strategy effectively enhanced the privacy of the CDM database, thereby encouraging clinical research involving multiple centers.

PROCEDURES Effects of injection volume (50, 100 μl) at different doses (0.05, 0.135, 0.22 nmol) on popliteal node (PN) detection were studied in rats. The radiotracer under study was (99m)Technetium-cysteine-mannose-dextran conjugate (30 kDa). RESULTS At 0.05 nmol dose, higher PN uptake was observed at 50 μl injection volume (2.6 fold increase). Conversely, at 0.135 nmol dose, an increase of radiotracer retention in PN was achieved at 100 μl volume, 78% higher than 50 μl. However, at 0.22 nmol dose, the injection volume changes did not influence on the PN uptake. Considering as suitable radiotracer performance: high PN uptake and extraction, better combinations were 0.05 nmol/50 μl, 0.135 nmol/100 μl, 0.22/50 μl. CONCLUSION Suitable performances could be reached by proper combinations of dose, injection volume and concentration for a specific radiotracer used in sentinel lymph node detection.","Núñez, Eutimio Gustavo Fernández; de Oliveira, Erica Aparecida; da Silva, Natanael Gomes; Filho, Renato Santos de Oliveira",Nuclear medicine and biology,302,1

But their positive and negative appraisals, and coping behaviour could prevent or ameliorate future problems. OBJECTIVE To explore the emotional experiences, thought processes and coping behaviours of people with existing mental health problems and carers living through the pandemic. METHODS UK participants who identified as a mental health service user (N18), a carer (N5) or both (N8) participated in 30-minute semi-structured remote interviews (31 March 2020 to 9 April 2020). The interviews investigated the effects of social distancing and self-isolation on mental health and the ways in which people were coping. Data were analysed using a framework analysis. Three service user researchers charted data into a framework matrix (consisting of three broad categories: ""emotional responses"", ""thoughts"" and ""behaviours"") and then used an inductive process to capture other contextual themes. RESULTS Common emotional responses were fear, sadness and anger but despite negative emotions and uncertainty appraisals, participants described efforts to cope and maintain their mental wellbeing. This emphasised an increased reliance on technology, which enabled social contact and occupational or leisure activities. Participants also spoke about the importance of continued and adapted mental health service provision, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with changes in their living environment, life schedule and social interactions. CONCLUSION This study builds on a growing number of qualitative accounts of how mental health service users and carers experienced and coped with extreme social distancing measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than a state of helplessness this study contains a clear message of resourcefulness and resilience in the context of fear and uncertainty.","Simblett, Sara K; Wilson, Emma; Morris, Daniel; Evans, Joanne; Odoi, Clarissa; Mutepua, Magano; Dawe-Lane, Erin; Jilka, Sagar; Pinfold, Vanessa; Wykes, Til",Journal of mental health,302,1

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine whether combined total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique with propofol/remifentanil is associated with less SSEP suppression when compared to combined volatile agent desflurane/remifentanil anesthesia during corrective scoliosis surgery at a comparable depth of anesthesia. DESIGN It is a randomized controlled trial. SETTING The study was conducted at the Single tertiary University Hospital during October 2014 to June 2015. PATIENTS Patients who required SSEP and had no neurological deficits, and were of American Society of Anesthesiologist I and II physical status, were included. Patients who had sensory or motor deficits preoperatively and significant cardiovascular and respiratory disease were excluded. A total of 72 patients were screened, and 67 patients were randomized and allocated to two groups: 34 in desflurane/remifentanil group and 33 in TIVA group. Four patients from desflurane/remifentanil group and three from TIVA group were withdrawn due to decrease in SSEP amplitude to <0.3 µV after induction of anesthesia. Thirty patients from each group were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS Sixty-seven patients were randomized to receive TIVA or desflurane/remifentanil anesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The measurements taken were the amplitude and latency of SSEP monitoring at five different time points during surgery: before and after the induction of anesthesia, at skin incision, at pedicle screw insertion, and at rod insertion. RESULTS Both anesthesia techniques, TIVA and desflurane/remifentanil, resulted in decreased amplitude and increased latencies of both cervical and cortical peaks. The desflurane/remifentanil group had a significantly greater reduction in the amplitude ( p = 0.004) and an increase in latency ( p = 0.002) of P40 compared with the TIVA group. However, there were no differences in both amplitude ( p = 0.214) and latency ( p = 0.16) in cervical SSEP between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Compared with TIVA technique, desflurane/remifentanil anesthesia caused more suppression in cortical SSEP, but not in cervical SSEP, at a comparable depth of anesthesia.","Hasan, M Shahnaz; Tan, Jin-Keat; Chan, Chris Yin Wei; Kwan, Mun Keong; Karim, Fathil Syafiq Abdul; Goh, Khean-Jin",Journal of orthopaedic surgery,302,16

Plenty of literature is available on lumbar spine non-instrumented surgeries under spinal anaesthesia (SA) but handful of literature is there on lumbar spinal instrumented fusion surgeries under SA. We retrospectively analysed the data of 131 patients operated under SA and 108 patients under GA. Aim of the study was to evaluate the safety, advantages and disadvantages of doing lumbar spine instrumented fusion surgeries under SA.In time of COVID-19 pandemic, aerosol generating procedure like intubation, can be avoided if lumbar spine instrumented fusion surgeries are performed under SA. Methods 239 patients aged between 20 and 79 years operated from January 2014 to December 2019 were included in this study. Indications for surgery were lumbar canal stenosis, degenerative or lytic spondylolisthesis. They underwent L4-L5 or L5-S1 fusion surgeries either TLIF or pedicle screw fixation postero lateral fusion (PLF) and decompression. Out of 239 patients,131 were operated under SA and 108 patients under GA. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood loss, operating room time, post-op pain relief and need of analgesics, cost of surgery and anaesthesia related complications were analysed. Results The study found significantly less blood loss (p<.05), less OR time, better post-op analgesia and lesser incidence of nausea and vomiting in SA (8.4%) than GA (29.6%). We observed average 10% cost reduction in SA. This study did not find any prone position related complication in regional anaesthesia but one transient brachial plexus palsy and one post-op shoulder pain in GA group. Conclusion SA is a safe alternative to GA for lumbar spine instrumented fusion surgery with significant less blood loss, OR time, better post-op analgesia, average 10% overall cost reduction and no reported prone-position related complications.","Sarkar, Saikat; Banerji, Aditi; Chattopadhyaya, Arindam; Banerjee, Sitikantha",Journal of clinical orthopaedics and trauma,302,16

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) degrades Ang II to angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and has recently been described to have an antagonistic effect on ACE signalling. However, the specific underlying role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is unclear. In the present study, the local imbalance of ACE and ACE2, as well as Ang II and Ang-(1-7) expression, was compared in wild-type (WT) and ACE2 knock-out (KO) or ACE2 transgenic (TG) mice subjected to cerulein-induced SAP. Serum amylase, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 levels and histological morphometry were used to determine the severity of pancreatitis. In WT mice, pancreatic ACE and Ang II and serum Ang II expression increased (P < 0.05), while pancreatic ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) and serum Ang-(1-7) levels were also significantly elevated (P < 0.05) from 2 to 72 h after the onset of SAP. However, the ratio of pancreatic ACE2 to ACE expression was significantly reduced (from 1.46 ± 0.09 to 0.27 ± 0.05, P < 0.001) and paralleled the severity of pancreatitis. The Ace2 KO mice exhibited increased levels of tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-6, multifocal coagulative necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate, and lower levels of serum IL-10 and pancreatic Ang-(1-7) (4.70 ± 2.13 versus 10.87 ± 2.51, P < 0.001) compared with cerulein-treated WT mice at the same time point. Conversely, Ace2 TG mice with normal ACE expression were more resistant to SAP challenge as evidenced by a decreased inflammatory response, attenuated pathological changes and increased survival rates. These data suggest that the ACE2-ACE imbalance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SAP and that pancreatic ACE2 is an important factor in determining the severity of SAP.","Liu, Ruixia; Qi, Haiyu; Wang, Jing; Wang, Yan; Cui, Lijian; Wen, Yan; Yin, Chenghong",Experimental physiology,302,20

Antimicrobials have been recognized by clinical guidelines as an important component in the management of AECB with a bacterial etiology. The challenge of identifying patients most likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy is difficult in the clinical setting. However, appropriate risk stratification of patients, and the use of antimicrobials within the correct spectrum and for a suitable duration, can improve clinical outcomes while minimizing induction of antimicrobial resistance. With an improved design in pharmacologic and clinical studies, differences can be appreciated among the various antimicrobial agents available to treat AECB. Factors to be considered in antimicrobial agent selection include local tissue penetration, effects on bacteriological eradication, duration of therapy, speed of resolution and prevention or delay of recurrences.","Sethi, Sanjay",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,302,10

There is an urgent need for safe and effective preventive vaccines to curb this pandemic. A growing amount of related research has been published. This study aimed to provide the current status of COVID-19 vaccine using bibliometric analysis. We searched Embase.com and MEDLINE comprehensively and included articles, articles in press, reviews, short surveys, conference abstracts and conference papers about COVID-19 vaccine. VOSviewer1.6.11 (Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands) was applied to perform the bibliometric analysis of these papers. A total of 1,312 papers were finally included.

Among all the institutions, Harvard University was regarded as a leader for research collaboration. We analyzed the keywords and identified seven COVID-19 vaccine research hotspot clusters. COVID-19 vaccine research hotspots focus on clinical trials on vaccine safety and efficacy, research on vaccine immunology and immunoinformatics, and vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis results demonstrated that cooperation between countries, institutions, and authors were insufficient. The results suggested that clinical trials on vaccine safety, efficacy, immunology, immunoinformatics, production and delivery are research hotspots.

METHODS Tunneled silicone 14.5-F catheters were inserted into the left internal jugular vein in eight dogs. The dogs were separated into two groups according to catheter indwelling time of 14 and 28 days. All dogs underwent extracorporeal circulation three times a week. Multidetector computed tomography venography (MDCTV) examination was used to examine the catheter tip thrombus. After the animals were sacrificed, histological and immunohistochemistry evaluations were performed to confirm specific cell populations. We used computer modeling to generate wall shear stress profiles for the blood flow through the catheter. RESULTS Catheter-related sheaths were identified in all catheter specimens, but there was no fibrin sheath around the catheter tip. There were also differences in wall shear stress between the different venous wall sites. Differences in vein wall thickening at different sites have been found at both 14 days (intima to media (I/M) ratio S1 vs S2: p = 0.01, S3 vs S4: p<0.01) and 28 days (I/M ratio S1 vs S2: p<0.01, S3 vs S4: p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS After catheter placement, fibrin sheath formation partially covered the catheter. Meanwhile, focal areas of intimal thickening were also seen in the venous wall adjacent to the sites of high wall shear stress. These findings indicate an important role of wall shear stress profiles in fibrin sheath formation and intimal thickening.","Wang, Li Hua; Wei, Fang; Jia, Lan; Lu, Zhi; Wang, Bo; Dong, Hong Ye; Yu, Hai Bo; Sun, Gui Jiang; Yang, Jie; Li, Bo; Meng, Jia; Zhang, Rui Ning; Bi, Xue Qing; Chen, Hai Yan; Jiang, Ai Li",The journal of vascular access,302,7

In macrophages, heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans mediate the initial PRRSV attachment and the receptor sialoadhesin mediates both PRRSV attachment and internalization into endosomes. Upon a pH drop, PRRSV is uncoated and its genome is released from the endosomes into the cytoplasm, which allows virus replication. However, expression of heparan sulphate and sialoadhesin in non-susceptible cells only allows virus internalization, but no virus uncoating and infection, indicating that other factors are involved. In the present study, it is shown that treatment of macrophages with serum (mainly the alpha-globulin fraction) inhibited PRRSV infection without affecting attachment and internalization. Because alpha-globulins contain several protease inhibitors, macrophages were treated with different protease inhibitors to investigate the involvement of proteases in PRRSV uncoating. Treatment of macrophages with broadly active inhibitors of serine or aspartic proteases, but not cysteine- or metallo-proteases, inhibited PRRSV uncoating and infection. Further investigation using specific inhibitors indicated that the aspartic protease cathepsin E is involved during PRRSV uncoating, but did not allow identification of the serine protease involved. The involvement of cathepsin E during PRRSV uncoating was confirmed by partial co-localization of internalized PRRSV with cathepsin E. Furthermore, cathepsin E expression increased with macrophage cultivation, which was positively correlated with an increased susceptibility to PRRSV infection. Together, these data show that, in macrophages, both the aspartic protease cathepsin E and an unidentified trypsin-like serine protease are involved in uncoating of internalized PRRSV and subsequent infection.","Misinzo, Gerald M; Delputte, Peter L; Nauwynck, Hans J",Veterinary research,302,1

More than 10 million CT scans of the chest were performed in the United States alone in 2012, highlighting the potential for this clinical scenario. Detecting a nodule on either a chest radiograph or a CT scan frequently leads to a cascade of further investigations to establish a definite diagnosis. Thoracic surgery is frequently performed to obtain a tissue diagnosis in these cases, however, for what often turns out to be a benign abnormality.

Type I interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes by activating phosphorylation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which form heterotrimers (interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 [ISGF3]) with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and translocate to the nucleus. PRRSV Nsp1β blocks the nuclear translocation of the ISGF3 complex by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we discovered that Nsp1β induced the degradation of karyopherin-α1 (KPNA1, also called importin-α5), which is known to mediate the nuclear import of ISGF3. Overexpression of Nsp1β resulted in a reduction of KPNA1 levels in a dose-dependent manner, and treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored KPNA1 levels. Furthermore, the presence of Nsp1β induced an elevation of KPNA1 ubiquitination and a shortening of its half-life. Our analysis of Nsp1β deletion constructs showed that the N-terminal domain of Nsp1β was involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA1. A nucleotide substitution resulting in an amino acid change from valine to isoleucine at residue 19 of Nsp1β diminished its ability to induce KPNA1 degradation and to inhibit IFN-mediated signaling. Interestingly, infection of MARC-145 cells by PRRSV strains VR-2332 and VR-2385 also resulted in KPNA1 reduction, whereas infection by an avirulent strain, Ingelvac PRRS modified live virus (MLV), did not. MLV Nsp1β had no effect on KPNA1; however, a mutant with an amino acid change at residue 19 from isoleucine to valine induced KPNA1 degradation. These results indicate that Nsp1β blocks ISGF3 nuclear translocation by inducing KPNA1 degradation and that valine-19 in Nsp1β correlates with the inhibition.","Wang, Rong; Nan, Yuchen; Yu, Ying; Zhang, Yan-Jin",Journal of virology,302,1

However recurrent or prolonged use can be associated with nitrous oxide toxicity, with numerous reports of harm documented in the literature. Nitrous oxide irreversibly binds and inactivates vitamin B12, which is an important co-factor in metabolic pathways involved in DNA and myelin synthesis. Toxicity is therefore associated with vitamin B12 deficiency-related syndromes, primarily involving haematological and neurological systems. As a 'legal high', nitrous oxide use has attracted repeated health warnings from experts. An awareness and understanding of the pathophysiology and management of nitrous oxide toxicity is therefore important for clinicians.

However, the feasibility and potential benefits of repeat thrombectomy for recurrent stroke is unclear. We aim to report our experience with repeat thrombectomy for recurrent LVOS. METHODS We reviewed our prospectively collected endovascular database for patients who underwent repeated mechanical thrombectomy. Baseline characteristics, procedural data and outcomes were evaluated. Patients with repeat thrombectomy were compared to patients with single thrombectomy. For patients with repeat thrombectomy, imaging and procedural variables were compared between first and last procedures. RESULTS Out of 697 patients treated within the study period, 15 patients (2%) had repeat thrombectomies (14 treated twice and one thrice). The mean age was 63 ± 15 years and 40% were males. The median time between the first and last procedure was 18 (1-278) days. Cardioembolism (66%) was the most common etiology, followed by intracranial atherosclerosis (13%) and large vessel atherosclerosis (6%). At 90 days after the last thrombectomy, 60% of patients achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 and 20% were deceased. There were no statistically significant differences in demographics, stroke severity, time from last known normal to puncture, reperfusion rates, hemorrhagic complications, good clinical outcomes and mortality between patients who underwent repeat thrombectomy and those who had a single thrombectomy. CONCLUSION In properly selected patients suffering recurrent LVOS, repeated mechanical thrombectomy appears to be feasible and safe. A previous thrombectomy should not discourage aggressive treatment as these patients may achieve similar rates of good clinical outcomes as those who undergo single thrombectomy.","Bouslama, Mehdi; Haussen, Diogo C; Rebello, Leticia C; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,302,31

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial FAN1 and human FAN1 (hFAN1) missing a flexible loop are monomeric, while intact hFAN1 is homo-dimeric in structure. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5’ flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5’ flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization. Our study therefore furnishes biochemical evidence for a role of hFAN1 homodimerization in biological processes that involve 5’ DNA Flap cleavage.","Rao, Timsi; Longerich, Simonne; Zhao, Weixing; Aihara, Hideki; Sung, Patrick; Xiong, Yong",bioRxiv,302,1

Materials and methods: The retrospective study included 764 patients with CKD VD, who received dialysis treatment at the Kyiv City Center for Nephrology and Dialysis, which is the clinical base of the Institute of Nephrology of the National Academy of Medical Sciences since September 1, 2020. until December 31, 2020. 155 patients were diagnosed with coronavirus disease. The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, dialysis patients with coronavirus disease were divided into groups depending on the severity of the disease. The second stage of the study was determined the influence of age, duration of dialysis treatment, gender, cause of chronic kidney disease VD, obesity, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular pathology on the course of coronavirus disease, as well as complications and mortality from COVID-19 among the dialysis population. Results: 155 cases of COVID-19 were registered among 764 dialysis patients. Mild coronavirus disease was diagnosed in 38 (24.5%) patients, moderate and severe in 64 (41.3%) and 53 (34.2%) patients, respectively. Oxygen support was required for 76 patients (79%), and artificial lung ventilation was used for 17 (10.9%) patients. Factors associated with severe coronavirus disease in this category of patients were found to be obesity (BMI> 30 kg / m2), diabetes mellitus, concomitant cardiovascular disease, and the need for oxygen support. In this category of patients, obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and require supplement oxygen are associated with severe Coronavirus disease COVID-19. There was no significant effect on the severity of coronavirus disease in the age of patients and duration of dialysis treatment. The duration of treatment in patients with diabetes was significantly higher (p <0.05), a direct strong correlation between BMI and duration of treatment was demonstrated. Survival was significantly higher in the group of patients who did not require oxygen support (78% vs. 56%) and had a BMI <30 kg / m2 (87% vs. 37%). Conclusions: the incidence of coronavirus disease among the dialysis cohort was 20.2% of cases. Patients treated with peritoneal dialysis had a significantly lower incidence. Severe coronavirus disease has been associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and the need for oxygen support. Men were more likely to have COVID-19 than women. There is no connection between the severe course of coronavirus disease with the age of patients and the duration of dialysis treatment. The duration of treatment of Coronavirus disease in the group of patients with diabetes and high BMI was longer. The following complications predominated in patients with COVID-19: thrombosis of arteriovenous fistula and atrial fibrillation. During the study period, 20 (12.9%) deaths were registered.

METHODS The study obtained epidemiological indicators for COVID-19, factors about medical resources and population movement as parameters for the SEIR model and utilized the model to predict the maximum number of infections on a single day at different control levels in Beijing, simulated as an epidemic spreading city and an epidemic outbreak city respectively. The modified two-step floating catchment area method under ArcGIS 10.6 environment was used to analyze spatial accessibility to fever clinics services for the patients in Beijing. RESULTS According to the results of the SEIR model, the highest number of infections in a single day in Beijing simulated as an epidemic spreading city at low, medium and high levels of prevention and control were 8 514, 183, and 68 cases, the highest number of infections in a single day in Beijing simulated as an outbreak city was 22 803, 10 868 and 3 725 cases, respectively. The following result showed that Beijing was simulated as an epidemic spreading city: among the 585 communities in Beijing, under the low level of prevention and control, there were 17 communities (2.91%) with excellent accessibility to fever clinics, and that of 41 communities (7.01%) with fever clinics was good. Spatial accessibility of fever clinics in 56 communities (9.57%) was ranked average, and 62 communities' (10.60%) accessibility was fair and 409 communities (69.91%) had poor accessibility; at the medium level of prevention and control, only the west region of Fangshan District and Mentougou District, the north region of Yanqing District, Huairou District and Miyun District had poor accessibility; under the high level of prevention and control, 559 communities' (95.56%) had excellent accessibility. The accessibility in 24 communities (4.10%) was good and in 2 communities (0.34%) was average. In brief, the existing fever clinics could meet the common demand. Beijing was simulated as an outbreak city: under the low level of prevention and control, only 1 community (0.17%) had excellent accessibility to fever clinics, and 5 communities (0.86%) had good accessibility. The accessibility of fever clinics in 10 communities (1.71%) was average and in 12 communities (2.05%) was fair. The accessibility of fever clinics in 557 communities (95.21%), nearly all areas of Beijing, was poor; under the middle and high level of prevention and control, the accessibility of ecological conservation areas was also relatively poor. CONCLUSION The distribution of fever clinic resources in Beijing is uneven. When Beijing is simulated as an epidemic spreading city: under the high level of prevention and control, the number of fever clinics can be appropriately reduced to avoid cross-infection; at the medium level of prevention and control, the fever clinics can basically meet the needs of patients with fever in Beijing, but the accessibility of fever clinics in ecological conservation areas is insufficient, and priority should be given to the construction of fever clinics in public hospitals above the second level in the ecological conservation areas. When the level of prevention and control is low, the accessibility of fever clinics in ecological conservation areas is poor. Priority should be given to the construction of fever clinics in ecological conservation areas, and temporary fever sentinels can be established to relieve the pressure of fever clinics. When Beijing is simulated as an outbreak city and has low prevention and control, due to a large number of infections, it is necessary to upgrade the prevention and control level to reduce the flow of people to curb the development of the epidemic.","Zhang, J W; Han, P E; Yang, L",Beijing da xue xue bao.

However, a previous study has shown that the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the viral genome is also required for subgenomic mRNA transcription; deletion of nucleotides (nt) 270 to 305 from the 3'-UTR completely abolished subgenomic mRNA transcription without affecting minus-strand RNA synthesis (Y.-J. Lin, X. Zhang, R.-C. Wu, and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol. 70:7236-7240, 1996), suggesting that the 3'-UTR affects positive-strand RNA synthesis. In this study, by UV-cross-linking experiments, we found that several cellular proteins bind specifically to the minus-strand 350 nucleotides complementary to the 3'-UTR of the viral genome. The major protein species, p55, was identified as the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB, also known as heterogeneous nuclear RNP I) by immunoprecipitation of the UV-cross-linked protein and binding of the recombinant PTB. A strong PTB-binding site was mapped to nt 53 to 149, and another weak binding site was mapped to nt 270 to 307 on the complementary strand of the 3'-UTR (c3'-UTR). Partial substitutions of the PTB-binding nucleotides reduced PTB binding in vitro. Furthermore, defective interfering (DI) RNAs harboring these mutations showed a substantially reduced ability to synthesize subgenomic mRNA. By enzymatic and chemical probing, we found that PTB binding to nt 53 to 149 caused a conformational change in the neighboring RNA region. Partial deletions within the PTB-binding sequence completely abolished the PTB-induced conformational change in the mutant RNA even when the RNA retained partial PTB-binding activity. Correspondingly, the MHV DI RNAs containing these deletions completely lost their ability to transcribe mRNAs. Thus, the conformational change in the c3'-UTR caused by PTB binding may play a role in mRNA transcription.","Huang, P; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,302,24

SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly transmitted across the globe within a short period of time, with more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths. The continuous rise in worldwide cases of COVID-19, transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 including re-infections and enormous case-fatality rates emphasizes the urgent need of potential preventive and therapeutic measures. The development of effective therapeutic and preventive measures relies on understanding the molecular and cellular mechanism of replication exhibited by SARS-CoV-2. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is ranging from 90-120 nm that comprises surface viral proteins including spike, envelope, membrane which are attached in host lipid bilayer containing the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral RNA. Spike (S) glycoprotein initiates the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 with a widely expressed cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and subsequent S glycoprotein priming via serine protease TMPRSS2. Prominently, comprehensive analysis of structural insights into the crucial SARS-CoV-2 proteins may lead us to design effective therapeutics molecules. The present article, emphasizes the molecular and structural perspective of SARS-CoV-2 including mechanistic insights in its replication.","Kumar, Swatantra; Saxena, Shailendra K",Methods (S.

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.","Pathak, Elizabeth Barnett; Salemi, Jason L; Sobers, Natasha; Menard, Janelle; Hambleton, Ian R",J Public Health Manag Pract,302,6

Nevertheless, there is limited information describing the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Latin America. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 9,468 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Ecuador. We calculated overall incidence, mortality, case fatality rates, disability adjusted life years, attack and crude mortality rates, as well as relative risk and relative odds of death, adjusted for age, sex and presence of comorbidities. A total of 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases and 474 deaths were included in the analysis. Men accounted for 55.4% (n = 5, 247) of cases and women for 44.6% (n = 4, 221). We found the presence of comorbidities, being male and older than 65 years were important determinants of mortality. Coastal regions were most affected by COVID-19, with higher mortality rates than the highlands. Fatigue was reported in 53.2% of the patients, followed by headache (43%), dry cough (41.7%), ageusia (37.1%) and anosmia (36.1%). We present an analysis of the burden of COVID-19 in Ecuador. Our findings show that men are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than women, and risk increases with age and the presence of comorbidities. We also found that blue-collar workers and the unemployed are at greater risk of dying. These early observations offer clinical insights for the medical community to help improve patient care and for public health officials to strengthen Ecuador's response to the outbreak.","Ortiz-Prado, Esteban; Simbaña-Rivera, Katherine; Barreno, Lenin Gómez; Diaz, Ana Maria; Barreto, Alejandra; Moyano, Carla; Arcos, Vannesa; Vásconez-González, Eduardo; Paz, Clara; Simbaña-Guaycha, Fernanda; Molestina-Luzuriaga, Martin; Fernández-Naranjo, Raúl; Feijoo, Javier; Henriquez-Trujillo, Aquiles R; Adana, Lila; López-Cortés, Andrés; Fletcher, Isabel; Lowe, Rachel",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,302,24

Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus. A total of 5 of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (four [80%] patients), and liver functions alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (four [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed in the hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4 ± 7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [20%] patients), acute liver injury (three [60%] patients), and diarrhea (two [40%] patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need intensive care unit and were discharged from the hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those coinfection patients.","Ding, Qiang; Lu, Panpan; Fan, Yuhui; Xia, Yujia; Liu, Mei",J. med. virol,302,6

The data of hospitalized COVID19 patients, especially those with serious illness, indicate the involvement of immunopathological complications. As no effective treatment is currently available, we propose 'Primed' Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) as a therapeutic alternative to tackle devastating epidemic. The individual response to MSCs treatment is heterogeneous. During the treatment of infectious pathology, the effectiveness of the treatment may vary based on the disease scenario. Interestingly, when transplanted in vivo, MSCs are governed by the locally regulated microenvironment, suggesting that the restorative variability could be tailored by choosing a priming regimen to specifically correct a given pathology. Therefore, in our opinion, the priming of MSCs could be a novel approach to improve the responses of COVID19 patients.","Raza, Syed Shadab; Seth, Pankaj; Khan, Mohsin Ali",,302,16

In particular, pandemic created the conditions for the most extensive mass teleworking experiment in history. While there is a wide literature on the effects of teleworking as a business innovation, mainly from an environmental perspective, there are few studies investigating the public perceptions regarding teleworking and, in particular, studies that draw from social media analyses. Based on these considerations, a big data analysis has been carried out in order to frame the public perceptions about teleworking on Twitter. The six-months sentiment analysis of about 11,000 tweets shows that the ecological value of telework is not perceived by people;surprisingly, in a pandemic context of growing ecological concern, there is no significant evidence of environmental awareness in relation to teleworking. However, the positive and negative concepts which emerge in relation to teleworking and similar terms can be assimilated to the benefits and pitfalls highlighted in the literature, which are related to economic or social sustainability.

Here, I examine the relationship between metabolism and COVID-19. I discuss why preexisting metabolic abnormalities, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension, may be important risk factors for severe and critical cases of infection, highlighting parallels between the pathophysiology of these metabolic abnormalities and the disease course of COVID-19.

We also confirmed that PDCoV infection impeded the activation of IFN-&#955;1 promoter stimulated by RIG-I, MDA5 and MAVS, but not by TBK1 and IRF1. Although the expression levels of IRF1 and MAVS were not changed, PDCoV infection resulted in reduction of the number of peroxisomes, the platform for MAVS to activate IRF1, and subsequent type III IFN production. Taken together, our study demonstrates that PDCoV suppresses type III IFN responses to circumvent the host's antiviral immunity.","Liu, Shudan; Fang, Puxian; Ke, Wenting; Wang, Jing; Wang, Xunlei; Xiao, Shaobo; Fang, Liurong",Vet Microbiol,302,14

Because all CoVs use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins, the frameshift signal in viral mRNA that stimulates -1 PRF provides a promising potential target for such therapeutics. To test the viability of this strategy, we explored a group of 6 small-molecule ligands, evaluating their activity against the frameshift signals from a panel of representative bat CoVs--the most likely source of future zoonoses--as well as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. We found that whereas some ligands had notable activity against only a few of the frameshift signals, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat suppressed -1 PRF significantly in several of them, while having limited to no effect on -1 PRF caused by frameshift signals from other viruses used as negative controls. These results suggest it is possible to find small-molecule ligands that inhibit -1 PRF specifically in a broad spectrum of CoVs, establishing the frameshift signal as a viable target for developing pan-coronaviral therapeutics.","Munshi, Sneha; Neupane, Krishna; Ileperuma, Sandaru M; Halma, Matthew TJ; Kelly, Jamie A; Halpern, Clarissa F; Dinman, Jonathan D.; Loerch, Sarah; Woodside, Michael T",,302,16

In many countries, this directive has been extended on shopping malls or public transportation. The aim of this paper is to critically analyze the statutory regulation to wear protective masks during the COVID-19 crisis from a medical standpoint. METHODS: We performed an extensive query of the most recent publications addressing the prevention of viral infections including the use of face masks in the community as a method to prevent the spread of the infection. We addressed the issues of practicability, professional use, and acceptability based on the community and the environment where the user resided. RESULTS: Upon our critical review of the available literature, we found only weak evidence for wearing a face mask as an efficient hygienic tool to prevent the spread of a viral infection. However, the use of MNC seems to be linked to relevant protection during close contact scenarios by limiting pathogen-containing aerosol and liquid droplet dissemination. Importantly, we found evidence for significant respiratory compromise in patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease, secondary to the development of hypercapnia. This could also happen in patients with lung infections, with or without SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Epidemiologists currently emphasize that wearing MNC will effectively interrupt airborne infections in the community. The government and the politicians have followed these recommendations and used them to both advise and, in some cases, mandate the general population to wear MNC in public locations. Overall, the results seem to suggest that there are some clinically relevant scenarios where the use of MNC necessitates more defined recommendations. Our critical evaluation of the literature both highlights the protective effects of certain types of face masks in defined risk groups, and emphasizes their potential risks.","Matuschek, Christiane; Moll, Friedrich; Fangerau, Heiner; Fischer, Johannes C; Zänker, Kurt; van Griensven, Martijn; Schneider, Marion; Kindgen-Milles, Detlef; Knoefel, Wolfram Trudo; Lichtenberg, Artur; Tamaskovics, Balint; Djiepmo-Njanang, Freddy Joel; Budach, Wilfried; Corradini, Stefanie; Häussinger, Dieter; Feldt, Torsten; Jensen, Björn; Pelka, Rainer; Orth, Klaus; Peiper, Matthias; Grebe, Olaf; Maas, Kitti; Gerber, Peter Arne; Pedoto, Alessia; Bölke, Edwin; Haussmann, Jan",Eur J Med Res,302,33

Our study aimed to compare the prevalence of anxiety and anxiety with insomnia, as well as the relationship between different psychological symptoms between the two groups. Methods: A total of 605 medical staff and 1091 public respondents were assessed through an online questionnaire survey, including the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the somatization subscale of Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Results: Compared with the general public, medical staff had a higher incidence of anxiety (45.5% vs 32.4%). The incidence of insomnia in anxious participants was 52.7% in medical staff and 44.6% in the general public, and the difference was significant (p &lt; 0.05). The GAD-7 score and somatization subscore of the SCI-90 were independently associated with insomnia among anxiety participants in both groups (all p &lt; 0.001).

This article takes stock of the key features of the COVID-19 innovation system-the network of public and private actors influencing the development and diffusion of technologies to combat the pandemic. Before the pandemic, biomedical research and development policy consisted largely of ""push"" funding from the public sector in support of basic research and ""pull"" incentives from patents to motivate private companies to invest in clinical trials and develop drugs and vaccines. In contrast, during the pandemic, public funding shifted its focus to late-stage product development and manufacturing. Procurement agreements with governments replaced traditional pull incentives from patents for the major private companies. Nonpatent barriers to competition may also have incentivized innovation. The challenges to ensuring diffusion have gained in prominence during the pandemic, though it is unclear what role patents will play in pricing and access. Some aspects of this approach to biomedical innovation may be unique to crises, but others could provide lessons for policy beyond the pandemic.","Sampat, Bhaven N; Shadlen, Kenneth C",Health Aff (Millwood),302,2

This study attempts to answer {\it who} constitutes the population vulnerable to the online misinformation in the pandemic, and what are the robust features and short-term behavior signals that distinguish susceptible users from others. Using a 6-month longitudinal user panel on Twitter collected from a geopolitically diverse network-stratified samples in the US, we distinguish different types of users, ranging from social bots to humans with various level of engagement with COVID-related misinformation. We then identify users' online features and situational predictors that correlate with their susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. This work brings unique contributions: First, contrary to the prior studies on bot influence, our analysis shows that social bots' contribution to misinformation sharing was surprisingly low, and human-like users' misinformation behaviors exhibit heterogeneity and temporal variability. While the sharing of misinformation was highly concentrated, the risk of occasionally sharing misinformation for average users remained alarmingly high. Second, our findings highlight the political sensitivity activeness and responsiveness to emotionally-charged content among susceptible users. Third, we demonstrate a feasible solution to efficiently predict users' transient susceptibility solely based on their short-term news consumption and exposure from their networks. Our work has an implication in designing effective intervention mechanism to mitigate the misinformation dissipation.","Teng, Xian; Lin, Yu-Ru; Chung, Wen-Ting; Li, Ang; Kovashka, Adriana",,302,5

There is no consensus on the optimal value, below which there is a higher chance of wound complications in patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction. METHODS: Patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction from 2015 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who returned to the operating room for a revision of the anastomosis were excluded from analysis. Patients were divided in two groups based on the development of late complications. Those were defined as fat necrosis, wound dehiscence, or distal flap ischemia/necrosis that developed after discharge from the hospital. Mean percutaneous oximetry readings of the first 24 hours were recorded and the mean change from the initial reading was calculated. The correlation between tissue oximetry change and development of complications was explored. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were identified. The mean age was 53, while the mean body mass index was 33. A total of 38 patients developed late wound complication. History of smoking, diabetes mellitus, neoadjuvant radiation therapy, and the mean change of the tissue oximetry reading were identified as independent predictors of wound complications. The absolute number of the tissue oximetry reading did not predict late complications. A multivariate analysis revealed that patients who experienced a mean decrease < 15% from the initial reading during the first 24 hours were significantly more likely to develop late flap-related wound complications. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing free tissue breast reconstruction, tissue oximetry readings do not predict late wound complications. However, the mean change at 24 hours from the initial reading does. A decrease of <15% in tissue perfusion was associated with a significant increase in the probability of developing flap-related wound complications.","Saad, Noah; Wang, Howard; Karamanos, Efstathios",J. reconstr. microsurg,302,22

DESIGN: We conducted a cross sectional survey of HCWs (physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), non-clinical staff) during May 2020. Participants completed a 42-item survey assessing disease transmission risk (clinical role, work environment, availability of personal protective equipment) and mental health (anxiety, depression and burn-out). SETTING: The questionnaire was disseminated over various social media platforms. 3083 respondents from 48 states, the District of Columbia and US territories accessed the survey. PARTICIPANTS: Using a convenience sample of HCWs who worked during the pandemic, 3083 respondents accessed the survey and 2040 participants completed at least 80% of the survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 infection, in addition to burn-out, depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Participants were largely from the Northeast and Southern USA, with attending physicians (31.12%), nurses (26.80%), EMTs (13.04%) with emergency medicine department (38.30%) being the most common department and specialty represented. Twenty-nine per cent of respondents met the criteria for being a probable case due to reported COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test.

It also identified factors related to the knowledge and behavior regarding the same among older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted via a telephone survey involving 283 older adults living alone in S City from March to April 2020. Knowledge and behavior pertaining to face mask usage were measured using Hilda Ho's Face Mask Use Scale; reliability of the measurement was Kuder-Richardson formula-20 = .62, Cronbach's &#945; = .92. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, independent t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Older adults used one mask for 3.55 days on an average. The knowledge level was 9.97 (± 1.84) out of 12 and behavior level was 15.49 (± 1.55) out of 16. Level of education (ß = - .31, p < .001), living region (ß = .13, p = .017), personal income (ß = .12, p = .041) significantly affected the face mask usage-related knowledge, and living region (ß = .15, p = .010) significantly affected the face mask usage-related behavior. CONCLUSION: Older adults living alone are aware of the effects of using face masks. However, their mask usage is inappropriate, for example, the prolonged use of the same mask.

Although individual differences in perceived stress have shown to be related to anxiety and depression in non-COVID-19 work, research has not examined potential factors underlying this relation in the context of COVID-19. Fatigue severity may be a promising mechanistic construct for perceived stress and anxiety and depression relations, as some work has found that perceived stress may predict elevated fatigue symptoms.

However, few studies have examined the protective psychological factors that may explain how individuals are coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and its forced confinements. Objective: This study analyzes the impact of confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic on positive functioning variables (resilience, meaning of life, gratitude, compassion, life satisfaction), emotional distress (depression, anxiety, perceived stress, affect), and posttraumatic growth (PTG). The impact was measured during and after the first month of strict and obligatory confinement in Spain. Methods: The sample was composed of 438 Spanish residents (78.3% women) between the ages of 18 and 68 (M = 35.68;SD = 13.19) during the first stage (first two weeks) of confinement. The sample was reduced to 197 participants during the second stage (fifth week) of confinement. Several online self-reported questionnaires were administered to assess positive functioning variables, emotional distress, and PTG. Results: Women, youths, individuals without a partner, with lower monetary incomes, or diagnosed with a mental disorder or chronic illness experienced lower scores in positive functioning variables and greater emotional distress during the first stage of confinement. Linear mixed models showed that scores on positive functioning variables, emotional distress, and PTG worsened in the second stage of confinement. Nevertheless, a structural equations model showed that increases in positive functioning variables in the second stage were associated with increases in life satisfaction (R2 = .450) and related to decreases in emotional distress (R2 = .186), leading in turn to increases in PTG (R2 = .061). Conclusions: Individuals could experience PTG during strict and mandatory confinement. The increase in PTG during this adverse event was indirectly associated with increases in positive functioning variables (i.e. gratitude, presence of meaning, resilience), through improvements in life satisfaction and emotional distress. © 2021 The Author(s).

Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of ""open-label placebos"" (OLPs) have remained subject of debate. Furthermore, it is unclear whether OLPs are similarly effective when provided remotely, as is sometimes required e.g. in the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, we examined the effects of OLP plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone on symptom reduction in people with allergic rhinitis (N = 54) over the course of two weeks. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was provided remotely (i.e. sent via postal service). To investigate the potential influence of the clinical encounter on the effects of OLP, we manipulated the perception of the virtual clinical encounter, both with respect to verbal and nonverbal factors (augmented vs. limited encounter). RESULTS: The results of the manipulation check confirmed that the augmented clinical encounter was evaluated more positively than the limited encounter, in terms of perceived warmth of the provider. Participants from all treatment groups showed significant symptom reduction from baseline to two weeks later, but OLP had no incremental effect over TAU. Participants benefitted more from OLP when they did not take any other medication against allergic symptoms than when taking medication on demand. When controlling for baseline symptoms, a significant treatment by encounter interaction was found, pointing to greater symptom improvement in the OLP group when the encounter was augmented, whereas the control group improved more when the encounter was limited. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that providing OLP and enhancing the encounter remotely is possible, but their effectiveness might be lower in comparison to previous studies relying on physical patient-provider interaction. The study raises questions for future research about the potential and challenges of remote placebo studies and virtual clinical encounters. The study has been registered as a clinical trial at ISRCTN (record number: 39018).","Kube, Tobias; Hofmann, Verena E; Glombiewski, Julia A; Kirsch, Irving",PLoS One,302,26

Older adults not only have worse coronavirus outcomes but also face significant disruptions in their medical and home care, and social support networks. The pandemic highlights the importance of geriatric and dementia services and the ongoing shortage of health professionals within these fields. We collaborated with Alzheimer's Association Connecticut to develop an e-curriculum to educate caregivers on how best to care for affected seniors during this public health crisis. Methods: We set out to design a novel, blended-learning intervention to improve COVID-19-related geriatric and dementia education. Stakeholder discussions and semi-structured interviews with caregiver support staff and educators were carried out as part of a local needs assessment. Four central themes were identified during these interviews and are now being used to develop an interactive animation-based curriculum on the challenges of administering care for older adults during the pandemic. Results: Our initial focus group with caregiver support staff and educators identified the following key challenges: 1) social isolation, 2) caregiver fatigue, 3) safety issues, and 4) difficulty navigating the healthcare system with COVID-19. We are developing 10 minute educational videos that focus on each of these four themes and incorporate 2-D vector animation and whiteboard style teaching. An additional video will discuss the biology of COVID and why elderly/cognitively impaired adults are at increased risk. Conclusion: Through a local needs assessment, we identified four themes as barriers to providing care for older adults in the COVID-19 era. This information will be used to create an e-curriculum to increase caregivers' confidence and comfort with supporting older adults during the current health crisis. This content may also facilitate important discussions beyond COVID-19 as challenges like caregiver burden and social isolation are not unique to the pandemic.","Oyeyemi, D.

Unavailability of totally effective vaccination and proper treatment regimen forces to employ a non-pharmaceutical way of disease mitigation. The world is in desperate demand of useful control intervention to combat the deadly virus. This manuscript introduces a new mathematical model that addresses two different diagnosis efforts and isolation of confirmed cases. The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is inspected, and the model's dynamical characteristics are also studied. We found that with the condition R 0 < 1 , the disease can be eliminated from the system. Further, we fit our proposed model system with cumulative confirmed cases of six Indian states, namely, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and West Bengal. Sensitivity analysis carried out to scale the impact of different parameters in determining the size of the epidemic threshold of R 0 . It reveals that unidentified symptomatic cases result in an underestimation of R 0 whereas, diagnosis based on new contact made by confirmed cases can gradually reduce the size of R 0 and hence helps to mitigate the ongoing disease. An optimal control problem is framed using a control variable u ( t ) , projecting the effectiveness of diagnosis based on traced contacts made by a confirmed COVID patient. It is noticed that optimal contact tracing effort reduces R 0 effectively over time.","Kumar Das, Dhiraj; Khatua, Anupam; Kar, T K; Jana, Soovoojeet",Appl Math Comput,302,24

While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases. Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries. Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to ""unlock"" or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. ""Precision physical distancing""-distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings-is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19. It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures.

However, to improve affinity and efficacy of antibodies, many somatic hypermutations could be introduced during affinity maturation, which cause several issues including safety and efficacy and limit their application in clinic. Here, we propose a special class of human mAbs with limited level of somatic mutations, referred to as germline-like mAbs. Remarkably, germline-like mAbs could have high affinity and potent neutralizing activity in vitro and in various animal models, despite lacking of extensive affinity maturation. Furthermore, the germline nature of these mAbs implies that they exhibit lower immunogenicity and can be elicited relatively fast in vivo compared with highly somatically mutated antibodies. In this review, we summarize germline-like mAbs with strong therapeutic and protection activity against various viruses that caused large-scale outbreaks in the last decade, including influenza virus H7N9, Zika virus, Dengue virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We also illustrate underlying molecular mechanisms of these germline-like antibodies against viral infections from the structural and genetic perspective, thus providing insight into further development as therapeutic agents for the treatment of infectious diseases and implication for rational design of effective vaccines.","Zhu, X.; Yu, F.; Wu, Y.; Ying, T.",Antibody Therapeutics,302,1

In the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the bariatric surgeons' community faced many concerns and challenges, especially in light of a decree issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 22nd, to ban all elective surgery in public hospitals. The aim of this study is to portray the practices and attitudes of Israeli bariatric surgeons in the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS: Anonymous web-based questionnaire sent to all active bariatric surgeons in Israel. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software package. RESULTS: 53 out of 63 (84%) active surgeons responded to the survey. 18% practice in the public sector only, 4% in the private sector only and 78% in both sectors. 76% practice BS for more than 10 years and 68% perform more than 100 procedures a year. Almost all the surgeons (98%) experienced a tremendous decrease in operations. Nevertheless, there were substantial differences by sectors. In the public sector, 86% of the surgeons ceased to operate while 14% did not comply with the government's decree. In the public sector 69% of the surgeons were instructed by the administrators to stop operating. The majority of surgeons who continued to operate (77%) changed nothing in the indications or contra-indications for surgery. Among the surgeons who opted to refrain from operating on special sub-groups, the most frequent reasons were pulmonary disease (82%), age above 60 (64%), Ischemic heart disease (55%) and living in heavily affected communities. Roughly only half (57%) of the surgeons implemented changes in informed consent and operating room (OR) measures, contrary to guidelines and recommendations by leading professional societies. When asked about future conditions for reestablishing elective procedures, the reply frequencies were as follows: no special measures - 40%; PCR negativity - 27%; IgG positivity - 15%; waiting until the end of the pandemic- 9%. CONCLUSIONS: We showed in this nation-wide survey that the variance between surgeons, regarding present and future reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, is high. There were substantial differences between the private and the public sectors. Although the instructions given by the MOH for the public sector were quite clear, the compliance by surgeons and administrators was far from complete. The administrators in the public sector, but more so in the private sector were ambiguous in instructing staff, leading surgeons to a more ""personal non-structured"" practice in the first phase of the pandemic. These facts must be considered by regulators, administrators and surgeons when planning for reestablishing elective BS or in case a second wave of the pandemic is on its way.","Beglaibter, Nahum; Zelekha, Orly; Keinan-Boker, Lital; Sakran, Nasser; Mahajna, Ahmad",Isr J Health Policy Res,302,16

Regarding the SIR model, the termination time of the outbreak should have been in early June 2020. However, several peaks invalidate the results of single-peak models. Therefore, we should present a model to support pandemics with several extrema. In this paper, we presented the generalized logistic growth model (GLM) to estimate sub-epidemic waves of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Therefore, the presented model simulated scenarios of two, three, and four waves in the observed incidence. In the second part of the paper, we assessed travel-related risk in inter-provincial travels in Iran. Moreover, the results of travel-related risk show that typical travel between Tehran and other sites exposed Isfahan, Gilan, Mazandaran, and West Azerbaijan in the higher risk of infection greater than 100 people per day.

In total, 337 participants completed four self-report questionnaires: selected subscales of the World Health Organisation's COVID-19 Behavioural Insights Tool, UCLA Loneliness Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Beck Hopelessness Scale. In addition to descriptive statistics and intercorrelations, structural equation modelling was used to compare three models of the potential role (predictor or moderator/mediator) that the three abovementioned COVID-19-related variables could play in psychological wellbeing. The results showed high levels of psychological distress among the current sample. Generally, better knowledge of COVID-19 and engaging in protective behaviours were found to be related to lower levels of psychological distress, whereas increased risk perception was found to be associated with increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. It was also found that behaviour mediated the effect of knowledge on psychological wellbeing, suggesting that while publicising information about COVID-19 remains necessary, providing the public with a means to engage in protective behaviours is central for promoting psychological wellbeing.","Padmanabhanunni, Anita; Pretorius, Tyrone",Psychol Rep,302,16

SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from humans to other animals, including tigers, cats, and mink. Consequently, infected people who work directly with bats could transfer the virus to a wild North American bat, resulting in a new natural reservoir for the virus, and lead to new outbreaks of human disease. We evaluated a reverse-transcription real-time PCR panel for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in bat guano. We found the panel to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, and able to detect the virus in bat guano samples spiked with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Our panel could be utilized by wildlife agencies to test bats in rehabilitation facilities prior to their release to the wild, minimizing the risk of spreading this virus to wild bat populations.","Anis, Eman; Turner, Greg; Ellis, Julie C; Di Salvo, Andrew; Barnard, Amanda; Carroll, Susan; Murphy, Lisa",J Vet Diagn Invest,302,16

Because in FH patients the level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is elevated from birth and it correlates with the degree of systemic endothelial dysfunction, both heterozygous FH (HeFH) patients and, in particular, homozygous FH (HoFH) patients have a dysfunctional endothelium prone to further damage by the direct viral attack and the hyper-inflammatory reaction typical of severe COVID-19. Evidence to date shows the benefit of statin use in patients with COVID-19. In FH patients, the focus should therefore be on the effective lowering of LDL-C levels, the root cause of the expected excess vulnerability to COVID-19 infection in these patients. Moreover, the ongoing use of statins and other lipid-lowering therapies should be encouraged during the COVID pandemic to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19. For the reduction of the excess risk in FH patients with COVID-19, we advocate stringent adherence to the guideline determined LDL-C levels for FH patients, or maybe even to lower levels. Unfortunately, epidemiologic data are lacking on the severity of COVID-19 infections, as well as the number of acute cardiac events that have occurred in FH subjects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such data need to be urgently gathered to learn how much the risk for, and the severity of COVID-19 in FH are increased.","Vuorio, Alpo; Raal, Frederick; Kaste, Markku; Kovanen, Petri T",Atherosclerosis,302,30

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the predictive properties of common community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) severity scores and COVID-19 specific indices. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a teaching hospital between 18 March-20 May 2020 were included. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics related to severity and mortality were measured and CURB-65, PSI, A-DROP, CALL, and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated as defined previously in the literature. Progression to severe disease and in-hospital/overall mortality during the follow-up of the patients were determined from electronic records. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard regression model was used. The discrimination capability of pneumonia severity indices was evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-eight patients were included in the study. Sixty-two patients (20.8%) presented with severe COVID-19 while thirty-one (10.4%) developed severe COVID-19 at any time from the admission. In-hospital mortality was 39 (13.1%) while the overall mortality was 44 (14.8%). The mortality in low-risk groups that were identified to manage outside the hospital was 0 in CALL Class A, 1.67% in PSI low risk, and 2.68% in CURB-65 low-risk. However, the AUCs for the mortality prediction in COVID-19 were 0.875, 0.873, 0.859, 0.855, and 0.828 for A-DROP, PSI, CURB-65, COVID-GRAM, and CALL scores respectively. The AUCs for the prediction of progression to severe disease was 0.739, 0.711, 0,697, 0.673, and 0.668 for CURB-65, CALL, PSI, COVID-GRAM, A-DROP respectively. The hazard ratios (HR) for the tested pneumonia severity indices demonstrated that A-DROP and CURB-65 scores had the strongest association with mortality, and PSI, and COVID-GRAM scores predicted mortality independent from age and comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) scores can predict in COVID-19. The indices proposed specifically to COVID-19 work less than nonspecific scoring systems surprisingly. The CALL score may be used to decide outpatient management in COVID-19.","Ucan, E S; Ozgen Alpaydin, A; Ozuygur, S S; Ercan, S; Unal, B; Sayiner, A A; Ergan, B; Gokmen, N; Savran, Y; Kilinc, O; Avkan Oguz, V",Respir Med Res,302,16

Smaller formats of antibodies have been developed to throw such restrictions. These small format antibodies include antigen binding fragments, single-chain variable fragments, single variable domain of camelid antibody (so-called nanobody (Nb) or VHH). Since their serendipitous discovery, nanobodies have been studies at length in the fields of research, diagnostics and therapy. These antigen binding fragments, originating from Camelid heavy-chain antibodies, possess unusual hallmarks in terms of (small) size, stability, solubility and specificity, hence allowing cost-effective production and sometimes out performing monoclonal antibodies. In addition, these small Camelid heavy-chain antibodies are highly adaptable tools for cancer research as they enable specific modulation of targets, enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins alike. Molecular imaging studies benefit from the rapid, homogeneous tumor accumulation of nanobodies and their fast blood clearance, permitting previously unattainable fast tumor visualization. Moreover, they are endowed with considerable therapeutic potential as inhibitors of receptor-ligand pairs and deliverers of drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles towards tumors. In this review, we shed light on the current status of nanobodies in diagnosis and imaging of tumor and exploiting nanobodies revert immunosuppressive events, modulation of immune checkpoints, and as deliverers of drugs for targeted tumor therapy.","Al-Baradie, Raid Saleem",Hum. antibodies,302,7

PoC-AgTs have therefore been included in national testing strategies with additional quality requirements to address limitations in specificity and sensitivity. Information given in the package inserts of the test providers should enable the user to evaluate the performance of a PoC-AgT in advance. The quality of this information has been independently assessed since the Corona Test Ordinance came into force in Germany in October 2020. The completeness of analytical and diagnostic performance specifications was assessed for all package inserts publicly available via the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). It was ascertained whether the minimum criteria, recommendations, and extended criteria of the PEI were comprehensibly fulfilled. The number of tests removed from the list by March 2021 was determined. By the closing date of the survey (17.11.2020), the PEI had listed 165 PoC-AgTs that formally fulfilled the minimum criteria and were thus reimbursed. A total of 78 identical systems were identified. Almost all providers were found to have gaps in the information on the validation results of their tests, meaning that an evaluation of performance is only possible to a limited extent. Until March 2021, 25 non-identical PoC-AgTs have been removed from the list. Many PoC-AgTs could not be comprehensively evaluated based on the information provided by the provider. Users are therefore dependent on provider-independent sources of information. © 2021 Mustafa Özcürümez et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","Özcürümez, M.; Katsounas, A.; Holdenrieder, S.; Von Meyer, A.; Renz, H.; Wölfel, R.",Journal of Laboratory Medicine,302,21

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in various environmental media, which speeds up the pace of the virus becoming a global biological pollutant. Because many engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are capable of inducing anti-microbial activity, ENMs provide excellent solutions to overcome the virus pandemic, for instance by application as protective coatings, biosensors, or nano-agents. To tackle some mechanistic issues related to the impact of ENMs on SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the molecular interactions between carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and a SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment (i.e., a model molecule of frameshift stimulation element from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome) using molecular mechanics simulations. The interaction affinity between the CNPs and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment increased in the order of fullerenes < graphenes < carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, we developed quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to describe the interactions of 17 different types of CNPs from three dimensions with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment. The QSAR models on the interaction energies of CNPs with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment show high goodness-of-fit and robustness. Molecular weight, surface area, and the sum of degrees of every carbon atom were found to be the primary structural descriptors of CNPs determining the interactions. Our research not only offers a theoretical insight into the adsorption/separation and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, but also allows to design novel ENMs which act efficiently on the genetic material RNA of SARS-CoV-2. This contributes to minimizing the challenge of time-consuming and labor-intensive virus experiments under high risk of infection, whilst meeting our precautionary demand for options to handle any new versions of the coronavirus that might emerge in the future.","Zhang, Fan; Wang, Zhuang; Vijver, Martina G; Peijnenburg, Willie J G M",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,302,21

RESULTS: From June 4 through June 22, 2020, 511 pharmacy trainees in 46 states completed the survey. Participants' median age was 26 (interquartile range [IQR], 25-28) years, with included responses from postgraduate year 1 residents (54% of sample), postgraduate year 2 residents (40%), and postgraduate fellows (6%). Compared to experiences prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer trainees conducted direct patient care (38.5% vs 91.4%, P < 0.001), more worked from home (31.7% vs 1.6%, P < 0.001), and less time was spent with preceptors per day (2 [IQR, 2-6] hours vs 4 [IQR, 1-4] hours, P < 0.001).

For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of COVID-19.

Recent works approached this task with innovative weakly-supervised algorithms such as multi-instance learning (MIL) and class activation maps (CAM), however, these methods often yield inaccurate or incomplete regions. One of the reasons is the neglection of the pathological implications hidden in the relationship across anatomical regions within each image and the relationship across images. In this paper, we argue that the cross-region and cross-image relationship, as contextual and compensating information, is vital to obtain more consistent and integral regions. To model the relationship, we propose the Graph Regularized Embedding Network (GREN), which leverages the intra-image and inter-image information to locate diseases on chest X-ray images. GREN uses a pre-trained U-Net to segment the lung lobes, and then models the intra-image relationship between the lung lobes using an intra-image graph to compare different regions. Meanwhile, the relationship between in-batch images is modeled by an inter-image graph to compare multiple images. This process mimics the training and decision-making process of a radiologist: comparing multiple regions and images for diagnosis. In order for the deep embedding layers of the neural network to retain structural information (important in the localization task), we use the Hash coding and Hamming distance to compute the graphs, which are used as regularizers to facilitate training. By means of this, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art result on NIH chest X-ray dataset for weakly-supervised disease localization. Our codes are accessible online.","Qi, Baolian; Zhao, Gangming; Wei, Xin; Fang, Chaowei; Pan, Chengwei; Li, Jinpeng; He, Huiguang; Jiao, Licheng",,302,31

The aim of this study is to delineate the prognostic importance of presence of concomitant cardiac injury on admission in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: For this multi-center retrospective study, data of consecutive patients who were treated for COVID-19 between 20 March and 20 April 2020 were collected. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and outcomes data were obtained from electronic medical records. In-hospital clinical outcome was compared between patients with and without cardiac injury. RESULTS: A total of 607 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the study; the median age was 62.5 ± 14.3 years, and 334 (55%) were male. Cardiac injury was detected in 150 (24.7%) of patients included in the study. Mortality rate was higher in patients with cardiac injury (42% vs. 8%; P < 0.01). The frequency of patients who required ICU (72% vs. 19%), who developed acute kidney injury (14% vs. 1%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (71%vs. 18%) were also higher in patients with cardiac injury. In multivariate analysis, age, coronary artery disease (CAD), elevated CRP levels, and presence of cardiac injury [odds ratio (OR) 10.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42-46.27; P < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of mortality. In subgroup analysis, including patients free of history of CAD, presence of cardiac injury on admission also predicted mortality (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.17-5.45; P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Cardiac injury on admission is associated with worse clinical outcome and higher mortality risk in COVID-19 patients including patients free of previous CAD diagnosis.","Barman, Hasan Ali; Atici, Adem; Sahin, Irfan; Alici, Gokhan; Aktas Tekin, Esra; Baycan, Ömer Faruk; Ozturk, Fatih; Oflar, Ersan; Tugrul, Sevil; Yavuz, Mustafa Baran; Celik, Fatma Betul; Oktay, Aysu; Vahaboglu, Haluk; Adas, Mine; Turgut, Namigar; Okuyan, Ertugrul; Yildirmak, Mustafa Taner; Gungor, Baris",Coron. artery dis,302,6

No phase of AHC efforts is untouched by the crisis, and medical schools, prioritizing learner welfare, are in the throes of adjusting to suspended clinical activities and virtual classrooms. While health professions students are currently limited in their contributions to direct clinical care, they remain the same smart, innovative, and motivated individuals who chose a career in health care and who are passionate about contributing to the needs of people in troubled times. The groundwork for operationalizing their commitment has already been established through the identification of value-added, participatory roles that support learning and professional development in health systems science (HSS) and clinical skills. This pandemic, with rapidly expanding workforce and patient care needs, has prompted a new look at how students can contribute. At the Penn State College of Medicine, staff and student leaders formed the COVID-19 Response Team to prioritize and align student work with health system needs. Starting in mid-March 2020, the authors used qualitative methods and content analysis of data collated from several sources to identify 4 categories for student contributions: the community, the health care delivery system, the workforce, and the medical school. The authors describe a nimble coproduction process that brings together all stakeholders to facilitate work. The learning agenda for these roles maps to HSS competencies, an evolving requirement for all students. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to harness the capability of students to improve health.Other AHCs may find this operational framework useful both during the COVID-19 pandemic and as a blueprint for responding to future challenges that disrupt systems of education and health care in the United States.","Long, Nathaniel; Wolpaw, Daniel R; Boothe, David; Caldwell, Catherine; Dillon, Peter; Gottshall, Lauren; Koetter, Paige; Pooshpas, Pardis; Wolpaw, Terry; Gonzalo, Jed D",Acad Med,302,1

The aims of this study were to assess the impact of repeated blood samplings on patients' anaemic state using standard-volume tubes, in comparison with the hypothetical use of low-volume tubes and to evaluate the transfusion policy adopted. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Transfusion data of mechanically ventilated non-bleeding patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalized in ICU for a minimum of 20 days were recorded. The total volume of blood drawn for samplings with standard-volume tubes and the corresponding red blood cell mass (RBCM) removed during hospitalization for each patient were calculated and compared with the hypothetical use of low-volume tubes. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Ten patients were anaemic at ICU admission (41.7 %). Overall, 6658 sampling tubes were employed, for a total of 16,786 mL of blood. The median RBCM subtracted by blood samplings per patient accounted for about one third of the total patients' RBCM decrease until discharge. The use of low-volume tubes would have led to a median saving of about one third of the drawn RBCM. Eleven patients were transfused (45.8 %) at a mean Hb value of 7.7 (± 0.5) g/dL. CONCLUSION: The amount of blood drawn for sampling has a significant role in the development of anaemia and the use of low-volume tubes could minimize the problem. Large high-powered studies are warranted to assess the more appropriate transfusion thresholds in non-bleeding critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease.","Beverina, Ivo; Borotto, Erika; Novelli, Chiara; Radrizzani, Danilo; Brando, Bruno",Transfus Apher Sci,302,24

Tissue and cellular tropism is one key to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We investigate the expression and subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), within the upper (nasal) and lower (pulmonary) respiratory tracts of human donors using a diverse panel of banked tissues. Here, we report our discovery that the ACE2 receptor protein robustly localizes within the motile cilia of airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during host respiratory transmission. We further determine whether ciliary ACE2 expression in the upper airway is influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, or medication use, and show the first mechanistic evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) does not increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection through enhancing the expression of ciliary ACE2 receptor. These findings are crucial to our understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for prevention and control of this virulent pathogen.","Lee, Ivan T; Nakayama, Tsuguhisa; Wu, Chien-Ting; Goltsev, Yury; Jiang, Sizun; Gall, Phillip A; Liao, Chun-Kang; Shih, Liang-Chun; Schürch, Christian M; McIlwain, David R; Chu, Pauline; Borchard, Nicole A; Zarabanda, David; Dholakia, Sachi S; Yang, Angela; Kim, Dayoung; Chen, Han; Kanie, Tomoharu; Lin, Chia-Der; Tsai, Ming-Hsui; Phillips, Katie M; Kim, Raymond; Overdevest, Jonathan B; Tyler, Matthew A; Yan, Carol H; Lin, Chih-Feng; Lin, Yi-Tsen; Bau, Da-Tian; Tsay, Gregory J; Patel, Zara M; Tsou, Yung-An; Tzankov, Alexandar; Matter, Matthias S; Tai, Chih-Jaan; Yeh, Te-Huei; Hwang, Peter H; Nolan, Garry P; Nayak, Jayakar V; Jackson, Peter K",Nat Commun,302,22

As person-to-person transmission is airborne, crowded closed spaces have high potential for rapid virus spread, especially early in the pandemic when social distancing and mask wearing were not mandatory. This retrospective study thoroughly investigates a small-scale SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Israel's central virology laboratory (ICVL) in mid-March 2020, in which six staff members and two related family members were infected. Suspicions regarding infection by contaminated surfaces in ICVL facilities were nullified by SARS-CoV-2 negative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of work surfaces swipe tests. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced and mutation analyses showed inclusion of all samples to clades 20B and 20C, possessing the spike mutation D614G. Phylogenetic analysis clarified transmission events, confirming S1 as having infected at least three other staff members and refuting the association of a staff member's infected spouse with the ICVL transmission cluster. Finally, serology tests exhibited IgG and IgA antibodies in all infected individuals and revealed the occurrence of asymptomatic infections in additional staff members. This study demonstrates the advantages of molecular epidemiology in elucidating transmission events and exemplifies the importance of good laboratory practice, distancing and mask wearing in preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, specifically in healthcare facilities.","Zuckerman, Neta S; Pando, Rakefet; Bucris, Efrat; Drori, Yaron; Lustig, Yaniv; Erster, Oran; Mor, Orna; Mendelson, Ella; Mandelboim, Michal",Viruses,302,5

Here we report a case of cold agglutinin disease (CAD), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and pulmonary embolism as a presentation of COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old African-American woman presented to the emergency room with fever and shortness of breath. She was tachycardic, febrile, and had an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.1 g/dL, D-dimer 4.55 µg/mL, and C-reactive protein 12.3 mg/dL. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed acute pulmonary embolism involving the bilateral lower lobe segmental branches. Her influenza test was negative, but her SARS-CoV-2 test returned positive. Due to severe anemia, she was not started on any anticoagulation. Haptoglobin was low. Direct antiglobulin test returned positive for anticomplement and negative for anti-immunoglobulin G. Cold agglutinin titer was 80. Mycoplasma, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus, human immunodeficiency viruses, and acute hepatitis screen were negative. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography showed a normal liver and spleen without lymphadenopathy. Peripheral blood smear showed red blood cell agglutination. On Day 2, she became hypoxic requiring 6 L oxygen. Since her Hb remained stable, she was started on low-intensity unfractionated heparin.

Unemployment is associated with increased risk of CVD, and so there is concern that the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the CVD burden. AIMS: This modeling study aimed to quantify potential health loss, health cost burden and health inequities among people with CVD due to additional unemployment caused by COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruption in one high-income country: New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: We adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD in the national NZ population. We modeled indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) for various scenarios of pandemic-related unemployment projections from the NZ Treasury. RESULTS: We estimated the potential CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 health-adjusted life years (HALYs) for the different unemployment scenarios. Health inequities would be increased with the per capita health loss for Maori (Indigenous population) estimated to be 3.7 times greater than for non-Maori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people). The estimated additional health system costs ranged between (NZ$303 million [m] to 503m in 2019 values; or US$209m to 346m). CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic could cause significant health loss, increase health inequities from CVD, and impose additional health system costs in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including additional job creation programs and measures directed towards the primary prevention of CVD.","Nghiem, Nhung; Wilson, Nick",PLoS One,302,21

Since 2005, TSWV emerged as an economically important virus of processing tomatoes in the Central Valley of California, in part due to increased populations of the primary thrips vector, western flower thrips (WFT; Frankliniella occidentalis). To develop an understanding of the epidemiology of TSWV in this region, population densities of WFT and incidence of TSWV were monitored in California's processing tomato transplant-producing greenhouses and associated open fields from 2007 to 2013. Thrips were monitored with yellow sticky cards and in tomato flowers, whereas TSWV incidence was assessed with indicator plants and field surveys for virus symptoms. All thrips identified from processing tomato fields were WFT, and females were three-fold more abundant on sticky cards than males. Symptoms of TSWV infection were observed in all monitored processing tomato fields. Incidences of TSWV ranged from 1 to 20%, with highest incidence found in late-planted fields. There was no single primary inoculum source, and inoculum sources for thrips/TSWV varied depending on the production region. These results allowed us to develop a model for TSWV infection of processing tomatoes in the Central Valley of California. The model predicts that low levels of primary TSWV inoculum are amplified in early-planted tomatoes and other susceptible crops leading to highest levels of infection in later-planted fields, especially those with high thrips populations. Based upon these findings, an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for TSWV in processing tomatoes in California was devised. This IPM strategy focuses on strategic field placement (identification of high-risk situations), planting TSWV- and thrips-free transplants, planting resistant varieties, monitoring for TSWV symptoms and thrips, roguing infected plants, thrips management targeting early generations, extensive sanitation after harvest, and strategic cropping to avoid overlap with winter bridge crops.","Batuman, Ozgur; Turini, Thomas A; LeStrange, Michelle; Stoddard, Scott; Miyao, Gene; Aegerter, Brenna J; Chen, Li-Fang; McRoberts, Neil; Ullman, Diane E; Gilbertson, Robert L",,302,5

The overall positive rate was 18/516 (3.5%), 16/18 (89%) had antibodies against SARS-COV-2, another 2 reported previous positive RT-PCR results although antibody testing was negative. Of those positive, 7/18 (39%) were unaware of their infection.

Many COVID-19 contraction experiments require comprehensive clinical procedures at medical facilities. Clinical studies help to make a correct diagnosis of COVID-19, where the disease has already spread to the organs in most cases. Prompt and early diagnosis is indispensable for providing patients with the possibility of early clinical diagnosis and slowing down the disease spread. Therefore, clinical investigations in patients with COVID-19 have revealed distinct patterns of breathing relative to other diseases such as flu and cold, which are worth investigating. Current supervised Machine Learning (ML) based techniques mostly investigate clinical reports such as X-Rays and Computerized Tomography (CT) for disease detection. This strategy relies on a larger clinical dataset and does not focus on early symptom identification. Towards this end, an innovative hybrid unsupervised ML technique is introduced to uncover the probability of COVID-19 occurrence based on the breathing patterns and commonly reported symptoms, fever, and cough. Specifically, various metrics, including body temperature, breathing and cough patterns, and physical activity, were considered in this study. Finally, a lightweight ML algorithm based on the K-Means and Isolation Forest technique was implemented on relatively small data including 40 individuals.

The first lockdown modified daily living and could have led to a decrease in the frequency of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the present study, we compared the frequency and severity of severe TBI before and during the first containment in Normandy. METHODS: We included all patients admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe TBI in the two tertiary neurosurgical trauma centres of Normandy during the first lockdown. The year before the containment served as control. The primary outcome was the number of patients admitted per week in ICU. We compared the demographic characteristics, TBI mechanisms, CT scan, surgical procedure, and mortality rate. RESULTS: The incidence of admissions for severe TBI in Normandy decreased by 33% during the containment. The aetiology of TBI significantly changed during the containment: there were less traffic road accidents and more TBI related to alcohol consumption. Patients with severe TBI during the containment had a better prognosis according to the impact score (p=0.04). We observed a significant decrease in the rate of short-term mortality related to severe TBI during the period of lockdown (p=0.02).

The aim of this study was to identify the predictors for clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 who did not show clinical deterioration upon hospital admission. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital between 23 January and 21 March 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities and treatments were all collected. The study endpoint was clinical deterioration within 20 days from hospital admission. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with clinical deterioration. RESULTS: A total of 49 (19%) patients showed clinical deterioration after admission. Compared with patients that did not experience clinical deterioration, clinically deteriorated patients had more dyspnea, cough and myalgia (65.3% versus 29.3%) symptoms and more had comorbidities (89.8% versus 36.1%). Clinical and laboratory characteristics at admission that were associated with clinical deterioration included senior age, diabetes, hypertension, myalgia, higher temperature, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, activated partial thromboplastin time, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, direct bilirubin, plasma creatinine, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, decreased albumin and bicarbonate concentration. Medical history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and metformin were also risk factors. CONCLUSION: The four best predictors for clinical deterioration were CRP, procalcitonin, age and albumin. A ""best"" multivariable prediction model, resulting from using a variable selection procedure, included senior age, presentation with myalgia, and higher level of CRP and serum creatinine (bias-corrected c-statistic = 0.909).

The increased burden of serious health-related suffering can impact the well-being of health-care workers, patients, and their families alike. The elderly, the frail, the vulnerable, and those with multiple comorbidities are disproportionately affected. Palliative care, with its comprehensive and inclusive approach, has much to offer in terms of alleviating the suffering, particularly those caused by the distressing physical and psycho-socio-spiritual symptoms, the complex medical decision-making, end-of-life care issues, and grief and bereavement, and needs to be integrated into the pathway of care provision in COVID-19. Psychosocial issues contribute to and amplify suffering and are often underestimated and undertreated and not accessible to many. Empowering frontline professionals in the core concepts of psychosocial support and palliative care thus becomes an absolute necessity. This quick review was done by a group of palliative care physicians and mental health experts from India to develop recommendations for physical and psychosocial care in the context of COVID-19.

AIM: The aim of the study was to conduct a preliminary analysis of the effects of a break in implementing rehabilitation programs in patients with Alzheimer's disease with symptoms of dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis included data obtained from qualification tests of 19 patients (14 women, 5 men) aged 76 to 91 years (mean 81.2 +/- 9.9 years) qualified in 2021 to return to groups at the Alzheimer Center in Warsaw. The obtained results of the performed Katz, Lawton tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were compared with the results from 2020. RESULTS: The initial assessment showed a deterioration of the general and mental condition of patients qualified for the planned activities. The Katz test for the assessment of basic activities of everyday life did not reveal any significant changes in relation to the results obtained one year ago, while the Lawton test for the assessment of complex activities of daily life showed that 13 (68%) of the subjects significantly deteriorated compared to the previous year's study. On the other hand, in the MMSE, deterioration was noted in 12 (63%) analyzed compared to their state from a year ago.

Additional information is needed to determine mental health status among school-aged children and adolescents during this public health crisis and the risk factors associated with psychological distress during the pandemic. Objective: To assess self-reported psychological distress among school-aged children and adolescents associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study using data from a survey on the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents in Guangdong province, China, conducted by using a stratified cluster random sampling method between March 8 to 30, 2020. To estimate outcomes associated with location of districts, only data from students with internet protocol addresses and current addresses in Guangdong were included. Data were analyzed from April 5 to July 20, 2020. Exposure: Home-based distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcome and Measures: The main outcome was self-reported psychological distress, measured using the total score on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire of 3 or greater. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors associated with mental health status. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to analyze the associations of factors with psychological distress. Results: Among 1â¯310â¯600 students who completed the survey, 1â¯199â¯320 students (mean [SD] age, 12.04 [3.01] years; 619â¯144 [51.6%] boys) were included in the final analysis. A total of 126â¯355 students (10.5%) self-reported psychological distress. Compared with students in primary school, high school students had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15-1.23]). Compared with students who wore a face mask frequently, students who never wore a face mask had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 2.41-2.79]). Additionally, students who spent less than 0.5 hours exercising had increased odds of self-reported psychological distress compared with students who spent more than 1 hour exercising (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.61-1.67]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress among students during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively high. Frequency of wearing a face mask and time spent exercising were factors associated with mental health. Therefore, it may be necessary for governments, schools, and families to pay attention to the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and take corresponding countermeasures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' mental health.","Qin, Zuguo; Shi, Lei; Xue, Yaqing; Lin, Huang; Zhang, Jinchan; Liang, Pengyan; Lu, Zhiwei; Wu, Mengxiong; Chen, Yaguang; Zheng, Xiao; Qian, Yi; Ouyang, Ping; Zhang, Ruibin; Yi, Xuefeng; Zhang, Chichen",JAMA Netw Open,302,21

We are not only in a ""pandemic"" but also an ""infodemic"". Health literacy is more important than ever in the face of these global health threats, which have impacted outcomes across the levels of the socio-ecological model (SEM), including individual health behaviors, family relationships, organizational behavior, state policy-making, national mortality statistics, and the international economy in the span of weeks. Our special issue sought to pull together interdisciplinary threads guided by two principles. The first was defining health literacy as essential skills and situational resources needed for people to find, understand, evaluate, communicate, and use information and services in a variety of forms across various settings throughout their life course to promote health and wellbeing. The second was the idea that enhancing health literacy in populations and systems is critical to achieving health equity. In this time of public health need across traditional borders, the inter-sectoral and international perspectives of special issue articles are more urgent than ever. A greater understanding, appreciation, and application of health literacy can support policy action on multiple levels to address major public health challenges. Health literacy should be built deliberately as a population-level resource and community asset. We have summarized the set of articles in this special issue across the levels of the SEM, hoping their thoughtful considerations and interesting findings will help to support global health and wellness and inspire future research, policy, and practice in this global public health emergency and beyond.","Sentell, Tetine; Vamos, Sandra; Okan, Orkan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),302,1

With multiple vaccines having now received regulatory approval, public health efforts to promote widespread vaccine dissemination are currently underway. There has been particular emphasis placed on vaccination of older populations, the age group in which COVID-19 infection has been most lethal. However, such widespread vaccination approaches have necessarily raised important questions related to potential interactions with underlying diseases and concomitant treatments among persons to be vaccinated. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition marked by reduced bone strength and an associated increased risk for fracture that generally requires sustained medical intervention(s). Osteoporosis is neither associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection nor by more pronounced disease severity following infection, such that individuals with osteoporosis need not be more highly prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. Osteoporosis therapies do not interfere with the efficacy or side effect profiles of COVID-19 vaccines and should not be stopped or indefinitely delayed because of vaccination. Depending on the specific drug profile within an anti-osteoporosis medication category, minor adjustments to the timing of drug administration may be considered with respect to the patient's COVID-19 vaccination schedule.

In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. METHODS: Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets' sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. RESULTS: We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.","Crocamo, Cristina; Viviani, Marco; Famiglini, Lorenzo; Bartoli, Francesco; Pasi, Gabriella; Carrà, Giuseppe",Eur Psychiatry,302,16

It is important to understand patient health-related behaviors and perceptions to guide public health vaccination strategies. OBJECTIVES: To examine perceptions of COVID-19 and vaccination beliefs, and identify predictors of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the US. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey guided by the Health Belief Model was conducted using a web-based Qualtrics survey panel of US adults. The main outcome was the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Additional measures included: demographics, perceptions of COVID-19 severity, risk and susceptibility, views of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, virus and vaccine information sources, vaccine beliefs and behaviors, and seasonal flu vaccine history. RESULTS: A total of 1047 complete responses were included. Females had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than males (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.80). Those with a two-year degree/some college had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those with a high school degree/GED (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36-0.97).

Excessive cytokine release and activation of coagulation appear to be key drivers of COVID-19 pneumonia and associated mortality. Contact activation has been linked to pathologic upregulation of both inflammatory mediators and coagulation and accumulating preclinical and clinical data suggest it to be a rational therapeutic target in COVID-19 patients. Pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between coagulation factors XI and XII has been shown to prevent consumptive coagulopathy, pathologic systemic inflammatory response, and mortality in at least 2 types of experimental sepsis. Importantly, inhibition of contact activation also prevented death from S. aureus-induced lethal systemic inflammatory response syndrome in nonhuman primates. The contact system is likely dispensable for hemostasis, and may not be needed for host immunity, suggesting it to be a reasonably safe target that will not result in immunosuppression or bleeding. As a few drugs targeting contact activation are already in clinical development, immediate clinical trials for their use in COVID-19 patients are potentially feasible for the prevention or treatment of respiratory distress.","Shatzel, J.

Although Canada did start with some structural disadvantages relative to Israel including less centralized and coherent emergency planning and a more complex demographic geography, there are, nonetheless, some important policy lessons Canada can draw from Israel. These include a more strategic use of national leadership in the vaccination campaign and the greater use of primary care resources and providers.","Marchildon, Gregory P",Isr J Health Policy Res,302,1

This type of heart failure is more common in older people with a history of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Patients with HFpEF are often managed in primary care, sometimes in collaboration with specialists. Knowledge about how best to manage this growing population is limited, and there is a pressing need to improve care for these patients. AIM: To explore clinicians' and patients'/carers' perspectives and experiences about the management of HFpEF to inform the development of an improved model of care. DESIGN AND SETTING: A multiperspective qualitative study involving primary and secondary care settings across the east of England, Greater Manchester, and the West Midlands. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted. Transcribed data were analysed using framework analysis and informed by the normalisation process theory (NPT). RESULTS: In total, 50 patients, nine carers/relatives, and 73 clinicians were recruited. Difficulties with diagnosis, unclear illness perceptions, and management disparity were identified as important factors that may influence management of HFpEF. The NPT construct of coherence reflected what participants expressed about the need to improve the identification, understanding, and awareness of this condition in order to improve care. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need to raise the public and clinical profile of HFpEF, develop a clear set of accepted practices concerning its management, and ensure that systems of care are accessible and attuned to the needs of patients with this condition.","Sowden, Emma; Hossain, Muhammad; Chew-Graham, Carolyn; Blakeman, Tom; Tierney, Stephanie; Wellwood, Ian; Rosa, Francesca; Deaton, Christi",Br.j.gen.pract,302,24

Here, we reflect on the immediate responses of most world powers amid the pandemic chaos: totalitarian surveillance and nationalist isolation. Drawing on published literature, we consider measures such as wildlife-use bans, lockdowns and travel restrictions, along with their reverberations for people, economies and the planet. Our synthesis highlights significant shortfalls of applying command-and-control tactics in emergencies. For one, heavy-handed bans risk enormous unintended consequences and tend to fail if they lack legitimacy or clash with people's values. Furthermore, reactive and myopic strategies typically view the pandemic as a stand-alone crisis, rather than unravelling the complex interplay of nature-society interactions through which zoonotic diseases originate. A return to adaptive management approaches that recognise root causes and foster socio-ecological resilience will be essential to improve human and planetary health and mitigate future pandemics.","Cawthorn, Donna-Mareè; Kennaugh, Alexandra; Ferreira, Sam M",Ambio,302,29

While much research focuses on the epidemiological and virological aspects of COVID-19 transmission, there remains an important gap in knowledge regarding the drivers of geographical diffusion between places, in particular at the global scale. Here, we use quantile regression to model the roles of globalisation, human settlement and population characteristics as socio-spatial determinants of reported COVID-19 diffusion over a six-week period in March and April 2020. Our exploratory analysis is based on reported COVID-19 data published by Johns Hopkins University which, despite its limitations, serves as the best repository of reported COVID-19 cases across nations. RESULTS: The quantile regression model suggests that globalisation, settlement, and population characteristics related to high human mobility and interaction predict reported disease diffusion. Human development level (HDI) and total population predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a high number of total reported cases (per million) whereas larger household size, older populations, and globalisation tied to human interaction predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a low number of total reported cases (per million). Population density, and population characteristics such as total population, older populations, and household size are strong predictors in early weeks but have a muted impact over time on reported COVID-19 diffusion. In contrast, the impacts of interpersonal and trade globalisation are enhanced over time, indicating that human mobility may best explain sustained disease diffusion. CONCLUSIONS: Model results confirm that globalisation, settlement and population characteristics, and variables tied to high human mobility lead to greater reported disease diffusion. These outcomes serve to inform suppression strategies, particularly as they are related to anticipated relocation diffusion from more- to less-developed countries and regions, and hierarchical diffusion from countries with higher population and density. It is likely that many of these processes are replicated at smaller geographical scales both within countries and within regions. Epidemiological strategies must therefore be tailored according to human mobility patterns, as well as countries' settlement and population characteristics. We suggest that limiting human mobility to the greatest extent practical will best restrain COVID-19 diffusion, which in the absence of widespread vaccination may be one of the best lines of epidemiological defense.","Sigler, Thomas; Mahmuda, Sirat; Kimpton, Anthony; Loginova, Julia; Wohland, Pia; Charles-Edwards, Elin; Corcoran, Jonathan",Global Health,302,21

In this population-based cohort study, we retrieved data from nationwide registries on all individuals diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection up to 1 November 2020. For individuals with diabetes, we examined the impact of use of GLP-1 RAs (n = 370) and DPP-4i (n = 284) compared with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) (n = 342) on risk of hospital admission and severe outcomes. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated after applying propensity score weighted methods to control for confounding. Current users of GLP-1 RAs had an adjusted RR of 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.34-2.33), while users of DPP-4i had an adjusted RR of 2.42 (95% confidence interval 0.99-5.89) for 30-day mortality compared with SGLT-2i use. Further, use of GLP-1 RAs or DPP-4i compared with SGLT-2i was not associated with decreased risk of hospital admission. Thus, use of incretin-based therapies in individuals with diabetes and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was not associated with improved clinical outcomes.","Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Pottegård, Anton; Sandholdt, Håkon; Madsbad, Sten; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich; Benfield, Thomas",Diabetes obes. metab,302,20

Abnormal coagulation profiles were reported to be associated with poor outcomes. In this study, we assessed the prognostic values of antithrombin (AT) activity levels and the impact of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) treatment on outcome. Materials and Methods: Conventional coagulation parameters as well as AT activity levels and outcomes of 104 consecutive critically ill acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with AT activity below 75% were treated with FFP. Maximum AT activity levels achieved in those patients were recorded. Results: AT activity levels at admission were significantly lower in nonsurvivors than survivors (73% vs. 81%). The cutoff level for admission AT activity was 79% and 58% was the lowest AT for survival. The outcome in those patients who had AT activity levels above 75% after FFP treatment was better than that of the nonresponding group. As well as AT, admission values of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were coagulation and inflammatory parameters among the mortality risk factors. Conclusion: AT activity could be used as a prognostic marker for survival and organ failure in COVID-19-associated ARDS patients. AT supplementation therapy with FFP in patients with COVID-19-induced hypercoagulopathy may improve thrombosis prophylaxis and thus have an impact on survival.","Anakli, Ilkay; Ergin Özcan, Perihan; Polat, Özlem; Orhun, Günseli; Alay, Gülçin Hilal; Tuna, Verda; Çeliksoy, Emre; Kiliç, Mehmet; Mercan, Mutlu; Ali, Achmet; Besisik, Sevgi; Esen, Figen",Turk J Haematol,302,25

The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.","Fung, Sin-Yee; Yuen, Kit-San; Ye, Zi-Wei; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",Emerg Microbes Infect,302,33

To combat its effects, many governments have opted for strategies of social isolation that involve a radical change in people's behavior. AREAS COVERED: For patients with hemophilia, the negative consequences of these measures can be greater, given they modify aspects of health care and lifestyles needed to counteract the adverse effects of hemophilia. The long-term consequences of the pandemic on patients with hemophilia are not well known. The aim of this special report is to show what COVID-19 could mean for this population, beyond the risk of infection. EXPERT OPINION: Considerations of the clinical, care, therapeutic, physical, nutritional, mental health, pain, and disability aspects that might be affected are included. Strategies are also suggested to minimize the effects that these issues can have on patients' lives. Patients, health professionals, and society as a whole must work together to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on people with hemophilia.","De la Corte-Rodriguez, Hortensia; Alvarez-Roman, M Teresa; Rodriguez-Merchan, E Carlos; Jimenez-Yuste, Víctor",Expert Rev Hematol,302,29

We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS. METHODS: We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks. To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS. We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data. RESULTS: With our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R(0) to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R(0) for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13). Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R(0) of 0·60 (0·42–0·80). Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R(0) would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.

Here, we used trichimeras to evaluate strategies of adoptive immunotherapy to solid tumors, using the kidney as a tumor surrogate. Three DLA-identical trichimeric recipients were established by simultaneously infusing marrow from two DLA-identical donor dogs into a DLA-identical recipient conditioned with 2 Gy total body irradiation and given a short course of postgrafting immunosuppression. After confirming stable hematopoietic engraftment, a kidney was transplanted from one of the two marrow donors into each respective trichimeric recipient. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from each kidney donor were then used to sensitize the alternate marrow donor. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) from the sensitized dogs were given to the trichimeric recipients, whereupon chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and kidney rejection were monitored. After DLI, we observed both prompt rejection of the transplanted marrow-donor kidney and disappearance of corresponding hematopoietic chimerism. Presumably, owing to shared minor histocompatibility antigens, host chimerism also disappeared and GvHD in skin, gut, and liver developed. The native kidneys, while showing lymphocytic infiltration, remained functionally normal. The current study demonstrated that under certain experimental conditions, the kidney, an organ ordinarily not involved in graft-versus-host reactions, can be targeted by sensitized donor lymphocytes.","Graves, Scott S.; Hogan, William J.; Kuhr, Christian; Diaconescu, Razvan; Harkey, Michael; Sale, George E.; Stone, Brad; Georges, George E.; Storb, Rainer",Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,302,1

METHODS: Medical records of 614 otolaryngology consults seen between January and June of 2019 and 602 seen between January and June of 2020 were reviewed. Extracted data included patient demographics, SARS-CoV-2 status, medical comorbidities, consult location, consult category, reason for consult, procedures performed, and overall outcome. Prevalence of data items was compared using t tests and Chi-squared tests. RESULTS: The number of monthly consults to the otolaryngology service remained approximately stable after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was a substantial increase in ICU consults and a decrease in ER and floor consults. The proportion of otology, rhinology, and head and neck consults decreased while that of airway consults—most of which were tracheostomy-related—greatly increased. While the top ten reasons for consult remained essentially the same, they dramatically increased as a percentage of consults during COVID-19 (55–92%), whereas there was a dramatic decrease in the proportion of less frequent consults. CONCLUSION: The changes in otolaryngology consultation patterns seen after the onset of the pandemic are multifactorial, but may be attributed to novel pathologies, attitudes, and policies. Nonetheless, these patterns reveal that a set of core otolaryngologic issues, including acute airway issues, head and neck lesions, severe sinusitis and epistaxis, are essential and need to be addressed in the inpatient setting, whereas the significant drop in other consults suggests that they may be appropriately managed on an outpatient basis.

Pharmacy students are the potential facilitator to give community education about COVID-19 treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacy students’ knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information about COVID-19 treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional study, recruiting 429 pharmacy students from three schools of pharmacy in Indonesia. The questionnaire about the knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information on COVID-19 treatment met the validity and reliability criteria. We defined the proportion of knowledge, behavior, and attitude of the students using SPSS(®) version 22. RESULTS: Most of the students are in the earlier years (46.63%), female (84.15%), find the information about COVID-19 from many sources of media (85.08%) including scientific articles and know information about COVID-19 transmission around their life area (76.46%).

The competition was redesigned as a Zoom meeting using breakout rooms, with library faculty and staff serving as team facilitators. Tasks were rewritten, shifting the focus from the library's physical spaces to its virtual services and online resources. The redesigned orientation was evaluated using two data sources: a postsession survey of student participants and a debriefing of the library employees who participated. Student evaluations were positive, while the faculty and staff provided numerous suggestions for improving future virtual orientations.

A leading contributor to these concerning outcomes is a lack of available intensive care unit (intensive care unit) beds and mechanical ventilation support. Poorer health is associated with a higher risk for severe respiratory complications from the coronavirus. We hypothesize that impaired respiratory muscle performance is an underappreciated factor contributing to poor outcomes unfolding during the coronavirus pandemic. While impaired respiratory muscle performance is considered to be rare, it is more frequently encountered in patients with poorer health, in particular obesity. However, measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice, including those with symptoms such as dyspnea. The purpose of this perspective paper is to discuss the potential role of respiratory muscle performance from the perspective of the coronavirus pandemic. We also provide a theoretical patient management model to screen for impaired respiratory muscle performance and intervene if identified with the goal of unburdening healthcare systems during future pandemic crises. • Poor baseline health increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus infection and poorer outcomes. • Patients with poorer baseline health, notably obesity, are more likely to demonstrate impaired respiratory muscle performance, and poorer outcomes following intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. • This relationship indicates respiratory muscle performance may contribute to outcomes related to acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus infection in patients with poor baseline health.","Severin, Richard; Arena, Ross; Lavie, Carl J; Bond, Samantha; Phillips, Shane A.",Am J Med,302,20

Tailored text messages may help patients navigate the health system and initiate care with a primary care physician. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of tailored text messages with newly enrolled Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. Text messages included education about the importance of primary care, reminders to obtain an appointment, and resources to help schedule an appointment. Within 120 days of enrollment, we examined completion of at least one primary care visit and use of the emergency department. Within 1 year of enrollment, we examined diagnosis of a chronic disease, receipt of preventive care, and use of the emergency department. 8432 beneficiaries (4201 texting group; 4231 control group) were randomized; mean age was 37 years and 24% were White.

METHODS: Radiographs of patients between 1 and 5 years old from the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center (Guangzhou dataset) and NIH ChestXray14 dataset were included. We utilized 5232 radiographs from the Guangzhou dataset to train a ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to identify pediatric pneumonia. DCNN testing was performed on a holdout set of 624 radiographs from the Guangzhou dataset (internal test set) and 383 radiographs from the NIH ChestXray14 dataset (external test set). Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and area under the curve (AUC) was compared via DeLong parametric method. Colored heatmaps were generated using class activation mapping (CAM) to identify important image pixels for DCNN decision-making. RESULTS: The DCNN achieved AUC of 0.95 and 0.54 for identifying pneumonia on internal and external test sets, respectively (p < 0.0001). Heatmaps generated by the DCNN showed the algorithm focused on clinically relevant features for images from the internal test set, but not for images from the external test set. CONCLUSION: Our model had high performance when tested on an internal dataset but significantly lower accuracy when tested on an external dataset.

A total of 339 respondents included in our last study during the second wave (4–11 August 2020) joined this survey (response rate = 51.1%). The questionnaire collected data on sleep conditions, mood, stress, and risk perception. The sleep quality and mood status were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The weighted prevalence of insomnia, anxiety, and depression was 33.6%, 15.3%, and 22.0%, respectively. Compared with the last survey, five out of six sleep parameters significantly worsened despite the lack of difference in the ISI score. The GAD-7 score was significantly lower. Old-aged adults were less likely to maintain good sleep quality compared with middle-aged adults (adjusted OR = 4.03, 95% CI: 1.04–15.73). Respondents without psychiatric disorder were more likely to be anxiety-free across the two time points (adjusted OR = 7.12, 95% CI: 1.33–38.03). One-third of Hong Kong people reported poor sleeping quality in the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Meanwhile, source apportionment of the hourly measured heavy metal concentrations was performed using a PMF model, in which eight sources were identified. The results show that the concentrations of most elements presented a ""V-shaped"" trend, which was mainly influenced by emissions from fireworks (K, Cu, Ba as indicative elements), Se-related industry, road dust (Ca, Fe, Ba), and motor vehicles (Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu). However, during the COVID-19 shutdown period, the concentrations of K, Ba, and Cu were high. Case-specific analysis suggested that prior to the shutdown period, the high concentrations of Cu were significantly influenced by long-range transport, which shifted to a dominant contribution from local fireworks during the shutdown period.","Cheng, Kai; Chang, Yun-Hua; Kuang, Ya-Qiong; Zou, Zhong",Huan Jing Ke Xue,302,3

Furthermore, higher body mass index (BMI) is related to severe disease. SARS‐CoV‐2 utilises angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain cellular entry. METHODS: We have investigated whether ACE2 bronchial epithelial expression is increased in COPD patients who are overweight compared to those who are not by RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We observed increased ACE2 expression in COPD patients who are overweight (mean BMI 29 kg/m(2)) compared to those notoverweight (mean BMI 21 kg/m(2)) (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Increased ACE2 expression may cause increased SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of the respiratory tract.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study on DHCPs was carried out at five dental teaching hospitals/colleges in four provinces of Saudi Arabia from October to December 2020. A 35-item valid and reliable questionnaire was used to assess the concerns, perceived impact, and preparedness of DHCPs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare parameters between the clinical and non-clinical staff. RESULTS: A total of 320 DHCPs participated in this study with proportion of clinical staff (57.5%) surpassing the non-clinical staff (42.5%). The clinical DHCPs felt greater odds of falling ill with COVID-19 than non-clinical workers (OR, 2.61) and willing to look for another job (OR, 3.50). The higher proportion in both groups was worried that people close to them would be at higher exposure risk (96.3%) however, slightly more clinical DHCPs were concerned for their children than a non-clinical worker (OR, 3.57). The clinical DHCPs have greater odds of worrying that people would avoid them and their family members because of their job (OR, 2.75). A higher proportion in both groups (75.0%, 63.2%) felt that they would feel stress at work. More non-clinical DHCPs (94.1%) had received training for infection control than clinical (94.1% vs 63.0%: OR 0.10). Similarly, more DHCPs in the nonclinical group received adequate personal protective equipment training (88.2%; OR, 0.48). Most participants practiced self-preparation such as buying masks and disinfection (94.4%, 96.9%). CONCLUSION: The majority of DHCPs felt concerned about their risk of exposure and falling ill from infection and infecting friends/family. These concerns could potentially affect the working of DHCPs during this pandemic. Measures to improve protection for DHCPs, minimize psychological implications, and potential social stigmatization should be identified at the planning phase before any pandemic.","Javed, Muhammad Qasim; Chaudhary, Farooq Ahmad; Mohsin, Syed Fareed; AlAttas, Mustafa Hussein; Edrees, Hadeel Yaseen; Habib, Syed Rashid; Riaz, Arham",PeerJ,302,16

Methods: After protocol setting, relevant articles were searched on various databases including PubMed, Medline, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and Web of Sciences using MeSH keywords. The data regarding demographic, clinical characteristics and prevalence of each persisting symptom were carefully studied and tabulated. Data analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26. Results: Out of the 153 articles reviewed, 21 articles qualified for the final analysis.

However, limited research has explored patient experiences of VCs in this context. This research therefore explored patient experiences of VCs during their early stages of implementation in response to Covid-19. DesignSecondary data analysis of routine patient survey responses using descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis. Setting and participants955 (22.6%) survey responses following a VC using Attend Anywhere in a rural, aging and outpatient care setting between June and July 2020. ResultsMost (93.2%) respondents reported having good (n=210, 22.0%), or very good (n=680, 71.2%) experiences with VCs. Most respondents accessed their VC alone (n=806, 84.4%), except for those aged 71+ (n=23/58, 39.7%). Most participants reported feeling listened to and understood (n=904, 94.7%), felt their needs had been met (n=860, 90.1%) and were able to communicate everything they wanted (n=848, 88.8%). Satisfaction with communication was very strongly associated with satisfaction with the technical performance of the VC (p<0.001). Free text responses had three key themes: i) barriers to VC use including technological difficulties, quality of patient information and accessibility or suitability concerns; ii) potential benefits including reduced stress and anxiety, enhanced accessibility, cost and time savings; and iii) patient suggested improvements including trial calls, turning music off, facilitating photo uploads, expanding written character limit and supporting other internet browsers. Most (92.1%) participants were likely to choose a VC again in the future. ConclusionsThe vast majority of respondents reported positive experiences of VCs. Identified benefits of enhanced accessibility, affordability, time, monetary and environmental savings are particularly interesting for future service delivery. Further research is needed, using rapid co-design techniques, to improve feedback methods, patient information and experience to support sustainability and to address accessibility and experience of patients excluded from this work, through lack of VC access.

Disasters disproportionately impact women and girls, with some evidence suggesting that violence against women and girls (VAWG) increases in disaster settings. Suggested risk factors for postdisaster VAWG include increased life stressors, failure of law enforcement, exposure to high-risk environments, exacerbation of existing gender inequalities and unequal social norms. We aim to systematically appraise the global literature on the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the following databases: Embase, Global Health, Medline, PubMed and Social Policy and Practice and searched grey literature. We included quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies published in English language that examined the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. We summarised the findings using a narrative synthesis approach. RESULTS: Of 555 non-duplicate records, we included a total of 37 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Among the quantitative studies, eight studies found a positive association between disaster exposure and increased VAWG, and four additional studies found positive associations with some violence types but not others. Qualitative findings offered insights into three hypothesised pathways: disaster exposure associated with (1) an increase of stressors that trigger VAWG; (2) an increase of enabling environments for VAWG and (3) an exacerbation of underlying drivers of VAWG. CONCLUSION: As the first known global systematic review on the relationship between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG, this review contributes to the evidence base. We were limited by the quality of quantitative studies, specifically study designs, the measurement of variables and geographic scope. The severe health consequences of VAWG and increasing frequency of extreme events means that rigorously designed and better quality studies are needed to inform evidence-based policies and safeguard women and girls during and after disasters.","Thurston, Alyssa Mari; Stöckl, Heidi; Ranganathan, Meghna",BMJ Glob Health,302,16

Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a retrospective analysis with offline comprehensive conventional measurement of bilateral heart function and develop an appropriate prognostic model for in-hospital death. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 37 consecutive patients with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay, who had undergone clinically indicated standard two-dimensional echocardiographic studies in intensive care wards. Offline comprehensive measurement was also performed. We further integrated the echocardiographic findings as paired evidence of vital organ involvement (possible respiratory distress assessed using right ventricular functional parameters, possible myocardial injury assessed using increased wall thickness, effusion or asynergy) and circulatory failure (suspected low flow status assessed using stroke volume index, suspected congestion assessed using elevated right or left atrial pressure). We evaluated its value for in-hospital death along with other echocardiographic findings. RESULTS: The most common features included a normal-sized left atrium and left ventricle with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, despite deteriorated left ventricular flow volume. Less frequent findings, such as abnormalities in the right heart and left ventricular abnormalities suggesting myocarditis, were observed. Although the single echocardiographic parameters failed to show predictive values for in-hospital death, integration of the echocardiographic findings suggested predictive value (p = 0.04, odds ratio: 12.28). CONCLUSION: Standard TTE at the bedside with offline comprehensive conventional measurement may provide prognostic information that is valuable for the management of patients with COVID-19.

Pakistan is one of these countries. A government mandated lockdown can have mitigating psychological effects on young adults, out of which a large fraction is made up of students. This study aims to investigate the correlations between changes in sleep pattern, perception of time, and digital media usage. Furthermore, it explores the impact of these changes on the mental health of students of different educational levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire, from March 24 to April 26, 2020. The survey was targeted at students and 251 responses were obtained. It was a 5-section long questionnaire. The first section inquired about demographics of participants. Each of the other 4 section were devoted to changes in sleep pattern, perception of time flow, digital media usage and mental health status of students. Close ended questions with multiple choice responses, dichotomous, interval and 4-point Likert scales were used in the construction of the survey questionnaire. Chi square, T-tests multinomial and binary logistic regression were used as primary statistical tests. All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results: Out of 251 adolescents that participated in our study, the majority (70.2%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 19.40+/- 1.62 years. Two-thirds of the respondents did not have much trouble falling asleep (66.5%). The analysis found no significant association between longer sleep periods and procrastination level (p = 0.054). Nearly three-fourths (72.9%) of our participants felt that getting through quarantine would have been more difficult if they did not have any electronic gadgets. Of these, a majority (85.8%) had a general feeling of tiredness and lacked motivation (p = 0.023). Additionally, a large number of students (69.7%) had reported that time is seemingly moving faster. A significant relationship between increased usage of electronic items and longer sleep periods was also noted (p = 0.005). With respect to the level of education statistically significant values were noted for alarm use both before and after quarantine began (p = 0.021 and p = 0.004, respectively). Further analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the median difference of time spent on social media before the outbreak (3.0+/-32.46) and time spent on social media after the outbreak (6.0+/-3.52) in a single day (p=0.000). Conclusions: Our research has revealed that due to the lockdown imposed by the government in response to COVID-19, the sleeping patterns of the students was affected the most. Our findings show that the increase in use of social media applications led to a widespread increase in the length of sleep, worsening of sleep habits (people sleeping at much later hours than usual), and a general feeling of tiredness. A general lack of recollection regarding what day of the week it was, as well as a change in the perceived flow of time were also notable. All these findings indicate the decline in mental health of students due to the lockdown. Promoting better sleep routines, minimizing the use of digital media, and encouragement of students to take up more hobbies could collectively improve the health and mood of students in self quarantine.","Ali, Abraish; Siddiqui, Asad Ali; Arshad, Muhammad Sameer; Iqbal, Fizza; Arif, Taha Bin",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),302,16

METHODS: A web-based national survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The prospective survey was distributed via social media (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook), QR code and email. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations. RESULTS: We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129 rheumatologists. Most patients (74%) and rheumatologists (76%) believed that DHAs are useful in the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and felt confident in their own usage thereof (90%; 86%). 38% of patients and 71% of rheumatologists reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29%; 48%). The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6%; 77.5%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable, available DHAs (58.5%; 41.9%), poor usability (42.1% of patients) and a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2% of rheumatologists). Only a minority (<10% in both groups) believed that digitalisation has a negative impact on the patient–doctor relationship.

Risk factors are well documented but protective factors are seldom examined. Social support has been reported to reduce psychological distress among the general population but its effect on farmers is inconclusive. Agricultural cooperatives are typically created and owned by farmers to secure markets, access supplies and services, and participate in decision-making. It is unknown whether having cooperative resources impacts symptoms of depression. A survey was used to examine whether having access to cooperative programs and social support impacted symptoms of depression among dairy farmers. Farm bankruptcies, stress, depression, and suicide were identified as ongoing concerns. Having social support and cooperative educational opportunities and mentorship programs were associated with decreased symptoms of depression. Conversely, having cooperative policy discussions was associated with increased symptoms of depression. Results suggest that social support can potentially reduce symptoms of depression among farmers and having access to cooperative resources can reduce or increase it, depending on the type of program. Our findings identified an opportunity to further examine how programs provided by farmer-led organizations such as cooperatives can impact stress, depression, and suicide among farmers.","Liang, Yanni; Wang, Kai; Janssen, Brandi; Casteel, Carri; Nonnenmann, Matthew; Rohlman, Diane S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,302,10

Design Narrative Review. Setting Inpatient rehabilitation. Participants Patients undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. Interventions Mask wearing. Main Outcome Measures Effect of mask wearing on exercise outcomes, including perceived exertion, shortness of breath, and patient perception; clinical implications for the interdisciplinary team. Results Five trials which observed exercise outcomes after mask wearing were identified and summarized. Findings for the effect of face masks on exercise and vital signs varied due to heterogeneity of exercise protocols and outcome measures. Relevant findings show that patients who wore masks had higher ratings of perceived exertion, increased shortness of breath, and feelings of claustrophobia while wearing a face mask during exercise. Wearing masks affected physical and mental outcomes despite exercise intensity (low, moderate, or high). Conclusions Moderate-to-high intensity exercise is needed for neuroplasticity. This type of exercise may not be possible in neurological populations, who do not have normal oxygen consumption at rest or with exercise, and may be further affected by wearing masks. Clinicians should their patients' mask wearing into consideration, and change the frequency, intensity, timing and types of exercises when patients are wearing a face mask. Frequent measurement of vital signs and fatigue symptoms are critical to maintain patient safety, and adjustments should be made as necessary. Other neurological challenges to monitor include impaired cognitive function, limited communication, reduced mood, and interactions with medications. These can affect the patients' ability to accurately determine and state their perceived effort or may hinder physiological and autonomic responses. Lastly, interdisciplinary teams should communicate patient findings related to mask wearing at team conferences, huddles and include discussion for ways to increase patients' participation and how to optimize health outcomes.

This work explores how protein states can be manipulated through controllability analysis: the determination of the minimum manipulation needed to drive the cell system to any desired state. Here, we complete a two-part controllability analysis of two protein networks: a host network representing the healthy cell state and an influenza A virus-host network representing the infected cell state. In this context, controllability analyses aim to identify key regulating host factors of the infected cell’s progression. This knowledge can be utilized in further biological analysis to understand disease dynamics and isolate proteins for study as drug target candidates. RESULTS: Both topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. Functional analysis finds overlap of results with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, NF-kB pathway and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year with a constant threat of pandemic infection. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods. These results are beneficial to future studies of influenza virus, both experimental and computational, and provide evidence that the combination of topology and controllability analyses may be valuable for future efforts in drug target discovery.

Several pathogens, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and even the recent 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), can cause serious breathing and brain disorders, tissue injury and inflammation, leading to high rates of mortality and resulting in great loss to human physical and mental health as well as the global economy. These infectious diseases exploit the microbial and host factors to induce serious inflammatory and immunological symptoms. Thus the development of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting bacterial/viral infection is an urgent need. In previous studies, YojI-IFNAR2, YojI-IL10RA, YojI-NRP1,YojI-SIGLEC7, and YojI-MC4R membrane–protein interactions were found to mediate E. coli invasion of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which activated the downstream anti-inflammatory proteins NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 2(NLRP2), using a proteomic chip conjugated with cell immunofluorescence labeling. However, the studies of pathogen (bacteria/virus)–host cell interactions mediated by membrane protein interactions did not extend their principles to broad biomedical applications such as 2019-nCoV infectious disease therapy. The first part of this feature article presents in-depth analysis of the cross-talk of cellular anti-inflammatory transduction signaling among interferon membrane protein receptor II (IFNAR2), interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10RA), NLRP2 and [Ca(2+)]-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2G5), based on experimental results and important published studies, which lays a theoretical foundation for the high-throughput construction of the cytokine and virion solution chip. The paper then moves on to the construction of the novel GPCR recombinant herpes virion chip and virion nano-oscillators for profiling membrane protein functions, which drove the idea of constructing the new recombinant virion and cytokine liquid chips for HTS of leading drugs. Due to the different structural properties of GPCR, IFNAR2, ACE2 and Spike of 2019-nCoV, their ligands will either bind the extracellular domain of IFNAR2/ACE2/Spike or the specific loops of the GPCR on the envelope of the recombinant herpes virions to induce dynamic charge distribution changes that lead to the variable electron transition for detection. Taken together, the combined overview of two of the most innovative and exciting developments in the immunoinflammatory field provides new insight into high-throughput construction of ultrasensitive cytokine and virion liquid chips for HTS of anti-inflammatory drugs or clinical diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases including infectious diseases, acute or chronic inflammation (acute gouty arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, atheromatosis, diabetes, obesity, tissue injury and tumors. It has significant value in the prevention and treatment of these serious and painful diseases.

Six healthy adult dogs were used in a crossover design and fed a low-fiber control diet (K9C) or one containing 7.5% beet pulp (K9BP). Pooled fecal DNA samples from each treatment were subjected to 454 pyrosequencing, generating 503 280 (K9C) and 505 061 (K9BP) sequences. Dominant bacterial phyla included the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes, both of which comprised ∼35% of all sequences, followed by Proteobacteria (13–15%) and Fusobacteria (7–8%). K9C had a greater percentage of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, whereas K9BP had greater proportions of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes. Archaea were not altered by diet and represented ∼1% of all sequences. All archaea were members of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, with methanogens being the most abundant and diverse. Three fungi phylotypes were present in K9C, but none in K9BP. Less than 0.4% of sequences were of viral origin, with >99% of them associated with bacteriophages. Primary functional categories were not significantly affected by diet and were associated with carbohydrates; protein metabolism; DNA metabolism; cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments; amino acids and derivatives; cell wall and capsule; and virulence.

The mechanisms by which this occurs and potential protective factors present in this relationship are understudied. Mindfulness is a cognitive resource that may protect individuals against symptoms of psychological distress. It has five core facets and encourages a nonjudgmental acceptance of the present moment. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of mindfulness in the relationship between ACEs and depression, both as a mediator and as a moderator, or protective factor. We hypothesized that the aware, describe, and non-judgement facets of mindfulness would be key factors in both sets of analyses. Participants at a university (N = 279) were given the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACES), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) to measure depression. Results indicated that the describe CI [.02, .11], aware CI [.05, .17], and non-judgement CI [.06, .18] facets of mindfulness significantly mediated the relationship between ACEs and depression. Additionally, the aware facet of mindfulness was also a significant moderator in this relationship, [t (interaction) = −3.22, p < 0.01], such that individuals with a high level of awareness had no increase in depression even as the number of ACEs increased. Negative cognitions associated with ACEs may harm one’s ability to effectively describe their feelings and to be fully aware of the present moment, which may contribute to symptoms of depression. Implications for mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are discussed.","McKeen, Haley; Hook, Megan; Podduturi, Purnaja; Beitzell, Emily; Jones, Amelia; Liss, Miriam",Curr Psychol,302,16

With the increasing application of remote sensing in grassland monitoring and measuring, it is still difficult to detect WPE at its early stages when its spectral signals are not strong enough. Even at late stages, woody species have strong vegetation characteristics that are commonly categorized as healthy ecosystems. We focus on how shrub encroachment can be detected through remote sensing by looking at the biophysical and spectral properties of the WPE grassland ecosystem, investigating the appropriate season and wavelengths that identify shrub cover, testing the spectral separability of different shrub cover groups and by revealing the lowest shrub cover that can be detected by remote sensing. Biophysical results indicate spring as the best season to distinguish shrubs in our study area. The earliest shrub encroachment can be identified most likely only when the cover reaches between 10% and 25%. A correlation between wavelength spectra and shrub cover indicated four regions that are statistically significant, which differ by season. Furthermore, spectral separability of shrubs increases with their cover; however, good separation is only possible for pure shrub pixels. From the five separability metrics used, Transformed divergence and Jeffries-Matusita distance have better interpretations. The spectral regions for pure shrub pixel separation are slightly different from those derived by correlation and can be explained by the influences from land cover mixtures along our study transect.","Soubry, Irini; Guo, Xulin",Sensors (Basel),302,16

Recent studies demonstrated that the incidence of severe or fatal M. pneumoniae was gradually increasing, which may be related to the excessive inflammation. However, the exact pathogenesis of excessive inflammation in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia(MPP) is still unclear. This study aimed to reveal the role of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 axis in children with MPP. METHODS: Children hospitalized in Respiratory Department during Jan. 2014 to Dec. 2015 were enrolled. All children enrolled was confirmed with MP infection using real-time PCR and ELISA. Children were excluded if they were co-infected with other pathogens. A total of 52 children with MPP and 26 controls were enrolled. miR-29c expression in monocytes of children with MPP was determined by real-time PCR and soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) and IL-17 were determined by ELISA, and explore their clinical significance. miR-29c overexpression and silencing technology and luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm whether B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c. The levels of transcription factor ROR-γt in CD4+ T cells and cytokine IL-17A in supernatant were detected after stimulated by different concentrations of B7-H3 fusion protein in vitro. RESULTS: Of all 52 children with MPP, the mean age of the children were 77 ± 33 months, and 23 cases were male accounting for 44.2%. Nineteen cases had pleural effusion accounting for 36.5%. Children with MPP had significantly lower level of miR-29c and higher level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 compared to controls (both P < 0.05). The level of miR-29c significantly increased during convalescent phase compared to that of acute phase while sB7-H3 and IL-17 significantly decreased during convalescent phase (both P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 in children with MPP during acute-stage (r = 0.361,P = 0.009). Children with MPP combined with pleural effusion had significantly higher level of sB7-H3 compared to those without pleural effusion (9952.3 ± 3065.3 vs. 7449.7 ± 2231.5, pg/ml), and the levels of sB7-H3 was positively correlated with the number of days of fever. The level of miR-29c was negatively correlated with M. pneumoniae specific IgG, IgM level. High concentrations of B7-H3(15μg/ml) could enhance ROR-γt expression and increase IL-17A. Functional studies based on luciferase reporter assay and immunofluorescence staining suggested that B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c, and miR-29c silencing or overexpression could up- or down-regulate the expression of B7-H3 in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The axis of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 plays a vital role in children with MPP through excessive inflammation. miR-29c and B7-H3 may be the new target for the prevention and treatment of MPP, and may be the novel and potential biomarkers for the assessment of prognosis.","Li, Qing-ling; Wu, Yin-yin; Sun, Hui-ming; Gu, Wen-jing; Zhang, Xin-xing; Wang, Mei-juan; Yan, Yong-dong; Hao, Chuang-li; Ji, Wei; Chen, Zheng-rong",Ital J Pediatr,302,17

Following extensive consultation, they were published in January 2001.1 These guidelines describe the precautions healthcare workers should take in three areas: standard principles for preventing HCAI, which include hospital environmental hygiene, hand hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, and the safe use and disposal of sharps; preventing infections associated with the use of short-term indwelling urethral catheters; and preventing infections associated with central venous catheters. The evidence for these guidelines was identified by multiple systematic reviews of experimental and non-experimental research and expert opinion as reflected in systematically identified professional, national and international guidelines, which were formally assessed by a validated appraisal process. In 2003, we developed complementary national guidelines for preventing HCAI in primary and community care on behalf of the National Collaborating Centre for Nursing and Supportive Care (National Institute for Healthand Clinical Excellence).2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identified, appraised and, if shown to be effective in preventing HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority. Consequently, the DH commissioned a review of new evidence published following the last systematic reviews. We have now updated the evidence base for making infection prevention and control recommendations. A critical assessment of the updated evidence indicated that the original epic guidelines published in 2001 remain robust, relevant and appropriate but that adjustments need to be made to some guideline recommendations following a synopsis of the evidence underpinning the guidelines. These updated national guidelines (epic2) provide comprehensive recommendations for preventing HCAI in hospitals and other acute care settings based on the best currently available evidence. Because this is not always the best possible evidence, we have included a suggested agenda for further research in each section of the guidelines. National evidence-based guidelines are broad principles of best practice which need to be integrated into local practice guidelines. To monitor implementation, we have suggested key audit criteria for each section of recommendations. Clinically effective infection prevention and control practice is an essential feature of protecting patients. By incorporating these guidelines into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of healthcare in NHS hospitals in England can be minimised.","Pratt, R.

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between myocardial injury secondary to COVID-19 infection and EAT thickness.Material and methods Thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed in 73 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19. EAT thickness and volume were calculated by two radiologists blind to the study data. We formed two groups according to hs-TnI concentrations, patients with myocardial damage (hs-TnI ≥11.6ângâ/âl) and without myocardial damage (hs-TnI<11.6 ngâ/âdl).Results A total of 46 patients were women (63.0â%). The mean age was 66.4±12.3 yrs in the myocardial injury group and 55.9±9.7 yrs in the group without myocardial injury (p<0.001). There were 20 hypertensive patients (68.9â%) in the injury group, while there were 12 hypertensive patients (27.3â%) in the group without injury (p=0.001). Glucose, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, white blood cell count, neutrophil, and neutrophilâ/âlymphocyte ratio were higher in the injury group (p<0.05, for all variables). The mean EAT thickness was 5.6±1.6 mm in the injury group, whereas it was 4.8±1.8 mm in the group without injury (p=0.031).

Longitudinal follow-up in n = 97 LFA + individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). RESULTS: Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titres during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titres, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 d. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.","Garritsen, Anja; Scholzen, Anja; van den Nieuwenhof, Daan W.

Vaccines are key for reducing coronaviral disease burden; however, the utility of live-attenuated vaccines is limited by risks of reversion or repair. Because of their history of emergence events due to their prevalence in zoonotic pools, designing live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines that can be rapidly and broadly implemented is essential for outbreak preparedness. Here, we show that coronaviruses with completely rewired transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) are effective vaccines against SARS-CoV. The TRN-rewired viruses are attenuated and protect against lethal SARS-CoV challenge. While a 3-nt rewired TRN reverts via second-site mutation upon serial passage, a 7-nt rewired TRN is more stable, suggesting that a more extensively rewired TRN might be essential for avoiding growth selection. In summary, rewiring the TRN is a feasible strategy for limiting reversion in an effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate that is potentially portable across the Nidovirales order.","Graham, Rachel L.; Deming, Damon J.; Deming, Meagan E.; Yount, Boyd L.; Baric, Ralph S.",Commun Biol,302,20

Recently, the importance of de novo origination has been recognized in eukaryotes, although eukaryotic genes originated de novo are relatively rare and difficult to identify. In contrast, viruses contain many de novo genes, namely those in which an existing gene has been “overprinted” by a new open reading frame, a process that generates a new protein-coding gene overlapping the ancestral gene. We analyzed the evolution of 12 experimentally validated viral genes that originated de novo and estimated their relative ages. We found that young de novo genes have a different codon usage from the rest of the genome. They evolve rapidly and are under positive or weak purifying selection. Thus, young de novo genes might have strain-specific functions, or no function, and would be difficult to detect using current genome annotation methods that rely on the sequence signature of purifying selection. In contrast to young de novo genes, older de novo genes have a codon usage that is similar to the rest of the genome. They evolve slowly and are under stronger purifying selection. Some of the oldest de novo genes evolve under stronger selection pressure than the ancestral gene they overlap, suggesting an evolutionary tug of war between the ancestral and the de novo gene.","Sabath, Niv; Wagner, Andreas; Karlin, David",Mol Biol Evol,302,20

In both cases, mild lymphocytosis at cerebrospinal fluid analysis and no structural brain changes were reported. The pathophysiological origin of the myoclonus in the two cases was different. In case 1, electroencephalogram did not reveal any cortical correlates and brain imaging of the spine was unremarkable, while in case 2, cortical origin of myoclonus was demonstrated.

One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to, from a statistical perspective, identify several key issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. METHODS: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, and the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) to analyze the reconstructed data. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups, and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We use the restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) as a global and robust measure for efficacy. RESULTS: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was –1.67 days (95% CI –3.62 to 0.28; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al, the difference of RMTIs at day 28 was –0.89 days (95% CI –2.84 to 1.06; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the hazard ratio estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al, the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups at day 30 was –2.7 days (95% CI –4.0 to –1.2; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in the recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI –3 to 0; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences became more statistically significant at larger percentiles. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the statistical issues and lessons learned from the recent three clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments, we suggest more appropriate approaches for the design and analysis of ongoing and future COVID-19 trials.","Yin, Guosheng; Zhang, Chenyang; Jin, Huaqing",JMIR Public Health Surveill,302,1

To investigate the distribution and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a home with COVID-19 positive occupants, samples were collected from a household with two confirmed COVID-19 cases (one adult and one child). Home surface swab and dust samples were collected two months after symptom onset (and one month after symptom resolution) in the household. The strength of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular signal in fomites varied as a function of sample location, surface material and cleaning practices. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal was detected at several locations throughout the household although cleaning appears to have attenuated the signal on many surfaces. Of the 24 surfaces sampled, 46% were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of sampling. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in dust recovered from floor and HVAC filter samples ranged from 104-105 N2 gene copies/g dust. While detection of viral RNA does not imply infectivity, this study confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal can be detected at several locations within a COVID-19 isolation home and can persist after symptoms have resolved. In addition, the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (normalized per unit mass of dust) recovered in home HVAC filters may prove useful for estimating SARS-CoV-2 airborne levels in homes. In this work, using the quantitative filter forensics methodology, we estimated an average integrated airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration of 69 ± 43 copies/m3. This approach can be used to help building scientists and engineers develop best practices in homes with COVID-19 positive occupants.","Maestre, Juan P.; Jarma, David; Yu, Jia-Rong F.; Siegel, Jeff; Horner, Sharon; Kinney, Kerry A.",Sci Total Environ,302,2

The coronaviruses are one of the serious pathogens to cause serious diseases in humans. Recently identified SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan City, China has emerged as a serious threat to human health and caused a global pandemic. Bats have been confirmed as a primary source of infection. The vaccination of the human population and animals serving as a potential reservoir is a straight forward strategy to control the transmission of any pathogen to humans. Natural products from many herbal plants are well known to have novel antiviral properties and evaluated against various viral diseases. There are many alkaloids have shown to be effective against coronaviruses. METHODS: Recently, the antiviral efficacy of natural alkaloids known as Homoharringtonine (HTT) and Emetine has been evaluated and provided promising results against coronaviruses including SARS-CoVs. These alkaloids may be very useful and can be used as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 because they have already been reported to inhibit the replication of SASRS-CoV and other viruses in cell lines. CONCLUSION: This review specifically focuses on the recent findings of these alkaloids against coronaviruses and possible treatment options for SARS-CoV-2. It is expected that natural products as alkaloids from herbal plants could be considered as novel and valuable candidates for the new antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Sohrab, Sayed Sartaj; Suhail, Mohd; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Azhar, Esam Ibraheem",Curr. pharm. des,302,20
