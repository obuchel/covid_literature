18003,E-healthonderwijs is een nieuwe uitdaging voor de huisartsopleiding,2021-06-01,"Two relevant topics in keeping populations healthy are handwashing and vaccinations. Thus, the service-learning project titled “We Are Healthy” campaign was introduced within a microbiology laboratory course with two objectives; our biologists would better understand the importance of these actions by designing activities that engage the student community and to obtain an understanding of the campus community’s behaviors and beliefs concerning these topics. Students designed the campaign to include handwashing stations, pictures of bacterial cultures from swabbing common surfaces, and trivia questions testing their peers’ knowledge of various vaccines, as well as handwashing and vaccination surveys. To assess the impact of the campaign on microbiology students (n = 34), they were provided 10 questions that were scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Student gains (score > 3) were reported for depth in knowledge, development of better public speaking skills, and greater respect for volunteers suggesting that the campaign was beneficial. This study subsequently led to the receiving of grants that allowed the continuation of the campaign within the course, the securing of funding for handwashing and hand sanitizing stations and the initiation of new undergraduate research projects.","Potter, Beth A.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170022/,694

Even as large-scale, globally operating digital platform enterprises find new ways to thrive in the midst of a crisis, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) nestled in local economies have proven to be fragile to shocks, causing countless local economies to unravel in the face of severe challenges to survival. Here, we discuss the role of entrepreneurship in re-building local economies that are more resilient. Specifically, we take a spatial perspective and highlight how the COVID-19 crisis has uncovered problems in the current tendency for thin contextualisation and promotion of globalisation. Based on this critique, we outline new perspectives for thinking about the relationship between entrepreneurship, resilience and local economies. Here, a particular emphasis is given to resilience building through deeply contextualised policies and research, localised flows of products and labour, and the diversification of local economies.","Korsgaard, Steffen; Hunt, Richard A; Townsend, David M; Ingstrup, Mads Bruun",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7565246/,694

This review article presents a comprehensive analysis of the current data in relation to COVID-19 and its effect on pregnant women, including symptoms, disease severity and the risk of vertical transmission. We also review the recommended management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the various pharmacological agents that are being investigated and may have a role in the treatment of this disease. At present, it does not appear that pregnant women are at increased risk of severe infection than the general population, although there are vulnerable groups within both the pregnant and nonpregnant populations, and clinicians should be cognizant of these high-risk groups and manage them accordingly. Approximately 85% of women will experience mild disease, 10% more severe disease and 5% critical disease. The most common reported symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea. Neither vaginal delivery nor cesarean section confers additional risks, and there is minimal risk of vertical transmission to the neonate from either mode of delivery. We acknowledge that the true effect of the virus on both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality will only be evident over time. We also discuss the impact of social isolation can have on the mental health and well-being of both patients and colleagues, and as clinicians, we must be mindful of this and offer support as necessary.","Ryan, Gillian A; Purandare, Nikhil C; McAuliffe, Fionnuala M; Hod, Moshe; Purandare, Chittaranjan N",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,,694

Three separate piecewise exponential survival models estimated for each solid organ the overall, demographic-specific, and donation service area-specific differences in the hazard of waitlist mortality before and after the national emergency declaration on March 13, 2020. Kidney waiting list mortality was higher after than before the national emergency (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.23-1.52). The hazard of waitlist mortality was not significantly different before and after COVID-19 for liver (aHR, 0.94), pancreas (aHR, 1.01), lung (aHR, 1.00), and heart (aHR, 0.94). Kidney candidates had notable variability in differences across donation service areas (aHRs, New York City, 2.52; New Jersey, 1.84; and Michigan, 1.56). The only demographic group with increased waiting list mortality were Blacks versus Whites (aHR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.07-1.86) for kidney candidates. The first 10 weeks after the declaration of a national emergency had a heterogeneous effect on waitlist mortality rate, varying by geography and ethnicity. This heterogeneity will complicate comparisons of transplant program performance during COVID-19.","Miller, Jonathan; Wey, Andrew; Musgrove, Donald; Son Ahn, Yoon; Hart, Allyson; Kasiske, Bertram L; Hirose, Ryutaro; Israni, Ajay K; Snyder, Jon J",Am. j. transplant,,694

236503,Prognostic value of lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients with corticosteroid treatment,2021,"During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, some reports of data still emerging and in need of full analysis indicate that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects. In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.","Danser, A H Jan; Epstein, Murray; Batlle, Daniel",Hypertension,,694

Fortunately, recombinant interferons as therapeutic products have accumulated a long history of beneficial therapeutic results in the treatment of chronic and acute viral diseases and also in the therapy of some types of cancer. One of the first antiviral treatments during the onset of COVID-19 in China was based on the use of recombinant interferon alfa 2b, so many clinicians began to use it, not only as therapy but also as a prophylactic approach, mainly in medical personnel. At the same time, basic research on interferons provided new insights that have contributed to a much better understanding of how treatment with interferons, initially considered as antivirals, actually has a much broader pharmacological scope. In this review, we briefly describe interferons, how they are induced in the event of a viral infection, and how they elicit signaling after contact with their specific receptor on target cells. Additionally, some of the genes stimulated by type I interferons are described, as well as the way interferon-mediated signaling is torpedoed by coronaviruses and in particular by SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene is one of the interferon response genes. Although for many scientists this fact could result in an adverse effect of interferon treatment in COVID-19 patients, ACE2 expression contributes to the balance of the renin-angiotensin system, which is greatly affected by SARS-CoV-2 in its internalization into the cell. This manuscript also includes the relationship between type I interferons and neutrophils, NETosis, and interleukin 17. Finally, under the subtitle of ""take-home messages"", we discuss the rationale behind a timely treatment with interferons in the context of COVID-19 is emphasized.","Garcia-Del-Barco, Diana; Risco-Acevedo, Daniela; Berlanga-Acosta, Jorge; Martos-Benítez, Frank Daniel; Guillén-Nieto, Gerardo",Front Immunol,,694
419390,Scoring cytokine storm by the levels of MCP-3 and IL-8 accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients with high mortality,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unexpected pressure on medical supplies, interrupting supply chains and increasing prices. The supply of antiviral filters which form an essential part of the ventilator circuit have been affected by these issues. Three-dimensional (3D) printing may provide a solution to some of these issues. METHODS: We designed and tested 3D printed heat and moisture exchange (HME) and antiviral casing. For each casing we tested two different filter materials derived from a sediment water filter cartridge or 1.5-µm glass fiber filter paper. A polyurethane sponge was used for the HME. Each design was tested for circuit leak, circuit compliance, peak inspiratory pressure and casing integrity using methylene blue dye. RESULTS: We designed, produced, and tested two different types of antiviral filters with six different internal configurations. Overall, we tested 10 modified filter designs and compared them with the original commercial filter. Except for the combination of 1.5-µm filter paper and 5 mm sponge peak inspiratory pressure and circuit compliance of the filters produced were within the operating limits of the ventilator. All In addition, all filters passed the dye test. CONCLUSIONS: Our filter may be of particular importance to those working in low middle-income countries unable to compete with stronger economies. Our design relies on products available outside the healthcare supply chain, much of which can be purchased in grocery stores, hardware stores, or industrial and academic institutions. We hope that these HMEs and viral filters may be beneficial to clinicians who face critical supply chain issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shaylor, Ruth; Francis, Mathew; Shaylor, Esther; Dadia, Solomon; Cohen, Barak",BMC Anesthesiol,,694

This study was conducted to better understand the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory viruses circulating in southern China. METHODS: We collected 22,680 respiratory samples from ARI patients in 18 hospitals in southern China during 2009-2018; seven common respiratory viruses including Flu, RSV, PIV, hMPV, ADV, HCoV, and HBoV were screened using in-house real-time PCR. RESULTS: Of all samples, 9760 ARI cases (9760/22680, 43.03%) tested positive for the seven common respiratory viruses. The most detected virus was Flu (14.15%), followed by RSV (10.33%) and PIV (5.43%); Flu-A, PIV3, and HCoV-OC43 were the predominant subtypes. Although most of the viruses were detected in male inpatients, Flu was more likely detected in female outpatients. Flu infection was more likely to cause URTI (upper respiratory tract infection), whereas RSV infection was more likely to cause pneumonia and bronchitis. The prevalence of Flu was particularly high in 2009. The epidemic level was found notably high in 2014-2018 for RSV, in 2016-2018 for PIV, in the summer of 2018 for ADV, in the summer of 2016 and winter of 2018 for HCoV, and in the summer of 2011 and autumn of 2018 for HBoV. The co-detection rate of the seven viruses was 4.70%; RSV, PIV, and Flu were the most commonly co-detected viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the epidemiological characteristics of seven common respiratory viruses in ARI patients in southern China.","Huang, Xu-Bin; Yuan, Lei; Ye, Cong-Xiu; Zhu, Xun; Lin, Cui-Ji; Zhang, Ding-Mei; He, Kai-Shu; Niu, Ruo-Xi; Cao, Kai-Yuan; Xu, Lin",Int J Infect Dis,,694
447053,Longitudinal dynamics of antibody responses in recovered COVID-19 patients,2021,"Peach palm fruit mesocarp (Bactris gasipaes var. gasipaes) is already consumed in the Northern region of Brazil, after its cooking and is known as a source of starch and carotenoids and like all fruits it has low storage stability. This work characterized the starch extracted from the mesocarp of peach palm fruit using with water in terms of its physical and chemical properties. The SEM micrographs show that starch presented bimodal distribution (size 3.9-10.4 µm), while the smaller granules had a smooth surface and an oval or conical shape, the larger granules were spherical with holes and cracks on the surface. The starch presented low amylose content (<20%) and amylopectin branch chain length distribution with the absence of a shoulder, which is suggestive of perfect crystalline structure, and a higher proportion of medium chains (DP 13-24), despite the large number of short chains (DP 6-12), and on average DP 21. X-ray diffraction showed a mixture of polymorphs A and B, which can be considered C-type crystalline pattern, which is indicative of being a slow digestible starch. Through paste viscosity results, by RVA, we can observe low values for thermal and pasting properties, suggesting greater homogeneity of crystals. Also, due to interaction with lipids originally present (2.69%), the starch showed lower retrogradation rate (22.64%), which resulted in a weak gel after 24 h of storage. As a product with greater storage stability, peach palm fruit starch, extracted for the purpose of promoting its regional use, has shown that it can be used in products where slow and smooth retrogradation is desired, such as in breads, soups, chowder and porridges, without the use of emulsifiers or fat.","Ferrari Felisberto, Mária Herminia; Souza Costa, Mariana; Villas Boas, Flávia; Lopes Leivas, Carolina; Maria Landi Franco, Célia; Michielon de Souza, Sérgio; Pedrosa Silva Clerici, Maria Teresa; Mach Côrtes Cordeiro, Lucimara",Food Res Int,,694

The indirect impact of the pandemic on health care delivery in general and pediatric emergency department (PED) visits in particular has been widely reported. AIMS: To assess the impact of the pandemic and the social restrictions imposed in its wake on PED visits and hospitalization rates in our Israeli medical center. We also sought to track these data in relation to the variation in pandemic severity and social restrictions over time. A comparison of this data with that of the adult emergency department was also performed. METHODS: Data for this study were drawn from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC), Jerusalem, Israel computerized databank. The daily number of PED and adult ER visits as well as hospitalizations resulting from these visits during the months January-July during the years 2018, 2019, 2020 were recorded. We compared the risk ratio for hospitalization in 2019 and 2020, as well as the incidence rate ratio. RESULTS: During March and April there was a decrease in PED visits from 4,588 visits in 2019 to 2,527 visits in 2020 (ratio = .551, 95%CI [.52,.58]. Despite the drop in PED visits, the rate of hospitalizations rose with respect to 2019 (Risk Ratio = 1.31, p < .001, 95%CI [1.17,1.47]). Similar but more moderate trends were seen in the adult ED. From May-July 2020, after the lockdown was lifted, PED visits remained 30% below the same time period from 2018 and 2019, while the hospitalization rate returned to its pre-pandemic level. CONCLUSIONS: A significant drop in PED visits is seen to extend well beyond the peak of the pandemic and the lockdown period. This highlights the potential risk of children with serious emergencies becoming casualties of the pandemic by their not being brought to medical attention. Efforts should be made to raise public awareness among parents and other caretakers of children regarding this matter.","Erlichman, Matti; Zalut, Todd; Schwartz, Shepard; Weiser, Giora",PLoS One,,694

The studies in the current Special Issue set the ground for continuing research toward even more comprehensive theoretical grounds; studies that incorporate several theoretical backgrounds and explore a broad theoretical model that may help us to understand successful adaptation in various contexts.

614824,Genome and epigenome editing identify CCR9 and SLC6A20 as target genes at the 3p21.31 locus associated with severe COVID-19,2021-02-22,"The new pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and spread around the world in <3 months, infecting millions of people, and causing countries to shut down public life and businesses. Nearly all nations were unprepared for this pandemic with healthcare systems stretched to their limits due to the lack of an effective vaccine and treatment. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is respiratory disease that can result in a cytokine storm with stark differences in morbidity and mortality between younger and older patient populations. Details regarding mechanisms of viral entry via the respiratory system and immune system correlates of protection or pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated. Here, we provide an overview of the innate immune responses in the lung to the coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. This review provides insight into key innate immune mechanisms that will aid in the development of therapeutics and preventive vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ahmed-Hassan, Hanaa; Sisson, Brianna; Shukla, Rajni Kant; Wijewantha, Yasasvi; Funderburg, Nicholas T.; Li, Zihai; Hayes, Don; Demberg, Thorsten; Liyanage, Namal P.

644916,Longitudinal dynamics of antibody responses in recovered COVID-19 patients,2021-03-31,"In a detailed microbiological and pathological study of eight outbreaks of calf pneumonia, which included the inoculation of respiratory material into 18 gnotobiotic calves, a total of five viruses, four species of mycoplasma and 19 species of bacteria were identified. The only microorganism not previously associated with bovine respiratory disease was a Coronavirus. The experimental disease produced in the majority of the gnotobiotic calves by the intratracheal inoculation of unpassaged respiratory material, closely resembled the natural disease. However statistical analysis of the results could not ascribe the disease seen to a single microorganism or to a particular combination of microorganisms. Assuming therefore that no microorganisms were missed in the study, it was concluded that the microbiological cause of the experimental disease lay amongst the organisms already found and that one or more of three other factors, discussed in the paper, accounted for the experimental disease produced.","Thomas, L.

655903,Lymphopenia predicts disease severity of COVID-19: a descriptive and predictive study,2020-03-27,"Background: After discharge from an intensive care unit(ICU), over 50% of patients face significant physical, mental and cognitive problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large cohort of these patients who will need follow-up services that can address their support needs. Objectives: To identify follow-up services planned for COVID-19 patients discharged from ICU, and to explore the views of ICU staff and General Practitioners(GPs) regarding these patients' future needs and care coordination. Design: Sequential mixed-methods UK study. We explored usual follow-up practice after ICU discharge and changes in follow-up during the pandemic through a survey of ICU staff, and GP awareness of follow-up and support needs of patients discharged from ICU through a survey of GPs. Through these surveys, we identified participants for semi-structured interviews with both groups. Results: We obtained 170 survey responses and conducted 23 interviews. Over 60% of GPs were unaware of the follow-up services generally provided by their local hospitals, and whether or not these were functioning during the pandemic. Eighty percent of ICUs reported some form of follow-up services, with 25% of these suspending provision during the peak of the pandemic, and over half modifying their provision (usually to provide the service remotely). Complex funding streams, poor communication between primary and secondary care, and lack of clarity about who was responsible for referrals and follow-up were the most common problems identified. Discharge documentation was described as poor and lacking key information. Both groups mentioned difficulties accessing services in the community. Conclusions: The pandemic has highlighted long-standing issues of continuity of care and complex funding streams for post-ICU follow-up care. The large cohort of ICU patients admitted due to COVID-19 highlights the need for improved follow-up services and communication between specialists and GPs, not only for COVID-19 patients, but for all those discharged from ICU.","Castro-Avila, A.
