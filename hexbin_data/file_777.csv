32731,Reprise du sport de loisir en sortie de confinement,2020-05-21,"The ability to predict protein–protein interactions is crucial to our understanding of a wide range of biological activities and functions in the human body, and for guiding drug discovery. Despite considerable efforts to develop suitable computational methods, predicting protein–protein interaction binding affinity changes following mutation (ΔΔG) remains a severe challenge. Algebraic topology, a champion in recent worldwide competitions for protein–ligand binding affinity predictions, is a promising approach to simplifying the complexity of biological structures. Here we introduce element- and site-specific persistent homology (a new branch of algebraic topology) to simplify the structural complexity of protein–protein complexes and embed crucial biological information into topological invariants. We also propose a new deep learning algorithm called NetTree to take advantage of convolutional neural networks and gradient-boosting trees. A topology-based network tree is constructed by integrating the topological representation and NetTree for predicting protein–protein interaction ΔΔG. Tests on major benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed topology-based network tree is an important improvement over the current state of the art in predicting ΔΔG.","Wang, Menglun; Cang, Zixuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",Nat Mach Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223817/,777
36668,Comment maintenir une activité chirurgicale vitale en cas de crise sanitaire grave ? L’exemple de la transplantation chez l’adulte,2020-07-14,"Oral health is a crucial but often neglected aspect of rehabilitation medicine. Approximately 71% of hospitalized rehabilitation patients and 91% of hospitalized acute care patients have impaired oral health. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, cognitive decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity. Another major factor is a lack of knowledge and interest in oral problems among health care workers. Recently, new concepts have been proposed, such as oral frailty, oral sarcopenia, and hospital-associated oral problems. Oral frailty, the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality in community-dwelling older adults. Oral sarcopenia refers to sarcopenia associated with oral conditions and function, although its definition has not yet been fully discussed. Hospital-associated oral problems are caused by disease, disease treatment, surgery, endotracheal intubation, poor self-care abilities, lack of care by medical staff, drugs, and iatrogenic factors during hospitalization. Furthermore, oral problems have negative impacts on rehabilitation outcomes, which include functional recovery, length of hospital stay, discharge home, and in-hospital mortality. Oral health management provided by dental hygienists improves not only oral status and function, swallowing function, and nutritional status but also activities of daily living, discharge home, and in-hospital mortality in post-acute rehabilitation. Oral rehabilitation, promotion, education, and medical-dental collaboration can be effective interventions for oral problems and therefore are necessary to improve rehabilitation outcomes.","Shiraishi, A.; Wakabayashi, Hidetaka; Yoshimura, Y.",J Nutr Health Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7349468/,777

METHODS We conducted a prospective national-level data collection of patients treated with MT, ranging 45 days across epidemic containment measures instatement, and of patients treated during the same calendar period in 2019. The primary end point was the variation of patients receiving MT during the epidemic period. Secondary end points included care delays between onset, imaging, and groin puncture. To analyze the primary end point, we used a Poisson regression model. We then analyzed the correlation between the number of MTs and the number of COVID-19 cases hospitalizations, using the Pearson correlation coefficient (compared with the null value). RESULTS A total of 1513 patients were included at 32 centers, in all French administrative regions. There was a 21% significant decrease (0.79; [95%CI, 0.76-0.82]; P<0.001) in MT case volumes during the epidemic period, and a significant increase in delays between imaging and groin puncture, overall (mean 144.9±SD 86.8 minutes versus 126.2±70.9; P<0.001 in 2019) and in transferred patients (mean 182.6±SD 82.0 minutes versus 153.25±67; P<0.001). After the instatement of strict epidemic mitigation measures, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of hospitalizations for COVID and the number of MT cases (R2 -0.51; P=0.04). Patients treated during the COVID outbreak were less likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis and to have unwitnessed strokes (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our study showed a significant decrease in patients treated with MTs during the first stages of the COVID epidemic in France and alarming indicators of lengthened care delays. These findings prompt immediate consideration of local and regional stroke networks preparedness in the varying contexts of COVID-19 pandemic evolution.","Kerleroux, Basile; Fabacher, Thibaut; Bricout, Nicolas; Moïse, Martin; Testud, Benoit; Vingadassalom, Sivadji; Ifergan, Héloïse; Janot, Kévin; Consoli, Arturo; Ben Hassen, Wagih; Shotar, Eimad; Ognard, Julien; Charbonnier, Guillaume; L'Allinec, Vincent; Guédon, Alexis; Bolognini, Federico; Marnat, Gaultier; Forestier, Géraud; Rouchaud, Aymeric; Pop, Raoul; Raynaud, Nicolas; Zhu, François; Cortese, Jonathan; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Berge, Jérome; Escalard, Simon; Boulouis, Grégoire",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.030373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432994/,777
78063,"Use of Selected Recommended Clinical Preventive Services - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States, 2018.",2021-04-02,"Significant evidence has accumulated to support the hypothesis that hippocampal region CA1 operates as an associative mismatch detector (e.g., Hasselmo et al., 1995; Lörincz & Buzsáki, 2000; Lisman & Otmakhova, 2001; Vinogradova, 2001; Meeter et al., 2004; Lisman & Grace, 2005; Kumaran & Maguire, 2007; Duncan et al., 2009; Schiffer et al., 2012). CA1 compares predictive synaptic signals from CA3 with synaptic signals from EC3, which reflect actual sensory inputs. The new CA1 pyramidal model presented here shows that the distal-proximal segregation of synaptic inputs from EC3 versus CA3, along with other biophysical features, enable such pyramids to serve as comparators that switch output encoding from a brief burst, for a match, to prolonged tonic spiking, for a mismatch. By including often-overlooked features of CA1 pyramidal neurons, this new model allows simulation of pharmacological effects that can eliminate either the match (phasic mode) response or the mismatch (tonic mode) response. These simulations reveal that dysfunctions can arise from either too much or too little ACh stimulation of the muscarinic receptors that control KCNQ channels. Additionally, a dysfunction caused by administration of an NMDA antagonist could be rescued by simultaneous administration of a KCNQ channel agonist, such as retigabine.","Berteau, Stefan; Bullock, Daniel",Journal of neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00238.2019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609564/,777

And also, contamination of infected individuals for preventing coronavirus spreading plays a vital role. Home quarantine seems to be the best isolation solution in terms of cost and psychological health of individuals who are infected or close contacts. However, the number of quarantine violations increases day by day in many parts of the world because of the long duration of the pandemic. In this paper, a potential solution is presented for monitoring the violation of home quarantine based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies. The deep learning convolutional neural network is trained on the cloud with images of quarantine subjects for face recognition. Monitoring IoT nodes expect individuals to scan their faces at regular intervals to prevent them from leaving quarantine areas. Moreover, by measuring their body temperature regularly, unexpected rises can be detected, and this situation can be reported to health authorities.

To understand whether early ART affects HIV-1 persistence in vivo, we performed single-cell ECCITE-seq and profiled 89,279 CD4+ T cells in paired samples during viremia and after immediate versus delayed ART in six people in the randomized interventional Sabes study. We found that immediate ART partially reverted TNF responses while delayed ART did not. Antigen and TNF responses persisted despite immediate ART and shaped the transcriptional landscape of CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 RNA+ cells, and T cell clones harboring them (cloneHIV-1). Some HIV-1 RNA+ cells reside in the most clonally expanded cytotoxic T cell populations (GZMB and GZMK Th1 cells). CloneHIV-1+ were larger in clone size, persisted despite ART, and exhibited transcriptional signatures of antigen, cytotoxic effector, and cytokine responses. Using machine-learning algorithms, we identified markers for HIV-1 RNA+ cells and cloneHIV-1+ as potential therapeutic targets. Overall, by combining single-cell immune profiling and T cell expansion dynamics tracking, we identified drivers of HIV-1 persistence in vivo.","Collora, Jack A.; Pinto-Santini, Delia; Pasalar, Siavash; Ravindra, Neal; Ganoza, Carmela; Lama, Javier; Alfaro, Ricardo; Chiarella, Jennifer; Spudich, Serena; van Dijk, David; Duerr, Ann; Ho, Ya-Chi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.428491,777

Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. RESULTS From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway. The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests.","Zainol Rashid, Z; Othman, S N; Abdul Samat, M N; Ali, U K; Wong, K K",The Malaysian journal of pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342927/,777

Substantial research has mainly examined problems related to potential negative effects of video games ranging from sedentary screen time, exposure to violence, and excessive or problematic gaming. However, over the past two decades, the use of video games in psychotherapy has become increasingly popular with a lot of applications. SUBJECTS AND METHODS After a review of the use and the effectiveness of commercial video games in the psychotherapy framework, we will share our experience in the use of video games in a child and adolescent psychiatric unit. We will illustrate it with the presentation of specific case reports. RESULT As video games are highly popular among children and adolescents, they are also interesting tools in the psychotherapeutic work with them. It's a new kind of play therapy, considering the setting, the psychological material that expresses during the game, the interpersonal relationships between gamers, the projective representation within the avatars, the cognitive strategies within the game. CONCLUSIONS Video games represent an essential tool in taking care of child psychiatric patients because of their popularity. They contribute greatly to build the patient/psychotherapist relationship. They help to approach cognitive, emotional and social patient's functioning, and also psychopathologic understanding and then psychiatric diagnosis.","Al Husni Al Keilani, Mouna; Delvenne, Veronique",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890384/,777

193362,"Influenza vaccination coverage among health-care personnel --- United States, 2010-11 influenza season.",2011,"The avian coronavirus Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), like other coronaviruses, expresses several small nonstructural (ns) proteins in addition to those from gene 1 (replicase) and the structural proteins. These coronavirus ns genes differ both in number and in amino acid similarity between the coronavirus groups but show some concordance within a group or subgroup. The functions and requirements of the small ns gene products remain to be elucidated. With the advent of reverse genetics for coronaviruses, the first steps in elucidating their role can be investigated. We have used our reverse genetics system for IBV (R. Casais, V. Thiel, S. G. Siddell, D. Cavanagh, and P. Britton, J. Virol. 75:12359-12369, 2001) to investigate the requirement of IBV gene 5 for replication in vivo, in ovo, and ex vivo. We produced a series of recombinant viruses, with an isogenic background, in which complete expression of gene 5 products was prevented by the inactivation of gene 5 following scrambling of the transcription-associated sequence, thereby preventing the expression of IBV subgenomic mRNA 5, or scrambling either separately or together of the translation initiation codons for the two gene 5 products. As all of the recombinant viruses replicated very similarly to the wild-type virus, Beau-R, we conclude that the IBV gene 5 products are not essential for IBV replication per se and that they are accessory proteins.","Casais, Rosa; Davies, Marc; Cavanagh, David; Britton, Paul",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15956552/,777
193989,"Outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O111 infections associated with a correctional facility dairy - Colorado, 2010.",2012,"The interactions between viruses and cellular autophagy have been widely reported. On the one hand, autophagy is an important innate immune response against viral infection. On the other hand, some viruses exploit the autophagy pathway for their survival and proliferation in host cells. Vaccinia virus is a member of the family of Poxviridae which includes the smallpox virus. The biogenesis of vaccinia envelopes, including the core envelope of the immature virus (IV), is not fully understood. In this study we investigated the possible interaction between vaccinia virus and the autophagy membrane biogenesis machinery. Massive LC3 lipidation was observed in mouse fibroblast cells upon vaccinia virus infection. Surprisingly, the vaccinia virus induced LC3 lipidation was shown to be independent of ATG5 and ATG7, as the atg5 and atg7 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited the same high levels of LC3 lipidation as compared with the wild-type MEFs. Mass spectrometry and immunoblotting analyses revealed that the viral infection led to the direct conjugation of ATG3, which is the E2-like enzyme required for LC3-phosphoethanonamine conjugation, to ATG12, which is a component of the E3-like ATG12–ATG5-ATG16 complex for LC3 lipidation. Consistently, ATG3 was shown to be required for the vaccinia virus induced LC3 lipidation. Strikingly, despite the high levels of LC3 lipidation, subsequent electron microscopy showed that vaccinia virus-infected cells were devoid of autophagosomes, either in normal growth medium or upon serum and amino acid deprivation. In addition, no autophagy flux was observed in virus-infected cells. We further demonstrated that neither ATG3 nor LC3 lipidation is crucial for viral membrane biogenesis or viral proliferation and infection. Together, these results indicated that vaccinia virus does not exploit the cellular autophagic membrane biogenesis machinery for their viral membrane production. Moreover, this study demonstrated that vaccinia virus instead actively disrupts the cellular autophagy through a novel molecular mechanism that is associated with aberrant LC3 lipidation and a direct conjugation between ATG12 and ATG3.","Moloughney, Joseph G; Monken, Claude E; Tao, Hanlin; Zhang, Haiyan; Thomas, Janice D; Lattime, Edmund C; Jin, Shengkan",Autophagy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22024753/,777
197487,"Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome--worldwide, 2003.",2003,"Traditional laparoscopic suturing and knot tying requires a steep learning curve and is often the rate-limiting step in performing advanced laparoscopic gynecologic surgical procedures. It is particularly challenging due to difficulties with tissue handling and needle control while performing the procedure on a two-dimensional screen, oftentimes at unfavorable suturing angles. Automated suturing devices have greatly simplified the process and allow less-experienced surgeons to safely and efficiently perform laparoscopic suturing and knot tying. The Endo Stitch (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) is a 10-mm single-use suturing device that allows placement of multiple suture types during laparoscopic surgery, and simplifies the process of laparoscopic knot tying. The SILS Stitch (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) is based on the same technology as the Endo Stitch with the added advantage of articulation up to 75 degrees and rotation up to 360 degrees. This enables surgeons to operate in tight spaces during advanced laparoscopic procedures, and to reach tissues in their natural anatomical position rather than pulling or manipulating tissue into the suturing device. Newer technologies in laparoscopic surgery, such as the Endo Stitch and SILS Stitch, may allow gynecologic surgeons to expand their surgical repertoire of advanced laparoscopic procedures.","Hart, Stuart",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23225593/,777

Among the accessory proteins of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the 3a protein has been shown to interact with the spike, envelope, and membrane glycoprotein and has recently been established to be a structural component of capsid. Recent studies suggest that the 3a protein may function as an ion channel and may promote virus release. In order to further characterize the functional properties of this protein, we initiated studies to check its RNA binding activity. Using the yeast three-hybrid system, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking techniques, we have shown that the 3a protein is capable of binding specifically to the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the SARS virus genomic RNA. Further, we have mapped the interaction domain of the 3a protein responsible for this RNA-protein interaction using a series of deletion mutants and defined it to the central 75 amino acid region. This RNA binding motif of 3a does not share homology with any other known RNA binding protein and may have an important role in viral capsid assembly and pathogenesis.","Sharma, Kulbhushan; Surjit, Milan; Satija, Namita; Liu, Boping; Chow, Vincent T K; Lal, Sunil K",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488094/,777

229880,Séquelles de la COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine use in chronic disease management has markedly increased during health emergencies due to COVID-19. Diabetes and technologies supporting diabetes care, including glucose monitoring devices, software analyzing glucose data, and insulin delivering systems, would facilitate remote and structured disease management. Indeed, most of the currently available technologies to store and transfer web-based data to be shared with health care providers. OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided our patients the opportunity to manage their diabetes remotely by implementing technology. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 virtual visits on glycemic control parameters among patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) during the lockdown period. METHODS: This prospective observational study included T1D patients who completed 2 virtual visits during the lockdown period. The glucose outcomes that reflected the benefits of the virtual consultation were time in range (TIR), time above range, time below range, mean daily glucose, glucose management indicator (GMI), and glycemic variability. This metric was generated using specific computer programs that automatically upload data from the devices used to monitor blood or interstitial glucose levels. If needed, we changed the ongoing treatment at the first virtual visit. RESULTS: Among 209 eligible patients with T1D, 166 completed 2 virtual visits, 35 failed to download glucose data, and 8 declined the visit. Among the patients not included in the study, we observed a significantly lower proportion of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) users (n=7/43, 16% vs n=155/166, 93.4% and n=9/43, 21% vs n=128/166, 77.1%, respectively; P<.001) compared to patients who completed the study. TIR significantly increased from the first (62%, SD 18%) to the second (65%, SD 16%) virtual visit (P=.02); this increase was more marked among patients using the traditional meter (n=11; baseline TIR=55%, SD 17% and follow-up TIR=66%, SD 13%; P=.01) than among those using CGM, and in those with a baseline GMI of &#8805;7.5% (n=46; baseline TIR=45%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=53%, SD 18%; P<.001) than in those with a GMI of <7.5% (n=120; baseline TIR=68%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=69%, SD 15%; P=.98). The only variable independently associated with TIR was the change of ongoing therapy. The unstandardized beta coefficient (B) and 95% CI were 5 (95% CI 0.7-8.0) (P=.02). The type of glucose monitoring device and insulin delivery systems did not influence glucometric parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the structured virtual visits help maintain and improve glycemic control in situations where in-person visits are not feasible.","Parise, Martina; Tartaglione, Linda; Cutruzzolà, Antonio; Maiorino, Maria Ida; Esposito, Katherine; Pitocco, Dario; Gnasso, Agostino; Irace, Concetta",J Med Internet Res,,777

For the estimation of the added resistance in waves a recently introduced semi-empirical method is used. Secondly, the influence of the increase in surface roughness of the hull and propeller due to fouling is investigated, reflecting the actual condition of a ship in service. The results show that even if ships are fulfilling the IMO 2013 Guideline, they may become unsafe in operation. Lastly, the uncertainties involved in the assessment procedure are discussed. The investigation conducted is particularly of interest for the assessment of the safety of ships now being idle or used as floating storage due to the impact of the pandemic COVID-19 on the world economy, while they are expected to go again into service once the demand for transport recovers.","Liu, Shukui; Papanikolaou, Apostolos; Bezunartea-Barrio, Ana; Shang, Baoguo; Sreedharan, Maya",Biofouling,,777
305392,Port du masque contre la COVID-19 : un geste obligatoire et non aléatoire,2020,"This article examines the factors restricting an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon. It argues that structural adjustment policies in the 1980s and 1990s as well as corruption and limited investment in recent times have severely weakened the country's health system. This article also emphasises the interconnection between poverty, slums, and COVID-19. This interconnection brings to the fore inequality in Cameroon. Arguably, this inequality could facilitate the spread of COVID-19 in the country. This article draws attention to the political forces shaping the response to the pandemic and contends that in some regions in the country, the lack of an effective response to the pandemic may not necessarily be due to a lack of resources. In so doing, it critiques the COVID-19 orthodoxy that focuses exclusively on the pathology of the disease and advocates ""technical"" solutions to the pandemic, while ignoring the political and socio-economic forces that shape the fight against the pandemic. At times, medical supplies and other forms of assistance may be available, but structural violence impairs access to these resources. Politics must be brought into the COVID-19 discourse, as it shapes the response to the pandemic.","Ojong, Nathanael",,,777

PURPOSE: This study compares the standardized assessment test scores of prelicensure nursing students who completed their pediatric clinical practicum in person for both the clinical and simulation practice settings versus virtually. METHODS: This study included 186 students in a pediatric clinical course. Half the students completed in-person pediatric clinical practice and simulation, and half the students used i-Human to complete their pediatric clinical practicum virtually. Scores on the Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI) Nursing Care of Children examination were compared using independent-samples t tests. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in ATI scores between students who completed their pediatric clinical practicum in the clinical setting compared with virtually (P = .485; 95% confidence interval, -2.24 to 4.71). CONCLUSIONS: Using the i-Human platform, along with prebriefing and debriefing, is an effective pedagogical approach to simulating a pediatric clinical practicum.","Weston, Jeannie; Zauche, Lauren Head",Nurse educ,,777

Here we examine differences in vulnerability to COVID-19 among the ten administrative regions and two major cities of Cameroon based on epidemiological risk factors and access to healthcare resources. Methods: regional epidemiological and healthcare access vulnerability indices were created and compared with cumulative COVID-19 cases, case fatality rates, co-morbidities, and healthcare resources in Cameroon. Results: based on epidemiological risk factors, populations in the East Region, Douala (in the Littoral Region), West Region, and Yaoundé (in the Center Region) are at highest risk for COVID-19. Meanwhile, the North, Far North, East, and Adamawa Regions had the most healthcare access vulnerability. COVID-19 cases per population were highest in the Center, Littoral, and East Regions. Case fatality rates were greatest in the North Region. Potential co-morbidities with greater prevalence among COVID-19 patients included male sex, hypertension, and diabetes. Conclusion: epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19 and access to healthcare varies between the regions of Cameroon. These discrepancies are potentially reflected in regional differences of COVID-19 cases and case fatality rates. In particular, the East Region has high epidemiological risk factors and low healthcare accessibility compared to other regions. Understanding the relationships between epidemiological risk factors, access to healthcare resources, and COVID-19 cases in Cameroon could aid decision-making among national policymakers and inform further research.","Judson, Seth David; Njabo, Kevin Yana; Torimiro, Judith Ndongo",Pan Afr Med J,,777

The response/recovery speed of the sensor is 270 ms/298 ms for fast breathing and only 6 ms/7 ms when a finger touched the sensor surface. This sensor showed excellent potential for the monitoring of different breathing patterns such as normal, deep, fast and relaxed. It also demonstrated the capability to detect skin evaporation in a non-contact mode, exhibiting future prospects for developing next-generation tools/devices such as smart touchless switches and screens.

Using a maximum variation strategy, participants with a range of sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity levels, and perceptions of seriousness and anxiety related to COVID-19 were selected. Semi-structured interviews captured participant perceptions of how their physical activity and perceptions of health changed during the pandemic. Using thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (1) Disruption to Daily Routines, (2) Changes in Physical Activity, (3) Balancing Health, and (4) Family Life. Participants experienced different degrees of disruption in their daily routines and physical activity based on their individual circumstances (e.g., pre-pandemic physical activity, family life, and access to resources). Although participants faced challenges in modifying their daily routines and physical activity, many adapted. Some participants reported enhanced feelings of well-being.

We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups. Future studies will have to address if this stereotyped B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 emerging from unmutated antibody rearrangements will create long-lived memory.","Paschold, Lisa; Simnica, Donjete; Willscher, Edith; Vehreschild, Maria Jgt; Dutzmann, Jochen; Sedding, Daniel G; Schultheiß, Christoph; Binder, Mascha",J. clin. invest,,777

We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in <20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay.

We provide a novel empirical Bayes framework to mitigate both under-selection problems in standard high-dimensional methods and over-selection issues in recent proposals, by learning whether each control's inclusion should be encouraged or discouraged. We develop efficient gradient-based and Expectation-Propagation model-fitting algorithms to render the approach practical for a wide class of models. A motivating problem is to estimate the salary gap evolution in recent years in relation to potentially discriminatory characteristics such as gender, race, ethnicity and place of birth. We found that, albeit smaller, some wage differences remained for female and black individuals. A similar trend is observed when analyzing the joint contribution of these factors to deviations from the average salary.

The preclass preparation resources and the active learning materials that were already in place for flipped teaching were helpful in the transition to solely online teaching. Therefore, the focus during the transition was to reconfigure active learning and examinations from the face-to-face format to the online platform. Instead of small group discussions in the classroom, teams interacted in Zoom Breakout Rooms. Rather than taking exams in-person during scheduled class time, students submitted exams online. Additionally, students prerecorded their project presentations instead of presenting them ""live"" during the last week of classes.

METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed for adult PWE both online and at a tertiary epilepsy center after the end of a national lockdown in Lithuania. PWE were asked to evaluate their health status during the lockdown and estimate changes in their seizure patterns. Additional questions concerned the accessibility and quality of epilepsy-related consultations. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 143 PWE (59 [41.3%] male, mean age 35.1â¯±â¯13.4â¯years), 94 (65.7%) completed the survey in person, 49 (34.3%) - online. A deterioration in reported physical and mental health during lockdown was observed (Zâ¯=â¯-4.604, pâ¯<â¯0.0001 and Zâ¯=â¯-4.253, pâ¯<â¯0.0001, respectively) and 22 (15.4%) PWE reported seizure exacerbation. In an ordinal logistic regression model (analysis of data from all participants), baseline seizure frequency (bâ¯=â¯0.413, pâ¯=â¯0.031), reported physical health before lockdown (bâ¯=â¯-0.462, pâ¯=â¯0.031) and the ease of proper antiepileptic drug (AED) use during the imposed restrictions (bâ¯=â¯-0.535, pâ¯=â¯0.006) were statistically significant variables associated with changes in seizure frequency. The latter were not affected by modifications in AED use (Mann-Whitney Uâ¯=â¯1127.0, pâ¯=â¯0.307) irrespective of the data collection method. With teleconsultations being predominant during the lockdown, an overall decline in the quality of epilepsy-related consultations was observed (Zâ¯=â¯-2.895, pâ¯=â¯0.004). Among all participants, 46 (32.2%) lost an epilepsy-related consultation or medical service because of the lockdown. This loss was found to be associated with seizure exacerbation (Mann-Whitney Uâ¯=â¯1622.5, pâ¯=â¯0.046). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that a national COVID-19 lockdown may have led to worse seizure control and health status in some PWE. Easy access to AEDs and their appropriate use may be especially useful to prevent seizure exacerbation during strict COVID-19 restrictions. The quality and accessibility of remote epilepsy-related consultations was suboptimal and may require further improvement during disruption of in-person services.","Puteikis, Kristijonas; Jasionis, Arminas; Mameniskiene, Ruta",Epilepsy Behav,,777

Specifically, we investigate the ability of ESN in predicting the burst synchronization of an ensemble of Rulkov neurons placed on a scale-free network. We have shown that a limited number of nodal dynamics used as input in the machine can capture the real trend of burst synchronization in this network. Further, we investigate on the proper selection of nodal inputs of degree-degree (positive and negative) correlated networks. We show that for a disassortative network, selection of different input nodes based on degree has no significant role in machine's prediction. However, in the case of assortative network, training the machine with the information (i.e time series) of low-degree nodes gives better results in predicting the burst synchronization. Finally, we explain the underlying mechanism responsible for observing this differences in prediction in a degree correlated network.","Roy, Mousumi; Senapati, Abhishek; Poria, Swarup; Mishra, Arindam; Hens, Chittaranjan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05139v2.pdf,777

Exemple du vaccin pour la COVID-19» par Pascal Demoly*,2021-02-10,"Immune responses to respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 originate and function in the lung, yet assessments of human immunity are often limited to blood. Here, we conducted longitudinal, high-dimensional profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19, revealing immune processes in the respiratory tract linked to disease pathogenesis. Survival from severe disease was associated with increased CD4+T cells and decreased monocyte/macrophage frequencies in the airway, but not in blood. Airway T cells and macrophages exhibited tissue-resident phenotypes and activation signatures, including high level expression and secretion of monocyte chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL3 by airway macrophages. By contrast, monocytes in blood expressed the CCL2-receptor CCR2 and aberrant CD163+ and immature phenotypes. Extensive accumulation of CD163+monocyte/macrophages within alveolar spaces in COVID-19 lung autopsies suggested recruitment from circulation. Our findings provide evidence that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by respiratory immunity, and rationale for site-specific treatment and prevention strategies.","Szabo, P. A.; Dogra, P.; Gray, J.

621208,Safe visiting is essential for nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic: an international perspective,2021-02-26,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The high adaptation and recombination abilities of infectious bronchitis virus (IB) have been proven. This study aims to verify the genetic and antigenic variation of eight field IB strains regarding the 4/91 strain vaccination in Chilean chickens. Phylogenetic, serologic and challenge studies were carried out to accomplish this goal. The genetic analyses indicate that all the viruses isolated prior to the 4/91 introduction belong to the genetic group GI-16 (three isolates from 2009). On the other hand, just one of the viruses isolated after the 4/91 strain vaccine introduction in Chile (in 2015) showed relationship with GI-16 lineage. The remaining four viruses (from 2017) belong to GI-13, the group where the strain 4/91 has been previously classified. Three viruses were chosen to perform antigenic and protective studies. Antigenically, the high relationship between the 4/91 vaccine with the isolate from 2017 is remarkable and could not be observed with isolates from 2009 and 2015. The 4/91 vaccine also showed better protection against the isolate from 2017 than isolates from 2009 and 2015. These results suggest that the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine in Chile could imply a change in some viruses, showing its ability to interact with field viruses, so it is important to monitor the circulating viruses and include these results in future governmental decisions. ABSTRACT: The introduction of the 4/91 vaccine against infectious bronchitis in Chile, a lineage not described until that time in the country, led to looking for changes induced by this action. This study considers eight isolates obtained from 2009, 2015 and 2017 and uses a maximum likelihood approach to classify the field isolates. Three isolates were selected to analyze antigenic relationships through a virus neutralization test and to perform protection tests measured trough an RT-qPCR. The isolates from 2009 and 2015 showed a relationship with GI-16 while those from 2017 were related to GI-13. Though the field isolates were classified in two different phylogenetic lineages, all of them showed only minor variations in subtype. The 13885R-17 isolate from 2017 exhibited high antigenic relatedness to the 4/91 vaccine. As expected, 4/91 and Massachusetts vaccines were not antigenically related. Vaccinated birds with the 4/91 vaccine showed less tracheal virus replication for the 13885R-17 from 2017 challenge than for the 12101SP-09 from 2009 and 13347SP-15 from 2015 isolates. The results indicated genetic and antigenic diversity in the most recent infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates in Chile. Moreover, the 4/91 vaccine would be involved in the generation of some current field viruses, which must be considered in vaccination programs and public policies.","Guzmán, Miguel; Sáenz, Leonardo; Hidalgo, Héctor",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491868/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9090656,777
629105,L’utilisation de Smartphones pour le suivi du déconfinement du Covid-19 en France,2020-05-26,"There are important scientific, legal and ethical reasons for optimising the quality of animal research and testing. Concerns about the reproducibility and translatability of animal studies are now being voiced not only by those opposed to animal use, but also by scientists themselves. Many of the attempts to improve reproducibility have, until recently, focused on ways in which the reporting of animal studies can be improved. Many reporting guidelines have been written. Better reporting cannot, however, improve the quality of work that has already been carried out - for this purpose better planning is required. Planning animal studies should involve close collaboration with the animal facility where the work is to be performed, from as early a stage as possible. In this way, weaknesses in the protocol will be detected and changes can be made before it is too late. Improved planning must focus on more than the “mathematical” elements of experimental design such as randomisation, blinding and statistical methods. This should include focus on practical details such as the standard of the facility, any need for education and training, and all the factors which can improve animal welfare. The PREPARE (Planning Research and Experimental Procedures on Animals: Recommendations for Excellence) checklist was developed to help scientists be more aware of all the issues which may affect their experiments. The checklist is supported by comprehensive webpages containing more information, with links to the latest resources that have been developed for each topic on the list.","Smith, Adrian J.",Lab Anim Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665911/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s42826-020-00054-0,777

Methods: We included all the patients with dyslipidemia followed at an Endocrinology Department. We analysed age, gender, number of appointments, lipid profile (triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol), fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and uric acid. We compared the results between the years 2019 and 2020 in the period of March to December. Data were obtained from clinical records. Descriptive statistics were applied and the results are presented by the mean and standard deviation. Statistical significance was accepted for p <0.05. Results: We included 755 patients, 446 (59,1%) were male, age at diagnosis was 63.1±13.1 years and follow up time was 12.3±7.8 years. Five-hundred thirty two patients (70.5%) had type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Coronary artery disease was found in 11.1% of the patients, peripheral arterial disease in 8.9% and cerebrovascular disease in 7.9%. In 2020 patients had less appointments (2.1 vs 3.4;p<0.001). The mean TC was lower in 2020 (175.3±42.4 vs 179.8±44.9mg/dL;p<0.01) as well as LDL cholesterol (93.8±35.9 vs 98.3±30.2mg/dL;p<0.01), non-HDL cholesterol (122.2±41.5 vs 128.7±43.7mg/dL;p<0.01), HbA1c (7.4±1.2 vs 7.6±1.3%;p<0.01) and fasting blood glucose (140.46±49.2 vs 145.3±57.7mg/dL;p=0.026). The mean HDL cholesterol, TG and acid uric were similar between both years. Conclusions: In our sample, we found that despite a lower number of consultations during the pandemic we obtained lower values of TC, LDL cholesterol, non–HDL cholesterol, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose.","Silva, E.M.M.; Marques, B.; Cunha, C.; Ferreira, R.; Bello, C.; Limbert, C.; Azinheira, J.; Duarte, S.",Atherosclerosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2021.06.511; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915021007838; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021915021007838,777

The present study describes how crime has changed in Sweden during ten weeks after the government started to implement interventions to reduce spread of the disease. Sweden has undertaken smaller interventions than many other countries and is therefore a particularly interesting case to study. The first major interventions in Sweden were implemented in the end of week 11 (March 12th) in the year 2020, and we analyze police reported crimes through week 21 (ending May 24th). Descriptive statistics are provided relative to expected levels with 95% confidence intervals for eight crime types. We find that total crime, assaults, pickpocketing and burglary have decreased significantly, personal robberies and narcotics crime are unchanged. Vandalism possibly increased somewhat but is hard to draw any firm conclusions on. The reductions are fairly small for most crime types, in the 5–20% range, with pickpocketing being the biggest exception noting a 59% drop relative to expected levels.","Gerell, Manne; Kardell, Johan; Kindgren, Johanna",Crime Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072489/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-020-00128-3,777

Experimental evolution has shown that the evolutionary path of microbes can be extraordinarily reproducible. Here, using experimental evolution in two circulating SARS-CoV-2, we estimate its mutation rate and demonstrate the repeatability of its evolution when facing a new cell type but no immune or drug pressures. We estimate a genomic mutation rate of 3.7×10-6 nt-1 cycle-1 for a lineage of SARS-CoV-2 with the originally described spike protein (CoV-2-D) and of 2.9×10-6 nt-1 cycle-1 for a lineage carrying the D614G mutation that has spread worldwide (CoV-2-G). We further show that mutation accumulation is heterogeneous along the genome, with the spike gene accumulating mutations at a mean rate 16×10-6 nt-1 per infection cycle across backgrounds, five-fold higher than the genomic average. We observe the emergence of mutators in the CoV-2-G background, likely linked to mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and/or in the error-correcting exonuclease protein. Despite strong bottlenecks, several de novo mutations spread to high frequencies by selection and considerable convergent evolution in spike occurs. These results demonstrate the high adaptive potential of SARS-CoV-2 during the first stages of cell infection in the absence of immune surveillance.","Borges, Vítor; Alves, Maria João; Amicone, Massimo; Isidro, Joana; Zé-Zé, Líbia; Duarte, Sílvia; Vieira, Luís; Guiomar, Raquel; Gomes, João Paulo; Gordo, Isabel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.444774,777

The RVP Fast v2 assay detected 30/61 (49.2%) hAdv infections that had been identified by real-time qPCR, demonstrating a significantly lower detection rate (p < 0.001). The sensitivity of the RVP Fast v2 assay in comparison to qPCR was lower in younger children (42.9% vs. 57.7%; Cohen’s kappa coefficient, 0.53); in samples with co-infections (40.0% vs. 56.7%; Cohen’s kappa coefficient, 0.52); and in samples with hAdv type C (45.9% vs. 57.1%; Cohen’s kappa coefficient, 0.60). Samples with lower viral loads were associated with a significantly lower sensitivity of the RVP Fast v2 assay (35.1% vs. 68.2%, p = 0.01; Cohen’s kappa coefficients, 0.49). The RVP Fast v2 assay has important limitations for the detection of hAdv and cannot be used to evaluate whether hAdvs are the main etiologic agent responsible for an outbreak or when epidemiological studies are performed.","Esposito, Susanna; Scala, Alessia; Bianchini, Sonia; Zampiero, Alberto; Fossali, Emilio; Principi, Nicola",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17030297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927078/,777

While EM is typically preceded by viral infections, most notably herpes simplex virus (HSV), and certain medications, a large portion of cases are due to an unidentifiable cause. EM can be confused with other more serious conditions like Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS); however, clinical research has provided significant evidence to classify EM and SJS as separate disorders. Treatment of EM is highly variable, depending on the etiology, the involvement of mucosal sites, and the chronicity (acute vs. recurring) of the disease. If the etiology or causal medication/infection is identified, then the medication is stopped and/or the infection is treated prior to initiating symptomatic treatment. Treatment for acute EM is focused on relieving symptoms with topical steroids or antihistamines. Treatment for recurrent EM is most successful when tailored to individual patients. First line treatment for recurrent EM includes both systemic and topical therapies. Systemic therapies include corticosteroid therapy and antiviral prophylaxis. Topical therapies include high-potency corticosteroids, and antiseptic or anesthetic solutions for mucosal involvement. Second-line therapies for patients who do not respond to antiviral medications include immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics, anthelmintics, and antimalarials","Soares, Alexa; Sokumbi, Olayemi",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57090921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577844/,777
