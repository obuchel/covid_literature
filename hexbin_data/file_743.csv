60852,60852,60852,COVID-19 Australia: Epidemiology Report 43 Reporting period ending 6 June 2021 - Reporting period ending 6 June 2021.,12.246418,-0.13595608,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a common problem which carries a risk of neurotoxicity. Certain infants who have hyperbilirubinaemia develop bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus which may lead to long-term disability. Phototherapy is currently the mainstay of treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. Among the adjunctive measures to compliment the effects of phototherapy, fluid supplementation has been proposed to reduce serum bilirubin levels. The mechanism of action proposed includes direct dilutional effects of intravenous (IV) fluids, or enhancement of peristalsis to reduce enterohepatic circulation by oral fluid supplementation. OBJECTIVES To assess the risks and benefits of fluid supplementation compared to standard fluid management in term and preterm newborn infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia who require phototherapy. SEARCH METHODS We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 7 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 7 June 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 7 June 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials that compared fluid supplementation against no fluid supplementation, or one form of fluid supplementation against another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group using the Covidence platform. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS Out of 1449 articles screened, seven studies were included. Three articles were awaiting classification, among them, two completed trials identified from the trial registry appeared to be unpublished so far.There were two major comparisons: IV fluid supplementation versus no fluid supplementation (six studies) and IV fluid supplementation versus oral fluid supplementation (one study). A total of 494 term, healthy newborn infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia were evaluated. All studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of care personnel, five studies had unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors, and most studies had unclear risk of bias in allocation concealment. There was low- to moderate-quality evidence for all major outcomes.In the comparison between IV fluid supplementation and no supplementation, no infant in either group developed bilirubin encephalopathy in the one study that reported this outcome. Serum bilirubin was lower at four hours postintervention for infants who received IV fluid supplementation (MD -34.00 μmol/L (-1.99 mg/dL), 95% CI -52.29 (3.06) to -15.71 (0.92); participants = 67, study = 1) (low quality of evidence, downgraded one level for indirectness and one level for suspected publication bias). Beyond eight hours postintervention, serum bilirubin was similar between the two groups. Duration of phototherapy was significantly shorter for fluid-supplemented infants, but the estimate was affected by heterogeneity which was not clearly explained (MD -10.70 hours, 95% CI -15.55 to -5.85; participants = 218; studies = 3; I² = 67%). Fluid-supplemented infants were less likely to require exchange transfusion (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.71; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02; participants = 462; studies = 6; I² = 72%) (low quality of evidence, downgraded one level due to inconsistency, and another level due to suspected publication bias), and the estimate was similarly affected by unexplained heterogeneity. The frequencies of breastfeeding were similar between the fluid-supplemented and non-supplemented infants in days one to three based on one study (estimate on day three: MD 0.90 feeds, 95% CI -0.40 to 2.20; participants = 60) (moderate quality of evidence, downgraded one level for imprecision).One study contributed to all outcome data in the comparison of IV versus oral fluid supplementation. In this comparison, no infant in either group developed abnormal neurological signs. Serum bilirubin, as well as the rate of change of serum bilirubin, were similar between the two groups at four hours after phototherapy (serum bilirubin: MD 11.00 μmol/L (0.64 mg/dL), 95% CI -21.58 (-1.26) to 43.58 (2.55); rate of change of serum bilirubin: MD 0.80 μmol/L/hour (0.05 mg/dL/hour), 95% CI -2.55 (-0.15) to 4.15 (0.24); participants = 54 in both outcomes) (moderate quality of evidence for both outcomes, downgraded one level for indirectness). The number of infants who required exchange transfusion was similar between the two groups (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.27; RD 0.11, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.34; participants = 54). No infant in either group developed adverse effects including vomiting or abdominal distension. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is no evidence that IV fluid supplementation affects important clinical outcomes such as bilirubin encephalopathy, kernicterus, or cerebral palsy in healthy, term newborn infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia requiring phototherapy. In this review, no infant developed these bilirubin-associated clinical complications. Low- to moderate-quality evidence shows that there are differences in total serum bilirubin levels between fluid-supplemented and control groups at some time points but not at others, the clinical significance of which is uncertain. There is no evidence of a difference between the effectiveness of IV and oral fluid supplementations in reducing serum bilirubin. Similarly, no infant developed adverse events or complications from fluid supplementation such as vomiting or abdominal distension. This suggests a need for future research to focus on different population groups with possibly higher baseline risks of bilirubin-related neurological complications, such as preterm or low birthweight infants, infants with haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia, as well as infants with dehydration for comparison of different fluid supplementation regimen.","Lai, Nai Ming; Ahmad Kamar, Azanna; Choo, Yao Mun; Kong, Juin Yee; Ngim, Chin Fang",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,743,1

Methods : A retrospective cohort analysis of all patients who presented to the Ophthalmology department of Royal Hallamshire Hospital Sheffield with serious ocular trauma during the COVID-19 lockdown period was performed. Data on mechanism of injury and date of injury, presentation, and surgical repair were collected. This process was repeated for the same dates in the previous 5 years for comparison. Results : During the COVID-19 lockdown period, we saw 10 cases of serious ocular trauma (4 globe ruptures, 4 full-thickness lid lacerations, and 2 intra-ocular foreign bodies). This is 3.33 times the average number of cases over the previous 5 years. The delay between injury and presentation rose to 1.1 days compared to 0.33 days pre-COVID; however, the time taken between presentation to surgery was only slightly affected (12 hours in 2020 compared to 11.38 hours pre-COVID). Conclusion : During the COVID-19 lockdown, the number of serious ocular trauma cases was more than three times the average of the previous 5 years. This increase is partially due to more DIY injuries as people stayed at home, but also surprisingly an increase in falls. There did appear to be a longer delay between injury and presentation, suggesting that patients were reluctant to come into hospital during the pandemic. Surgery was performed within 12 hours on average for both groups, reassuringly indicating that sight-saving surgery was not delayed despite extraordinary circumstances.","Stedman, Emily N; Jefferis, Joanna M; Tan, Jennifer H",Ophthalmic epidemiology,743,0

Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), an end-product of RAS, is recognized by its cardiovascular protective properties through stimulation of the Mas receptor, including vasodilation, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive actions, and consequently, counter-regulating the well-known Ang II-elicited actions. The overall hypothesis of this study is that Ang-(1-7) inhibits Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), via regulation of mitogen-activated protein phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) activity. Aortas from male Wistar rats were incubated with Ang-(1-7) or vehicle. Concentration-response curves to Ang II were performed in endothelium-denuded aortas, in the presence or absence of ERK1/2 (PD98059) inhibitor or Mas receptor (A-779) antagonist. Expression of proteins was assessed by western blot, and immunohistochemistry was conducted in VSMCs. Ang-(1-7) incubation decreased Ang II-induced contractile response in aortas, and this effect was not observed in the presence of PD98059 or A-779. Stimulation of VSMCs with Ang-(1-7) prevented Ang II-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but not C-Raf-activation. Furthermore, Ang II decreased MKP-1 phosphorylation in VSMCs. Interestingly, simultaneous incubation of Ang-(1-7) with Ang II favored MKP-1 phosphorylation, negatively modulating ERK1/2 activation in VSMCs. The results suggest that Ang-(1-7) counter-regulates actions evoked by Ang II overproduction, as observed in cardiovascular diseases, mainly by modulating MKP-1 activity. This evidence suggests that the role of Ang-(1-7) in MKP-1-regulation represents a target for new therapeutic development.","Sousa-Lopes, Alejandra; de Freitas, Raiany Alves; Carneiro, Fernando Silva; Nunes, Kenia Pedrosa; Allahdadi, Kyan James; Webb, Robert Clinton; Tostes, Rita de Cassia; Giachini, Fernanda Regina; Lima, Victor Vitorino",International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,743,24

Other factors, such as sex, also play an important role in determining behavioral and neurochemical responses to drugs of abuse. In these studies, we sought to develop a protocol for vaporized e-cigarette nicotine self-administration in rats, as a foundation to better understand the differing effects of nicotine exposure routes on behavior and physiological function. We report a novel method that elicits robust nicotine vapor self-administration in male and female rats. Our findings indicate that 5-mg/ml nicotine vape solution provides a high level of consistency in lever-pressing behavior for both males and females. Moreover, in male rats, we find that such e-cigarette nicotine vapor induces similar blood levels of nicotine's main metabolite, cotinine, as that found with intravenous nicotine self-administration. Therefore, the breathing pattern during vapor exposure in males leads to similar levels of titrated nicotine intake as with intravenous nicotine self-administration. Interestingly, a differential effect was found in the females, in which the same conditions of vapor exposure led to decreased cotinine levels with vapor compared to intravenous self-administration. Finally, differences in nicotine-mediated locomotion provide further support of the physiological effects of e-cigarette vapor inhalation. Taken together, our findings reveal important sex differences in nicotine intake based on the route of exposure, and we further establish a protocol for nicotine vapor self-administration in rats.","Lallai, Valeria; Chen, Yen-Chu; Roybal, Mikayla M; Kotha, Eashan R; Fowler, James P; Staben, Andres; Cortez, Angelique; Fowler, Christie D",Addiction biology,743,19

METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of all adult patients who underwent colonoscopies for LGIB at our hospital system between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019. A statistical model was built on a cohort of 5195 cases using multiple logistic regressions to predict the detection of various colonoscopy findings and the use of different colonoscopy maneuvers. The model was converted into a risk scoring system, named the TYPICAL Index, and was validated against a separate cohort of 914 cases. RESULTS Active bleeding was only seen in 3.8% of colonoscopies performed for LGIB and endoscopic hemostasis was applied in 43.7% of actively bleeding lesions. Malignant-appearing lesions were detected in 2.5% of LGIB procedures and all cases of proximal colonic mass were identified in subjects age above 60. The TYPICAL Index, derived from age, gender, hemoglobin, creatinine, international normalized ratio, and prior colonoscopy for LGIB has a concordance statistic of 0.71 and a negative predictive value of 93.8% for potential bleeding sources requiring hemostasis, malignant-appearing lesions, or active bleeding on colonoscopy when applied using a threshold of 6. CONCLUSIONS Active bleeding and malignancies are rarely encountered and endoscopic hemostasis is seldom required during colonoscopy performed for LGIB. We developed and validated a risk scoring system to identify cases of low predicted diagnostic and therapeutic yield and to guide clinical decision-making.","Chung, Waihong; Rich, Harlan; Wands, Jack",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,743,1

When prevention and control of COVID-19 is gradually normalized, communication between countries needs to be gradually restored due to development needs. There are 34 vaccines in the clinical evaluation stage and 145 vaccines in the preclinical evaluation stage in the global COVID-19 vaccine research and development program, but the rate and process of vaccination may not be sufficient to meet the current needs of society for restoring development and communication. Studies have found that chloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir and other drugs are useful for COVID-19, but currently there is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The main detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 at present include pathogenic detection methods, molecular biology detection methods and antibody detection, of which molecular biology detection technology is the main detection method at present. There are some more convenient and rapid detection methods. A study showed that salivary nucleic acid testing could be used for large-scale screening of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results showed that the probability of true concordance between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva was stubbornly 0.998 (90% CI: 0.996-0.999). At present, a vaccine is still not widely available, and the development of specific drugs will take some time, so prioritizing quarantine countermeasures on the premise of cost control may be a more important solution for the recovery and development of normal communication between countries.","Zhu, Han; Lu, Hongzhou",Bioscience trends,743,1

SPAs are widely used in biotechnology, as therapeutic agents, they are physiologically relevant and regulate development of the natural hosts. During genome evolutionary analysis of Streptomyces lividans 66 we identified an NRPS-like biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that lacked a condensation (C) domain but included a tRNA-Utilizing Enzyme (tRUE) belonging to the leucyl/phenylalanyl (L/F) transferase family. This system was predicted to direct the synthesis of a novel SPA with protease inhibitory activity, called livipeptin. Following genome mining and phylogenomic analyses we confirmed the presence of tRUEs within diverse Streptomyces genomes, including fusions with a C-minus NRPS-like protein. We further demonstrate functional cooperation between these enzymes and provide the biosynthetic rules for the synthesis of livipeptin, expanding the known universe of acetyl-leu/phe-arginal SPAs. The L/F-transferase C-minus NRPS productive interaction was shown to be tRNA-dependent after semisynthetic assays in the presence of RNAse, which contrasts with leupeptin, an acetyl-leu-arginal SPA that we show to be produced by Streptomyces roseous ATCC 31245 via a tRUE-minus BGC with multiple complete NRPSs. Thus, livipeptin and leupeptin are the result of convergent evolution, which has driven the appearance of unprecedented biosynthetic logics directing the synthesis of protease inhibitors thought to be at the core of Streptomyces colony biology. Our results pave the way for understanding this Streptomyces trait, as well as for the discovery of novel natural products following evolutionary genome mining approaches. Abstract importance Convergent evolution in microbiology is believed to be highly recurrent yet examples that have been comprehensively characterized are scarce. Proteases inhibition by small peptide aldehydes is at the core of many microbiological processes, both within the cell and during colony development, and in microbial ecology. Here we report the biosynthetic foundations of leupeptin, the main Streptomyces protease inhibitor, and of livipeptin, a protease inhibitor produced by Streptomyces lividans. Although these peptides belong to the same chemical class, here we show that their biosynthetic routes result from convergent evolution, as they involve unrelated biosynthetic mechanisms, including the recruitment of a tRNA-utilizing enzyme that functionally replaces the condensation domain of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase during livipeptin biosynthesis. Thus, these results pave the way for understanding Streptomyces protease inhibitors as a trait and provide unprecedented knowledge for genome mining of natural products and synthetic biology where proteases inhibition is desirable.","Aguilar, César; Verdel-Aranda, Karina; Ramos-Aboites, Hilda E.; Morales, Marco Antonio; Licona-Cassani, Cuauhtémoc; Barona-Gómez, Francisco",bioRxiv,743,24

The reliability of the synthesized evidence depends highly on the methodological quality of a systematic review and meta-analysis. In recent years, several tools have been developed to guide the reporting and evidence appraisal of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and much statistical effort has been paid to improve their methodological quality. Nevertheless, many contemporary meta-analyses continue to employ conventional statistical methods, which may be suboptimal compared with several alternative methods available in the evidence synthesis literature. Based on a recent systematic review on COVID-19 in pregnancy, this article provides an overview of select good practices for performing meta-analyses from statistical perspectives. Specifically, we suggest meta-analysts (1) providing sufficient information of included studies, (2) providing information for reproducibility of meta-analyses, (3) using appropriate terminologies, (4) double-checking presented results, (5) considering alternative estimators of between-study variance, (6) considering alternative confidence intervals, (7) reporting prediction intervals, (8) assessing small-study effects whenever possible, and (9) considering one-stage methods. We use worked examples to illustrate these good practices. Relevant statistical code is also provided. The conventional and alternative methods could produce noticeably different point and interval estimates in some meta-analyses and thus affect their conclusions. In such cases, researchers should interpret the results from conventional methods with great caution and consider using alternative methods.","Zhao, Yuxi Lin Lifeng",BioMedInformatics,743,6

While most disruptions originate upstream to a firm’s immediate suppliers, unfortunately, most firms still lack visibility into the deeper tiers of the supply network. Beyond this, the extant literature on network resilience is mostly focused on simplistic static network analysis methods. We propose an effective method for resilience assessment of deep-tier supply networks. The proposed framework relies on discrete-event simulation informed by secondary data sources and global supply risk assessment/metric databases for improving the assessment of resilience for a firm. We also demonstrate that deep-tier visibility can be critical for effective resilience assessment of global networks. We validate the efficiency of the proposed method using a case-study informed by a real-world automotive supply network.

The search for newer and better vaccines for TB is an ongoing endeavor and latest results from trials of candidate TB vaccines such as M72AS01 look promising. However, recent encouraging data from BCG revaccination trials in adults combined with studies on mucosal and intravenous routes of BCG vaccination in non-human primate models have renewed interest in BCG for TB prevention. In addition, several well-demonstrated non-specific effects of BCG, for example, prevention of viral and respiratory infections, give BCG an added advantage. Also, BCG vaccination is currently being widely tested in human clinical trials to determine whether it protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or death with detailed analyses and outcomes from several ongoing trials across the world awaited. Through this review, we attempt to bring together information on various aspects of the BCG-induced immune response, its efficacy in TB control, comparison with other candidate TB vaccines and strategies to improve its efficiency including revaccination and alternate routes of administration. Finally, we discuss the future relevance of BCG use especially in light of its several heterologous benefits.","Ahmed, Asma; Rakshit, Srabanti; Adiga, Vasista; Dias, Mary; Dwarkanath, Pratibha; D039,; Souza, George; Vyakarnam, Annapurna",Immunol Rev,743,11

In this paper, we propose a simple linear-time algorithm for the construction of the original eBWT, which does not require the preprocessing of Bannai et al. [CPM 2021]. As a byproduct, we obtain the first linear-time algorithm for computing the BWT of a single string that uses neither an end-of-string symbol nor Lyndon rotations. We combine our new eBWT construction with a variation of prefix-free parsing to allow for scalable construction of the eBWT. We evaluate our algorithm (pfpebwt) on sets of human chromosomes 19, Salmonella, and SARS-CoV2 genomes, and demonstrate that it is the fastest method for all collections, with a maximum speedup of 7.6x on the second best method. The peak memory is at most 2x larger than the second best method. Comparing with methods that are also, as our algorithm, able to report suffix array samples, we obtain a 57.1x improvement in peak memory.

The first major SARS-CoV-2 variant carries a D614G substitution in the spike (S-D614G) that has been associated with altered conformation, enhanced ACE2 binding, and increased infectivity and transmission. In this report, we used mass spectrometry techniques to characterize and compare the N-glycosylation of the wild type (S-614D) or variant (S-614G) SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins prepared under identical conditions. The data showed that half of the N-glycosylation sequons changed their distribution of glycans in the S-614G variant. The S-614G variant showed a decrease in the relative abundance of complex-type glycans (up to 45%) and an increase in oligomannose glycans (up to 33%) on all altered sequons. These changes led to a reduction in the overall complexity of the total N-glycosylation profile. All the glycosylation sites with altered patterns were in the spike head while the glycosylation of three sites in the stalk remained unchanged between S-614G and S-614D proteins.","Wang, Dongxia; Zhou, Bin; Keppel, Theodore; Solano, Maria; Baudys, Jakub; Goldstein, Jason; Finn, M.

In-network caching function in ICN plays an important role to achieve the design motivation. However, many researchers on in-network caching have focused on where to cache rather than how to cache: the former is known as contents deployment in the network and the latter is known as cache replacement in an ICN element. Although, the cache replacement has been intensively researched in the context of web-caching and content delivery network previously, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to ICN due to the fine granularity of cacheable items in ICN, which eventually changes the access patterns. In this paper, we argue that ICN requires a novel cache replacement algorithm to fulfill the requirements in the design of high performance ICN element. Then, we propose a novel cache replacement algorithm to satisfy the requirements named Compact CLOCK with Adaptive Replacement (Compact CAR), which can reduce the consumption of cache memory to one-tenth compared to conventional approaches.","Ooka, Atsushi; Eum, Suyong; Ata, Shingo; Murata, Masayuki",,743,16

For unknown reasons, COVID-19 infections are associated with adverse cardiovascular complications, implicating that vascular endothelial cells are essential in viral propagation. The etiological pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has a higher reproductive number and infection rate than its predecessors, indicating it possesses novel characteristics that infers enhanced transmissibility. A unique K403R spike protein substitution encodes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, introducing a potential role for RGD-binding host integrins. Integrin &#945;Vß3 is widely expressed across the host, particularly in the endothelium, which acts as the final barrier before microbial entry into the bloodstream. This mutagenesis creates an additional binding site, which may be sufficient to increase SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we investigate how SARS-CoV-2 passes from the epithelium to endothelium, the effects of &#945;Vß3 antagonist, Cilengitide, on viral adhesion, vasculature permeability and leakage, and also report on a simulated interaction between the viral and host protein in-silico.","Nader, Danielle; Fletcher, Nicola; Curley, Gerard F; Kerrigan, Steven W",PLoS One,743,16

CIITA is the founding member of the mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) protein family but stood apart for a long time as the only transcriptional regulator. More recently, it was found that its closest homolog, NLRC5 (NLR protein caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing 5), is a regulator of MHC-I gene expression. Both act as non-DNA-binding activators through multiple protein-protein interactions with an MHC enhanceosome complex that binds cooperatively to a highly conserved combinatorial cis-acting module. Thus, the regulation of MHC-II expression is regulated largely through the differential expression of CIITA. In addition to the well-defined role of CIITA in MHC-II GENE regulation, we will discuss several other aspects of CIITA functions, such as its role in cancer, its role as a viral restriction element contributing to intrinsic immunity, and lastly, its very recently discovered role as an inhibitor of Ebola and SARS-Cov-2 virus replication. We will briefly touch upon the recently discovered role of NLRP3 as a transcriptional regulator, which suggests that transcriptional regulation is, after all, not such an unusual feature for NLR proteins.","León Machado, Jorge Alfonso; Steimle, Viktor",Int. j. mol. sci.

We assessed the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in patients with SLE and RA and patient behavior, disease-related symptoms, and mental health. METHODS: More than 900 participants were included: 405 patients with RA or SLE (CRD-patients) and 513 blood donors. All participants had blood SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies measured (sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 99.5%) and answered a questionnaire concerning behavior, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-9). The CRD patients were further asked about physical activity, adherence to medication, and disease-related symptoms. RESULTS: CRD-patients had a significant lower seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=1/365, 0.3%) compared to blood donors (n=10/513, 1.9%) (p=0.03). Almost 60% of patients were unable to exercise as usual, increased pain was experienced by 34% of patients and increased disease activity by 24%. Almost 10% of patients reduced or discontinued their immunosuppressive treatments at their own initiative. Symptoms of moderate depression were present in 19% of patients compared to 6,8% blood donors (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low seroprevalence in patients with CRDs indicates successful mitigation of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, this appears to occur at the expense of physical activity, experience of increased pain, disease activity, and symptoms of depression. There is a need for care providers to be aware of these negative side-effects and for further studies to investigate the possible long-term consequences.","Ammitzbøll, Christian; Andersen, Jakob Bøgh; Vils, Signe Risbøl; Mistegaard, Clara Elbaek; Mikkelsen, Susan; Erikstrup, Christian; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Hauge, Ellen-Margrethe; Troldborg, Anne",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),743,16

While greatly emphasizing protection, most guiding documents have neglected to support and protect the psychosocial needs of frontline health care workers and patients and their families during provision of palliative and end-of-life care. Consequently, the stage has been set for increased anxiety, moral distress, and moral injury and extreme moral hazard. A family-centered approach to care has been unilaterally relinquished to a secondary and nonessential role during the current crisis. This phenomenon violates a foundational public health principle, namely, to apply the least restrictive means to achieve good for the many. Instead, there has been widespread adoption of utilitarian and paternalistic approaches. In many cases the foundational principles of palliative care have also been neglected. No circumstance, even a global public health emergency, should ever cause health care providers to deny their ethical obligations and human commitment to compassion. The lack of responsive protocols for family visitation, particularly at the end of life, is an important gap in the current recommendations for pandemic triage and contingency planning. A stepwise approach to hospital visitation using a tiered, standardized process for responding to emerging clinical circumstances and individual patients' needs should be considered, following the principle of proportionality. A contingency plan, based on epidemiological data, is the best strategy to refocus health care ethics in practice now and for the future.","Jones-Bonofiglio, Kristen; Nortjé, Nico; Webster, Laura; Garros, Daniel",Am J Crit Care,743,13

The topic is perceived to be of significant importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use data for more than 225 banks in 18 countries in the MENA region to test whether increased competition causes banks to hold higher capital ratios. Employing panel data techniques, and distinguishing between Islamic and conventional banks, we show that banks tend to hold higher capital ratios when operating in a more competitive environment. We also provide evidence that banks in the MENA region increase their capitalization levels in response to a higher risk and vice versa. Further, banking concentration (measured by the HH-index) and credit risk have a significant and positive impact on capital ratios of IBs, whereas competition does play a restrictive role in determining the level of their capital. The results hold when controlling for ownership structure, regulatory and institutional environment, bank-specific and macroeconomic characteristics. Our findings inform regulatory authorities concerned with improving the financial stability of banking sector in the MENA region to strengthen their policies in order to force banks to better align with capital requirements and risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mateev, Miroslav; Tariq, Muhammad Usman; Sahyouni, Ahmad",PLoS One,743,26

The international community has signaled its commitment to exploring and implementing effective policy responses to AMR, with a Global Action Plan on AMR approved by the World Health Assembly in 2015. Major governance challenges could thwart collective efforts to address AMR, along with limited knowledge about how to design effective global governance mechanisms. To identify common ground for more coordinated global actions we conducted a narrative review to map dominant ideas and academic debates about AMR governance. We found two categories of global governance mechanisms: binding and non-binding and discuss advantages and drawbacks of each. We suggest that a combination of non-binding and binding governance mechanisms supported by leading antimicrobial use countries and important AMR stakeholders, and informed by One Health principles, may be best suited to tackle AMR.

Here, we investigated the effectiveness of commercial UVC-LED disinfection boxes in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces of personal items. We contaminated glass, metal and plastic samples representing the surfaces of personal items such as smartphones, coins or credit cards with SARS-CoV-2 formulated in an organic matrix mimicking human respiratory secretions. For disinfection, the samples were placed at different distances from UVC emitting LEDs inside commercial UVC-LED disinfection boxes and irradiated for different time periods (up to 10 minutes). High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were effectively inactivated on all surfaces after 3 minutes of irradiation. Even 10 seconds of UVC-exposure strongly reduced viral loads. Thus, UVC-LED boxes proved to be an effective method for disinfecting SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces that are typically found on personal items.","Bormann, M.; Alt, M.; Schipper, L.; van de Sand, L.; Otte, M.; Meister, T.

Plasma exchange (PLEX) has recently been reported to treat ANE of childhood (ANEC), but its efficacy is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PLEX on ANEC. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in four pediatric intensive care units from December 2014 to December 2020. All patients who were diagnosed with ANEC were included; however, these patients were excluded if their length of stay was less than 24 h. Participants were classified into PLEX and non‐PLEX groups. RESULTS: Twenty‐nine patients with ANEC were identified, 10 in the PLEX group and 19 in the non‐PLEX group. In the PLEX group, C‐reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransaminase levels were significantly lower after 3 days of treatment than before treatment (13.1 vs. 8.0, P = 0.043; 9.8 vs. 1.5, P = 0.028; 133.4 vs. 31.9, P = 0.028; 282.4 vs. 50.5, P = 0.046, respectively). Nine patients (31.0%, 9/29) died at discharge, and a significantly difference was found between the PLEX group and non‐PLEX group [0 vs. 47.4% (9/19), P = 0.011]. The median follow‐up period was 27 months, and three patients were lost to follow‐up. Thirteen patients (50.0%, 13/26) died at the last follow‐up, comprising three (33.3%, 3/9) in the PLEX group and ten (58.8%, 10/17) in the non‐PLEX group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.411). Three patients (10.3%, 3/29) fully recovered. INTERPRETATION: PLEX may reduce serum C‐reactive protein and procalcitonin levels and improve liver function in the short term. PLEX may improve the prognosis of ANEC, and further studies are needed.","Li, Kechun; Zhang, Tao; Liu, Gang; Jin, Ping; Wang, Yeqing; Wang, Lijie; Xu, Meixian; Liu, Chunyi; Liu, Yingchao; Zhou, Tao; Xu, Yan; Yang, Ying; Fang, Boliang; Yang, Xin; Liu, Chunfeng; Qian, Suyun",Pediatr Investig,743,26
