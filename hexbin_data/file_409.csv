3372,Clinical features and outcome of patients with acute respiratory failure revealing anti-synthetase or anti-MDA-5 dermato-pulmonary syndrome: a French multicenter retrospective study,2018-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Anti-synthetase (AS) and dermato-pulmonary associated with anti-MDA-5 antibodies (aMDA-5) syndromes are near one of the other autoimmune inflammatory myopathies potentially responsible for severe acute interstitial lung disease. We undertook a 13-year retrospective multicenter study in 35 French ICUs in order to describe the clinical presentation and the outcome of patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure (ARF) revealing AS or aMDA-5 syndromes. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2017, 47 patients (23 males; median age 60 [1st–3rd quartiles 52–69] years, no comorbidity 85%) were admitted to the ICU for ARF revealing AS (n = 28, 60%) or aMDA-5 (n = 19, 40%) syndromes. Muscular, articular and cutaneous manifestations occurred in 11 patients (23%), 14 (30%) and 20 (43%) patients, respectively. Seventeen of them (36%) had no extra-pulmonary manifestations. C-reactive protein was increased (139 [40–208] mg/L), whereas procalcitonine was not (0.30 [0.12–0.56] ng/mL). Proportion of patients with creatine kinase ≥ 2N was 20% (n = 9/47). Forty-two patients (89%) had ARDS, which was severe in 86%, with a rate of 17% (n = 8/47) of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. Proportion of patients who received corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasma exchange were 100%, 72%, 15%, 21% and 17%, respectively. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 45% (n = 21/47) and 51% (n = 24/47), respectively. Patients with aMDA-5 dermato-pulmonary syndrome had a higher hospital mortality than those with AS syndrome (n = 16/19, 84% vs. n = 8/28, 29%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Intensivists should consider inflammatory myopathies as a cause of ARF of unknown origin. Extra-pulmonary manifestations are commonly lacking. Mortality is high, especially in aMDA-5 dermato-pulmonary syndrome.","Vuillard, Constance; Pineton de Chambrun, Marc; de Prost, Nicolas; Guérin, Claude; Schmidt, Matthieu; Dargent, Auguste; Quenot, Jean-Pierre; Préau, Sébastien; Ledoux, Geoffrey; Neuville, Mathilde; Voiriot, Guillaume; Fartoukh, Muriel; Coudroy, Rémi; Dumas, Guillaume; Maury, Eric; Terzi, Nicolas; Tandjaoui-Lambiotte, Yacine; Schneider, Francis; Grall, Maximilien; Guérot, Emmanuel; Larcher, Romaric; Ricome, Sylvie; Le Mao, Raphaël; Colin, Gwenhaël; Guitton, Christophe; Zafrani, Lara; Morawiec, Elise; Dubert, Marie; Pajot, Olivier; Mentec, Hervé; Plantefève, Gaëtan; Contou, Damien",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131681/,409
3588,Improvement in the survival rates of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported respiratory failure patients: a multicenter retrospective study in Korean patients,2019-01-03,"BACKGROUND: Although the utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasing and its technology is evolving, only a few epidemiologic reports have described the uses and outcomes of ECMO. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in utilization and survival rate in patients supported with ECMO for severe respiratory failure in Korea. METHODS: This was a multicenter study on consecutive patients who underwent ECMO across 16 hospitals in Korea. The records of all patients who required ECMO for acute respiratory failure between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed, and the utilization of ECMO was analyzed over time. RESULTS: During the study period, 5552 patients received ECMO in Korea as a whole, and a total of 2472 patients received ECMO at the participating 16 hospitals. We analyzed 487 (19.7%) patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure. The number of ECMO procedures provided for respiratory failure increased from 104 to 153 during the study period. The in-hospital survival rate increased from 30.8% to 35.9%. The use of prone positioning increased from 6.8% to 49.0% (p < 0.001), and the use of neuromuscular blockers also increased from 28.2% to 58.2% (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that old age (OR 1.038 (95% CI 1.022, 1.054)), use of corticosteroid (OR 2.251 (95% CI 1.153, 4.397)), continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 2.196 (95% CI 1.135, 4.247)), driving pressure (OR 1.072 (95% CI 1.031, 1.114)), and prolonged ECMO duration (OR 1.020 (95% CI 1.003, 1.038)) were associated with increased odds of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of ECMO and survival rates of patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure increased over time in Korea. The use of pre-ECMO prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers also increased during the same period.","Baek, Moon Seong; Lee, Sang-Min; Chung, Chi Ryang; Cho, Woo Hyun; Cho, Young-Jae; Park, Sunghoon; Koo, So-My; Jung, Jae-Seung; Park, Seung Yong; Chang, Youjin; Kang, Byung Ju; Kim, Jung-Hyun; Oh, Jin Young; Park, So Hee; Yoo, Jung-Wan; Sim, Yun Su; Hong, Sang-Bum",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6318967/,409

This 5-year cohort study was performed at an academic tertiary care center. EEGs in 154 patients with altered mental status were classified according to five predefined patterns: Isolated continuous slowing of background activity (theta, theta/delta, and delta activity) and patterns with slowing background activity with episodic transients [i.e., triphasic waves (TWs) or frontal intermittent delta activity (FIRDA)]. Clinical characteristics, blood tests and neuroimaging were compared among groups. Associations between EEG patterns and structural and non-structural abnormalities were calculated. Glasgow Outcome Score >3 at discharge was defined as favorable and 1–3 as unfavorable outcome. In multivariable analyses, theta was associated with brain atrophy (OR 2.6, p = 0.020), theta/delta with intracerebral hemorrhages (OR 6.8, p = 0.005), FIRDA with past cerebrovascular accidents (OR 2.7, p = 0.004), TWs with liver or multi-organ failure (OR 6, p = 0.004; OR 4, p = 0.039), and delta activity with alcohol/drug abuse with or without intoxication, and HIV infection (OR 3.8, p = 0.003; OR 9, p = 0.004). TWs were associated with death (OR 4.5, p = 0.005); theta/delta with unfavorable outcomes (OR 2.5, p = 0.033), while patients with FIRDA had favorable outcomes (OR 4.8, p = 0.004). In encephalopathic patients, well-defined EEG patterns are associated with specific pathological conditions and outcomes, suggesting that mechanistic hypotheses underlie these abnormal EEG patterns. To clarify the respective contributions of non-structural and structural abnormalities to encephalopathy reflected in specific EEG patterns, prospective studies using continuous EEG monitoring during the acute onset of encephalopathy are needed.","Sutter, Raoul; Stevens, Robert D.; Kaplan, Peter W.",J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102032/,409

10336,Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Infection and Pathology,2016-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Copepods are key components of aquatic ecosystems and can help regulate the global carbon cycle. Much attention has been paid to the species diversity of copepods worldwide, but the phylogeography and genetic diversity of copepods in Nigeria is unexplored. RESULTS: Using a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker, we preformed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses for Cyclopidae copepods in Southeast Nigeria. A high species diversity of Cyclopidae in Nigeria: 5 species of Tropocyclops, 5 species of Mesocyclops and 2 species of Thermocyclops from Cyclopidae were identified in 15 populations. Moreover, we detected 18 unique haplotypes, which fell into two distinct clades. Pairwise genetic distances (uncorrected p-distances) among the species of Cyclopidae ranged from 0.05 to 0.257. Several species co-existed in the same lake, and some haplotypes were shared among different geographic populations, suggesting a dispersal of Cyclopidae in our sampling region. Finally, we found that the population genetic diversity for each species of Cyclopidae was low in Nigeria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings explored the species diversity and distribution of copepods within the family Cyclopidae for 15 Nigerian freshwater ecosystems: a high species diversity of Cyclopidae copepods was detected over a small geographic sampling range. Results from this study contribute to a better understanding of copepod diversity of Nigerian freshwater ecosystems.","Ni, Yijun; Ebido, Chike Chukwuenyem; Odii, Elijah Chibueze; Wang, Jinhui; Orakwelu, Chinemerem Hodges; Abonyi, Francis Chukwuemeka; Ngene, Chinedu Innocent; Okoro, Joseph Onyekwere; Ubachukwu, Patience Obiageli; Hu, Wei; Yin, Mingbo",BMC Evol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171763/,409

The sample comprised 1235 Brazilian runners of both sexes (492 women; 743 men), with a mean age of 37.94 ± 9.46 years. Individual characteristics were obtained through an online questionnaire: Sex, age, body height (m) and body mass (kg), socioeconomic status, and training information (i.e., self-classification, practice time, practice motivation, running pace, frequency and training volume/week). Multivariate analysis of variance was conducted by sex and the discriminant analysis was used to identify which among running pace, practice time, body mass index and volume/training could differentiate groups such as “professional athletes”, “amateur athletes” and “recreational athletes”. For both sexes, running pace was the variable that better discriminated the groups, followed by BMI and volume/week. The practice time is not a good indicator to differentiate runner’s types. In both sexes, semi-professional runners were those that better self-classify themselves, with amateur runners presenting the highest classification error. This information can be used to guide the long-term training, athlete’s selection programs, and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of athletes.","Thuany, Mabliny; de Souza, Raphael F.; Hill, Lee; Mesquita, João Lino; Rosemann, Thomas; Knechtle, Beat; Pereira, Sara; Gomes, Thayse Natacha",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8072622/,409
19753,Surgical outcomes in cardiogenic shock patients with preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),2021-08-03,"BACKGROUND: The Qilin pill (QLP) is a traditional Chinese compound prescription comprising 15 herbs that has demonstrated significant therapeutic effects on premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in recent years. However, a pharmacological evaluation of QLP on ovarian function remains to be conducted, and the key mechanism of QLP treatment on POI is unclear. METHODS: Premature ovarian insufficiency rats were established by bilateral partial ovariectomy. The model rats were administrated with low (QLP-L), medium (QLP-M) and high (QLP-H) doses of QLP for 4 weeks to evaluate the ovarian function in terms of estrous cycle, hormone level, and follicle count. The mechanism of QLP in the treatment of POI was systematically explored by network pharmacology, and expression levels of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways were verified by Western blotting and molecular docking. RESULTS: The rat model of resection-induced POI was successfully established, and QLP could significantly recover the estrous cycle, decrease serum FSH levels, and decelerate follicle depletion after 4 weeks of administration. The optimal dose of QLP in the experiment was preliminarily determined to be 0.9 g/kg. Based on the network pharmacology methods, we constructed the compound-target network and protein protein interaction (PPI) network of QLP for the treatment of POI. The experimental verification of the enrichment analysis showed that QLP inhibited the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, and the key compounds and key targets involved were verified by molecular docking. CONCLUSION: QLP exerted significant therapeutic effects on resection-induced POI rats, and this was achieved by the inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. This study is the first to systematically investigate the effects and mechanism of QLP on POI rats, which will provide valuable guidance in clinic.","Li, Debao; Jia, Yuling; Hou, Yiwen; Chen, Dingshi; Zheng, Chiyang; Chen, Lifen; Zhou, Li; Sun, Zuyue",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8331109/,409

An information security strategy needs to focus on an overall objective, usually the objectives laid out in an organization’s business strategy and its derived information technology strategy, where it takes the status quo and reflects the main objectives derived and postulates how and when to close the identified gaps. This strategy approach for improving information security is intended for an organization which supports an automotive and captive finance enterprise but is not restricted to this. The approach is aligned to the scope of ISO 270002 “Code of Practice for an Information Security Management System” [ISO05]. However, compliance is left out of the scope. The strategy concentrates on four areas considered the relevant areas for infonnation security: people, business processses. applications and infrastructure and has therefore a clear focus on processes, stability, resilience and efficiency which are the pillars of a successful enterprise.","Fibikova, Lenka; Mueller, Roland",ISSE 2012 Securing Electronic Business Processes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178875/,409
31885,Global Trends in Epidemiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020-04-30,"The proinflammatory role of T helper (Th) 17 cells and therefore of its cytokines, IL-17 (IL-17A), IL-17F, and IL-22, in autoimmune disorders has been favored, although there is evidence that not only IL-17A but also IL-17F and IL-22 have a dual role as negative regulators. Here we review the concept of the dual function of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 in the light of recent strategies to use neutralization of these cytokines as potential alternative to neutralizing TNF and IL-1 treatments in chronic inflammatory disorders. Expectedly, in allergic lung inflammation, neutralization of IL-17A inhibited neutrophil recruitment. However, this IL-17A antibody treatment concomitantly increased eosinophil recruitment by neutralizing IL-17A’s dual role as negative regulator. IL-17A negatively regulated dendritic cell function and activation of T helper cell (Th)2 cytokine production. Furthermore, IL-17A inhibited Th2-characteristic chemokine and adhesion molecule expression. On a mechanistic level, IL-17A acted on IκB-β by preventing degradation and in turn leading to reduced NF-κB activation or IL-17A inhibited transcription factor IRF-1. Therefore, anti-IL-17A therapy, although presenting a promising lead in chronic inflammatory disorders, bears a potential risk of exacerbating allergic asthma.","Schnyder, Bruno; Schnyder-Candrian, Silvia","IL-17, IL-22 and Their Producing Cells: Role in Inflammation and Autoimmunity",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178895/,409
35385,Consequences and Solutions for the Impact of Communication Impairment on Noninvasive Ventilation Therapy for Acute Respiratory Failure: A Focused Review,2020-06-15,"Specifying a computational problem requires fixing encodings for input and output: encoding graphs as adjacency matrices, characters as integers, integers as bit strings, and vice versa. For such discrete data, the actual encoding is usually straightforward and/or complexity-theoretically inessential (up to polynomial time, say); but concerning continuous data, already real numbers naturally suggest various encodings with very different computational properties. With respect to qualitative computability, Kreitz and Weihrauch (1985) had identified admissibility as crucial property for “reasonable” encodings over the Cantor space of infinite binary sequences, so-called representations. For (precisely) these does the Kreitz-Weihrauch representation (aka Main) Theorem apply, characterizing continuity of functions in terms of continuous realizers. We similarly identify refined criteria for representations suitable for quantitative complexity investigations. Higher type complexity is captured by replacing Cantor’s as ground space with more general compact metric spaces, similar to equilogical spaces in computability.","Lim, Donghyun; Ziegler, Martin",Beyond the Horizon of Computability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309482/,409
39022,Positive end-expiratory pressure-induced recruited lung volume measured by volume-pressure curves in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a physiologic systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in high-income countries. In addition to the high costs of initial hospitalization, COPD patients frequently return to the emergency department (ED) and are readmitted to hospital within 30 days of discharge. A COPD acute care discharge care bundle focused on optimizing care for patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD has been shown to reduce ED revisits and hospital readmissions. The aim of this study was to explore and understand factors influencing implementation and uptake of COPD discharge care bundle items in acute care facilities from the perspective of health care providers and patients. METHODS: Qualitative methodology was adopted. Nine focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured guide: seven with acute and primary/community health care providers and two with patients/family members. Focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and coded and analyzed using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Forty-six health care providers and 14 patients/family members participated in the focus groups. Health care providers and patients identified four factors that can challenge the implementation of COPD discharge care bundles: process of care complexities, human capacity in care settings, communication and engagement, and attitudes and perceptions towards change. Both health care providers and patients recognized process of care complexity as the most important determinant of the COPD discharge bundle uptake. Processes of care complexity include patient activities in seeking and receiving care, as well as practitioner activities in making a diagnosis and recommending or implementing treatment. Important issues linked to human capacity in care settings included time constraints, high patient volume, and limited staffing. Communication during transitions in care across settings and patient engagement were also broadly discussed. Other important issues were linked to patients’, providers’, and system attitudes towards change and level of involvement in COPD discharge bundle implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Complexities in the process of care were perceived as the most important determinant of COPD discharge bundle implementation. Early engagement of health providers and patients in the uptake of COPD discharge bundle items as well as clear communication between acute and post-acute settings can contribute positively to bundle uptake and implementation success.","Michas, Marta; Deuchar, Lesly; Leigh, Richard; Bhutani, Mohit; Rowe, Brian H.; Stickland, Michael K.; Ospina, Maria B.",Implement Sci Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477849/,409

Catalytic and anti-cancer activities of the poly-peptide were evaluated using standard in vitro biochemical methods. Medium nutrients were selected by one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach while Plackett–Burman design (PBD) screened potential factors for optimization. Path of steepest ascent (PSA) and response surface methodology (RSM) of a Min-Run-Res V fractional factorial of a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to optimize factor levels towards improved enzyme activity. A multi-objective approach using desirability function generated through predictor importance and weighted coefficient methodology was adopted for optimization. The approach set optimum bioprocess conditions as 49.55 g/L molasses, 64.98% corn steep liquor, 44.23 g/L asparagine, 1.73 g/L potassium, 0.055 g/L manganese and 0.043 g/L chromium (III) ions, at a composite desirability of 0.943 and an L-asparaginase activity of 5216.95U. The Sephadex-200 partially-purified polypeptide had a specific activity of 476.84 U/mg; 0.087U glutaminase activity, 36.46% yield and 20-fold protein purification.

The feeling has been that resources have been shifted to treating the COVID patients and that “shelter-in-place” requirements have reduced the risks for burn injury. The ABA and other organizations have sent biweekly surveys in order to determine how the pandemic has interfered with burn care. Despite these concerns, we seemed very busy. METHODS: The inpatient data was collected in our adult and pediatric burn centers between January 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in burn admissions in both adult and pediatric centers. At the same time there were 1270 COVID-19 adult admissions and 4 COVID-positive admissions at the pediatric center. In the adult center, there was increase from 414 total admissions from fiscal year 2019 (7/2018-6/2019) of 414 to 495 for fiscal year 2020 (7/2019-6/2020). The average daily census also increased from 18.33 to 18.36 during the same period. The monthly number of burn admissions increased from 38.5/month for the last six months of 2019 to 44/month for the first six months of 2020. The admission rate continued in July (41) and August (47). In the first 8 months of 2020, there were 356 admissions with a mean TBSA of 11.3%. There were many large burns admitted in late summer. The mean TBSA of the 12 bed ICU on September 11, 2020 was 60.6% (range 25–85%). In the pediatric unit, there were 174 admissions through July 2020, a 6% increase from the preceding same period. There was a 6% decrease in burn reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant burden of COVID-19 patients, burn admissions also increased at the same time. There was no evidence that “shelter-in-place” requirements changed the risk for burn injuries. Resources for critical care needs should not be siphoned away from burn centers during pandemics. Risky behaviors leading to burns do not go away despite new health crises.","Greenhalgh, David G; Romanowski, Kathleen S; Sen, Soman; Palmieri, Tina L",J Burn Care Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083553/,409

However, when faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, Extension agents turned to alternative platforms for providing educational opportunities. In April 2020, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center (LSU AgCenter) agents hosted a live webinar entitled “Sustainability during Turbulent Markets” to bring beef cattle producers information on management strategies during a time of instability. This initial webinar included 41 live participants and an additional 40 views within one week of posting the recording. Event responses prompted creation of the Beef Brunch Educational Series, an online series designed to maintain engagement and allow agents to present timely management recommendations and industry news to producers. Live webinars occur at 10:30 a.m. on the second Tuesday of each month. Webinars are also recorded for online distribution through the LSU AgCenter website, LSU AgCenter-Livestock YouTube channel, and podcast platforms. Bi-weekly news updates are released on the same platforms. News updates feature weather and pasture conditions, market outlooks, management tips, events, and current industry topics. Webinar engagement on all platforms averages 233 viewers with a growth range of 81 to 859 since April. News updates average 87 views with a growth range of 29 to 270 participants. When asked, 85% of viewers strongly agreed or agreed that information learned in webinars would be applied to their operations. Extension agents utilize this program for professional development, with 75% strongly agreeing or agreeing that webinars increased confidence to apply presented knowledge and 70% stating they have or plan to incorporate news update content in their programming. Thus, increased views, positive feedback, and requests for more information illustrate relevance in continuing the Beef Brunch Educational Series beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and optimistically developing it into a leading informational source for beef cattle producers in Louisiana.","Edwards, Ashley K; Faulk, A Lee; Deshotel, Vincent; Holmes, Jason",J Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104506/,409

61052,Incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019: new implications for intervention and control.,2021-04-04,"Aldose reductase (AKR1B1), the first enzyme in the polyol pathway, is likely involved in the onset of diabetic complications. Differential inhibition of AKR1B1 has been proposed to counteract the damaging effects linked to the activity of the enzyme while preserving its detoxifying ability. Here, we show that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the most representative catechins present in green tea, acts as a differential inhibitor of human recombinant AKR1B1. A kinetic analysis of EGCG, and of its components, gallic acid (GA) and epigallocatechin (EGC) as inhibitors of the reduction of L-idose, 4-hydroxy2,3-nonenal (HNE), and 3-glutathionyl l-4-dihydroxynonanal (GSHNE) revealed for the compounds a different model of inhibition toward the different substrates. While EGCG preferentially inhibited L-idose and GSHNE reduction with respect to HNE, gallic acid, which was still active in inhibiting the reduction of the sugar, was less active in inhibiting HNE and GSHNE reduction. EGC was found to be less efficient as an inhibitor of AKR1B1 and devoid of any differential inhibitory action. A computational study defined different interactive modes for the three substrates on the AKR1B1 active site and suggested a rationale for the observed differential inhibition. A chromatographic fractionation of an alcoholic green tea extract revealed that, besides EGCG and GA, other components may exhibit the differential inhibition of AKR1B1.","Balestri, Francesco; Poli, Giulio; Pineschi, Carlotta; Moschini, Roberta; Cappiello, Mario; Mura, Umberto; Tuccinardi, Tiziano; Del Corso, Antonella",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10071003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640594/,409

METHODOLOGY The nonlinear feature of updated cases is captured through Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) with threshold points; Exposure-response curve suggests that daily confirmed cases is changed at the different stages of TD according to the threshold points of piecewise function, which traces out the rule of updated cases under different meteorological condition. RESULTS Our results show that the confirmed cases decreased by 0.390% (95% CI: -0.478 ~ -0.302) for increasing each one degree of TD if TD is less than 11.5°C; It will increase by 0.302% (95% CI: 0.215 ~ 0.388) for every 1°C increase in the TD (lag0-4) at the interval [11.5, 16]; Meanwhile the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases will increase by 0.321% (95% CI: 0.142 ~ 0.499) for every 1°C increase in the TD (lag0-4) when the TD (lag0-4) is over 16°C, and the most fluctuation occurred on Sunday. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed our model robust. CONCLUSIONS In US, this interval effect of TD reminds us that it is urgent to control the spread and infection of COVID-19 when TD becomes greater in autumn and the ongoing winter.","Ding, Yongmei; Gao, Liyuan; Shao, Ning-Yi",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690205/,409

Exponential increases in the number of cases globally lend to the implementation of a nationwide lockdown. In Europe in general and Ireland in particular, the lockdown significantly limits medical students' clinical exposure and access to clinical sites. For medical students, this portends numerous implications, such as limited patient contact and an inability to explore the various medical and surgical specialties in profundity. Nevertheless, medical students continue to aspire to pursue various specialties-including otolaryngology-for which the clinical contact remains exceedingly limited.","Hussain, Salman; Almas, Talal",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/01945998211000387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33685290/,409

While the cities have state of the art hospitals with trained doctors, rural areas where most of the population lives, have a severe shortage of resources. Children form nearly 40% of India's population, and there is a great demand for pediatric surgical and anesthesia services. Specialty training in pediatric anesthesia however, is still in its infancy, with the majority of children being administered anesthesia by general anesthesiologists. This review discusses the reasons behind India's ailing healthcare system and the shortage of qualified pediatric anesthesiologists. Anesthesiologists face multiple challenges in their daily work including inadequate infrastructure, paucity of medications and working equipment, non-availability of trained help, and poor remuneration. All these factors contribute to work related stress. On the other hand, the dearth of anesthesiologists offers ample opportunities to serve the underserved, improve the safety and quality of perioperative care in the rural areas and improve the self image of the anesthesiologist. A paucity of data regarding anesthesia, surgery and work related issues makes writing an article like this very difficult. However, it highlights the need for professional bodies to take note of these facts and play an active role in encouraging documentation, data collection and improving standards of teaching and practice.","Dave, Nandini; Varghese, Elsa; Jacob, Rebecca",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.14053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119926/,409

69752,Articles That May Change Your Practice: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.,2016,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The aim of this study was to report characteristics of patients presenting with serious ocular injuries during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. RECENT FINDINGS Of 1058 patients presenting for emergency evaluation during the stay-at-home order, 62 (5.9%) patients [mean (SD) age, 41.1 (19.2) years; 19 (31%) women; 31 (50%) white] presented with severe ocular trauma. The daily mean (SD) number of patients who presented for emergency evaluation decreased from 49.0 (9) to 36.4 (6) during the quarantine (P < 0.001). Patients presenting during the stay-at-home order were less likely to have health insurance [odds ratio (OR), 0.33; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.13-0.90, P = 0.024], more likely to have a delayed presentation (difference, 22.7 h, 95% CI, 5.8-39.5, P < 0.001, more likely to travel farther to seek emergency care (difference, 10.4 miles, 95% CI, 2.6-18.2, P < 0.001) and more likely to have an injury occur at home (OR, 22.8; 95% CI, 9.6-54.2, P < 0.001). Of injuries occurring at home, there was a significant increase in injuries arising from home improvement projects during the stay-at-home order (28 vs. 0%, P = 0.02). SUMMARY During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with ocular trauma were more likely to have injuries sustained at home and have additional barriers to care. These changes underscore a need for targeted interventions to optimize emergent eye care during a pandemic.","Wu, Connie; Patel, Samir N; Jenkins, Thomas L; Obeid, Anthony; Ho, Allen C; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740065/,409

While studies have demonstrated a low risk of serious adverse events, the comprehensive incidence and nature of the spectrum of transfusion reactions to convalescent plasma is unknown. We retrospectively examined 427 adult inpatient CP transfusions to determine incidence and types of reactions, as well as clinical parameters and risk factors associated with transfusion reactions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Retrospective analysis was performed for 427 transfusions to 215 adult COVID-19 patients within the Mount Sinai Health System, through the FDA eIND and EAP approval pathways. Transfusions were blindly evaluated by two reviewers and adjudicated by a third reviewer in discordant cases. Patient demographics, clinical, and laboratory parameters were compared and analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-five reactions from 427 transfusions were identified (12.9% incidence), and thirteen were attributed to transfusion (3.1% incidence). Reactions were classified as underlying COVID-19 (76%), febrile non-hemolytic (10.9%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (9.1%), allergic (1.8%), and hypotensive (1.8%) reactions. Statistical analysis identified increased transfusion reaction risk for ABO blood group B or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 12-13, and decreased risk within the age group of 80-89 years. CONCLUSION Our findings support the use of CP as a safe therapeutic option from a transfusion reaction perspective, in the setting of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of ABO group B, age, and predisposing disease severity in the incidence of transfusion reaction events.","Nguyen, Freddy T; van den Akker, Tayler; Lally, Kimberly; Lam, Hansen; Lenskaya, Volha; Liu, Sean T H; Bouvier, Nicole M; Aberg, Judith A; Rodriguez, Denise; Krammer, Florian; Strauss, Donna; Shaz, Beth H; Rudon, Louella; Galdon, Patricia; Jhang, Jeffrey S; Arinsburg, Suzanne A; Baine, Ian",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33125158/,409

This study explores potential interest in missed period pills in two US states. STUDY DESIGN We enrolled people seeking pregnancy test services at nine health centers in two US states between June 2015 and October 2017. Participants completed an anonymous questionnaire containing closed- and open-ended questions about background characteristics, reproductive practices, pregnancy feelings and intentions, abortion attitudes, and MPP interest. We used ordered logistic regression to identify factors associated with MPP interest and inductive content analysis to identify recurring qualitative themes related to MPP interest or disinterest. RESULTS In all, 678 people completed the survey and 286/678 (42%) indicated interest in missed period pills. Interest was greatest (129/185 or 70%) among those who would be unhappy if pregnant. Variables associated with interest in the multivariate analyses were age ≥35, nulliparity, prior abortion and contraceptive use, recent use of emergency contraception, pregnancy feelings and intentions, and abortion attitudes (p<.05). Variables not associated with interest included state of residence, educational attainment, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and frequency of religious attendance. Key reasons for interest were to prevent, avoid or terminate pregnancy; and psychological or emotional benefits, including management of abortion stigma. Reasons for non-interest included concerns about safety or side effects, desire to be pregnant or have a baby, and not wanting to abort or hurt the fetus/baby. CONCLUSION If missed period pills were available in the United States, demand might be substantial and wide-ranging across demographic groups. IMPLICATIONS Our findings suggest that some people with missed periods do not desire pregnancy confirmation before taking medications that might disrupt a pregnancy. As a result, provision of missed period pills in the United States would expand reproductive service options and could improve the delivery of patient-centered care.","Sheldon, Wendy R; Mary, Meighan; Harris, Lisa; Starr, Katherine; Winikoff, Beverly",Contraception,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2020.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916168/,409

A pan-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, inhibited ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and protected human cortical neural progenitors in both monolayer and three-dimensional organoid cultures. Ten structurally unrelated inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibited ZIKV replication. Niclosamide, a category B anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, also inhibited ZIKV replication. Finally, combination treatments using one compound from each category (neuroprotective and antiviral) further increased protection of human neural progenitors and astrocytes from ZIKV-induced cell death.

Medical non-compliance due to the length of the treatment and antibiotic side effects has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) that are difficult to treat. A current therapeutic strategy attempting to circumvent this issue aims to enhance drug delivery to reduce the duration of the antibiotic regimen or dosage of first-line antibiotics. One such agent that may help is cyclic peptide [R4W4], as it has been shown to have antibacterial properties (in combination with tetracycline) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the past. The objective of this study is to test cyclic peptide [R4W4] both alone and in combination with current first-line antibiotics (either isoniazid or pyrazinamide) to study the effects of inhibition of M. tb inside in vitro human granulomas. Results from our studies indicate that [R4W4] is efficacious in controlling M. tb infection in the granulomas and has enhanced inhibitory effects in the presence of first-line antibiotics.","Hernandez, Joshua; Ashley, David; Cao, Ruoqiong; Abrahem, Rachel; Nguyen, Timothy; To, Kimberly; Yegiazaryan, Aram; Akinwale David, Ajayi; Kumar Tiwari, Rakesh; Venketaraman, Vishwanath",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973740/,409

One reason is that the native proteins usually contain idiosyncrasies evolved for their native functions but disfavoring engineering requirements. To overcome this issue, one strategy is to create de novo proteins which are designed to possess improved stability, high environmental tolerance, and enhanced engineering potential. Compared to other protein engineering strategies, in silico design of de novo proteins has significantly expanded the protein structural and sequence spaces, reduced wet lab workload, and incorporated engineered features in a guided and efficient manner. In the Baker laboratory we have been applying a design pipeline that uses the blueprint builder to design different folds of de novo proteins, and have successfully obtained libraries of de novo proteins with improved stability and engineering potential.

The local medical service is key to the municipality's healthcare preparedness. We wished to investigate how the healthcare personnel perceived the restructuring at their GP practice during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, and the factors that facilitated and impeded the process. MATERIAL AND METHOD The article is based on a focus group interview that was conducted with eight nurses and medical secretaries at Otta GP practice in June 2020. The interview was transcribed and analysed using systematic text condensation. RESULTS The informants described a chaotic and demanding situation, in which they had to deal with their own as well as the patients' fears. They found crisis management to be difficult in a situation where the leadership in the municipality were unaware of the challenges of the GP practice. Lack of guidelines from the authorities at the start of the outbreak gave rise to considerable uncertainty. Through collaboration and flexibility, the practice arrived at new ways of working in order to safeguard its running. This gave a strong feeling of coping and fellowship, and a greater awareness of the informants' own importance in the front line of crisis management. INTERPRETATION The study elucidates the role of support staff in the face of a crisis for the GP practice. Competent employees with the latitude and tools to tackle the challenges quickly guided the practice from chaos to a new type of working day. The municipality could have supported the process by ensuring the necessary resources and general guidelines for prioritisation of tasks.","Renaa, Therese; Brekke, Mette","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528128/,409

METHODS A Systematic review of the literature was performed in March 2020 for studies reporting VTE rates in transgender patients undergoing hormone treatment and rates in cis-gender patients on HRT. Data regarding demographics, hormone therapy, and VTE incidence were collected and pooled for analysis. OUTCOME The primary outcome of interest was the development of a VTE event in association with concurrent hormone administration. RESULTS Overall, 22 studies were included with 11 reporting VTE rates among transgender patients, 6 in cis-female patients, and 5 in cis-male patients. Data from 9,180 transgender patients (6,068 assigned male at birth [AMAB] and 3,112 assigned female at birth [AFAB]) undergoing hormone treatment and 103,713 cis-gender patients (18,748 female and 84,965 male) undergoing HRT were pooled. The incidence of VTE was higher in AMAB patients compared to AFAB patients (42.8 vs 10.8 VTE per 10,000 patient years; P = .02). The rate of VTE incidences in AMAB patients appears similar or higher than the rate demonstrated in cis-females on HRT. VTE incidence in AFAB patients, however, is similar to the published rates in cis-males on HRT. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AMAB patients on hormone therapy have higher VTE rates than AFAB patients. AMAB and AFAB patients may have similar VTE incidence to cis-female and cis-male patients on hormone replacement therapy, respectively. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS This is the first study to aggregate and quantify the development of VTE events in association with hormone therapy in transgender patients. It places these values in the context of rates published in more widely studied populations. It is limited by its retrospective data and heterogenic data. CONCLUSION Surgical planning regarding perioperative and postoperative VTE prophylaxis or cessation of hormone therapy should take into account each patient's Caprini risk assessment and the nature of each intervention.

98491,Nursing Challenges in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Era.,2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVES To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an academic medical center in the southern United States. METHODS Retrospective, observational cohort study of all adult patients (18 years and older) consecutively admitted with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection between March 13 and April 25, 2020 at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. All of the patients either survived to hospital discharge or died during hospitalization. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected. Patient outcomes (need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death) were analyzed. RESULTS One hundred patients were included, 53% of whom were women. Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 44-70) and 66% were younger than 65. Seventy-five percent identified themselves as Black, despite representing 58% of hospitalized patients at our institution in 2019. Common comorbid conditions included hypertension (68%), obesity (65%), and diabetes mellitus (31%). Frequent clinical manifestations included shortness of breath (76%), cough (75%), and fever (64%). Symptoms were present for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 4-7) on presentation. Twenty-four percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and, overall, 19% died (67% of those requiring mechanical ventilation). Eighty-four percent of those who died were Black. On multivariate analysis, ever smoking (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-28.6) and history of diabetes mellitus (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.5-24.3) were associated with mortality, and those admitted from home were less likely to die (vs outside facility, OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0-0.7). Neither age, sex, race, body mass index, insurance status, nor rural residence was independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS Our study adds evidence that Black patients appear to be overrepresented in those hospitalized with and those who die from COVID-19, likely a manifestation of adverse social determinants of health. These findings should help guide preventive interventions targeting groups at higher risk of acquiring and developing severe COVID-19 disease.","Lucar, Jose; Wingler, Mary Joyce B; Cretella, David A; Ward, Lori M; Sims Gomillia, Courtney E; Chamberlain, Nicholas; Shimose, Luis A; Brock, James B; Harvey, Jessie; Wilhelm, Andrew; Majors, Lance T; Jeter, Joshua B; Bueno, Maria X; Albrecht, Svenja; Navalkele, Bhagyashri; Mena, Leandro A; Parham, Jason",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000001222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655307/,409

In addition, devils are affected by two of the three known transmissible cancers in mammals. Immune checkpoint immunotherapy has transformed human medicine, but a lack of species-specific reagents has limited checkpoint immunology in most species. We developed a cut-and-paste reagent development system and used the fluorescent fusion protein system to show that immune checkpoint interactions are conserved across 160,000,000 years of evolution, CD200 is highly expressed on transmissible tumor cells, and coexpression of CD200R1 can block CD200 surface expression. The system's versatility across species was demonstrated by fusing a fluorescent reporter to a camelid-derived nanobody that binds human programmed death ligand 1. The evolutionarily conserved pathways suggest that naturally occurring cancers in devils and other species can be used to advance our understanding of cancer and immunological tolerance.","Flies, Andrew S; Darby, Jocelyn M; Lennard, Patrick R; Murphy, Peter R; Ong, Chrissie E B; Pinfold, Terry L; De Luca, Alana; Lyons, A Bruce; Woods, Gregory M; Patchett, Amanda L",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937435/,409

With climate communication, it can be tempting to think that the primary goal should be to get more people to accept climate change, but true climate literacy requires not just an understanding of the reality of climate change but also acting on that understanding. Here, I argue that there is an important role for communicating about climate change with people who already accept that it is occurring. Such communication can help people improve their understanding, increasing their certainty regarding climate change and its drivers, and spur them to take action. Social science research has important insights regarding how to communicate in a way that encourages people to change behaviors, including aiming to increase personal and collective efficacy and helping people figure out how to meet key needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change communicators should seek out audiences that already accept climate change, helping those individuals deepen their understanding and energizing and empowering these people to act.","Duffy, Meghan A",The American naturalist,https://doi.org/10.1086/715153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34403318/,409

METHODS This is a prospective study enrolling all ACHD patients who answered a questionnaire dedicated telematic cardiovascular examination. RESULTS A total of 289 patients were enrolled, 133 (47%) were male, 25 (9%) were affected by a genetic syndrome. The median age was 38 (29-51) years, whereas the median time interval between the last visit and the telematic follow-up was 9.5 (7.5-11.5) months. Overall, 35 patients (12%) reported a worsening of fatigue in daily life activity, 17 (6%) experienced chest pain, 42 (15%) had presyncope and 2 (1%) syncope; in addition, 28 patients (10%) presented peripheral edema and 14 (5%) were orthopneic. A total of 116 (40%) patients reported palpitations and 12 had at least one episode of atrial fibrillation and underwent successful electrical (8) or pharmacological (4) cardioversion. One patient was admitted to the emergency department for uncontrolled arterial hypertension, five for chest pain, and one for heart failure. Two patients presented fever but both had negative COVID-19 nasal swab. CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telemedicine dramatically increased and here we report a positive experience in ACHD patients. The postpandemic role of telemedicine will depend on permanent regulatory solutions and this early study might encourage a more systematic telematic approach for ACHD patients.","Grandinetti, Maria; Di Molfetta, Arianna; Graziani, Francesca; Delogu, Angelica Bibiana; Lillo, Rosa; Perri, Gianluigi; Pavone, Natalia; Bruno, Piergiorgio; Aspromonte, Nadia; Amodeo, Antonio; Crea, Filippo; Massetti, Massimo",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882538/,409

To investigate the ecotoxicity of epoxiconazole to soil microbiome, we carried out an indoor experiment in which soils from two main regions of wheat production in China (Nanjing and Anyang) were treated with epoxiconazole (0, 0.0625, 0.625, or 6.25 mg kg-1) and incubated for 90 days. Under epoxiconazole stress, for bacteria and fungi, the abundance was increased and the diversity and community were impacted. In Anyang soil, the half-life of epoxiconazole was short with more increased species (linear discriminant analysis effect size biomarkers) and more increased xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in epoxiconazole treatments. The increased species mostly due to high abundance in initial state and more positive connections of the species. Co-occurrences revealed that epoxiconazole tightened bacterial connection, and increased positive correlations in Anyang soil. The N transformation was influenced with increased nifH and amoA; and the contents of NH4+-N and NO3--N were also increased. The functions of C, S, and manganese metabolisms were also impacted by epoxiconazole. This work expands our understanding about epoxiconazole degradation and help us to properly assess the risk of epoxiconazole in soil.","Du, Pengqiang; He, Hairong; Zhou, Lin; Dong, Fengshou; Liu, Xingang; Zheng, Yongquan",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399219/,409
101568,Learning From the Decrease in US Emergency Department Visits in Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,2020-08-03,"INTRODUCTION The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exerted a heavy burden on public health worldwide. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Hangzhou, China. METHODS This was a retrospective study that included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in XiXi Hospital of Hangzhou from 15 January 2020 to 30 March 2020. We reviewed and analysed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features involving these cases. Age-tratification analysis was also implemented. RESULTS We analysed 96 confirmed cases. The patients had a mean age of 43 years, with six patients younger than 18 years and 14 patients older than 60 years. No significant gender difference was discovered. Co-morbidities were commonly observed in patients aged over 40 years. Twenty eight of the patients had travelled from Wuhan City, and 51 patients were infected through close contact. Familial clusters accounted for 48 of the cases. The mean incubation time was 7 days, and the symptoms were mainly fever, cough, fatigue, and sore throat. Lymphocytopenia was observed predominantly in patients aged over 60 years. Fifty five patients presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions. The radiological changes were typically distributed in the subpleural area, and pleural effusion rarely occurred. All patients were discharged successfully. CONCLUSION During the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, half of the patients from a designated hospital in Hangzhou City were discovered as familial clusters. Therefore, strict prevention and control measures during self-isolation should be implemented. Patients aged over 60 years who had underlying co-morbidities were prone to lymphocytopenia and severe infection.","Gao, J; Zhang, S; Zhou, K; Zhao, X; Liu, J; Pu, Z",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177240/,409

XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electronic microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscope), HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscope), UV-Vis, and Raman are adopted to ensure that this balsam pear-shaped CuO with dense nanoparticle protuberance is successfully prepared. The LOD of this CuO SERS substrate is 4.79 μg L-1 with R6G as molecular probe. By using DFT (density functional theory) calculation and FDTD (finite difference time domainmethod) simulation, both EM (electromagnetic enhancement) and CM (chemical enhancement) mechanisms are investigated, and the results show that these two-enhancement mechanisms can coexist in this balsam pear-shaped CuO. Finally, the prepared substrate has been applied for the determination of trace levels of paraquat in solution , and results show that its LOD for paraquat is 275 μg L-1 (optimum Raman band: 1646 cm-1 Raman shift), which is better than the government standard in China. A dexterous and facile way for fabrication of CuO SERS-active substrates with low cost and high performance, quite promising in detection of chemically hazardous substances and pesticide residue is provided.

106845,Attributes of Dysgeusia and Anosmia of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hospitalized Patients.,2020-11-11,"Phenomenon: Little is known about how participation in disaster relief impacts medical students. During the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, New York Medical College School of Medicine students witnessed the attacks and then became members of emergency treatment teams at St. Vincent's Hospital, the trauma center nearest to the World Trade Center. To date, only two reports describe how 9/11 influenced the lives of medical students. This study was designed to characterize the short- and long-term effects on NYMC students and to compare those effects between students assigned to St Vincent's Hospital and classmates assigned to rotations at facilities more remote from the attack site. We hypothesized that participation in direct relief efforts by students assigned to the St. Vincent's site might have long-lasting effects on their lives and these effects might vary when compared to classmates assigned elsewhere. Approach: This was a retrospective, survey-based, unmatched cohort study. Participants included all school of medicine graduates who were St. Vincent's rotators on 9/11 (N = 22) and classmates (N = 24) assigned to other sites who could be contacted and agreed to participate. Our primary measure was whether the 9/11 experience affected the participant's life, defined as an affirmative response to the item which asked whether the 9/11 experience affected the participant's ""life thereafter, career choice, attitudes toward life or attitudes toward practice."" Secondary measures included self-reported effects on career, life, attitudes, health, resilience, personal growth, personality features, and the temporal relationship between the attack and stress symptoms. Findings: Completed surveys were received from 16/22 (73%) St. Vincent's and 18/24 (75%) non-Saint Vincent's participants: 62% male, 82% had children, 74% identified as Caucasian/white and 76% employed full-time. Overall, slightly more than half (58%) of respondents reported an effect of 9/11 on their life, with a greater but non-significant proportion of St. Vincent's rotators reporting life impact (67% versus 50% for St. Vincent's versus other locations, respectively). High post-9/11 stress levels, current marriage, and ability to make and keep family and social relationships were associated with an effect on life which approached statistical significance. Participants reported positive or no post 9/11 effects on empathy and altruism (50%), resilience (47%), attitudes toward medical practice and career (32%), and charitable giving (24%), while positive, negative, or no effects were reported for attitude toward life, family and social relations, physical health, and conscientiousness. Mental health was the only domain in which all participants reported unchanged or negative effects. Two St. Vincent's rotators but no students assigned elsewhere believed they experienced 9/11-related post-traumatic stress disorder. Insights: Just over half of New York Medical College School of Medicine students rotating at St. Vincent's Hospital on 9/11 or elsewhere reported significant life-effects as a result of direct/indirect experiences related to the attack. Perceived stress may have been a more important driver of this life-change than other factors such as geographic proximity to the disaster site and/or direct participation in relief efforts. Further study of medical school interventions focused on stress reduction among students who participate in disaster relief is warranted.","Nabors, Christopher; Frishman, William H; Dhand, Abhay; Yandrapalli, Srikanth; Kumar, Anila; Pratt, Maryanne; Halperin, Edward C",Teaching and learning in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/10401334.2020.1818566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074731/,409

The gastric electrical stimulator (GES) is an alternative to gastrectomy in patients with medically refractory gastroparesis. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of patients treated with the gastric stimulator versus patients treated with laparoscopic subtotal or total gastrectomy. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients who had surgical treatment of gastroparesis from January 2003 to January 2012. Postoperative outcomes were analyzed and symptoms were assessed with the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). RESULTS There were 103 patients: 72 patients (26 male/46 female) with a GES, implanted either with laparoscopy (n = 20) or mini-incision (n = 52), and 31 patients (9 male/22 female) who underwent laparoscopic subtotal (n = 27), total (n = 1), or completion gastrectomy (n = 3). Thirty-day morbidity rate (8.3% vs. 23%, p = 0.06) and in-hospital mortality rate (2.7% vs. 3%, p = 1.00) were similar for GES and gastrectomy. There were 19 failures (26%) in the group of GES patients; of these, 13 patients were switched to a subtotal gastrectomy for persistent symptoms (morbidity rate 7.7%, mortality 0). In total, 57% of patients were treated with GES while only 43% had final treatment with gastrectomy. Of the GES group, 63% rated their symptoms as improved versus 87% in the primary gastrectomy group (p = 0.02). The patients who were switched from GES to secondary laparoscopic gastrectomy had 100% symptom improvement. The median total GCSI score did not show a difference between the procedures (p = 0.12). CONCLUSION The gastric electrical stimulator is an effective treatment for medically refractory gastroparesis. Laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy should also be considered as one of the primary surgical treatments for gastroparesis given the significantly higher rate of symptomatic improvement with acceptable morbidity and comparable mortality. Furthermore, the gastric stimulator patients who have no improvement of symptoms can be successfully treated by laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy.","Zehetner, Joerg; Ravari, Farrokh; Ayazi, Shahin; Skibba, Afshin; Darehzereshki, Ali; Pelipad, Diana; Mason, Rodney J; Katkhouda, Namir; Lipham, John C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2407-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22752276/,409

We identified adult (age ≥18 years) patients receiving biologic anti-inflammatory agents between 1 January 2012 and 31 March 2019 across the five Research Partners in the Biologic and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium's Distributed Research Network. We examined the number of incident use episodes for each biologic, as well as patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Curated data and analytic tools from the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System were used to perform the analyses. We identified 90,360 incident episodes of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi) and 70,506 incident episodes of non-TNFi medications. Adalimumab was the most common TNFi drug (47% of all TNFi episodes) and showed a steady increase in utilization during the study period compared to other TNFi agents. Rituximab was the most commonly initiated non-TNFi medication (44% of non-TNFi episodes). Other non-TNFi agents, namely, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and secukinumab, demonstrated notable increases in utilization over time. Biosimilar use was limited; we observed 653 incident episodes for infliximab-dyyb and 39 incident episodes for infliximab-abda. As more biologics enter the market, greater variation in the use of biologics with similar indications and between biologic originators and biosimilars is anticipated. Because information on efficacy and safety at the time of drug approval is limited, post-marketing surveillance and research is needed to monitor medication safety and evaluate effectiveness between biologic drugs using real-world data.","Mendelsohn, Aaron B; Nam, Young Hee; Marshall, James; McDermott, Cara L; Kochar, Bharati; Kappelman, Michael D; Brown, Jeffrey S; Lockhart, Catherine M",Pharmacology research & perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372729/,409

Diagnostically, p53 immunohistochemistry remains the only biomarker recommended clinically to aid histopathological diagnosis. The emerging mutational profile of BE is one of highly heterogeneous lesions at the genomic level with many mutations already occurring in non-dysplastic tissue. As well as point mutations, larger scale copy-number changes appear to have a key role in the progression to OAC and clinically applicable assays for the reliable detection of aneuploidy will be important to incorporate into future clinical management of patients. For some patients, the transition to malignancy may occur rapidly through a genome-doubling event or chromosomal catastrophe, termed chromothripsis, and detecting these patients may prove especially difficult. Given the heterogeneous nature of this disease, sampling methods to overcome inherent bias from endoscopic biopsies coupled with the development of more objective biomarkers than the current reliance on histopathology will be required for risk stratification. The aim of this approach will be to spare low-risk patients unnecessary procedures, as well as to provide endoscopic therapy to the patients at highest risk, thereby avoiding the burden of incurable metastatic disease.","Gregson, Eleanor M; Bornschein, Jan; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",British journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2016.219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27441494/,409

We screened for relevance studies that enrolled adults with chest trauma who developed mild to severe acute respiratory failure and were treated with NIV. We included studies reporting at least one clinical outcome of interest to perform a meta-analysis. RESULTS Ten studies (368 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included for the meta-analysis. Five studies (219 patients) reported mortality and results were quite homogeneous across studies, with a summary relative risk for patients treated with NIV compared with standard care (oxygen therapy and invasive mechanical ventilation) of 0.26 (95 % confidence interval 0.09-0.71, p = 0.003). There was no advantage in mortality of continuous positive airway pressure over noninvasive pressure support ventilation. NIV significantly increased arterial oxygenation and was associated with a significant reduction in intubation rate, in the incidence of overall complications and infections. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that NIV could be useful in the management of acute respiratory failure due to chest trauma.","Chiumello, D; Coppola, S; Froio, S; Gregoretti, C; Consonni, D",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-013-2901-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23571872/,409

111372,Racial Differences in Statewide Suicide Mortality Trends in Maryland During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.,2020-12-16,"OBJECTIVE Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a ""scar-less"" new surgical technique which has been gaining popularity over recent years. In comparison to conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery, SILS is introduced as a less invasive method. This technique has also been applied to colorectal surgery. The aim of the presenting study is to investigate the applicability of SILS and report short term results. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated prospectively collected data of 24 patients who had been operated with ""Single Incision Laparoscopic Colon Resection (SILCR)"" in our clinic between June 2011-June 2013. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before surgery. Patient data such as ASA and BMI values, need for additional surgery, tumors, number of lymph nodes resected, length of hospital stay, length of surgery, timing of flatus, time to start oral feeding and complications were recorded. RESULTS SILCR was performed in 24 patients. In 13 patients, SILCR was performed for cancer treatment. There was no need for extra ports, conversion to open surgery and stoma creation was also not necessary. Drain was placed in 4 patients. Overall complication rate was 12.5%. The mean number of lymph nodes in 13 patients who underwent SILCR for tumor was found to be 23 (14-33). The mean operative time and length of hospital stay was 177 minutes (110-363) and 5.35 days (4-11) respectively. Anastomotic leakage was not seen in any of the patients. In one patient, urinoma formation due to ureteral leakage was seen which resulted from thermal injury. CONCLUSION When we compare other series with almost the same number of patients' reported SILS results in the literature, we believe that we could draw conclusions from our data. SILS appears to have comparable results to conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery in the hands of experienced surgeons. It seems advantegous as it can be done with conventional laparoscopic instruments in a ""scar-less"" manner. Prospective randomized trials are necessary to define the benefits of one procedure over the other.","Ertem, Metin; Gök, Hakan; Özveri, Emel",Ulusal cerrahi dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5152/ucd.2013.2351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25931861/,409

Evaluation of studies is limited by sample size, retrospective design, heterogeneity of operative techniques, sparse adjustment for learning curve, and mixed results. Consequently, adoption of robotic colectomy by surgeons has been expectedly slow. The objectives of the study were to compare the outcomes of robotic colectomy to laparoscopic colectomy for patients with right-sided tumors undergoing a standardized completely intracorporeal operation and to examine the impact of prior experience with laparoscopic right colectomies on the performance of robotic right colectomies. Retrospective review of outcomes of consecutive patients undergoing a robotic right colectomy (robot) compared to those undergoing laparoscopic colectomy (LAP). LAP patients were further subdivided into a group during the learning curve (LC) and after the learning curve (post-LC). Data collected included operative time (OT), conversion to laparotomy, lymph nodes harvested (LN), length of stay (LOS), 30-day morbidity, and mortality. Comparison of continuous and categorical variables was assessed with the independent samples t test and Chi-square test, respectively. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, and significance defined as p < 0.05. 122 patients underwent robot (n = 21), LAP (n = 101), LC (n = 51), or post-LC (n = 50). OT was decreased for post-LC compared to LC (198 vs. 228 min). There were no conversions in robot and five with LAP. Morbidity was similar for robot (14%) compared to LAP (22%), LC (24%), or post-LC cases (20%). Median LOS was similar for robot vs. LAP (3 vs. 5 days). Robot had greater mean LN yield vs. LAP (19 vs. 14, p = 0.02). The initial outcomes with completely intracorporeal colectomy achieved robotically were equivalent to results during or after LC for laparoscopic resection. Proficiency gained with LAP seems to positively impact the initial results with the robot.","Blumberg, David",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-018-0895-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30474786/,409

Recently, the TME concept has been transformed into that of complete mesocolic excision (CME) in an attempt to improve prognosis for patients with colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Multidisciplinary team (MDT) workshops including the CME concept were held annually between 2004 and 2008 at the Karolinska University Hospital. The workshops focused on preoperative staging, surgery and histopathology and included lectures and live surgery sessions. To compare survival before and after the ""Stockholm Colon Cancer Project"" all patients diagnosed with a right sided colon cancer between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2003 (Group 1) and from January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2008 (Group 2) in Stockholm were identified from the Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR). RESULTS The proportion of patients having a tumour resection and the proportion having emergency surgery was higher in Group 1. There were more early tumours and more R0 resections in Group 2. Overall survival in all diagnosed patients and disease free survival after tumour resection was improved in the second time period.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the presence of cerebral microbleeds and their distribution are related to the integrity of white matter microstructures. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study comprised 982 participants who underwent brain MR imaging to determine microbleed status. The cross-sectional relation between microbleeds and the microstructural integrity of the white matter was assessed by 2 statistical methods: a multilinear regression model based on the average DTI parameters of normal-appearing white matter and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis, a tract-based voxelwise analysis. Fiber tractography was used to spatially describe the microstructural abnormalities along WM tracts containing a cerebral microbleed. RESULTS The presence of cerebral microbleeds was associated with lower mean fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, and the association remained when cardiovascular risk factors and cerebral small-vessel disease markers were further adjusted. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis indicated strictly lobar cerebral microbleeds associated with lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity, and higher radial diffusivity in the internal capsule and corpus callosum after adjusting other cerebral small-vessel disease markers, while only a few voxels remained associated with deep cerebral microbleeds. Diffusion abnormalities gradients along WM tracts containing a cerebral microbleed were not found in fiber tractography analysis. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral microbleeds are associated with widely distributed changes in white matter, despite their focal appearance on SWI.","Liu, J-Y; Zhou, Y-J; Zhai, F-F; Han, F; Zhou, L-X; Ni, J; Yao, M; Zhang, S; Jin, Z; Cui, L; Zhu, Y-C",AJNR.

During the COVID-19 pandemic confinement period, with a cut off in transportation as well as in occupational and physical activities, we observed a decrease in medical and elective surgical activities but emergency cases of upper limb and hand surgery increased. MATERIALS AND METHODS we conducted a retrospective epidemiological study to analyze two periods between the same dates in 2019 and 2020, for all the duration of the confinement period. We compared the numbers of consultations in the emergency department, elective surgeries, hand and upper limb emergency cases in our center and urgent limb surgeries in the nearby hospital. Then we compared the mechanisms and severity of injuries and the type of surgery. RESULTS between 2019 and 2020 there was a decrease of consultations in the emergency department in our institution of 52%, a decrease of total elective surgeries of 75%, a decrease in surgeries for urgent peripheral limb injuries of 50%, whereas the hand and upper limb emergency remained stable or even increased by 4% regard to occupational and domestic accidents. There was a significant difference in the mechanism of injury with an increase of domestic accident and a decrease of occupational, road traffic and sport accidents. Severity of the injuries increased, with augmentation of the number of tissues involved and longer expected time of recovery. CONCLUSION during the confinement period of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an important reduction of medical activities, the amount and severity of hand emergency cases increased. A specific plan regarding duty shift organization for hand trauma should be maintained regardless of the sanitary situation.","Fortané, Thibaut; Bouyer, Michael; Le Hanneur, Malo; Belvisi, Baptiste; Courtiol, Guillaume; Chevalier, Kevin; Dainotto, Caroline; Loret, Marie; Kling, Agathe; Bentejac, Antonin; Lafosse, Thibault",Injury,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2021.02.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622592/,409

In April 2020, the nation was shocked by the death by suicide of New York City emergency physician Dr. Lorna Breen, who died while recovering from COVID-19. She joins an unknown number of clinicians who have taken their lives over the past year. The authors introduce Dr. Breen, a highly talented physician working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine how pervasive distress and suicide are in clinicians. Then they explain the lived experience movement and highlight how clinicians speaking openly about their mental illness and treatment are making it easier for their colleagues to seek lifesaving help, despite the stigma still surrounding mental illness and treatment in medicine. The authors sort through the science of clinician distress, critique how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of clinicians, and describe existing national initiatives to address clinician stress, burnout, and suicide. Finally, they recommend evidence-based actions to prevent clinician suicide that multiple stakeholder groups can take, including regulatory agencies, licensing boards, and hospital privileging boards; specialty boards, professional associations, and continuing education organizations; medical educators; and individual clinicians. Suicide is a complex but generally preventable cause of death. Those in medicine must forge ahead with collective momentum. Dr. Breen, so many other clinicians, and those they have left behind deserve nothing less.","Moutier, Christine Yu; Myers, Michael F; Feist, Jennifer Breen; Feist, J Corey; Zisook, Sidney",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570850/,409

This impairs the cough response, which can increase the risk of complications if infected with coronavirus disease 2019. This case describes a 32-yr-old man with an acute traumatic motor incomplete spinal cord injury, C4 American Spinal cord Injury Association Impairment Scale D D, in an inpatient rehabilitation facility who presented with only a fever. Initial infectious workup was negative, and he continued to have elevated temperatures with no other symptoms. He was then tested for coronavirus disease 2019 and found to be positive. This is the first documented case that identifies this potentially lethal disease in an acute motor incomplete spinal cord injury in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. We further discuss how physiatrists need to be aware of milder presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with spinal cord injuries. Inability to recognize this disease can lead to delayed diagnosis and asymptomatic spread in an inpatient rehabilitation setting.","Khaliq, Fareea; Ratnasingam, Denesh; Bush-Arnold, Michael",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819923/,409

METHODS Eleven children between the ages of 1 month and 16 years requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation were simultaneously classified based on the bispectral index and the Comfort-B scale. Their behavior was recorded using digital photography, and the record was later evaluated by three independent evaluators. Agreement tests (Bland-Altman and Kappa) were then performed. The correlation between the two methods (Pearson correlation) was tested. RESULTS In total, 35 observations were performed on 11 patients. Based on the Kappa coefficient, the agreement among evaluators ranged from 0.56 to 0.75 (p<0.001). There was a positive and consistent association between the bispectral index and the Comfort-B scale [r=0.424 (p=0.011) to r=0.498 (p=0.002)]. CONCLUSION Due to the strong correlation between the independent evaluators and the consistent correlation between the two methods, the results suggest that the Comfort-B scale is reproducible and useful in classifying the level of sedation in children requiring mechanical ventilation.","Silva, Cláudia da Costa; Alves, Marta Maria Osório; El Halal, Michel Georges dos Santos; Pinheiro, Sabrina dos Santos; Carvalho, Paulo Roberto Antonacci",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,https://doi.org/10.5935/0103-507x.20130052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553512/,409

METHODS Data from patients who underwent surgical management for early-stage ovarian cancer between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients presented with stage I or II disease, and underwent comprehensive staging surgery consisting of a total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal cytology. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery (24 patients) or laparotomy (53 patients) were identified. Surgery for none of the patients was converted from laparoscopy to laparotomy. The mean operation time was shorter and the estimated blood loss was lower in the laparoscopy group than in the laparotomy group, though the differences were not statistically significant (193 min vs. 224 min, p=0.127; 698 mL vs. 973 mL, p=0.127). There were no differences in the intraoperative or postoperative complications. During a mean follow-up period of 31 months, tumor recurrence occurred in 4 patients: 2 (8.3%) in the laparoscopy group and 2 (3.8%) in the laparotomy group. The mean disease-free survival was 59 months after laparoscopy and 66 months after laparotomy (p=0.367). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery seems to be adequate and feasible for the treatment of early-stage ovarian cancer with comparable results to laparotomy in terms of the surgical outcomes and oncological safety.","Koo, Yu-Jin; Kim, Jung-Eun; Kim, Young-Hwa; Hahn, Ho-Suap; Lee, In-Ho; Kim, Tae-Jin; Lee, Ki-Heon; Shim, Jae-Uk; Lim, Kyung-Taek",Journal of gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2014.25.2.111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761214/,409

A laparoscopic approach has been advocated but access to more proximal diverticula is problematic. We propose the selective addition of a thoracoscopic approach to overcome these challenges and reviewed our results. METHODS A retrospective review from 2004 to 2015 identified 17 patients with an epiphrenic diverticulum who underwent surgery. Patients were grouped according to height of the diverticular neck (HDN) above the GEJ: group A < 5 cm, group B > 5 cm. Preoperative evaluation and type of surgery performed were recorded. Postoperative complications, mortality, and clinical outcomes using quality of life metrics and objective testing were assessed. RESULTS The mean size of the diverticulum was 3.3 cm (2-6 cm) with a mean height above the GEJ of 5.5 cm (0-12 cm). A motility disorder was identified in 15/17. Group A, 9 patients, underwent laparoscopic diverticulectomy, myotomy, and partial fundoplication. For group B, 8 patients, the intended procedure was thoracoscopic diverticulectomy followed by laparoscopic myotomy and partial fundoplication, but this was only completed in 5. In 3 the myotomy was aborted or incomplete with subsequent staple line leaks resulting in 1 death. At a mean follow-up of 21 months, improvement of median QOLRAD scores from 3.42 to 6.2 (p = 0.18); GERD-HRQL from 23 to 1 (p = 0.05), swallowing score from 17.5 to 30 (p = 0.22), and Eckardt scores from 5 to 0 (p < 0.05) were observed. CONCLUSIONS A minimally invasive strategy for epiphrenic diverticula based HDN above the GEJ and selective thoracoscopy for higher diverticula is feasible and appropriate, and resulted in improved quality of life. Incomplete myotomy was associated with a substantially higher complication rate. Laparoscopic myotomy should precede diverticulectomy for all cases, especially for high diverticula.","Achim, Virginie; Aye, Ralph W; Farivar, Alexander S; Vallières, Eric; Louie, Brian E",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5033-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27405481/,409

However, intracorporeal knot-tying under direct laparoscopy is difficult and requires proficiency. We conducted a retrospective study comparing the results of a long unidirectional barbed suturing technique (with V-Loc180 suture) and the results of conventional suturing as applied to laparoscopic myomectomy. METHODS In women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy in our university hospital between January 2011 and April 2013, uninterrupted suturing of 2 or more layers was performed. These women were divided into 2 groups according to the method of suturing: those in whom standard absorbable sutures were used (group P, n =42) and those in whom our suturing technique was used (group V, n =41). Patient characteristics and surgical variables were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS No significant between-group difference was observed in age (p = .975), body mass index (p = .778), GnRHa administration (p = .059), intraoperative vasopressin dose (p = .364), intraoperative blood loss (73.8 ± 64.1 vs. 59.3 ± 54.0 mL, respectively; p = .199), myoma mass (212.6 ± 133.3 vs. 208.3 ± 198.4 g, respectively; p = .134), ΔHb (p = .517), or postoperative hospital stay (p = .314). Operation time (mean ± SD) was significantly shorter for group V (71.2 ± 22.9 minutes; range, 28.0-110.0 minutes; p < .001) than for group P (94.4 ± 27.2 minutes; range, 53.0-165.0 minutes). No patient required intraoperative transfusion or conversion to laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS Our suturing technique exploits the features of unidirectional barbed sutures and can be used in the same way as the conventional method when performing continuous suturing for laparoscopic myomectomy. Our data suggest that operation time can be reduced by as much as 25% with this new technique.","Aoki, Yoichi; Kikuchi, Iwaho; Kumakiri, Jun; Kitade, Mari; Shinjo, Azusa; Ozaki, Rie; Kawasaki, Yu; Takeda, Satoru",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-14-84; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345546/,409

There is currently little evidence-based guidance regarding specific indications and outcomes for reoperative bariatric surgery. A task force was convened to review the current evidence regarding reoperative bariatric surgery. The aim of the review was to identify procedure-specific indications and outcomes for reoperative procedures. METHODS Literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting indications for and outcomes after reoperative bariatric surgery. Specifically, operations to treat complications, failed weight loss, and weight regain were evaluated. Abstract and manuscript reviews were completed by the task force members to identify, grade, and categorize relevant studies. RESULTS A total of 819 articles were identified in the initial search. After review for inclusion criteria and data quality, 175 articles were included in the systematic review and analysis. The majority of published studies are single center retrospective reviews. The evidence supporting reoperative surgery for acute and chronic complications is described. The evidence regarding reoperative surgery for failed weight loss and weight regain generally demonstrates improved weight loss and co-morbidity reduction after reintervention. Procedure-specific outcomes are described. Complication rates are generally reported to be higher after reoperative surgery compared to primary surgery. CONCLUSION The indications and outcomes for reoperative bariatric surgery are procedure-specific but the current evidence does support additional treatment for persistent obesity, co-morbid disease, and complications.","Brethauer, Stacy A; Kothari, Shanu; Sudan, Ranjan; Williams, Brandon; English, Wayne J; Brengman, Matthew; Kurian, Marina; Hutter, Matthew; Stegemann, Lloyd; Kallies, Kara; Nguyen, Ninh T; Ponce, Jaime; Morton, John M",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776071/,409
151950,Management of Patients With Severe Mental Illness During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,2020-06-24,"Molecular hydrogen (H2 ) was long regarded as non-functional in mammalian cells. We overturned the concept by demonstrating that H2 exhibits antioxidant effects and protects cells against oxidative stress. Subsequently, it has been revealed that H2 has multiple functions in addition to antioxidant effects, including ant-inflammatory, anti-allergic functions, and as a cell death and autophagy regulation. Additionally, H2 stimulates energy metabolism. Because H2 does not readily react with most biomolecules without a catalyst, it is essential to identify the primary targets with which H2 reacts or interacts directly. As a first event, H2 may react directly with strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in vivo. This review addresses the key issues related to this in vivo reaction. •OH may have a physiological role because it triggers a free radical chain reaction and may be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ - or mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+ - channeling. In the subsequent pathway, H2 suppressed a free radical chain reaction, leading to decreases in lipid peroxide and its end products. Derived from the peroxides, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal functions as a mediator that up-regulates multiple functional PGC-1α. As the other direct target in vitro and in vivo, H2 intervenes in the free radical chain reaction to modify oxidized phospholipids, which may act as an antagonist of Ca2+ -channels. The resulting suppression of Ca2+ - signaling inactivates multiple functional NFAT and CREB transcription factors, which may explain H2 multifunctionality. This review also addresses the involvement of NFAT in the beneficial role of H2 in COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease and advanced cancer. We discuss some unsolved issues of H2 action on lipopolysaccharide signaling, MAPK and NF-κB pathways and the Nrf2 paradox. Finally, as a novel idea for the direct targeting of H2 , this review introduces the possibility that H2 causes structural changes in proteins via hydrate water changes.","Ohta, Shigeo",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666200806101137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767925/,409

156319,Commentary: COVID-19 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: A long way from home.,2020-12-09,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant challenges on hospital capacity. While mitigating unnecessary crowding in hospitals is favourable to reduce viral transmission, it is more important to prevent readmissions with impaired clinical status due to initially inappropriate level of care. A validated predictive tool to assist clinical decisions for patient triage and facilitate remote stratification is of critical importance. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study in patients with confirmed COVID-19 stratified into two levels of care, namely ambulatory care and hospitalization. Data on socio-demographics, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities were collected during the first (N = 571) and second waves (N = 174) of the pandemic in Belgium (2 March to 6 December 2020). Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to build and validate the prediction model. RESULTS Significant predictors of hospitalization were old age (OR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.06-1.10), male gender (OR = 4.41, 95%CI: 2.58-7.52), dyspnoea (OR 6.11, 95%CI: 3.58-10.45), dry cough (OR 2.89, 95%CI: 1.54-5.41), wet cough (OR 4.62, 95%CI: 1.93-11.06), hypertension (OR 2.20, 95%CI: 1.17-4.16) and renal failure (OR 5.39, 95%CI: 1.00-29.00). Rhinorrhea (OR 0.43, 95%CI: 0.24-0.79) and headache (OR 0.36, 95%CI: 0.20-0.65) were negatively associated with hospitalization. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and the area under the ROC curve was 0.931 (95% CI: 0.910-0.953) for the prediction model (first wave) and 0.895 (95% CI: 0.833-0.957) for the validated dataset (second wave). CONCLUSION With a good discriminating power, the prediction model might identify patients who require ambulatory care or hospitalization and support clinical decisions by Emergency Department staff and general practitioners.","Diep, Anh Nguyet; Gilbert, Allison; Saegerman, Claude; Gangolf, Marjorie; D'Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre; Donneau, Anne-Françoise",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1903548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793352/,409

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS Compare rates of food sufficiency and utilization of free food sources between working-age persons with and without disabilities in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In September 2020, an online survey was conducted with n = 13,277 working-age individuals with and without disabilities to gather information about food sufficiency prior to COVID-19 (i.e., in March 2020) and within the last seven days as well as receipt of free groceries or meals, use of food programs or pantries, and concerns with using free food sources over the past week. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were used to compare these measures for persons with and without disabilities. RESULTS Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, the proportion of working-age persons who were food sufficient decreased from March 2020 to September 2020 for persons with disabilities (65%-57%, an eight-percentage point decrease) and for persons without disabilities (78%-73%, a five-percentage point decrease). The rates of change were not significantly different between groups. In September 2020, higher proportions of persons with disabilities (58%) used free food resources in the past week than persons without disabilities (41%). CONCLUSIONS The low rate of food sufficiency, the high rate of free food resource utilization, and the concerns noted by working-age persons with disabilities in using these sources suggest a need for continuing nutrition assistance policy and program development targeted towards the needs of persons with disabilities.","Brucker, Debra L; Stott, Grace; Phillips, Kimberly G",Disability and health journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183289/,409
161155,"Clinical analysis of seven pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Jingzhou, Hubei, China: a retrospective study.",2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND/AIMS We have reported the neuroprotective properties of Heat shock protein B8(HSPB8) against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced injury by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. However, the exact underlying mechanism of its protective effect on mitochondrial function remains unknown. Here we examined whether the beneficial effect of HSPB8 on OGD/R-induced cell death is associated with mitophagy in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells. METHODS Using the mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model and mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cell cultures subjected to OGD/R, we employed western-blot, RT-PCR and immunostaining to analyze the change of expression pattern of HSPB8 and mitophagic flux after brain I/R both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, via overexpressing HSPB8 or knocking down HSPB8 expression with siRNA in N2a cell, we evaluated the effect of HSPB8 on mitochondrial function during OGD/R. The impact of HSPB8 on mitophagic pathway was also assessed. Finally, mitotophagy inhibitors (CQ and Mdivi-1) were adopted to verify the involvement of mitophagy in HSPB8- induced neuroprotection. RESULTS HSPB8 could be up-regulated by brain I/R both in vivo and in vitro. Mitophagy enhancement coincided with induction of HSPB8 during I/R. Overexpression of HSPB8 reinforced I/R-induced mitophagy in OGD/R-treated mouse N2a cells and HSPB8 silence suppressed mitophagy process. Inhibition of mitophagy compromised neuroprotection conferred by HSPB8 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS HSPB8 promoted OGD/R-induced mitophagy, which restored the mitochondrial function and contributed to the decrease in cell apoptosis after OGD/R. Therefore, HSPB8 could be a favorable neuroprotective agent for cerebral I/R related disorders.","Li, Fazhao; Tan, Jieqiong; Zhou, Fangfang; Hu, Zhiping; Yang, Binbin","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",https://doi.org/10.1159/000492259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071537/,409

Further, how long-term SO2 affects Puerto Rican children living in the island of Puerto Rico, a group with high asthma prevalence, is unclear. We evaluated the effects of annual average 1-hour daily maximum SO2 average on asthma, atopy, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), and lung function in Puerto Rican children. METHODS A cohort of 678 children (351 with asthma, 327 without asthma) was recruited in Puerto Rico from 2009 to 2010. Annual average 1-hour daily maximum SO2 exposure was interpolated utilizing publicly available monitoring data. Multivariable logistic and linear regression was used for the analysis of asthma, atopy (defined as an IgE ≥0.35 IU/mL to at least one of five common aero-allergens), total IgE, and lung function measures (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], and FEV1/FVC ratio). RESULTS Annual SO2 exposure (per 1 ppb) was significantly associated with asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-1.91) and atopy (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.02-1.78). Such exposure was also significantly associated with lower FEV1/FVC in all children (β = -1.42; 95% CI = -2.78 to -0.08) and in children with asthma (β = -2.39; 95% CI= -4.31 to -0.46). Annual SO2 exposure was not significantly associated with total IgE, FEV1, or FVC. CONCLUSIONS Among Puerto Rican children in Puerto Rico, long-term SO2 exposure is linked to asthma and atopy. In these children, long-term SO2 exposure is also associated with reduced FEV1/FVC, particularly in those with asthma.","Rosser, Franziska; Forno, Erick; Kurland, Kristen S; Han, Yueh-Ying; Mair, Christina; Acosta-Pérez, Edna; Canino, Glorisa; Celedón, Juan C",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31805225/,409

Identifying the culprit drug is essential; however, despite numerous methods being published, there are no consensus guidelines. Objectives: Conduct a scoping review to identify all published methods of culprit drug identification for cutaneous drug eruptions, compare the methods, and generate hypotheses for future causality assessment studies. Eligibility criteria: Peer-reviewed publications involving culprit drug identification methods. Sources of evidence: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Charting methods: Registered PRISMA-ScR format protocol on Open Science Forum. Results: In total, 135 publications were included comprising 656,635 adverse drug events, most of which were cutaneous. There were 54 methods of culprit drug identification published, categorized as algorithms, probabilistic approaches, and expert judgment. Algorithms had higher sensitivity and positive predictive value, but lower specificity and negative predictive value. Probabilistic approaches had lower sensitivity and positive predictive value, but higher specificity and negative predictive value. Expert judgment was subjective, less reproducible, but the most frequently used to validate other methods. Studies suggest that greater accuracy may be achieved by specifically assessing cutaneous drug eruptions and using combinations of causality assessment categories. Conclusions: Culprit drug identification for adverse drug reactions remains a challenge. Many methods have been published, but there are no consensus guidelines. Using causality assessment methods specifically for cutaneous drug eruptions and combining aspects of the different causality assessment categories may improve efficacy.

Recommendations of the association of rheumatologists of Russia,2021,"The digital divide between Indigenous and other Australians describes the unequal access to information and communications technology (ICT) between these groups. Historically, researchers have focused on acquiring new technology, but we argue that it is important to understand all the dynamics of digital usage, including the loss of access to ICT within a household. For long-lived technology such as internet access, it is particularly important to consider that retention of access to the technology. This paper conducts a longitudinal analysis of changes in internet usage for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian households using the Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset, 2006–2016. While earlier work analyses the digital divide in terms of ‘diffusion’ or adoption of ICT, this paper shows that the failure to retain internet access is also important in driving the digital divide. The dynamics of the digital divide have important and ongoing implications for addressing broader socioeconomic disadvantages experienced by Indigenous Australians. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency of policy addressing the digital divide, given the renewed momentum for remote learning and telecommuting.","Hunter, Boyd H.; Radoll, Peter J.",Australasian Journal of Information Systems,https://doi.org/10.3127/ajis.v24i0.1805,409
166732,Clinical Experience and Lessons of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Early in the Pandemic at a Public Regional Core Hospital,2021,"Soon after the first COVID-19 positive case was detected in Wuhan, China, the virus spread around the globe, and in no time, it was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. Testing, which is the first step in identifying and diagnosing COVID-19, became the first need of the masses. Therefore, testing kits for COVID-19 were manufactured for efficiently detecting COVID-19. However, due to limited resources in the densely populated countries, testing capacity even after a year is still a limiting factor for COVID-19 diagnosis on a larger scale and contributes to a lag in disease tracking and containment. Due to this reason, we started this study to provide a better cost-effective solution for enhancing the testing capacity so that the maximum number of people could get tested for COVID-19. For this purpose, we utilized the approach of artificial neural networks (ANN) to acquire the relevant data on COVID-19 and its testing. The data were analyzed by using Machine Learning, and probabilistic algorithms were applied to obtain a statistically proven solution for COVID-19 testing. The results obtained through ANN indicated that sample pooling is not only an effective way but also regarded as a “Gold standard” for testing samples when the prevalence of the disease is low in the population and the chances of getting a positive result are less. We further demonstrated through algorithms that pooling samples from 16 individuals is better than pooling samples of 8 individuals when there is a high likelihood of getting negative test results. These findings provide ground to the fact that if sample pooling will be employed on a larger scale, testing capacity will be considerably increased within limited available resources without compromising the test specificity. It will provide healthcare units and enterprises with solutions through scientifically proven algorithms, thus, saving a considerable amount of time and finances. This will eventually help in containing the spread of the pandemic in densely populated areas including vulnerably confined groups, such as nursing homes, hospitals, cruise ships, and military ships.","Mustafa Kamal, Pasha Syed Fasih Ali Gardazi Fariha Imtiaz Asma Talib Qureshi Afrasiab Rabia",Journal of Intelligent Systems,https://doi.org/10.1515/jisys-2021-0041,409

The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) Background in patients with moderate HEART score referred from an urgent care (UC) for an expedited outpatient cardiology evaluation for 11 months was described in 133 patients in a previous study. This is a follow-up study with 18 months of data and 206 patients. The primary outcome was to examine the rate of MACE when patients with moderate HEART score were referred for an expedited outpatient cardiology Aim follow-up after evaluation in urgent care. The secondary outcome was to determine if there is a decrease in rate of ED transfer after this protocol was introduced. A cross-sectional study was conducted by a multispecialty group in Las Vegas, Nevada, which included 206 patients with a HEART score of 4 to 6 (i.e.: moderate risk) who presented to one of five UC centers with chest pain or an anginal equivalent.

The surfactant has the function of reducing the surface tension of the alveoli. The less pulmonary surfactant there is, the more the alveoli tend to collapse due to the increased surface tension of their surface. Consequently, the lung would tend to collapse, that is, to reduce its volume, but collapse is prevented by the muscular movement of inspiration, which instead increases its volume. This means that a “low-pressure area” is created in the interstitial space which attracts liquid and substances which are often inflammatory and which organize over time, giving rise to interstitial pneumonia.ResultsI propose to administer the pulmonary surfactant to the patient Covid-19 in the presence of dyspnea and certainly during assisted ventilation. This technique is routinely used in preterm infants suffering from lack of pulmonary surfactant production due to the immaturity of type II alveolar cells, pending that once matured these cells produce it autonomously.ConclusionsSimilarly, the administration of surfactant during Covid-19 lung infection would allow the correct amount of surfactant to be maintained during the acute phase of the infection and would give time for type II alveolar cells to heal and independently resume surfactant production.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Bracco, L.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1871,409

However, a bottleneck remains due to a lack of techniques for detecting and sorting environmental microorganisms with vast diversity and abundance. Here, we developed a fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) pipeline for high-throughput screening of PET-degrading microorganisms or enzymes (PETases). The pipeline comprises three steps: generation and incubation of droplets encapsulating single cells, picoinjection of fluorescein dibenzoate (FDBz) as the fluorogenic probe, and screening of droplets to obtain PET-degrading cells. We characterized critical factors associated with this method, including specificity and sensitivity for discriminating PETase from other enzymes. We then optimized its performance and compatibility with environmental samples. The system was used to screen a wastewater sample from a PET textile mill. We successfully obtained PET-degrading species from nine different genera. Moreover, two putative PETases from isolates Kineococcus endophyticus Un-5 and Staphylococcus epidermidis Un-C2-8 were genetically derived, heterologously expressed, and preliminarily validated for PET-degrading activities. We speculate that the FADS pipeline can be widely adopted to discover new PET-degrading microorganisms and enzymes in various environments and may be utilized in the directed evolution of PETases using synthetic biology.","Qiao, Yuxin; Hu, Ran; Chen, Dongwei; Wang, Li; Fu, Ye; Li, Chunli; Dong, Zhiyang; Weng, Yunxuan; Du, Wenbin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.443719,409

Here, we have developed a novel cancer vaccine platform based on BCG that can direct BCG-induced immune responses against tumour antigens. By physically attaching tumour-specific peptides onto the mycobacterial outer membrane, we were able to induce strong systemic and intratumoural T cell-specific immune responses towards the attached tumour antigens. These therapeutic peptides can be attached to the mycobacterial outer membrane using a cell-penetrating peptide sequence derived from human immunodeficiency virus Tat, N-terminally fused to the tumour-specific peptides. Alternatively, therapeutic peptides can be conjugated with a poly-lysine sequence N-terminally fused to the tumour-specific peptides. Using two mouse models of melanoma and a mouse model of colorectal cancer, we observed that the anti-tumour responses of BCG can be significantly improved by coating the BCG with tumour-specific peptides. In addition, by combining this novel cancer vaccine platform with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, the number of responders to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy can be significantly increased.","Ylösmäki, Erkko; Martins, Beatriz; Fusciello, Manlio; Feola, Sara; Hamdan, Firas; Chiaro, Jacopo; Ylösmäki, Leena; Vaughan, Matthew J.; Viitala, Tapani; Kulkarni, Prasad S.; Cerullo, Vincenzo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.05.434062,409

With the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, different articles have been published highlighting the superiority of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) over the gold reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. In this study, we developed simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and fourplex (4 targets) assays based on a two color ddPCR system for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results showed that the fourplex assay had the similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical isolates demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug couldnt.

Invest. 88:119-125). In this study we characterized the rabbit ileal BB receptor for this toxin. Purified toxin receptor peptides of 19 and 24 amino acids showed 100% homology with rabbit sucrase-isomaltase (SI). Guinea pig receptor antiserum reacted in Western blots with rabbit SI and with the purified toxin receptor. Antireceptor IgG blocked in vitro binding of toxin A to rabbit ileal villus cell BB. Furthermore, anti-SI IgG inhibited toxin A-induced secretion (by 78.1%, P < 0.01), intestinal permeability (by 80.8%, P < 0.01), and histologic injury (P < 0.01) in rabbit ileal loops in vivo. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with SI cDNA showed increased intracellular calcium increase in response to native toxin (holotoxin) or to a recombinant 873-amino acid peptide representing the receptor binding domain of toxin A. These data suggest that toxin A binds specifically to carbohydrate domains on rabbit ileal SI, and that such binding is relevant to signal transduction mechanisms that mediate in vitro and in vivo toxicity.","Pothoulakis, C; Gilbert, R J; Cladaras, C; Castagliuolo, I; Semenza, G; Hitti, Y; Montcrief, J S; Linevsky, J; Kelly, C P; Nikulasson, S; Desai, H P; Wilkins, T D; LaMont, J T",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8698855/,409

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS 1,226,159 dogs vaccinated at 360 veterinary hospitals. PROCEDURE Electronic records from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003, were searched for possible VAAEs (nonspecific vaccine reaction, allergic reaction, urticaria, or anaphylaxis) diagnosed within 3 days of vaccine administration. Information included age, weight, sex, neuter status, and breed. Specific clinical signs and treatments were reviewed in a random sample of 400 affected dogs. The association between potential risk factors and a VAAE was estimated by use of multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS 4,678 adverse events (38.2/10,000 dogs vaccinated) were associated with administration of 3,439,576 doses of vaccine to 1,226,159 dogs. The VAAE rate decreased significantly as body weight increased. Risk was 27% to 38% greater for neutered versus sexually intact dogs and 35% to 64% greater for dogs approximately 1 to 3 years old versus 2 to 9 months old. The risk of a VAAE significantly increased as the number of vaccine doses administered per office visit increased; each additional vaccine significantly increased risk of an adverse event by 27% in dogs < or = 10 kg (22 lb) and 12% in dogs > 10 kg. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Young adult small-breed neutered dogs that received multiple vaccines per office visit were at greatest risk of a VAAE within 72 hours after vaccination.

Intestinal parasites, Bordetella pertussis, and other infectious disease agents can also be transmitted. Some of these infections may be inapparent or may not manifest in adopted children until many years after the adoption. Increased attention to preventive measures for family members and early diagnosis of infectious diseases in adopted children can reduce transmission of the organisms causing these infections.

194727,Sinus bradycardia: an unusual manifestation of mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.,2020-12-01,"Wild-type human hepatitis B virus (HBV) exhibits selective export of virions containing mature genomes. In contrast, changing an isoleucine to a leucine at amino acid 97 (I97L) of the HBV core antigen (HBcAg) causes it to release immature genomes. To elucidate the structure-function relationship of HBcAg at amino acid 97, we systematically replaced the isoleucine residue at this position with 18 other amino acids via mutagenesis. Twelve of the 18 mutants exhibited no significant phenotype, while five new mutants displayed strong phenotypes. The I97D mutant had a near lethal phenotype, the I97P mutant exhibited a significantly reduced level of virion secretion, and the I97G mutant lacked the full-length relaxed circular form of viral DNA. The tip of the spike of the capsid particle is known to contain a predominant B-cell epitope. However, the recognition of this exposed epitope by an anti-HBc antibody appeared to be affected by the I97E mutation or by histidine tagging at the C terminus of mutant HBcAg, which is presumably in the capsid interior. Surprisingly, the nuclear HBcAg of mutants I97E and I97W, produced from either a replicon or an expression vector, was found to be colocalized with nucleolin and B23 at a frequency of nearly 100% by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In contrast, this colocalization occurred with wild-type HBcAg only to a limited extent. We also noted that nucleolin-colocalizing cells were often binucleated or apoptotic, suggesting that the presence of HBcAg in the nucleolus may perturb cytokinesis. The mechanism of this phenomenon and its potential involvement in liver pathogenesis are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nucleolar HBcAg in culture.","Ning, Bo; Shih, Chiaho",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564475/,409

195499,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.,2020-03-01,"The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome contains cis-acting sequences necessary for transcription and replication. A consensus secondary structural model of the 5' 140 nucleotides of the 5' UTRs of nine coronaviruses (CoVs) derived from all three major CoV groups is presented and characterized by three major stem-loops, SL1, SL2, and SL4. NMR spectroscopy provides structural support for SL1 and SL2 in three group 2 CoVs, including MHV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43. SL2 is conserved in all CoVs, typically containing a pentaloop (C47-U48-U49-G50-U51 in MHV) stacked on a 5 base-pair stem, with some sequences containing an additional U 3' to U51; SL2 therefore possesses sequence features consistent with a U-turn-like conformation. The imino protons of U48 in the wild-type RNA, and G48 in the U48G SL2 mutant RNA, are significantly protected from exchange with solvent, consistent with a hydrogen bonding interaction critical to the hairpin loop architecture. SL2 is required for MHV replication; MHV genomes containing point substitutions predicted to perturb the SL2 structure (U48C, U48A) were not viable, while those that maintain the structure (U48G and U49A) were viable. The U48C MHV mutant supports both positive- and negative-sense genome-sized RNA synthesis, but fails to direct the synthesis of positive- or negative-sense subgenomic RNAs. These data support the existence of the SL2 in our models, and further suggest a critical role in coronavirus replication.","Liu, Pinghua; Li, Lichun; Millership, Jason J; Kang, Hyojeung; Leibowitz, Julian L; Giedroc, David P",RNA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17353353/,409

These include the following: 1) insufficient coordination between hospitals and civil/governmental response agencies; 2) insufficient on-site critical care capability; 3) a lack of ""portability"" of acute care processes (i.e., patient transport and/or bringing care to the patient); 4) education shortfalls; and 5) the inability of hospitals to align disaster medical requirements with other competing priorities. CONCLUSIONS Definition of the roles and responsibilities of a hospital during a disaster requires additional planning precision beyond the prehospital response phase. Planners must also better define plans for circumstances when or if a hospital is rendered unusable. Disaster medical training of hospital personnel has been inadequate. This article details the specifics of these issues and outlines various potential approaches to begin addressing and formulating remedies to these shortfalls.","Farmer, J Christopher; Carlton, Paul K",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16477204/,409

METHODS Baseline, 12, 24 and 36 month data were obtained retrospectively from the National Institutes of Health Osteoarthritis Initiative. Participants had symptomatic radiographic knee OA. Multiple binary logistic regression models identified characteristics independently associated with the use of analgesics or nutraceuticals. RESULTS We included 987 subjects (55.9% female, mean age 61.5 years, 71.0% white). At baseline, 68.2% reported frequent use of a conventional analgesic or nutraceutical for joint pain (for more than half of the previous month). Non-prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most frequently reported medications (26.8%), even in those more than 75-years old. Multiple conventional analgesics were used by 11.9%. Frequent analgesic use was more likely in women (odds ratio (OR) 1.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.3)) and people with more pain (moderate 1.7 (1.2 to 2.4); severe 3.1 (2.1 to 4.7)); nutraceutical use was less likely in non-whites (0.4 (0.3 to 0.6)), those more than 74-years old (0.6 (0.3 to 0.9)) and those with comorbidities (0.6 (0.5 to 0.9)) and more likely in people with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 4 (2.2 (1.5 to 3.3)). Overall there was no change in the proportion of participants frequently using prescription or over the counter (OTC) analgesics at 36 months, although most people had changed medication type; of those using a traditional analgesic at baseline approximately one third were still using the same type at 36 months (ranging from 26.2% of baseline prescription NSAID users to 40.6% of baseline acetaminophen users). All participants reporting baseline analgesic use also reported 36 month analgesic use. Female participants (OR 95% CI 1.2 to 3.2, P = 0.009), those with high body mass index (1.2 to 4.8, P = 0.010) and those with moderate (1.6 to 2.6, P = 0.090) or severe (1.8 to 12.0, P = 0.002) baseline pain were more likely to use pain medication during the 36 month follow-up period; participants more than 75-years old were less likely (0.2 to 1.0, P = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS Most people with knee OA used pharmacological therapies frequently, and use appeared to be according to American College of Rheumatology recommendations.

Metformin is considered as the first-line medication for the treatment of T2D, especially in obese patients. Beyond its glucose-lowering activity, metformin exerts pleiotropic effects, among which an anti-inflammatory effect that could be beneficial. However, metformin is contraindicated in case of severe renal insufficiency, liver failure and/or unstable heart failure, because of a risk of lactic acidosis. Yet, COVID-19, besides the well-known pneumonia that can be responsible for severe hypoxemia, may be associated with multisystemic organ failure, among which kidneys, liver and heart. Thus, the question arises whether metformin, which represents the background therapy in above 80 % of patients with T2D, should be continued in patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or instead be stopped. This article summarizes the most important results of observational studies, which all argue for a beneficial effect of metformin therapy that is associated with a significant reduction in mortality among hospitalized patients with T2D due to COVID-19.

Influenza virus types A & B (Inf A & B), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (ADV) were identified by indirect immuno-fluorescent staining. Medical records of the patients with positive virus cultures were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS One or more viral agents were isolated from 1682 specimens (25.7%). The pathogens identified were RSV 37.2%, ADV 19.9%, Inf A 18.9%, PIV 17.5% and Inf B 6.4%. The most frequent pathogen of pneumonia and acute bronchiolitis was RSV and that of croup was PIV. Upper respiratory tract infections were more prevalent in adults and the most frequently caused by influenza virus. Influenza virus itself was more frequently isolated in children less than six years old, which was different from previous reports. Influenza virus was mostly isolated in the winter and spring, while RSV was usually isolated from early fall with a peak incidence in the winter. Inf A and RSV showed a dampening effect on the occurrence of other viruses during their major epidemic. PIV was mostly detected in the spring and summer. ADV was isolated throughout the whole year. CONCLUSIONS The epidemiological characteristics of respiratory virus infections in Seoul and the neighboring areas in 2004-2006, were similar to the findings of previous reports except for some minor changes. These findings could be useful to clinicians in managing their patients.","Kim, Sun Hyung; Huh, Ji Hoon; Bae, Sook Young; Kim, Jang Su; Yoon, Soo Young; Lim, Chae Seung; Cho, Yunjung; Kim, Young Kee; Lee, Kap No; Lee, Chang Kyu",The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18156750/,409

The recent therapeutic development for psoriasis has been remarkable and biologics have dramatically changed the treatment of psoriasis. In moderate-to-severe cases, systemic therapies are required to control their symptoms and biologics can provide greater efficacy when compared with other types of therapies. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a great impact on the lives of many people and has worsened substantially worldwide. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it still remains unclear whether biologics suppress the immune system and increase the risk of COVID-19. In this review, we have summarized the experience with biologics used for treating psoriasis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biologics seem to be beneficial to COVID-19 infection.

The disease rapidly crossed the barrier of countries, continents and spread globally. Non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing, face mask, frequent hand washing and use of sanitizer remained the best available option to prevent the spread of disease. OPD, IPD admissions, elective O. Ts were curtailed. Orthopedic care was only limited to emergency and semi-urgent procedures like necrotizing fasciitis, open fracture, and compartment syndrome. These measures were taken to preserve infrastructure and manpower to manage covid-19 pandemic. The children were thought to have a low susceptibility to covid-19 as compared to an adult. Deferring the patient during pandemic has led to high orthopedic disease burden, morbidity and disease-related sequelae, hence elective care must be resumed with modified hospital infrastructure. Resumption of elective/emergent orthopedic care should be slow, phasic and strategic, much similar to unlocking. Cases must be stratified depending on covid status and severity. Dedicated O.Ts with neutral/negative pressure and HEPA filter for covid positive and suspected patients are to be used. All symptomatic and suspected patients should be investigated for covid-19 by RT-PCR, blood counts and CT scan. Regional anaesthesia should be preferred to General anaesthesia. Power drill/saw/burr/pulse lavage should be minimized to avoid aerosol generation. Postoperatively continuous surveillance and monitoring to be done for covid related symptoms. Medical institutes rapidly shifted to the online mode of education. Blended learning (virtual & physical) and imparting skills have to be continued in post covid phase with equitable distribution of teaching hours to students of different years.","Kumar, Saurabh; Shah, Bhushan; Johari, Ashok; Anjum, Rashid; Garg, Devansh; Salhotra, Rashmi; Tyagi, Asha; Khan, Amir Maroof; Jain, Anil Kumar",Indian J Orthop,,409

The significance of Ct values in epidemiological studies and large cohorts is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To monitor Ct values in a long-term study and compare the results with demographic data of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. STUDY DESIGN: S gene SARS-CoV-2 Ct values were analyzed retrospectively from consecutive patients between March 15th to September 15th 2020 with special regard to age, gender, and in- or outpatient status. RESULTS: In total, 65,878 patients were tested, 1103 (1.7 %) of whom were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six positive patients were excluded, because the respective PCR runs did not meet the stability requirements (Ct value of the positive controls between 26 and 29). Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04). Patients in the age groups >80 years had significantly higher Ct values than the remaining age groups (p < 0.001). Children (0-19 years) showed Ct values in the range of those found in adults (25.2 vs. 25.1, p = 0.9). There were no statistically different Ct values between in- and outpatients (p = 0.1), however, SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients were significantly older than outpatients (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CT values are suitable for more detailed monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Age is an important cofactor in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and may have influence on Ct values in SARS-CoV-2-PCR.","Ade, Carolin; Pum, Joachim; Abele, Iris; Raggub, Lubna; Bockmühl, Dirk; Zöllner, Bernhard",J Clin Virol,,409

205889,Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities,2020,"BACKGROUND: Wound complications following midline laparotomies are common and the main source of postoperative morbidity including superficial or deep wound infection, skin dehiscence, fascia dehiscence, and incisional hernia. Abdominal closure complications are strongly associated with suture technique and material, in addition to other factors related to the patient and type of surgery performed. The traditional technique is to place the fascia sutures 1 cm apart and at least 1 cm away from the fascia edge. A Swedish study described a new technique of placing the sutures 5 mm apart and 5 mm away from the fascia edge, resulting in lower rates of abdominal wound complications. This study has a number of limitations. There is a need for improved quality evidence to convince the surgical community to change the closure technique of abdominal wounds aiming to reduce morbidity, which is exemplified in incisional hernias and other various postop complications. METHODS: This is a 1:1 randomized, controlled, patient- and assessor-blinded, parallel design, superiority trial, with a primary endpoint of incisional hernia at 1 year. The study will be conducted at AUBMC over a 3-year period. Patients planned for a non-emergent midline laparotomy for general surgery or vascular procedure will be randomized to either fascia closure technique. In order to detect a drop of 12% in the incidence of incisional hernia, with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, we will need to recruit 114 patients per arm. After adjusting for loss to follow-up, target recruitment is 274 subjects. We will compare both arms for the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes, using chi-square or t test as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be done. DISCUSSION: This trial will assess postop complications following abdominal midline wound closures via two different suturing techniques. This trial will generate evidence-based conclusions that will allow surgeons to assess the role of a new abdominal closure technique in decreasing short- and long-term postoperative complications, for a commonly performed procedure.

206286,"Coronavirus disease 2019, school closures, and children’s mental health",2020,"BACKGROUND: Doctors commonly continue to work when they are unwell. This norm is increasingly problematic during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic when effective infection control measures are of paramount importance. This study investigates the barriers existing before COVID-19 that prevent junior doctors with an acute respiratory illness working in Canberra, Australia, from taking sick leave, and offers suggestions about how to make sick leave more accessible for junior doctors. METHODS: Anonymous online survey study. RESULTS: 192 junior doctors were invited to participate in the study. Fifty-four responded, and only those who had worked whilst unwell with an acute respiratory illness were included, providing a total number of fifty responses. Of these, 72% believed they were infectious at the time they worked whilst unwell. 86% of respondents did not feel supported by the workplace to take sick leave when they were unwell, and 96% identified concerns about burdening colleagues with extra workload and lack of available cover as the main deterrents to accessing sick leave. CONCLUSION: Junior doctors at our health service, pre-COVID-19, do not widely feel empowered to take sick leave when they have an acute respiratory illness. Junior doctors are primarily concerned about burdening their colleagues with extra workloads in an environment where they perceive there to be a lack of available cover. Having more available cover, leadership from seniors, and clearer guidelines around the impact of sick leave on registration may contribute to a culture where junior doctors feel supported to access sick leave.","Mitchell, Lucy; Coatsworth, Nicholas",Infect.

The immune system is crucial in defending and eliminating the virus and infected cells. However, immune dysregulation may result in the rapid progression of COVID-19. Here, we evaluated the subsets, phenotypic and functional characteristics of natural killer (NK) and T cells in patients with COVID-19 and their associations with disease severity. Methods: Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients enrolled in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 25 to February 27, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells and T cells subsets in circulating blood and serum levels of cytokines were analyzed via flow cytometry. Then the LASSO logistic regression model was employed to predict risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. Results: The counts and percentages of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NKT cells were significantly reduced in patients with severe symptoms. The cytotoxic CD3-CD56dimCD16+ cell population significantly decreased, while the CD3-CD56dimCD16- part significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients. More importantly, elevated expression of regulatory molecules, such as CD244 and programmed death-1 (PD-1), on NK cells and T cells, as well as decreased serum cytotoxic effector molecules including perforin and granzyme A, were detected in patients with COVID-19. The serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in severe patients. Moreover, the CD3-CD56dimCD16- cells were screened out as an influential factor in severe cases by LASSO logistic regression. Conclusions: The functional exhaustion and other subset alteration of NK and T cells may contribute to the progression and improve the prognosis of COVID-19. Surveillance of lymphocyte subsets may in the future enable early screening for signs of critical illness and understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.","Li, Mingyue; Guo, Weina; Dong, Yalan; Wang, Xiaobei; Dai, Die; Liu, Xingxing; Wu, Yiquan; Li, Mengmeng; Zhang, Wenjing; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Lin, Lan; Kang, Zhenyu; Yu, Ting; Tian, Chunxia; Qin, Renjie; Gui, Yang; Jiang, Feng; Fan, Heng; Heissmeyer, Vigo; Sarapultsev, Alexey; Wang, Lin; Luo, Shanshan; Hu, Desheng",Front Immunol,,409

Often however, effective vaccinations are carried out insufficiently. In March 2020, the German measles protection law was introduced to raise the level of population (herd) immunity to over 95 %. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted among the population on the Measles Protection Act with self-declarations on measles vaccination/illness of participants and their children and evaluation of various sanctions. RESULTS: 1,594 adults participated. 19.3 % were affected by the law. Of these, only 77.5 % were immune to measles, 14.0 % wanted to be fully vaccinated when the law came into force, which would lead to 91.5 % immunity. Assuming that participants with unclear vaccination status or measles disease are immune, an immunity of>95 % can be achieved. 86.4 % of the children (aged 2 to 17 years) had developed immunity. Parents' willingness to have their children vaccinated because of the sanctions provided for in the Measles Protection Act was only 0.8 %. CONCLUSION: The level of immunity to measles in adults and children was under 95 % in our study. The sanctions of the Measles Protection Act are a greater incentive for adults to undergo measles vaccination than for parents. Strategies to increase immunity with the target group of parents should continue to be pursued.","Neugebauer, Michael; Ebert, Matthias; Vogelmann, Roger","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen (Online)",,409

The papers in the special issue both build on existing telepsychotherapy initiatives and offer rapid responses to the early phase of COVID-19. Two papers explore the relative effectiveness of in-person supervision and telesupervision, proposing telesupervision as a feasible alternative; and extending practical considerations to maintain effective clinical care in training settings while implementing telepsychology. Ten papers address technological challenges, with recommendations to create, enhance, and optimally configure telepsychotherapy services for clients across the mental health spectrum from common mental health problems, clinical high risk for psychosis, high risk for suicide, posttraumatic stress disorder, and family intervention. Turning to process, two papers explore psychotherapists' attitudes toward online psychotherapy and their use of technology in practice. Finally, one paper addressed system considerations, describing the development of a virtual partial hospital program for acute psychiatric patients stepping down from inpatient hospitalization. We discuss the key themes emerging from this corpus of work, linking these themes to the current state of evidence regarding the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Crucially, the value of this special issue goes beyond the current crisis, enabling psychotherapists to be better prepared for physical distancing situations that they may face in the future.","Inchausti, Felix; MacBeth, Angus; Hasson-Ohayon, Ilanit; Dimaggio, Giancarlo",J.

Participants who received more COVID-19-related health information online reported more frequent effort to engage in all types of preventive behaviors: wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, P<.001), washing hands (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.35-1.85, P<.001), covering nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.52-2.10, P<.001), keeping social distance with others (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21-1.65, P<.001), staying home (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.20-1.62, P<.001), avoiding using public transportation (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.88, P<.001), and cleaning frequently used surfaces (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, P<.001). Compared with participants who did not have positive cases in their social circles, those who had immediate family members (OR 1.48, 95% CI 8.28-26.44, P<.001) or close friends and relatives (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.58-4.03, P<.001) who tested positive were more likely to get tested. Participants' sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, and employment status were also associated with preventive behaviors and testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that the extent of receiving COVID-19-related information online, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics including sex, ethnicity, age, marital status, and employment status are key factors associated with US residents' engagement in various preventive behaviors and testing for COVID-19.","Li, Siyue; Feng, Bo; Liao, Wang; Pan, Wenjing",J Med Internet Res,,409

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The modified online OSCE comprising of eight question entities was organised simultaneously in all four dental institutes of Finland using the Moodle virtual learning environment. All fourth-year students (n = 179) attended the examination online at home. Student feedback was collected via an anonymous questionnaire with multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions concerning attitudes towards the modified online OSCE, as well as content and usability of the question entities in the examination. Means and standard deviations were calculated for multiple-choice questions. Content analysis was used for open-ended questions. RESULTS: Of 179 students, 119 (66%) consented to the study. Students experienced they had received adequate information (mean 3.8; SD 1.2), had a positive attitude before the examination (4.0; 1.0) and found the practice test useful (3.7; 1.1) (range 1-5). Technical implementation (2.7; 0.7) and the difficulty of the questions (2.9; 0.6) (range 1-4) were found to be good. The teaching students received during their studies was sufficient (3.2; 0.5) (range 1-4). Content (mean 3.2; 0.4) and usability (2.9; 0.4) of the question entities were good (range 1-4). The themes arising from open-ended questions were importance and practicality of the topic (in questions) in relation to the work of a dentist and gratitude for the rapid conversion of the OSCE into an online examination despite COVID-19. The themes arising from negative experiences included difficulties in completing the examination within the time allocated, and dissatisfaction with the model answers provided after the examination. CONCLUSION: The positive student feedback towards the modified online OSCE encourages including an online examination to complement the traditional OSCE.","Hytönen, Hanna; Näpänkangas, Ritva; Karaharju-Suvanto, Terhi; Eväsoja, Taina; Kallio, Anu; Kokkari, Anne; Tuononen, Tiina; Lahti, Satu",Eur. j. dent. educ,,409

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study METHODS: Among 32,814 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 2020 and December 2020 in our center, eleven microbiologically confirmed ROM co-infection cases in severe COVID-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: There were nine men and two women with a mean age of 73.1 ± 7.7 years. Eight patients had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes with a mean diagnosis duration of 12.1 ± 4.4 years. All patients had COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and received corticosteroids. The mean time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and ROM diagnosis was 14.4 ± 4.3 days. Seven patients (63.6%) had orbital apex syndrome, and four patients (36.4%) presented with orbital cellulitis. Endophthalmitis was detected in 54.5% of patients, and two of these patients developed retinoschisis. CT scan/MRI revealed sino-orbital involvement in all patients, and three of these had cerebral involvement at initial presentation. All patients received intravenous and retrobulbar liposomal amphotericin B and had undergone radical debridement of involved sinuses. Intravitreal liposomal amphotericin B injected in patients with endophthalmitis. Despite all measures, 63.6% of patients expired. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 is associated with a significant incidence of ROM with higher mortality rates due to immune dysregulation and the widespread use of steroids. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of this infection in patients with COVID-19. An aggressive multidisciplinary approach can help to reduce mortality.","Bayram, Nurettin; Ozsaygili, Cemal; Sav, Hafize; Tekin, Yucel; Gundogan, Medine; Pangal, Emine; Cicek, Ayse; Özcan, Ibrahim",Jpn J Ophthalmol,,409
221533,Experience of remote cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic: the V-LAP™ device in advanced heart failure,2020,"In this paper, we employ a combination of time regression discontinuity design method (T-RD) and the difference-in-difference method (DID) to identify and quantify the causal effects of the strict lockdown policy on vegetable prices using multiple-year daily price data from 151 wholesale markets of Chinese cabbage. We find that the lockdown policy caused a large and immediate surge in price and price dispersion of Chinese cabbage, though they fluctuated smoothly for the same period in normal years. The DID results further show that the price surge peaked in the fourth week of lockdown but gradually came down to the level of a normal year by week 11. However, the price rose again (though to a much smaller extent) in response to the resurgence of COVID-19 in a few provinces in early-mid April but quickly returned to the normal level in week 15 when the lockdown measures were largely removed. We also find that the supply chain disruption is the driving factor for the price hike.

The in silico prediction of pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of hundred one 1,2,3-triazole-phtalimide derivatives, obtained from SciFinder® library, were investigated. Compounds that did not show good gastrointestinal absorption, violated the Lipinski's rules, proved to be positive for the AMES test, and showed to be hepatotoxic or immunotoxic in our ADMET analysis, were filtered out of our study. The hit compounds were further subjected to molecular docking on SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The ADMET analysis revealed that 43 derivatives violated the Lipinski's rules and 51 other compounds showed to be positive for the toxicity test. Seven 1,2,3-triazole-phthalimide derivatives (A7, A8, B05, E35, E38, E39, and E40) were selected for molecular docking and MFCC-ab initio analysis. The results of molecular docking pointed the derivative E40 as a promising compound interacting with multiple target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The complex E40-Mpro was found to have minimum binding energy of -10.26 kcal/mol and a general energy balance, calculated by the quantum mechanical analysis, of -8.63 eV. MD simulation and MMGBSA calculations confirmed that the derivatives E38 and E40 have high binding energies of -63.47 ± 3 and -63.31 ± 7 kcal/mol against SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In addition, the derivative E40 exhibited excellent interaction values and inhibitory potential against SAR-Cov-2 main protease and viral nucleocapsid proteins, suggesting this derivative as a potent antiviral for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of COVID-19.

METHODS: In the present single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we reported findings from 87 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory syndrome hospitalized in an intermediate Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU), subdividing the patients in two groups according to the admission date (before and after March 29, 2020). RESULTS: With improved skills in the clinical management of COVID-19, we observed a significant lower mortality in the T2 group compared with the T1 group and a significantly difference in terms of mortality among the patients transferred in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from our intermediate RICU (100% in T1 group vs. 33.3% in T2 group). The average length of stay in intermediate RICU of ICU-transferred patients who survived in T1 and T2 was significantly longer than those who died (who died 3.3 ± 2.8 days vs. who survived 6.4 ± 3.3 days).

Early in Feb, 2020, we suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may possess neuroinvasive potential similar to that of many other coronaviruses. Since then, a variety of neurological manifestations have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was supported in some patients with neuroimaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid tests. To date, at least 27 autopsy studies on the brains of COVID-19 patients can be retrieved through PubMed/MEDLINE, among which neuropathological alterations were observed in the brainstem in 78 of 134 examined patients, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and viral proteins were detected in the brainstem in 16/49 (32.7%) and 18/71 (25.3%) cases, respectively. To shed some light on the peculiar respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 patients, this review assessed the existing evidence about the neurogenic mechanism underlying the respiratory failure induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acknowledging the neurological involvement has important guiding significance for the prevention, treatment, and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tan, Bai-Hong; Liu, Jia-Mei; Gui, Yue; Wu, Shuang; Suo, Jia-Le; Li, Yan-Chao",Aging (Albany NY),,409

Pathogenesis of viral infection, co-morbidities, medical treatments, and psychosocial factors may contribute to COVID-19 related neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae. This systematic review aims to synthesize available literature on psychiatric and cognitive characteristics of community-dwelling survivors of COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty-three studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria for review. Emerging findings link COVID-19 to cognitive deficits, particularly attention, executive function, and memory. Psychiatric symptoms occur at high rates in COVID-19 survivors, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disruption, and to a lesser extent posttraumatic stress. Symptoms appear to endure, and severity of acute illness is not directly predictive of severity of cognitive or mental health issues. The course of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae is limited by lack of longitudinal data at this time. Although heterogeneity of study design and sociocultural differences limit definitive conclusions, emerging risk factors for psychiatric symptoms include female sex, perceived stigma related to COVID-19, infection of a family member, social isolation, and prior psychiatry history. SUMMARY: The extant literature elucidates treatment targets for cognitive and psychosocial interventions. Research using longitudinal, prospective study designs is needed to characterize cognitive and psychiatric functioning of COVID-19 survivors over the course of illness and across illness severity. Emphasis on delineating the unique contributions of premorbid functioning, viral infection, co-morbidities, treatments, and psychosocial factors to cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is warranted.","Vanderlind, William Michael; Rabinovitz, Beth B; Miao, Iris Yi; Oberlin, Lauren E; Bueno-Castellano, Christina; Fridman, Chaya; Jaywant, Abhishek; Kanellopoulos, Dora",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,409

This study investigated the effect of the pandemic on feeding choices and maternal wellbeing amongst breastfeeding mothers living in Australian and New Zealand. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that examined feeding methods, maternal mental wellbeing, worries, challenges, and positive experiences during the pandemic. Most women were exclusively breastfeeding (82%). Partial breastfeeding was associated with perceived low milk supply and longer pregnancy duration during the pandemic. Reduced mental health and wellbeing was associated with lower levels of family functioning, increased perceived stress, and perinatal anxiety. Longer pregnancy duration during the pandemic was associated with lower mental health wellbeing scores, while higher perceived stress scores were reported for regions with higher COVID-19 infection rates and women with perceived low milk supply. Women reported that the pandemic resulted in less pressure and more time for family bonding, while worries about the pandemic, family health, and parenting challenges were also cited. Mental health concerns of breastfeeding women appear to be exacerbated by COVID-19, highlighting a critical need for access to mental health and broader family support during the pandemic.","Sakalidis, Vanessa S; Rea, Alethea; Perrella, Sharon L; McEachran, Jacki; Collis, Grace; Miraudo, Jennifer; Prosser, Stuart A; Gibson, Lisa Y; Silva, Desiree; Geddes, Donna T",Nutrients,,409

Here, we apply natural language processing techniques to characterize social media users who began to post anti-Asian hate messages during COVID-19. We compare two user groups -- those who posted anti-Asian slurs and those who did not -- with respect to a rich set of features measured with data prior to COVID-19 and show that it is possible to predict who later publicly posted anti-Asian slurs. Our analysis of predictive features underlines the potential impact of news media and information sources that report on online hate and calls for further investigation into the role of polarized communication networks and news media.","An, Jisun; Kwak, Haewoon; Lee, Claire Seungeun; Jun, Bogang; Ahn, Yong-Yeol",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07296v1.pdf,409

In the current study, we used the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to assess the response to fear within health staff in Mexico. This was a cross-sectional survey study in which we administered the Spanish version of the FCV-19S to hospital staff. The FCV-19S is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of fear caused by COVID-19. A total of 2860 participants-1641 female and 1218 male personnel from three hospitals-were included in the study. The internal reliability of the scale was good, with Cronbach's alpha of .902. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the seven items of the FCV-19S, showing good model fit (&#967; 2 (7) = 29.40, p < .001; CFI = .99; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .03; SRMR = .010; AIC = 71.40). We found a global FCV-19S mean score of 19.3 ± 6.9, with a significant difference in scores between women and men. Our survey shows a significantly higher level of fear in nursing and administrative personnel, which may be explained by the nursing staff being in close contact with infected patients and the administrative staff lacking understanding of the possible implications of the infection, compared with nonclinical hospital personnel. Our results are consistent with those of other researchers. We must remember that fear is a reaction and that we must be courageous enough to trust validated infection prevention practices to provide the highest standard of care, in the safest environment that we can, for as long as we can.","García-Reyna, Benjamín; Castillo-García, Gilberto Daniel; Barbosa-Camacho, Francisco José; Cervantes-Cardona, Guillermo Alonso; Cervantes-Pérez, Enrique; Torres-Mendoza, Blanca Miriam; Fuentes-Orozco, Clotilde; Pintor-Belmontes, Kevin Josue; Guzmán-Ramírez, Bertha Georgina; Hernández-Bernal, Aldo; González-Ojeda, Alejandro; Cervantes-Guevara, Gabino",Int J Ment Health Addict,,409

Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients who tested positive for COVID-19 with PCR via nasopharyngeal swabs. Conjunctival swabs were collected for each patient and subjected to RT-PCR assay. Demographic data and clinical history of patients were investigated and analysed. Results: In this study, 4.9% of the patients tested positive with conjunctival swabs for COVID-19;29.9%, 28.7%, 20.1%, and 12.2% of the patients had fever, shortness of breath, cough, and red eye, respectively. Among all patients, 18.9% and 73.2% had a history of traveling and contact with positive COVID-19 cases, respectively. There were significant correlations between the conjunctival results and diabetes (P=0.049) and hypertension (P=0.002). Traveling was a risk factor for positive conjunctival swab testing (P=0.016). The sensitivity of the conjunctival swab was 4.8%. Conclusion: Among all positive cases of COVID-19, a small percentage had positive results when tested using a conjunctival swab. Conjunctival swabs have very low sensitivity for the detection of COVID-19. However, tears could still be a mode of disease transmission, especially from patients to eye care specialists.","Hadrawi, Manal Malak Mohammad Almahmoudi Faeeqah Mogharbel Ahmed Rozy Omar Hanafi Somaya Ali Batool Sanaa Nabeel Faqieha Fatimah Alzahrani khaled",Clinical Ophthalmology,,409

This infection spreads mainly through direct contact with Flügge micro droplets or core droplets that remain suspended as aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that infected subjects, both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19, can transmit the virus. Since the infection typically enters through mouth, nose, and eyes, dentistry is one of the medical practices at highest risk of infection due to the frequent production of aerosol and the constant presence of saliva. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that only emergency/urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak. Considering the virus' route of transmission, a specific protocol should be applied to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment (cross-infection). This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices. This paper aims to discuss and suggest the most appropriate procedures in every aspect of dental practice to reduce infection risk.","Lo Giudice, Roberto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,409

In the clinic, most patients with COVID-19 show none or mild symptoms, while approximately 20% of them develop severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or septic shock due to infection-induced cytokine release syndrome (the so-called ""cytokine storm""). Neutralizing antibodies targeting inflammatory cytokines may potentially curb immunopathology caused by COVID-19; however, the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets make attenuating the cytokine storm challenging. Nonspecific in vivo biodistribution and dose-limiting side effects further limit the broad application of those free antibodies. Recent advances in biomaterials and nanotechnology have offered many promising opportunities for infectious and inflammatory diseases. Here, potential mechanisms of COVID-19 cytokine storm are first discussed, and relevant therapeutic strategies and ongoing clinical trials are then reviewed. Furthermore, recent research involving emerging biomaterials for improving antibody-based and broad-spectrum cytokine neutralization is summarized. It is anticipated that this work will provide insights on the development of novel therapeutics toward efficacious management of COVID-19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases.","Meng, Qian-Fang; Tian, Rui; Long, Haiyi; Wu, Xianjia; Lai, Jialin; Zharkova, Olga; Wang, Jiong-Wei; Chen, Xiaoyuan; Rao, Lang",Adv Mater,,409

Furthermore, unemployment benefits have been made more generous in many countries. While it is still too early to assess the relative success of national strategies to cope with the pandemic and to revitalise the labour market as well as to evaluate the medium-term fiscal viability of different support measures, a few policy directions become apparent.

Several pharmacists working in the Pharmacy and Medical Devices Department of the Madrid Regional Health Service were called to manage the Pharmacy Department of the abovementioned hospital. Required permissions to set up a PD were here authorized urgently. Tackling human and material resources, and computer systems for drug purchase and electronic prescription, were some of the initial issues that hindered the pharmaceutical provision required for patients from the very day one. Once the purchase was assured, mainly by direct purchase from suppliers, drug dispensing up to 1,250 hospitalized patients (25 nursing units) and 8 ICU patients was taken on. Dispensing was carried out through either drug stocks in the nursing units or individual patient dispensing for certain drugs. Moreover, safety issues related to prescription were considered, and as the electronic prescription was implemented we attained 100% prescriptions review and validation. The constitution of a multidisciplinary Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee let agree to a pharmacotherapy guide, pres cription protocols, therapeutic equivalences, interactions, and drug dispensing circuits. The Pharmacy Department strategy was to ensure a very quick response to basic tasks keeping the aim to offer a pharmaceutical care of the highest quality whenever possible. Working under a health emergency situation, with many uncertainties and continuous pressure was a plight. However, the spirit of collaboration in and out of the Pharmacy Department was aligned with the whole hospital motivation to offer the highest quality of healthcare. These were possibly the keys to allow caring for almost 4,000 patients during the 42 days that the hospital lasted.","Aranguren-Oyarzábal, Ainhoa; Segura-Bedmar, María; Calvo-Alcántara, María José",Farm Hosp,,409

The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in sub-groups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias. RESULTS: From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. Three specimen types captured lower % positives [NS (82%, 95% CI: 73-90%), OP (84%, 95% CI: 57-100%), saliva (88%, 95% CI: 81 - 93%)] than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (97%, 95% CI: 90-100%). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield. CONCLUSIONS: NP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric vs. adult, late vs. early in disease course) and head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed.","Lee, Rose A; Herigon, Joshua C; Benedetti, Andrea; Pollock, Nira R; Denkinger, Claudia M",J. clin. microbiol,,409

We aim to present the pathophysiology of COVID-19, emphasizing the major cellular and clinical manifestations from a cardiological perspective. As a roaming viral particle or more likely via the Trojan horse route, SARS-CoV-2 can access different parts of the body. Cardiovascular features of COVID-19 can count myocardial injuries, vasculitis-like syndromes, and atherothrombotic manifestations. Deviations in the normal electrocardiogram pattern could hide pericardial effusion or cardiac inflammation, and dispersed microthrombi can cause ischemic damages, stroke, or even medullary reflex dysfunctions.

It is unclear if chemotherapy could accentuate the overall risk in these patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis linking COVID-19 data and oncological information systems to compare lethality in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy before COVID-19. We considered patients who received chemotherapy in the last 30 days as in ""active treatment"", and patients who did not receive drugs in this period as ""non-active treatment"" for propensity-score pair matching. We also tested the influence of baseline variables in our results in a multivariate model. RESULTS: 66.1% (162/246) of patients in matched active chemotherapy died vs. 70.2% (172/246) in the matched non-active chemotherapy group. The risk of death was positively associated with palliative intent of treatment and hematologic neoplasms. Being in active chemotherapy was not associated with increased mortality compared to non-active treatment. We also noted in exploratory propensity-score matchings that the use of alkylating agents (odds ratio [OR] 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.70) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14-0.56) were protective factors.

To monitor the progress towards such an ambitious target, reliable, up-to-date and fine-grained measurements of socioeconomic indicators are necessary. When it comes to socioeconomic development, novel digital traces can provide a complementary data source to overcome the limits of traditional data collection methods, which are often not regularly updated and lack adequate spatial resolution. In this study, we collect publicly available and anonymous advertising audience estimates from Facebook to predict socioeconomic conditions of urban residents, at a fine spatial granularity, in four large urban areas: Atlanta (USA), Bogot\'a (Colombia), Santiago (Chile), and Casablanca (Morocco). We find that behavioral attributes inferred from the Facebook marketing platform can accurately map the socioeconomic status of residential areas within cities, and that predictive performance is comparable in both high and low-resource settings. We also show that training a model on attributes of adult Facebook users, aged more than 25, leads to a more accurate mapping of socioeconomic conditions in all cities.

Methods: The T21RS COVID-19 Initiative launched an international survey for clinicians or caregivers on patients with COVID-19 and DS. Data collected between April and October 2020 (N=1046) were analysed and compared with the UK ISARIC4C survey of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without DS. Findings: The mean age of COVID-19 patients with DS in the T21RS survey was 29 years (SD = 18). Similar to the general population, the most frequent signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Joint/muscle pain and vomiting or nausea were less frequent (p < 0.01), whereas altered consciousness/confusion were more frequent (p < 0.01). Risk factors for hospitalization and mortality were similar to the general population with the addition of congenital heart defects as a risk factor for hospitalization. Mortality rates showed a rapid increase from age 40 and were higher in patients with DS (T21RS DS versus non-DS patients: risk ratio (RR) = 3.5 (95%-CI=2.6;4.4), ISARIC4C DS versus non-DS patients: RR = 2.9 (95%-CI=2.1;3.8)) even after adjusting for known risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation: Leading signs/symptoms of COVID-19 and risk factors for severe disease course are similar to the general population. However, individuals with DS present significantly higher rates of medical complications and mortality, especially from age 40.

The patient experienced reductions in serum bile acids and improvement in itching and sleep scores, and odevixibat was well tolerated. After the odevixibat study, symptoms returned and the patient underwent partial external biliary diversion (PEBD). Odevixibat treatment and PEBD produced similar normalisation of serum bile acid levels and improvements in pruritus and sleep disruptions. Thus, odevixibat appeared to be as effective as invasive PEBD in treating serum bile acids and cholestatic pruritus in this patient.","Slavetinsky, Christoph; Sturm, Ekkehard",BMJ case reports,,409

By contrast, although the bootstrap t test was proposed in 1993, it is seldom adopted in medical research. We aim to demonstrate that the bootstrap t test outperforms Student's t test under normality in data. Using random data samples from normal distributions, we evaluated the testing performance, in terms of true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate and diagnostic abilities, in terms of the area under the curve (AUC), of the bootstrap t test and Student's t test. We explore the AUC of both tests with varying sample size and coefficient of variation. We compare the testing outcomes using the COVID-19 serial interval (SI) data in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, China, for demonstration. With fixed TPR, the bootstrap t test maintained the equivalent accuracy in TPR, but significantly improved the true-negative rate from the Student's t test. With varying TPR, the diagnostic ability of bootstrap t test outperformed or equivalently performed as Student's t test in terms of the AUC. The equivalent performances are possible but rarely occur in practice. We find that the bootstrap t test outperforms by successfully detecting the difference in COVID-19 SI, which is defined as the time interval between consecutive transmission generations, due to sex and non-pharmaceutical interventions against the Student's t test. We demonstrated that the bootstrap t test outperforms Student's t test, and it is recommended to replace Student's t test in medical data analysis regardless of sample size.","Zhao, Shi; Yang, Zuyao; Musa, Salihu S; Ran, Jinjun; Chong, Marc K C; Javanbakht, Mohammad; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H",Epidemiol Infect,,409
258480,Correction: Electrotherapy and electrophysiology procedures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: an opinion of the Heart Rhythm Section of the Polish Cardiac Society (with an update),2021,"An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rtwas assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt= 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rtwas assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt= 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt= 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rtto an ideal level and control the infection.","Wang, Huwen; Wang, Zezhou; Dong, Yinqiao; Chang, Ruijie; Xu, Chen; Yu, Xiaoyue; Zhang, Shuxian; Tsamlag, Lhakpa; Shang, Meili; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Ying; Xu, Gang; Shen, Tian; Zhang, Xinxin; Cai, Yong",Cell Discov.,,409

METHODS: After NAFLD screening in an outpatient Infectious Diseases Clinic, NAFLD patients were randomly allocated to general dietary recommendations (SC group) or to a structured dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean diet (intervention group). During lockdown, follow-up consultations in the intervention group were done by video and/or phone. After 3 months of lockdown, all patients (intervention and SC group) consented to a telephone interview which aimed to characterize eating habits and lifestyle changes and evaluate stress and depression. Biochemical data when available, was compared between the peri-period of confinement. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients were screened. From the 55 NAFDL identified, 27 were allocated to dietary intervention and 28 to SC and were followed before lockdown for a mean period of 5.0 ± 1.5 months in which SC group gained a median of 0.65 kg vs. a median loss of 1.5 kg in the intervention group (p < 0.001). During lockdown, 93.3% of patients in the SC group referred that ""diet got worse"" vs. 6.7% in the intervention group p < 0.01), and 35.3% vs. 15.7% (p = 0.014) reported increase in appetite, respectively. Both groups gained weight, SC group vs. 0.7 ± 1.7 kg in the intervention group, p < 0.001). Higher weight gain was associated with changes in the dietary pattern (3.8 ± 2.1 kg vs. 2.0 ± 1.3 kg in ""no change in dietary pattern""; p = 0.002). Glucose blood levels increased after lockdown in the SC group, with a mean increase of 15 mg/dl (p = 0.023). The remaining metabolic parameters remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: The maintenance of dietary intervention, using telemedicine, can mitigate the adverse change in dietary habits and physical activity pattern, preventing a substantial increase in body weight.","Policarpo, Sara; Machado, Mariana V; Cortez-Pinto, Helena",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,409

The reopening of schools underlines the importance of understanding the epidemiology of pediatric COVID-19 infections. We sought to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pediatric COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from healthcare organizations in the United States. The study outcomes (hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, critical care) were assessed using logistic regression. The subgroups of sex and race were compared after propensity score matching. Among 12,306 children with lab-confirmed COVID-19, 16.5% presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), 13.9% had gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), 8.1% had dermatological symptoms (rash), 4.8% had neurological (headache), and 18.8% had other non-specific symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia and disturbances of smell or taste). In the study cohort, the hospitalization frequency was 5.3%, with 17.6% needing critical care services and 4.1% requiring mechanical ventilation. Following propensity score matching, the risk of all outcomes was similar between males and females. Following propensity score matching, the risk of hospitalization was greater in non-Hispanic Black (RR 1.97 [95% CI 1.49-2.61]) and Hispanic children (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.03-1.78]) compared with non-Hispanic Whites.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive quantitative study, conducted through the application of a 52-item questionnaire with four sections (feelings, perceived stress, stress-reducing factors, and adaptation strategies). The study population was 227 nursing professionals from ""Hospital General del Guasmo Sur"" of the Ministry of Public Health, who worked during the peak of the pandemic from March to May 2020. The sample comprised 155 nurses who voluntarily accepted to participate. The study received 127 complete questionnaires for analysis. RESULTS: The data showed the priority of humanist feelings and professional duty for these nurses, mostly young (59% under 35 years of age and with the professional exercise of three and fewer years), against the fear of contagion and the stress of strenuous work. They also revealed the great importance for them of the institutional support, recognition to the staff, and strict organization of safe care, like strategies for coping with this difficult experience.

263132,Social media in times of crisis: Learning from Hurricane Harvey for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic response,2020,"The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 facilitates the entry of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, into host cells by cleaving the S1/S2 interface of the viral spike protein. Based on structural data derived from X-ray crystallographic data of related trypsin-like proteases, a homology model of TMPRSS2 is described and validated using the broad spectrum COVID-19 drug candidate camostat as a probe. Both active site recognition and catalytic function are examined using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamic (QM/MM MD) simulations of camostat and its active metabolite, 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate (GBPA). Substrate binding is shown to be primarily stabilized through salt bridge formation between the shared guanidino pharmacophore and D435 in pocket A (flanking the catalytic S441). Based on the binding mode of GBPA, residues K342 and W461 have been identified as potential contacts involved in TMPRSS2 selective binding and activity. Additional data is reported that indicates the transition state structure is stabilized through H-bonding interactions with the backbone N-H groups within an oxyanion hole following bottom-side attack of the carbonyl by S441. This is supported by prior work on related serine proteases suggesting further strategies to exploit in the design of more potent inhibitors. Taken overall, the proposed structure along with the key contact sites and mechanistic features identified should prove highly advantageous to the design and rational development of safe and effective therapeutics that target TMPRSS2 and avoid inhibition of other trypsin-dependent processes.","Escalante, Diego E; Ferguson, David M",Med Chem Res,,409

These scenarios were implemented and tested using EpiGraph, an epidemic simulator which has been extended to simulate COVID-19 propagation. EpiGraph implements a social interaction model, which realistically captures a large number of characteristics of individuals and groups, as well as their individual interconnections, which are extracted from connection patterns in social networks. Besides the epidemiological and social interaction components, it also models people's short and long-distance movements as part of a transportation model. These features, together with the capacity to simulate scenarios with millions of individuals and apply different contention and mitigation measures, gives EpiGraph the potential to reproduce the COVID-19 evolution and study medium-term effects of the virus when applying mitigation methods. EpiGraph, obtains closely aligned infected and death curves related to the first wave in the Madrid metropolitan area, achieving similar seroprevalence values. We also show that selective lockdown for people over 60 would reduce the number of deaths. In addition, evaluate the effect of the use of face masks after the first wave, which shows that the percentage of people that comply with mask use is a crucial factor for mitigating the infection's spread.","Singh, David E; Marinescu, Maria-Cristina; Guzmán-Merino, Miguel; Durán, Christian; Delgado-Sanz, Concepción; Gomez-Barroso, Diana; Carretero, Jesus",Front Public Health,,409

Recently, it has been recognised that COVID-19 may present in multi-systemic ways which can cause diagnostic uncertainty or error.We present a patient who attended hospital with features of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) before developing clinical and radiological findings of COVID-19. While the authors recognise that neurological complications have been reported following COVID-19 infection, to their knowledge this report describes a unique presentation of GBS without preceding COVID-19 symptoms.Since these conditions may have considerable overlapping features including respiratory failure and (following prolonged critical care admission) profound weakness, it is possible that one diagnosis may be overlooked. Raising awareness of a possible association between these conditions is important so both are considered allowing appropriate investigations to be arranged to optimise the chance of neurological recovery and survival, while also protecting staff from potentially unrecognised COVID-19.","Gale, Aislinn; Sabaretnam, Suganya; Lewinsohn, Asher",BMJ case reports,,409

METHOD: Front-line nurses from a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China, participated. Participants completed the Chinese versions of the General Information Questionnaire, the Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale, the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, and the General Self-Efficacy Scale. RESULTS: A total of 149 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The median total hospice care attitudes score was median 102.00(interquartile range, 95.5-120.50). The nurses' attitudes toward hospice care were significantly associated with their age, knowledge of hospice care, level of empathy, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The attitudes of front-line nurses toward hospice care need to be improved. Hospital departments should establish an effective public health emergency strategy, provide training to increase front-line nurses' knowledge and practical experience of hospice care, cultivate nurses' empathy, and enhance their sense of self-efficacy, in order to improve the quality of hospice care for patients and their families.","Liu, Qinghua; Tao, Jing; Gao, Lianlian; He, Xifei; Wang, Yuping; Xia, Wenlin; Huang, Lihong",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,409

The peptides bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) resulting in elevated cAMP and/or phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover. In contrast, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or neuregulin (NRG)-1 bind to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the EGFR or HER3, increasing tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in the phosphorylation of protein substrates such as PI3K or phospholipase (PL)C. Peptide GPCRs can transactivate numerous RTKs, especially members of the EGFR/HER family resulting in increased phosphorylation of ERK, leading to cellular proliferation or increased phosphorylation of AKT, leading to cellular survival. GRCR antagonists and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are useful agents to prevent RTK transactivation and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells.","Moody, Terry W; Ramos-Alvarez, Irene; Jensen, Robert T",Peptides,,409

We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.","Hart, Olga E; Halden, Rolf U",Sci Total Environ,,409

METHODS: Participants were male professional football players from the two highest German leagues and the officials working closely with them. Our report covers nine match days spread over 9 weeks (May to July 2020). Daily symptom monitoring, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA twice weekly, and antibody tests (on two occasions-early during the phase in May 2020 and in the week of the last match) were conducted. Target variables were: (1) onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms, (2) positive PCR results, and (3) IgG seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. All detected seroconversions were controlled by neutralisation tests. FINDINGS: Suspicious symptoms were reported for one player; an immediate additional PCR test as well as all subsequent diagnostic and antibody tests proved negative for coronavirus. Of 1702 regularly tested individuals (1079 players, 623 officials members), 8 players and 4 officials tested positive during one of the first rounds of PCR testing prior to the onset of team training, 2 players during the third round. No further positive results occurred during the remainder of the season. 694 players and 291 officials provided two serum samples for antibody testing. Nine players converted from negative/borderline to positive (without symptoms); two players who initially tested positive tested negative at the end of the season. 22 players remained seropositive throughout the season. None of the seroconversions was confirmed in the neutralisation test. CONCLUSION: Professional football training and matches can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires strict hygiene measures including regular PCR testing.","Meyer, Tim; Mack, Dietrich; Donde, Katrin; Harzer, Oliver; Krutsch, Werner; Rössler, Annika; Kimpel, Janine; von Laer, Dorothee; Gärtner, Barbara C",Br. j. sports med,,409

DESIGN AND METHODS: Five hundred and eighteen people with cancer with data extracted from two waves (2017-19 and April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK dataset participated. FINDINGS: An increased risk of depression was observed for cancer of the breast, prostate, blood, but not other cancers (e.g., lung, melanoma). After controlling for prior depression and other factors, it was loneliness during COVID-19, and not previous loneliness, that was predictive. Those currently lonely had a 4.5-fold increased risk of depression. These findings demonstrate that people living with cancer are at increased risk of developing depression during COVID-19, and that feelings of isolation help explain this risk.

CQ and HCQ are antimalarial drugs with disease-modifying activity in rheumatic diseases (DMARD) and now are among the most widely used DMARDs. Although they are rare, severe adverse effects caused mainly by deposition of intracellular metabolites in both cardiac and skeletal muscle have been described. Currently, both CQ and HCQ have been proposed to have efficacy for patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and several large centers in the United States and other countries have started clinical trials. METHODS: A case of HCQ cardiotoxicity diagnosed on an endomyocardial biopsy is presented. A review of the pathology archives was performed to identify additional cases of CQ or HCQ myopathy, and histologic changes were recorded. A brief literature review with an emphasis on pathologic findings in myopathies was performed. RESULTS: Including the index case, 4 cases of CQ or HCQ myopathy were identified. Light microscopic findings included vacuolated myopathy, and electron microscopic findings included myeloid bodies and curvilinear inclusion bodies. CONCLUSION: CQ and HCQ myopathy can present following long-term administration of the drug. The pathologic findings are nonspecific and overlap with other vacuolated myopathies, necessitating careful correlation of the histologic changes with the patient's medical history.","Nadeem, Urooba; Raafey, Muhammad; Kim, Gene; Treger, Jerermy; Pytel, Peter; N Husain, Aliya; Schulte, Jefree J",Am. j. clin. pathol,,409

Saudi Arabia recognized the danger early and implemented a series of urgent precautions. Thus, this study aims to evaluate public trust and compliance with the precautionary measures implemented by authorities to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of the Saudi public using an electronic questionnaire during the COVID-19 outbreak. The data, which were collected using a validated public trust and compliance tool, were analyzed using the chi-square test, t test, and binary logistic regression. Findings: Of the 1232 participants, there were 655 (53.2%) males and 577 (46.8%) females with 34 ± 10 years as the mean and standard deviation of their age. Participants demonstrated a high level of trust and agreement (98.2%) with the implemented precautionary measures. A positive association between participants’ age and their level of agreement with the government actions (r=˗.082, P=0.004) was observed, with a significant difference between males (97.1±6.2) and females (98.0±4.7) (t=˗2.7, P=0.006).

The resulting 3D models are based on a few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge available about the biological entity, represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new visual-programming technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we determine the statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, the spatial properties, and the distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in the construction of the 3D model. Once all the imaging evidence is incorporated into the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining the rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, and their distances and orientations relative to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization as a visual-programming feedback loop. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virion ultrastructure.

Methods: We conducted molecular docking and structural dynamics studies with a set of 65 Tea bioactive compounds to illustrate their ability to inhibit NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, post-simulations end state thermodynamic free energy calculations were estimated to strengthen our results. Results and Conclusion: Six bioactive tea molecules showed better docking scores than the standard molecule sinefungin. These results were further validated by MD simulations, where Theaflavin compound demonstrated lower binding free energy in comparison to the standard molecule sinefungin.

A total of 2039 respondents representing all healthcare providers (59.8%) as well as other professionals filled in the sociodemographic section, the General Health Questionnaire-28 and the author's questionnaire with questions related to exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the availability of protective measures, quarantine, change of working hours and place of employment during the pandemic, as well as feelings associated with the state of the pandemic. RESULTS: Medical professionals more often presented with relevant psychopathological symptoms (GHQ-28 (General Health Questionnaire-28) total score >24) than the non-medical group (60.8% vs. 48.0%, respectively) such as anxiety, insomnia and somatic symptoms even after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Male sex, older age and appropriate protective equipment were associated with significantly lower GHQ-28 total scores in medical professionals, whereas among non-medical professionals, male sex was associated with significantly lower GHQ-28 total scores. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and anxiety symptoms as well as insomnia are more prevalent among medical staff than workers in other professions. Targeting the determinants of these differences should be included in interventions aimed at restoring psychological well-being in this specific population. Apparently, there are present gender differences in psychological responses that are independent of profession.","Maciaszek, Julian; Ciulkowicz, Marta; Misiak, Blazej; Szczesniak, Dorota; Luc, Dorota; Wieczorek, Tomasz; Fila-Witecka, Karolina; Gawlowski, Pawel; Rymaszewska, Joanna",,,409

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the use of a telehealth platform for the follow-up of transplanted patients during the first 2 weeks from discharge. METHODS: 21 patients who received autologous or allogeneic HCT for hematological malignancies were screened from the 30th April 2020 to 15th July 2020. The telehealth platform consisted in the daily collection of vital signs and physical or psychological symptoms for 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Required medical devices (oximeter, blood pressure monitor)were given to patients and a dedicated smartphone application was developed to collect this data. Daily medical revision of the data was performed form a hematologist specialized in HCT through a web-based software. RESULTS: Only 12 out of 21 patients were able to enter or complete the study. Technological barriers were the most frequent limiting factor of the study. In the 12 patients who completed the study, adherence in reporting data was high. Patients' experience in using such a system was considered generally good. In 2 cases, the system allowed the early recognition of acute complications. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that application of telehealth systems can be applied in the early post-transplant setting with evident advantage for the physicians and patients in terms of both medical and psychological perspectives. Technological issues still represent a problem in the applicability of such a system, especially for elderly patients. Easier to use technologies could help in the future in expanding the use of telehealth systems in this setting.

This two-wave longitudinal study performed in Italy aimed to explore people’s perceptions of changes in healthy and unhealthy food consumption before and during the first lockdown and the possible persistence of such changes after its official end, as a function of the number of people cohabiting, negative emotion activation, and individual eating styles. A total of 728 Italian adults completed self-reported food consumption measures and related psychological variables at both time points. In the lockdown period, participants reported an increase in healthy food consumption and involvement in cooking and a decrease in the consumption of junk food. This general pattern was stronger for both young and restrained eaters. The intensity of negative emotions and the number of cohabitants were not associated with the examined behaviour. In the post-lockdown period, the new consumption pattern acquired during the confinement was partially discontinued: participants cut down their healthy food consumption as well as their involvement in food preparation, but they continued to reduce their junk food intake. These results suggest that people’s food consumption patterns can easily improve when the situation is favourable (e.g., more time and opportunities for cooking healthy meals) and offer an interesting theoretical contribution to understanding the factors useful in promoting healthy eating, in the event of a future outbreak.","Caso, Daniela Guidetti Margherita Capasso Miriam Cavazza Nicoletta",Food Quality and Preference,,409

These changes can lead to complications if compounded by external stress and anxiety. COVID-19 has emerged as a chief stressor among the general population and is a serious threat among vulnerable populations. Therefore, there is a need for stress management tools, such as Yoga and physical exercises, both at home and at work. These can be adopted during the pandemic with proper maintenance of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compile literature that has reported the health outcomes of Yoga intervention on pregnancy at the workplace and analyzes both the restrictions as well as advantages of its beneficial effects in comparison to physical exercises. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature review was conducted utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar. The keywords used for the search include ""Yoga"", ""work"", ""complications"", ""physical exercise"", ""drugs"" and ""COVID"" indifferent permutations and combinations with ""pregnancy"". We compiled the literature with respect to pregnancy complications and the effects of drugs, physical activity and Yoga for preventing these complications. RESULTS: We noted that pregnancy-related complications are becoming more prevalent because of a sedentary lifestyle, restricted physical activity and growing stress. In such situations, a home or workplace Yoga protocol can combine both exercise and mindfulness-based alleviation of anxiety for both working and non-working women. CONCLUSION: Yoga can be effective for combating stress and anxiety besides boosting immunity in pregnant working women confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nadholta, Pooja; Bali, Parul; Singh, Amit; Anand, Akshay",Work,,409

METHODS: This retrospective study was carried in the Radiology Department, King Fahad Military Medical Complex, Dhahran between March to August 2020 (6 months). All laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted cases were evaluated for their symptoms, duration of hospital stays (in a ward or intensive care unit [ICU]), and imaging findings (ground-glass opacity [GGO], air-space shadowing/consolidation, and others such as atelectasis, reticulation, peribronchovascular thickening, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion) on chest radiograph (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) studies. Cavitation, nodularity, bronchiectasis, and embolism detected on CT scans were considered as complications. Disease course in terms of recovery (radiographic regression or resolution of findings), worsening (shifting from ward to ICU), and unfavorable outcome (persistent ICU stay or death) were recorded. Imaging findings were interpreted by 2 experienced radiologists and consensus reporting was made. Chi-square test was used to determine association. Results: Out of 106 patients, majority were males (n=82, 77.4%). Forty-six patients (43.3%) had abnormal imaging with mostly peripheral GGO (56.5%), followed by consolidations (34.7%), and others (26%). Complications were detected in 6 ICU patients. All patients with unfavorable outcomes were above 60 years having comorbidities or complications (p less than 0.0005). Fatality rate was calculated as 2.8.

However, it is susceptible to the thermal shock when working in a low temperature environment, which will cause a time-consuming and inaccurate human body temperature measurements. To overcome the effects of thermal shock, a hybrid temperature compensation method combining hardware and algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the principle of infrared temperature measurement is described and the influence of thermal shock on infrared thermometer is analyzed. Then, the hybrid temperature compensation scheme is constructed by mounting a heating ring on the infrared sensor shell, and using the proportional integral derivative (PID) algorithm and the pulse width modulation (PWM) technology to control it heating. In this way, the internal ambient temperature of infrared sensor can be raised rapidly closing to the external ambient temperature, and the stable outputs of the infrared sensor are also accelerated. Finally, some experiments are carried out in a laboratory. The results show that the proposed method can quickly and accurately measure the temperature of standard black body when the ambient temperatures are 5 , 15 and 25 Celsius respectively, the measurement error is only 0.2 Celsius , and the measurement time is less than 2 seconds.

305716,A comparative study of online learning in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic versus conventional learning,2021,"Issue: Calls to change medical education have been frequent, persistent, and generally limited to alterations in content or structural re-organization. Self-imposed barriers have prevented adoption of more radical pedagogical approaches, so recent predictions of the 'inevitability' of medical education transitioning to online delivery seemed unlikely. Then in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools to overcome established barriers overnight and make the most rapid curricular shift in medical education's history. We share the collated reports of nine medical schools and postulate how recent responses may influence future medical education. Evidence: While extraneous pandemic-related factors make it impossible to scientifically distinguish the impact of the curricular changes, some themes emerged. The rapid transition to online delivery was made possible by all schools having learning management systems and key electronic resources already blended into their curricula; we were closer to online delivery than anticipated. Student engagement with online delivery varied with different pedagogies used and the importance of social learning and interaction along with autonomy in learning were apparent. These are factors known to enhance online learning, and the student-centered modalities (e.g. problem-based learning) that included them appeared to be more engaging. Assumptions that the new online environment would be easily adopted and embraced by 'technophilic' students did not always hold true. Achieving true distance medical education will take longer than this 'overnight' response, but adhering to best practices for online education may open a new realm of possibilities. Implications: While this experience did not confirm that online medical education is really 'inevitable,' it revealed that it is possible. Thoughtfully blending more online components into a medical curriculum will allow us to take advantage of this environment's strengths such as efficiency and the ability to support asynchronous and autonomous learning that engage and foster intrinsic learning in our students. While maintaining aspects of social interaction, online learning could enhance pre-clinical medical education by allowing integration and collaboration among classes of medical students, other health professionals, and even between medical schools. What remains to be seen is whether COVID-19 provided the experience, vision and courage for medical education to change, or whether the old barriers will rise again when the pandemic is over.","Binks, Andrew P; LeClair, Renée J; Willey, Joanne M; Brenner, Judith M; Pickering, James D; Moore, Jesse S; Huggett, Kathryn N; Everling, Kathleen M; Arnott, John A; Croniger, Colleen M; Zehle, Christa H; Kranea, N Kevin; Schwartzstein, Richard M",Teach Learn Med,,409

This study aimed to investigate how younger and older adults are regulating their emotions during the current pandemic. Specifically, this study measured potential age differences in acceptance (broken down into situational and emotional acceptance), because it has been identified as a possible underlying mechanism of the relationship between aging and reduced negative affect (Shallcross et al., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 104(4), 734-749, 2013). Methods: Younger (N = 150) and older (N = 150) adults completed trait-level questionnaires of emotional and situational acceptance, and completed a task where they reacted to 24 negative, arousing COVID-19 news headlines, half of which were old-age focused, to capture trial-level acceptance use. Results: Older adults reported greater trait-level acceptance and used emotional acceptance more frequently than younger adults during the headlines task, especially on trials containing old-age focused headlines. Interestingly, younger adults reported reduced trial-level subjective arousal when engaging in emotional acceptance compared to active emotion regulation (suggesting beneficial affective outcomes of acceptance), while older adults reported no differences in arousal between trials when they engaged in acceptance and when they engaged in more active emotion regulation. Conclusion: We discuss potential explanations for these findings as well as present future research directions on acceptance across the lifespan.","Wolfe, Hannah E; Isaacowitz, Derek M",Aging Ment Health,,409

This study evaluated the effectiveness of an online psychological intervention based on the Awareness, Courage, and Love (ACL) model from Functional Analytic Psychotherapy to promote closeness between couples during the pandemic. METHOD: Thirty-one couples were randomised into either the intervention or control group for a 2-hour online group session. The intervention was designed to increase closeness between couples, whereas control group members watched a movie. In both groups, participants responded to two instruments that assessed the couple's relationship. Generalised linear mixed modeling was used to compare the change scores over time between the groups, with random effects used to control for the correlation within a couple and the correlation within the individual. RESULTS: The intervention group's closeness increased by 23 per cent while the control group's closeness increased only 2 per cent. A week later, a significant difference between the two groups emerged on closeness.

METHODS: Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire scale (GAD-7), Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90) somatization, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the suicidal module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used for online survey. RESULTS: A total of 606 frontline hospital staff and1099 general population were recruited. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia, and suicide risk in frontline medical staffs were 57.6%, 45.4%, 12.0%, 32.0% and 13.0%, respectively. Except for suicide risk, the prevalence of other psychological disorders in frontline medical staff were higher than those in general population (all p<0.01). Among the frontline medical staff, the daily working hours were associated with all psychological disturbance (all p<0.01), women with anxiety (p = 0.02), body mass index (BMI) with anxiety and insomnia (p = 0.02, p = 0.03). Age was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia (all p<0.01). Finally, years of working and family income were negatively associated with suicide risk (p = 0.03, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that during the outbreak of COVID-19, the frontline medical staff are more likely to suffer from psychological disturbances than general population. It is noticeable that daily working hours are a risk factor for all measured psychological disturbances, and some other variables may be involved in certain psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff.","Zhou, Yongjie; Wang, Wenjuan; Sun, Yanping; Qian, Wei; Liu, Zhengkui; Wang, Ruoxi; Qi, Ling; Yang, Jiezhi; Song, Xiuli; Zhou, Xin; Zeng, Lingyun; Liu, Tiebang; Li, Zezhi; Zhang, Xiangyang",J Affect Disord,,409

311258,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy: Double Reading of Chest CT Examination,2021,"Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also known as COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, emerged first in Wuhan, China, and spread all over the world. The World Health Organization on January 30, 2020, officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. There is speculation as to the origin of the infection and the objective of this narrative review is to scan the available literature to create a cohesive review. Methodology: This review article is based on a literature search of PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar using the keywords "" Corona virus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""COVID"" ""Origins,"" ""Review,"" and ""classification."" Articles providing new information were selected. Results: The coronavirus which has caused a pandemic has a genomic structure which closely resembles that of a bat coronavirus. The region that binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), i.e., the region of the spike proteins, resembles a coronavirus found in the pangolin (a scaly anteater found in the Chinese market and used in Chinese medicine). It is possible that the coronavirus was existing initially in its natural hosts, the bat, or pangolin. It is likely that the spike proteins mutated to bind to molecules similar to the human ACE2 protein therefore allowing it to infect humans. Another possibility is that it jumped species from bat to human and then became capable of causing pathogenic disease. The mutations in the receptor-binding domain portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2. It is not certain if the necessary mutations for causing the pandemic occurred before or after SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans. Conclusions: The current corona pandemic is due to the SARS-CoV-2 and there is evidence that it has spread to humans from bats. Pangolins, civet cats may be reservoirs for the virus, but as of now, there is no evidence of a laboratory origin of the virus. It is not clear whether the virus jumped species recently or was preexisting in humans and became pathogenic because of a recent mutation.","Bhardwaj, P.",Journal of the Practice of Cardiovascular Sciences,,409

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that this pandemic will disappear soon. No health system, with its present resources and workflow, is capable enough to deal with a full-blown wave of this pandemic. Acquisition of specific new skills may be fundamental in delivering appropriate health care for our patients. The gold standard for diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Radiological investigations (chest X-ray or high-resolution computerized tomography [CT]) can be helpful both for diagnosis and management, but they have many limitations. Ultrasound has been suggested as a reliable and accurate tool for assessing the lungs in COVID-19 patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) can show specific signs of interstitial pneumonia, which is characteristic of COVID-19 pulmonary infection. In addition, nonradiologist specialists with experience in ultrasound can be trained on LUS with a relatively rapid learning curve. In pregnancy, LUS can be particularly useful due to the avoidance of exposure to ionizing radiation. In this review, we present the advantages, techniques, and limitations of the use of LUS during the COVID-19 pandemic, with specific focus on pregnancy.","Youssef, Aly; Cavalera, Marta; Azzarone, Carlotta; Serra, Carla; Brunelli, Elena; Casadio, Paolo; Pilu, Gianluigi",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,,409

Forty CX3CR1GFP/+ mice were randomly divided into 8 groups. In addition to the normal group, the rest of groups were receiving laser treatment. The retina and choroid from the second, third, fourth and fifth group of mice were taken in the 1, 4, 7, 14 days after laser treatment. The mice in the sixth and seventh group received intravitreal injection of 2 µl PPADS or PBS respectively immediately after laser treatment. The mice in the eighth group received topical application of PPADS once per day of three days. The mice in sixth, seventh and eighth group received AF and FFA examination on the fourth day after laser treatment. Immunofluorescence histochemical staining and real-time quantitative PCR were used to evaluate P2 expression and its effect on choroidal neovascularization. After laser treatment, activated microglia can express P2 receptors (P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2 and P2Y12). The expression of P2 increased on the first day after laser damage, peaked on the fourth day (tP2X4 = 6.05, tP2X7 = 2.95, tP2Y2 = 3.67, tP2Y12 = 5.98, all P < 0.01), and then decreased. After PPADS inhibition, compared with the PBS injection group, the mRNA of P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2 and P2Y12 were decreased significantly in the PPADS injection group (tP2X4 = 5.54, tP2X7 = 9.82, tP2Y2 = 3.86, tP2Y12 = 7.91, all P < 0.01) and the PPADS topical application group (tP2X4 = 3.24, tP2X7 = 5.89, tP2Y2 = 6.75, tP2Y12 = 4.97, all P < 0.01). Compared with the PBS injection group, not only the activity of microglia cells but also the leakage of CNV decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the PPADS injection group and the PPADS topical application group. But between two PPADS groups, the leakage of CNV had no difference (P = 0.864). After laser induced CNV, activated microglia can express P2 receptors. The P2 receptor inhibitor, PPADS, can significantly affect the function of microglia and inhibit the formation of choroidal neovascularization.","Li, Lu; Liu, Juejun; Xu, Amin; Heiduschka, Peter; Eter, Nicole; Chen, Changzheng",Sci Rep,,409

The alteration in innate immunity is through histone modifications and epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes to develop an inflammatory phenotype, a process called ""trained immunity."" The memory T cells of adaptive immunity are also responsible for resistance against secondary infections after administration of BCG vaccine, a process called ""heterologous immunity."" Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is known to not only boosts immune responses to many vaccines when they are co-administered but also decrease severity of these infections when used alone. The BCG vaccine by itself induces a TH1 type response, and its use as a vector has also shown promising results.

Several virus-encoded nonstructural proteins play a key role during the viral life cycle. Endoribonuclease NSP15 is vital for the replication and life cycle of the virus, and is thus considered a compelling druggable target. Here, we performed a combination of multiscoring virtual screening and molecular docking of a library of 1624 natural compounds (Nuclei of Bioassays, Ecophysiology and Biosynthesis of Natural Products (NuBBE) database) on the active sites of NSP15 (PDB:6VWW). After sequential high-throughput screening by LibDock and GOLD, docking optimization by CDOCKER, and final scoring by calculating binding energies, top-ranked compounds NuBBE-1970 and NuBBE-242 were further investigated via an indepth molecular-docking and molecular-dynamics simulation of 60 ns, which revealed that the binding of these two compounds with active site residues of NSP15 was sufficiently strong and stable. The findings strongly suggest that further optimization and clinical investigations of these potent compounds may lead to effective SARS-CoV-2 treatment.","Saeed, Mohd; Saeed, Amir; Alam, Md Jahoor; Alreshidi, Mousa",Molecules (Basel),,409

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The Health in Prisons Programme (HIPP) of the WHO Regional Office for Europe worked with partner organizations to review regularly the evidence on best practices in prison health and use it to inform policy recommendations at the global level. HIPP issued overarching guidance and specific tools to support implementation of measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in prisons and other custodial settings. Moreover, to monitor the emergence of outbreaks, the HIPP developed a minimum data set for countries voluntarily to report COVID-19 cases and identify situations in need of direct support. FINDINGS: Since May 2020, the WHO has periodically received data from Member States, leading to the development of country-specific bulletins to support countries and, whenever appropriate, to organize virtual missions to further support ministries and public health bodies responsible for managing COVID-19 in prisons. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The development of a specific set of indicators for prisons enables exploring data in a disaggregated manner. Monitoring response measures developed in prison enables judging their appropriateness to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV2 in prisons and alignment with guidance issued by the WHO.","Alves da Costa, Filipa; Neufeld, Maria; Hamad, Mohamed; Carlin, Eric; Ferreira-Borges, Carina",International journal of prisoner health (Online),,409

DESIGN: A cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey. SETTING: APNs in any UK setting. PARTICIPANTS: The survey was sent to an existing UK-wide cohort of APNs. 124 APNs responded (51%). RESULTS: UK-based APNs in this study reported shortages of staff (51%) and personal protective equipment (PPE) (68%) during the first 3 months of the coronavirus outbreak. Almost half (47%) had considered leaving their job over the same 3 months. Despite difficulties, there were reports of positive changes to working practice that have enhanced care. CONCLUSION: UK APNs report COVID-19-related shortages in staff and equipment across primary and secondary care and all regions of the UK. Shortages of PPE during a pandemic are known to be a factor in the development of mental health sequelae as well as a risk factor for increased turnover and retention issues. Half of APNs surveyed were considering a change in job. The UK risks a further crisis in staff morale and retention if this is not acknowledged and addressed. APNs also expressed concern about patients not receiving routine care as many specialties closed or reduced working during the crisis. However, there were also many examples of good practice, positive changes and innovation.","Wood, Emily; King, Rachel; Senek, Michaela; Robertson, Steve; Taylor, Bethany; Tod, Angela; Ryan, Anthony",BMJ Open,,409

333501,Trends in US Heart Transplant Waitlist Activity and Volume During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"The Arba'een pilgrimage in Iraq is now the largest annual gathering in a single place worldwide. To monitor and address the health needs of pilgrims in field clinics near the pilgrimage route, a syndromic surveillance system was designed and implemented by Global Health Development/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network in collaboration with Iraq Ministry of Health. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of the surveillance system and the data it gathered in evaluating the burden of common acute and infectious conditions, chronic conditions, and trauma and injuries during the Arba'een pilgrimage in 2018. Data were collected at 152 field clinics located across 11 governorates in Iraq at strategic points along the Arba'een pilgrimage route from all governorates to Karbala between October 8 and November 3, 2018. A team of 24 surveillance supervisors trained, oversaw, and provided technical support for 304 data collectors. The data collectors recorded data from 338,399 patients (42.5% female and 57.5% male) in the span of 26 days. The vast majority of patients were from Iraq (n = 294,260, 87.6%) and Iran (n = 34,691, 10.3%). Of the 338,399 patients whose data were recorded by the surveillance system, 246,469 (72.8%) reported acute and infectious conditions, 202,032 (59.70%) reported chronic conditions, and 6,737 (2.0%) reported traumas and injuries. Many patients reported several conditions in multiple categories. The most prevalent acute condition treated was influenza-like illness, identified through patients exhibiting a combination of fever and cough symptoms. Findings from this study will help inform future planning efforts so healthcare workers can be better prepared for treating such cases at mass gatherings. With the latest challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, preparations for a possible future outbreak of the novel coronavirus are also discussed. The information from this study serves as a foundation to inform and optimize future planning of wide-scale surveillance efforts and address challenges in health service delivery and health security.","Lami, Faris; Amiri, Mirwais; Majeed, Yasir; Barr, Kira M; Nsour, Mohannad Al; Khader, Yousef S",Health Secur,,409

Teams A and B, each consisting of 11 players (typically six on the ice and five on the bench at any given time), included men aged 19-53 years. During the 5 days after the game, 15 persons (14 of the 22 players and a rink staff member) experienced signs and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)*; 13 of the 15 ill persons had positive laboratory test results indicating infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented at a choir practice (1) and at meat processing plants (2,3); however, apart from an outbreak involving 57 infected dancers that has been linked to high-intensity fitness dance classes in South Korea (4) and a cluster of five infected persons at a squash facility in Slovenia (5), few published reports are available regarding transmission associated with specific sports games or practices.

340046,Evolving Healthcare Delivery in Neurology During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"The dispersal of marine larvae determines the level of connectivity among populations, influences population dynamics, and affects evolutionary processes. Patterns of dispersal are influenced by both ocean currents and larval behavior, yet the role of behavior remains poorly understood. Here we report the first integrated study of the ontogeny of multiple sensory systems and orientation behavior throughout the larval phase of a coral reef fish-the neon goby, Elacatinus lori. We document the developmental morphology of all major sensory organs (lateral line, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory) together with the development of larval swimming and orientation behaviors observed in a circular arena set adrift at sea. We show that all sensory organs are present at hatch and increase in size (or number) and complexity throughout the larval phase. Further, we demonstrate that most larvae can orient as early as 2 days post-hatch, and they swim faster and straighter as they develop. We conclude that sensory organs and swimming abilities are sufficiently developed to allow E. lori larvae to orient soon after hatch, suggesting that early orientation behavior may be common among coral reef fishes. Finally, we provide a framework for testing alternative hypotheses for the orientation strategies used by fish larvae, laying a foundation for a deeper understanding of the role of behavior in shaping dispersal patterns in the sea.","Majoris, John E; Foretich, Matthew A; Hu, Yinan; Nickles, Katie R; Di Persia, Camilla L; Chaput, Romain; Schlatter, E; Webb, Jacqueline F; Paris, Claire B; Buston, Peter M",Sci Rep,,409

340599,Redeployment of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: This study examined remote learning practices and difficulties during initial stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Participants were 238 adolescents (132 males; 118 with ADHD) aged 15.64-17.99 years and their parents. Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires in May/June 2020 when in-person schools were closed in the U.S. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of families incurred financial costs to support remote learning, and only 59% of school-based services received before COVID-19 continued during COVID-19 remote learning. Adolescents with ADHD had fewer routines and more remote learning difficulties than adolescents without ADHD. Parents of adolescents with ADHD had less confidence in managing remote learning and more difficulties in supporting home learning and home-school communication. Thirty-one percent of parents of adolescents with ADHD with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or receiving academic accommodations (504 Plan) reported remote learning to be very challenging, compared with 18% of parents of adolescents with ADHD without an IEP/504 Plan, and only 4% of parents of adolescents with neither ADHD nor an IEP/504 Plan. Fewer adolescent routines, higher negative affect, and more difficulty concentrating because of COVID-19 were each associated with greater adolescent remote learning difficulties only in adolescents with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial findings of the nature and impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative for schools and communities to provide the necessary supports to adolescents, particularly those with mental health and/or learning difficulties, and to their parents.","Becker, Stephen P; Breaux, Rosanna; Cusick, Caroline N; Dvorsky, Melissa R; Marsh, Nicholas P; Sciberras, Emma; Langberg, Joshua M",J Adolesc Health,,409

341572,Learning From the Decrease in US Emergency Department Visits in Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"Background and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused social and economic turmoil, which has led to enormous strain for many families. Past work with pandemic outbreaks suggests that media attention can increase anxiety and compensatory behaviors. Social isolation can lead to increase in online communication and parents who use social media may be affected by other people's emotions online through what is known as digital emotion contagion (DEC). The current study aimed to examine the role of DEC in the relationship between stress, concern about COVID-19, parental burnout and emotion regulation (ER). Methods: In April 2020, an online survey was advertised in Social Media Parenting Groups and published on FIU Psychology online research system SONA. Data were analyzed using correlational analysis, linear and multiple linear regression, and moderation analysis. Results: Concern about COVID-19 predicted stress, depression, and parental burnout. Susceptibility to DEC significantly increased the impact of stress on parental burnout. Having relatives infected with COVID-19 increased the effect of DEC on parental burnout. A higher level of ER buffered the relationship between emotion contagion and concern about COVID-19. Conclusion: These findings suggest that susceptibility to digital emotion contagion may have a negative effect on parents. Digital emotion contagion may increase parental burnout and is tied to stress.","Prikhidko, Alena; Long, Haiying; Wheaton, Michael G",Front Public Health,,409

346438,Maternal Mortality From Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States,2020,": Current data suggest that the opioid epidemic represents a worsening problem in the United States. However, prescribing rates of opioids have been steadily declining, suggesting that alternative opioids are becoming a major contributor to this crisis. One medication that has shown an increase in nonmedical use is loperamide. Loperamide is a peripheral mu-opioid agonist that is intended to be used for diarrhea. However, when taken at high doses and/or in combination with P-glycoprotein inhibitors, it acts centrally by penetrating the blood-brain-barrier. Loperamide crossing the blood-brain-barrier results in similar central nervous system depression as other opioids. Loperamide's over-the-counter availability and growing media presence has resulted in more cases of loperamide substance use disorder, predominantly to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms and to produce a euphoric state. This case series presents 3 patients with loperamide-associated opioid use disorder who have been successfully treated with on-going buprenorphine treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case-series to explore long-term buprenorphine treatment for loperamide use disorder. Our findings suggest that buprenorphine can be used for loperamide use disorder, most effectively when patients are in mild to moderate withdrawal. These cases also demonstrate how different waiting times were necessary before starting buprenorphine treatment in order to avoid precipitated withdrawal.","Brar, Jessica K; Broyan, Viktoriya R; Allgaier, Jeffrey T; Nye, Larry; Saxon, Andrew J",,,409

The slow and inefficient process of carrying out traditional randomized clinical trials led regulatory authorities to hastily approve treatments and tests without sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy.We here outline issues with the current research platform, summarize shortcomings of traditional randomized clinical trials particularly apparent at the time of pandemics, and highlight the advantages of pragmatic clinical trials as an alternative to rapidly generate the needed clinical evidence. We further discuss barriers and challenges to pragmatic clinical trials implementation and explore opportunities for research institutions and regulatory authorities to facilitate widespread adoption of this vital research tool.As a subsequent wave of COVID-19, and/or another epidemic, are all but inevitable in our lifetime, we must ensure that our research infrastructure is conducive to carrying out pragmatic clinical trials to expeditiously generate the needed evidence and blunt the epidemic's toll on human lives and livelihoods.","Almufleh, Aws; Joseph, Jacob",Trials,,409

METHODS: Three hundred pregnant women were surveyed face to face with 40 questions. Sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination history, perception of risk for the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and acceptance of and attitude toward future COVID-19 vaccination were prospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Among all participants, 111 (37%) stated their intent to receive the vaccine if it were recommended for pregnant women. Most common refusal reasons were lack of data about COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant populations and possibility of harm to the fetus. There was a weak positive correlation between COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy and number of school-age children. Pregnant women in the first trimester expressed higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination than those in the second and third trimesters. CONCLUSION: The present study reported low acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in a sample of pregnant women. Concern about vaccine safety was the major reason for hesitancy. Identifying attitudes among priority groups will be useful for creating vaccination strategies that increase uptake during the current pandemic.","Goncu Ayhan, Sule; Oluklu, Deniz; Atalay, Aysegul; Menekse Beser, Dilek; Tanacan, Atakan; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem; Sahin, Dilek",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,409

Clinical studies have found that patients with cardiovascular disease are more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and are more prone to develop severe disease after infection and have a poor prognosis. Since patients with cardiovascular disease have more ACE2 receptors, are more prone to vascular endothelial damage, while patients with COVID often have increased plasma angiotensin II and inflammatory factors, hypoxia in body and myocardium, and blood coagulation dysfunction, so that the overall disease aggravated. At present, there is insufficient research on the specific mechanism of the interaction between COVID and cardiovascular disease (especially the mechanism of increased susceptibility to COVID in patients with cardiovascular disease). In present paper, the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2, the susceptibility, and the concurrent characteristics of the underlying diseases are discussed, which provides reference suggestions for the next clinical and experimental steps.","Rui, Wang; Hong-Yong, Wang; Yong-Jun, Luo",Med.

A comprehensive screening tool is therefore necessary to identify these needs. To date, no data exist on satisfaction with medical and therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 in terms of quality and quantity. The aim of this study is to develop a survey for use with COVID-19 patients during and after the end of the acute phase of the disease. METHODS: Following the definition of dimensions by a group of experts, and a literature search, proven survey instruments were searched for suitable items. In addition, specific questions were developed based on symptoms, and answer options were created with regard to to the complexity of the questions. RESULTS: The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Needs Survey (C19-RehabNeS) consists of the established 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) together with the newly developed COVID-19-Rehabilitation Needs Questionnaire (C19-RehabNeQ) (11 further dimensions, respectively 57 items). CONCLUSION: C19-RehabNeS is a comprehensive survey to assess functional limitations and rehabilitation needs during and after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The strength of this survey is that it combines the assessment of important rehabilitation needs with assessment of satisfaction with the health services, treatment and therapy during the pandemic (C19-RehabNeQ) and assessment of patients' quality of life (SF-36).

Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. CONCLUSION: Participants' intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of Covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of Covid-19 vaccines in cultivating Covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants'.","Mir, Hilal Hamid; Parveen, Subeena; Mullick, Naushadul Haque; Nabi, Shazia",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,409
355256,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): situation report, 76",2020,"Vitamin D has been claimed to be effective in the response to infections, including the respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is supposed that lockdown measures and fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection might reduce vitamin D levels through the modification of lifestyle. However, very few data exist on the association between lockdown measures and vitamin D status in humans. For this cross-sectional comparative study, adolescents (n = 298) aged 18 to 19 years were enrolled during the compulsory military fitness-for-duty evaluation between July and December 2020 in Southern Switzerland. Beyond anthropometric measurements, participants filled in a structured questionnaire about their lifestyle and a blood specimen was sampled for the determination of total 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. The obtained data were compared with those of 437 adolescents enrolled at the military fitness-for-duty evaluation during the same period of the year in the context of the CENERI study (2014-2016). The anthropometric measures were similar between the two study groups. The levels of vitamin D were also comparable (77 (64-91) vs. 74 (60-92) nmol/L, p = 0.50; median and interquartile range). A total of 38 (13%) and 43 (9.8%) subjects presented insufficient (<50 nmol/L) levels of vitamin D (p = 0.42) during the current pandemic and in the CENERI study, respectively. These data do not support the hypothesis that during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, late adolescents are at higher risk of vitamin insufficiency.","Meoli, Martina; Muggli, Franco; Lava, Sebastiano A G; Bianchetti, Mario G; Agostoni, Carlo; Kocher, Claudine; Bührer, Thomas W; Ciliberti, Letizia; Simonetti, Giacomo D; Milani, Gregorio P",Nutrients,,409

The model of chronic care must be based on productive interaction between the health care team and the patient. Due to the Covid19 Pandemic we have transformed the face to face support and treatment of the Obesity patient into a virtual model. Digital model can turns the patient into an “active patient” who participates in making decisions about their own health. Objetives: Describe digital transformation for the virtual management of obese and overweight patients. Material-Methods: We have re-engineered the process of diagnosis, care and treatment of the obese patient in order to integrate telemedicine. The clinical programme described in Figure 1 achieves a complete diagnosis of obesity and associated comorbidities and provides the patient with all the necessary tools for dietary modifications, physical exercise and emotional control during one year. The contact with the patient is mainly virtual through the patient's hospital website. Before medical appointments at 0, 6 and 12 months the programme request complementary tests (Bioelectrical impedance, blood test and abdominal ultrasounds) and asks patient to fill in online forms on personal history, cardiovascular risk factors, treatment, family history, weight history, dietary habits, tests of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, RAPA test for physical exercise, Golberg and EDI scales to examine psychological condition, tests of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, Life Quality Questionnaire(IWQOL-Lite) and Epworth sleepiness scale for SHAS screening. The programme has automatic calculators for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) screen (NAFLD fibrosis score/FIB4 Index), cardiovascular risk and Frindisk test for Diabetes risk. System automatic requests a home polysomnography if the Epworth score is greater than 8 and also screens for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using NAFLD score, FIB4 index and abdominal ultrasound and requests Fibroscan if necessary. If EDI and Golberg scales are pathological, the system activates online psychological support. When the patient comes to the medical appointment, the doctor has full information to make an accurate diagnosis. After, the patient undergoes a monthly therapeutic educational group programme and fill in the online Weight and Waist Circumference booklet and podometer record monthly. The patient receives individually tailored nutritional recommendations and physical exercise. Managing obesity with learning Empowers the patient. The aim is to train the patient to become autonomous in the management of the disease. Results: The digital clinical pathway has been activated in December 2020. Conclusions:-Telemedicine enables an intensive, immediate and fluid intervention that allows the patient to actively participate in their own health process, fostering the self-efficacy and responsibility so necessary in the management of chronic diseases.-The IT development of the clinical pathway has allowed us to be more efficient in terms of time and resources by automating procedures like screening of SHAS and NAFLD.","Montoya Álvarez, T.; Vázquez Martínez, C.; Hoyas Rodríquez, I.; Luca, B.

358888,Potential for State Restrictions to Impact Critical Care of Pregnant Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Background: Oral mucositis is a common and debilitating painful side effect of many forms of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Mucositis may lead to dose reductions and unplanned interruptions of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (RT) and often affects patients' quality of life. Aim: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of the ayurvedic preparation in decreasing the severity of mucositis in head-and-neck cancer patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Materials and Methods: In this prospective randomized study, the patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 patients received conventional mucositis treatment, whereas Group 2 patients received ayurvedic preparation Yashtimadhu in addition to conventional treatment. Group 3 patients received honey for local application in oral cavity as well as one tea spoon of honey twice daily orally in addition to routine conventional treatment. All the patients were assessed for mucositis at the end of every week during the RT for a period of 6 weeks. Results: A significant difference was observed between the groups at each time point. Nearly 42.85% of patients in conventional treatment arm developed Grade 3 mucositis, 20% of patients developed Grade 3 mucositis in group where honey was given, and only 15.5% of patients developed Grade 3 mucositis in Yastimadhu group. Unplanned treatment breaks and hospitalization of patients were reduced with the use of yashtimadhu as compared to other two groups. Conclusion: Yashtimadhu was observed to be effective and delayed the development of severe form of mucositis. The drug appeared to be more efficient in the management of radiation-induced mucositis.","Mamgain, Ravindra Kumar; Gupta, Meenu; Mamgain, Pratibha; Verma, Sanjeev Kumar; Pruthi, Deep Shankar; Kandwal, Abhishek; Saini, Sunil",J Cancer Res Ther,,409

While identification and containment of new cases remains important, laboratories must now pivot and consider an assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naïve, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and vaccinated (including both naïve and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naïve, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP values, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naïve group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than naïve following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.","Narasimhan, Madhusudhanan; Mahimainathan, Lenin; Araj, Ellen; Clark, Andrew E; Markantonis, John; Green, Allen; Xu, Jing; SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Alexis, Charles; Fankhauser, Kimberly; Parikh, Hiren; Wilkinson, Kathleen; Reczek, Annika; Kopplin, Noa; Yekkaluri, Sruthi; Balani, Jyoti; Thomas, Abey; Singal, Amit G; Sarode, Ravi; Muthukumar, Alagarraju",J. clin. microbiol,,409

The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, appear to be impacting on people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is likely that many countries will experience a ‘wave’ of COVID-19 related mental disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as social isolation; unemployment; housing and income stress; intimate partner violence; work-related trauma; and grief and loss. The ‘two-pronged’ approach used to deal with COVID-19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new-onset cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is particularly important to ‘flatten the curve’ and avoid a surge in incidence of mental disorders stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up. These interventions include parenting programs, social and emotional learning programs, self-care strategies, and workplace mental wellbeing programs, among others.","Carbone, Stephen R.",Mental Health Prev.,,409

They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had (i) attempted to quit smoking, (ii) attempted to quit vaping and (iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. FINDINGS: Odds of self-reported COVID-19 were significantly greater among current smokers [20.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.73] and long-term (> 1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68) compared with never smokers (14.5%). Recent (< 1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of self-reported COVID-19 (22.2%, aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.85-2.53). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in self-reported COVID-19 by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand-washing before face-touching, engagement in hand-washing behaviours was high (> 85%), regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of quit attempts in the past 3 months were reportedly triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one in 10 current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In England, current smokers and long-term ex-smokers appear to have higher odds of self-reported COVID-19 compared with never smokers in adjusted analyses, but there were no large differences between people who used nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes. Engagement in hand-washing appears to be high, regardless of nicotine or tobacco use. A minority of past-year smokers and current e-cigarette users, respectively, report attempting to quit smoking/vaping due to COVID-19.","Tattan-Birch, Harry; Perski, Olga; Jackson, Sarah; Shahab, Lion; West, Robert; Brown, Jamie",Addiction,,409
362225,The mental health burden of social distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 more readily affects the elderly, especially as they present co-morbidities. In the COVID-19 pathogeny, ACE2 appears to be the key cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans. The level of ACE2 gene expression influences the susceptibility of contracting SARS-CoV-2. In circumstances in which the ACE2 level is low, the incidence of Covid-19 seems to be fewer. Two clinical patterns illustrate this observation, i. e., in infants and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Very young children and AD patients get little COVID-19, in part probably due to decreased expression of ACE2. The determination of the nasal level of ACE2 gene expression could provide a useful scale to predict the susceptibility to contract the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lecarpentier, Yves; Vallée, Alexandre",Aging (Albany NY),,409

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a prelude to viral entry into the cell. Using a naive llama single-domain antibody library and PCR-based maturation, we have produced two closely related nanobodies, H11-D4 and H11-H4, that bind RBD (KD of 39 and 12 nM, respectively) and block its interaction with ACE2. Single-particle cryo-EM revealed that both nanobodies bind to all three RBDs in the spike trimer. Crystal structures of each nanobody-RBD complex revealed how both nanobodies recognize the same epitope, which partly overlaps with the ACE2 binding surface, explaining the blocking of the RBD-ACE2 interaction. Nanobody-Fc fusions showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (4-6 nM for H11-H4, 18 nM for H11-D4) and additive neutralization with the SARS-CoV-1/2 antibody CR3022.","Huo, Jiangdong; Le Bas, Audrey; Ruza, Reinis R; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Mikolajek, Halina; Malinauskas, Tomas; Tan, Tiong Kit; Rijal, Pramila; Dumoux, Maud; Ward, Philip N; Ren, Jingshan; Zhou, Daming; Harrison, Peter J; Weckener, Miriam; Clare, Daniel K; Vogirala, Vinod K; Radecke, Julika; Moynié, Lucile; Zhao, Yuguang; Gilbert-Jaramillo, Javier; Knight, Michael L; Tree, Julia A; Buttigieg, Karen R; Coombes, Naomi; Elmore, Michael J; Carroll, Miles W; Carrique, Loic; Shah, Pranav N M; James, William; Townsend, Alain R; Stuart, David I; Owens, Raymond J; Naismith, James H",Nat Struct Mol Biol,,409

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 associated with differential response to corticosteroid therapy? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital treated between January and February 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was the administration of IV corticosteroids. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Marginal structural modeling was used to account for baseline and time-dependent confounders. An unsupervised machine learning approach was carried out to identify phenotypes of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 428 patients were included; 280 of 428 patients (65.4%) received corticosteroid therapy. The 28-day mortality was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroid therapy than in those who did not (53.9% vs 19.6%; P < .0001). After marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not associated significantly with 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.54-1.18; P = .26). Our analysis identified two phenotypes of COVID-19, and compared with the hypoinflammatory phenotype, the hyperinflammatory phenotype was characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher rates of complications. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with a reduced 28-day mortality (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.80; P = .0062) in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype. INTERPRETATION: For critically ill patients with COVID-19, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with 28-day mortality, but the use of corticosteroids showed significant survival benefits in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype.","Chen, Hui; Xie, Jianfeng; Su, Nan; Wang, Jun; Sun, Qin; Li, Shusheng; Jin, Jun; Zhou, Jing; Mo, Min; Wei, Yao; Chao, Yali; Hu, Weiwei; Du, Bin; Qiu, Haibo",Chest,,409

We classify economic sectors into three groups based on performance, i.e., sectors performing below, average, and above-average performing. Our results indicate that the economic efficiency and energy use efficiency effects in the industry sector have remained above average. In contrast, the GDP gap effect has remained below average. In the case of structure effect and intensity effect, the agriculture sector has performed on average. In contrast, the service sector has shown mixed results in all factors.

In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoVs. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs.","Kandeel, Mahmoud; Ibrahim, Abdelazim; Fayez, Mahmoud; Al-Nazawi, Mohammed",J Med Virol,,409

Older age and presence of comorbidities, including diabetes, were shown to be associated with a more severe course and a higher fatality rate. Studies from the most affected countries, including China, United States and Italy, seem to indicate that prevalence of diabetes among patients affected by COVID-19 is not higher than that observed in the general population, thus suggesting that diabetes is not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, a large body of evidence demonstrate that diabetes is a risk factor for disease progression towards critical illness, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation or admission to intensive care unit, and ultimately death. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes remain to be elucidated. In particular, it is still unresolved whether is diabetes per se, especially if poorly controlled, or rather the various comorbidities/complications associated with it that predispose patients with COVID-19 to a worse prognosis. In fact, conditions that cluster with diabetes in the context of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and hypertension, or complicate chronic hyperglycemia, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, have also been associated with poor prognosis in these individuals and the available studies have not consistently shown that diabetes predict disease severity independently of them.","Pugliese, Giuseppe; Vitale, Martina; Resi, Veronica; Orsi, Emanuela",Acta Diabetol,,409

However, parents are increasingly expressing concerns about whether these might be physically harmful. This mini review assessed the evidence. METHOD: We conducted a narrative review on the effects of mask wearing on physiological variables in children, using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and the World Health Organization COVID-19 Database up to 7 November 2020. The lack of paediatric studies prompted a second search for adult studies. RESULTS: We only found two paediatric studies, published in 2019 and 2020. The 2020 study was not related to COVID-19. Only one study, performed with N95 respirators, collected medical parameters, and this did not suggest any harmful effects of gas exchange. The eight adult studies, including four prompted by the pandemic and one on surgeons, reported that face masks commonly used during the pandemic did not impair gas exchange during rest or mild exercise.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with higher severity and mortality of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of comorbidities and medications in addition to determining the association between AKI, antibiotics against coinfections (AAC) and outcomes of patients. We conducted a retrospective study on adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a tertiary center. Our primary outcomes were the incidence rate of AKI based on comorbidities and medications. The secondary outcome was to determine mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged hospitalization by AKI and AAC. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression method was used to explore predictive effects of AKI and AAC on outcomes. Out of 854 included participants, 118 patients developed AKI in whom, 57 used AAC and 61 did not. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities in patients developed AKI. AAC, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and corticosteroids had significant higher rate of administration in patients developed AKI. AAC were associated with higher deaths (odds ratio [OR] = 5.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3-8.78) and ICU admission (OR = 5.87; 95%CI: 2.81-12.27), while AKI had higher OR for prolonged hospitalization (3.37; 95%CI: 1.76-6.45). Both AKI and AAC are associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19.

369491,The Early Influence and Effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Resident Education and Adaptations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulated immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are thought to underlie the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to further characterize host antiviral and cytokine gene expression in COVID-19 patients based on illness severity. METHODS: In this case-control study, we retrospectively analyzed 46 recovered COVID-19 patients and 24 healthy subjects (no history of COVID-19) recruited from the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang City. Blood samples were collected from each study participant for RNA extraction and PCR. We assessed changes in antiviral gene expression between healthy controls and patients with mild/moderate (MM) and severe/critical (SC) disease. RESULTS: We found that type I interferon signaling (IFNA2, TLR8, IFNA1, IFNAR1, TLR9, IRF7, ISG15, APOBEC3G, and MX1) and genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines (IL12B, IL15, IL6, IL12A and IL1B) and chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL11 and CXCL10) were upregulated in patients with MM and SC disease. Moreover, we found that IFNA1, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) were significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) in the SC group compared to the MM group. We also observed that microRNA (miR)-155 and miR-130a levels were markedly higher in the MM group compared to the SC group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with the activation of host antiviral genes. Induction of the IFN system appears to be particularly important in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, as decreased expression of IFNA1, APOBEC3G and FADD genes in SC patients, relative to MM patients, may be associated with disease progression.","Li, Shasha; Duan, Xiaoqiong; Li, Yujia; Li, Ming; Gao, Yong; Li, Tuantuan; Li, Shilin; Tan, Lin; Shao, Tuo; Jeyarajan, Andre J; Chen, Limin; Han, Mingfeng; Lin, Wenyu; Li, Xiuyong",Aging (Albany NY),,409

370616,Pre-existing Disparities and Potential Implications for the Rapid Expansion of Telemedicine in Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia of unknown cause was detected on 30 December 2019 in China. It was categorized as an outbreak and named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. The pandemic affects all people, but patient groups such as hemodialysis (HD) patients have been particularly affected. We do not know if refugees suffered more during the outbreak. In this study, we compared depressive symptom frequency between Syrian refugee HD patients and Turkish ones. METHODS: The study had a single-center, cross-sectional design. Demographic and clinical data were collected retrospectively from patients' files containing details about past medical history, demographic variables and laboratory values. Validated Turkish and Arabic forms of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess depressive symptoms. BDI scores were compared according to nationality, demographic features and clinical data. A BDI score more than 14 was accepted as suspicion of depression. RESULTS: 119 patients were enrolled in the study. After the exclusion of 22 patients, 75 Turkish and 22 Syrian patients were included for further analysis. The median BDI (interquartile range) score for Turkish and Syrian patients were 12 (7-23) and 19.5 (12.7-25.2), respectively (p = 0.03). Suspicion of depression was present at 42.7% of Turkish, and 72.7% of Syrian HD patients (p = 0.013). Regarding all patients, phosphorus level, Kt/V, and nationality were significantly different between patients with and without suspicion of depression (p = 0.023, 0.039, 0.013, respectively). CONCLUSION: Syrian patients had higher BDI scores and more depressive symptoms than Turkish patients. Additional national measures for better integration and more mental support to Syrian HD patients are needed.","Sevinc, Mustafa; Hasbal, Nuri Baris; Sakaci, Tamer; Basturk, Taner; Ahbap, Elbis; Ortaboz, Mustafa; Mazi, Emrah Erkan; Pirdogan, Efruz; Ling, Jonathan; Unsal, Abdulkadir",PLoS One,,409
370739,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Short Review on Hematological Manifestations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Evidence links COVID-19 severity to hyper-inflammation. Treatment with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, was shown to lead to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19. We, therefore, performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether the circulating levels of IL-6 is a reliable indicator of disease severity among patients affected with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar on April 19, 2020. RESULTS: Eleven studies provided data of IL-6 levels in patients with severe to critical COVID-19 (severe) and patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (non-severe). The included studies were of moderate to high quality. The mean patients' age was 60.9 years, ranging from 45.2 to 76.7 years in the severe group and 46.8 years, ranging from 37.9 to 61 years, in the nonsevere group. Fifty-two percent were male in the severe group, as compared to 46% in the non-severe group. An overall random effects meta-analysis showed significantly higher serum levels of IL-6 in the severe group than in the non-severe group with a mean difference of +23.1 pg/mL (95% CI: 12.42-33.79) and the overall effect of 4.24 (P-value < 0.001). Meta-regressions showed that neither age nor sex significantly influenced the mean difference of IL-6 between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis and meta-regression reveal a reliable relationship between IL-6 and COVID-19 severity, independent of age and sex. Future research is, however, required to assess the effect of BMI on the pattern of IL-6 production in patients with COVID-19. Also, there might be confounding factors that influence the relationship between IL-6 and COVID-19 severity and remain as yet unknown.","Mojtabavi, Helia; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Eur Cytokine Netw,,409
370740,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Short Review on Hematological Manifestations,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We compared physical activity levels before the outbreak and quarantine measures with COVID-19-associated hospitalization prevalence in surviving patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we investigated the association of physical activity levels with symptoms of the disease, length of hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional. METHODS: Between June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We shared the electronic link to the questionnaire on the internet. We collected data about clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay) and cofactors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases, socioeconomic and educational, and physical activity levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short version). RESULTS: Out of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate analysis, sex, age, and BMI were all associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Men had a higher prevalence of hospitalization (66.6%, pâ¯=â¯0.013). Patients older than 65â¯years, obese, and with preexisting disease had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. In a multivariate regression model, performance of at least 150â¯min/wk (moderate) and/or 75â¯min/wk (vigorous) physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of hospitalizations after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and preexisting diseases (PRâ¯=â¯0.657; pâ¯=â¯0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient physical activity levels were associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Performing at least 150â¯min a week of moderate-intensity, or 75â¯min a week of vigorous-intensity physical activity was associated with 34.3% reduction in prevalence.","de Souza, Francis Ribeiro; Motta-Santos, Daisy; Dos Santos Soares, Douglas; de Lima, Juliana Beust; Cardozo, Gustavo Gonçalves; Guimarães, Luciano Santos Pinto; Negrão, Carlos Eduardo; Dos Santos, Marcelo Rodrigues",J. sci. med. sport,,409

We could observe that the traditional narrative of the CE is being challenged by new strategies that include the relationships among stakeholders and the reallocation of stakeholder roles. This is even more evident in the current health crisis, COVID-19. Circular economy can have higher integrated impacts beyond the mere economic and environmental spheres if it is conceptualized as an open and dynamic loop of relationships, where stakeholders power, roles and responsibilities overlap and converge into an emergent joint-value creation","Casalegno, Cecilia Civera Chiara Mosca Fabrizio Freeman R.

Untersucht werden soll, wie diese Pandemie-Maßnahme auf die Bevölkerung eines ländlich geprägten, strukturschwachen Bundeslandes am Beispiel der Notaufnahmefallzahlen eines Schwerpunktversorgers gewirkt hat. METHODEN: Abruf von anonymisierten aggregierten Routinedaten und Auswertung der Phasen ""Vergleich"" (03.07.2019-15.03.2020), Corona-Phase 1"" (16.03.2020-06.05.2020) und ""Corona-Phase 2"" (07.05.2020-31.07.2020). ERGEBNISSE: Auswertung von 24977 Patientendaten (2493 Patienten Corona-Phase 1/5106 Patienten Phase 2). 53% der Patienten sind älter als 50 Jahre, ca. 30% älter als 70 Jahre. Regulär suchen 67,6 Patienten die Notaufnahme je Tag auf. In der Corona-Phase 1 reduziert sich die Zahl um 19,7 Patienten/Tag; in der Phase 2 sind 8,2 Patienten/Tag weniger als in der Vergleichsgruppe - bei insgesamt unveränderter Altersstruktur. 56% der Patienten suchen eigenständig (Selbstvorstellung) die Notaufnahme auf, 24% auf Veranlassung eines Vertragsarztes, 17% werden durch den Rettungsdienst (Notarzt, RTW) vorgestellt. Besonders auffällig ist der Fallzahlrückgang bei den Patienten, die sich selbst in der Notaufnahme vorstellen und vom Kassenarzt eingewiesen werden. Die Fallzahlen über den Rettungsdienst (NEF, RTW) sind relativ stabil - bzw. in der 2. Corona-Phase anteigend (Notarzt+7%, RTW+36%). Das Hauptdiagnosespektrum der aus der Notaufnahme stationär aufgenommenen Patienten umfasst bei den Vertragsarzteinweisungen und Selbstvorsteller 375 bzw. 360 ICD-10-GM Dreistellergruppen. Hierbei reduzieren sich typische Notfallerkrankungen deutlich (Hirninfarkt (I63) -52%, Herzinfarkt (I21) -61%, Cholelithiasis (K80) -75% bei Selbstvorstellungen/Vorhofflimmern (I48) -55%, akute Bronchitis (J20) - 35%, Gastroenteritis (A09) -48% bei Vertragsarzteinweisungen - jeweils Corona-Phase 1 zu Vergleichsgruppe). Diese Fallzahlverluste sind überwiegend in der Corona-Phase 2 persistent (Hirninfarkt (I63) - 29% bei Selbstvorstellern) und nur z. T. reversibel (Herzinfarkt (I21)+10%). SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Eine Reduktion von Notfallkontakten, die nicht final durch den Pandemieverlauf erklärbar ist, v. a. der Selbstvorstellungen, Kassenarztvorstellungen fanden statt. Die Reduktion der Fallzahlen v. a. der überwiegend älteren Patienten, die selbstständig oder über den Kassenarzt vorgestellt wurden, überwog den Anteil des professionellen Rettungsdienstes deutlich. Es kann vermutet werden, dass Pandemie-Maßnahmen selbst zu diesem Effekt - trotz ausreichender medizinischer Ressourcen- geführt haben. ""Infektionsangst"" als alleiniges Erklärungsmodell überzeugt nicht, da in Mecklenburg die Pandemie einen sehr milden, fallzahlschwachen Verlauf ohne Hotspot-Ereignisse in Krankenhäusern hatte. Untersuchungen zur Entscheidungsfindung der Bevölkerung bei Notfällen im weiteren Pandemieverlauf sind notwendig. BACKGROUND: Extensive lockdown restrictions were implemented by the government to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic situation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether and how access to the emergency department (ED) changed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to baseline parameter in a hospital in the county Mecklenburg in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on patients who accessed the ED in ""Corona - Phase 1"" (16.03.2020-06.05.2020) and ""Corona - Phase 2"" (07.05.2020-31.07.2020) were collected and compared with the""pre-Covid-era"" (03.07.2019-15.03.2020). RESULTS: Data on 24,977 patients were evaluated; of these, 2493 patients in the Corona-Phase 1 and 5106 patients in the Corona-Phase 2 periods. Among these patients, 53% patients were older than 50, 30% older than 70 years. Normally 67.6 patients/day (p/d) visit the ED. This value decreased to 19.7 p/d in Phase 1 and 8.2 p/d in phase 2. 24% of the patients were referred by the GP, 56% presented themselves and 17% by the rescue service. Wo observed a decline of stroke cases by 52%, heart attacks by 61% and atrial fibrillation by 55% in Phase 1. The decline of cases mainly persisted in phase 2 (e. g. stroke 29%). CONCLUSIONS: Access to the ED decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak especially by patients who presented to the ED by themselves or referred by the GP - these were more than those brought into the ED by the rescue service. Based on literature and our own data, we suspect the lockdown restrictions could be responsible for the observed decrease of cases, too. In the context of the mild course of COVID-19 cases in Mecklenburg, these results are surprising. Further studies regarding whether and how the population used the ED should be performed.","Stöwhas, Mathias; Lippert, Hans",Gesundheitswesen,,409
376466,COVID-19 infection and glucocorticoids: update from the Italian Society of Endocrinology Expert Opinion on steroid replacement in adrenal insufficiency,2020,"It has been reported that frequent occurrence of COVID-19 infection in these patients is associated with low cytosolic pH. During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises. LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down. When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate. Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms. When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H+ ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic. Paradoxically, Na+/H+ exchanger activation takes place. While H+ ion is thrown out of the cell, Na+ and Ca+2 enter the cell. When Na+ and Ca+2 increase in the cell, the cells swell and die. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production. A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H+ symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained. Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE. Thus, Na+ and Ca+2 flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells. Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load.","Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,409

Physical activity level using ""International Physical Activity Questionnaire""; stress level, using ""Perceived Stress Scale-14""; fear level, using ""Fear of COVID-19 Scale""; sleep quality, using ""Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index""; and quality of life, using ""World Health Organization Quality of Life"" were evaluated.Results: Total physical activity level, vigorous physical activity level, and walking score of patients with asthma were lower than healthy individuals (p < 0.05). Sitting time of patients with asthma was higher than healthy individuals (p < 0.05). Subjective sleep quality, latency, duration, efficiency, sleeping medication use, and daytime dysfunction of both were similar (p > 0.05). Only sleep disturbance score of patients with asthma were higher than healthy individuals (p < 0.05). Quality of life, stress and fear levels of both were similar (p > 0.05).Conclusion: During pandemic, patients with asthma are more inactive than healthy individuals regardless of presence of a chronic disease, pandemic negatively affected stress, fear levels, sleep and quality of life. To minimize effects of restrictions and psychological burden caused by pandemic and to encourage patients with asthma to perform physical activities, conducting studies to control stress levels and increasing quality of life and sleep of all individuals are important.","Dasdemir, Kübra Ayse; Suner Keklik, Sinem",J Asthma,,409

However, recent decades have shown only limited progress in discovering novel extracellular matrix-protein-derived ligands for translational applications. Through motif analysis of evolutionarily conserved RGD-containing regions in laminin (LM) and peptide-functionalized hydrogel microarray screening, we identified a peptide (a1) that showed superior supports for endothelial cell (EC) functions. Mechanistic studies attributed the results to the capacity of a1 engaging both LM- and Fn-binding integrins. RNA sequencing of ECs in a1-functionalized hydrogels showed ~60% similarities with Matrigel in ""vasculature development"" gene ontology terms. Vasculogenesis assays revealed the capacity of a1-formulated hydrogels to improve EC network formation.

The model which is simple follows well-known premises in population dynamics. Our aim is to calculate an approximate estimate of the total number of infected persons during the course of the disease. The model predicted—to a high degree of correctness—the timing of the pandemic peak;the latter was foreseen by the model long before it was announced by the Egyptian authorities. The estimated values from the model were also found to match significantly with the nation reported data during the course of the disease.

384102,Coronavirus disease 2019: Challenges and practical solutions in the intensive care unit,2020,"Many animals rely on facial traits to recognize their kin; however, whether these traits have been selected specifically for this function remains unknown. Using deep learning for face recognition, we present the first evidence that interindividual facial resemblance has been selected to signal paternal kinship. Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) live in matrilineal societies, in which females spend their entire lives not only with maternal half-sisters (MHS) but also with paternal half-sisters (PHS). We show that PHS have more differentiated social relationships compared to nonkin, suggesting the existence of kin recognition mechanisms. We further demonstrate that facial resemblance increases with genetic relatedness. However, PHS resemble each other visually more than MHS do, despite both kin categories sharing similar degrees of genetic relatedness. This paternally derived facial resemblance among PHS indicates selection to facilitate kin recognition. This study also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to study phenotypic evolution.","Charpentier, M J E; Harté, M; Poirotte, C; de Bellefon, J Meric; Laubi, B; Kappeler, P M; Renoult, J P",Sci.

Within a year, several vaccines have been developed and millions of doses delivered. Reporting of adverse events is a critical postmarketing activity. METHODS: We report findings in 23 patients who presented with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 6 to 24 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca). On the basis of their clinical and laboratory features, we identify a novel underlying mechanism and address the therapeutic implications. RESULTS: In the absence of previous prothrombotic medical conditions, 22 patients presented with acute thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, primarily cerebral venous thrombosis, and 1 patient presented with isolated thrombocytopenia and a hemorrhagic phenotype. All the patients had low or normal fibrinogen levels and elevated d-dimer levels at presentation. No evidence of thrombophilia or causative precipitants was identified. Testing for antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) was positive in 22 patients (with 1 equivocal result) and negative in 1 patient. On the basis of the pathophysiological features observed in these patients, we recommend that treatment with platelet transfusions be avoided because of the risk of progression in thrombotic symptoms and that the administration of a nonheparin anticoagulant agent and intravenous immune globulin be considered for the first occurrence of these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remains critical for control of the Covid-19 pandemic. A pathogenic PF4-dependent syndrome, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, can occur after the administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Rapid identification of this rare syndrome is important because of the therapeutic implications.","Scully, Marie; Singh, Deepak; Lown, Robert; Poles, Anthony; Solomon, Tom; Levi, Marcel; Goldblatt, David; Kotoucek, Pavel; Thomas, William; Lester, William",N Engl J Med,,409

In our institute, a tertiary oncologic public hospital with high surgical volume, we prioritize maintaining cancer treatment as well as possible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if uro-oncological surgeries at pandemic are safe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent uro-oncological procedures. Epidemiological data, information on COVID-19 infection related to surgery and clinical characteristics of non-survival operative patients with COVID-19 infections were analyzed. RESULTS: From 213 patients analyzed, Covid-19 symptoms were noticed in 8 patients at preoperative process or at hospital admission postponing operation; 161 patients were submitted to elective surgery and 44 to emergency surgery. From patients submitted to elective surgeries, we had 1 patient with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 (0,6%), with mild symptoms and quick discharge. From the urgencies group, we had 6(13%)patients tested positive; 5 were taken to ICU with 4 deaths. CONCLUSION: Elective uro-oncological procedures at the COVID-19 epidemic period in a COVID-19-free Institute are safe, and patients who need urgent procedures, with a long period of hospitalization, need special care to avoid COVID-19 infection and its outcomes.","Silva, Gabriel Carvalho Dos Anjos; Abe, Daniel Kanda; Pedrenho, Rubens; Vilares, Rafael Nascimento; Cordeiro, Mauricio Dener; Coelho, Rafael Ferreira; Nahas, William Carlos",Int Braz J Urol,,409

The lack of vaccine and effective therapeutic agents for the disease prompted world-wide effort to test those antiviral therapeutics already in use for other diseases. Another interesting approach has been based on the pathological sequel of the disease that involve severe inflammatory reaction (or the cytokine storm) associated with pneumonia in critically ill patients. This article outlines the prophylaxis therapeutic potential of supplements vitamins and micronutrients in COVID-19.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the outcomes of critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to a network of hospitals in New Orleans, LA and is an evidence-based protocol for care associated with improved outcomes? STUDY DESIGN: and Methods: In this multi-center, retrospective, observational cohort study of intensive care units in four hospitals in New Orleans, LA, we collected data on adults admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 9, 2020 and April 14, 2020. The exposure of interest was admission to an ICU which implemented an evidence-based protocol for COVID-19 care. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days. RESULTS: The initial 147 patients admitted to any ICU and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 comprised the cohort for this study. In the entire network, exposure to an evidence-based protocol was associated with more ventilator-free days (25 days, 0 - 28) compared with non-protocolized ICUs (0 days, 0 - 23, p = 0.005), including in adjusted analyses (p = 0.02). Twenty patients (37%) admitted to protocolized ICUs died compared with 51 (56%, p = 0.02) in non-protocolized ICUs. Among 82 patients admitted to the academic safety net hospital's ICUs, the median number of ventilator-free days was 22 (IQR 0 - 27) and mortality rate was 39%. INTERPRETATION: Care of critically ill COVID-19 patients with an evidence-based protocol is associated with increased time alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation. In-hospital survival occurred in the majority of critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to an academic safety net hospital's ICUs despite a high rate of co-morbidities.","Janz, David R; Mackey, Scott; Patel, Nirav; Saccoccia, Beau P; St Romain, Michelle; Busack, Bethany; Lee, Hayoung; Phan, Lana; Vaughn, Jordan; Feinswog, David; Chan, Ryan; Auerbach, Lauren; Sausen, Nicholas; Grace, Joseph; Sackey, Marian; Das, Anushka; Gordon, Angellica O; Schwehm, Jennifer; McGoey, Robin; Happel, Kyle I; Kantrow, Stephen P",Chest,,409

392911,Digestive symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"INTRODUCTION: Ocular symptoms are uncommon manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Earlier study reported that dry eye, blurred vision, foreign body sensation, tearing, itching, conjunctival secretion, conjunctival congestion, ocular pain, and photophobia are among the ocular symptoms that could be found in COVID-19 patients. However, there are only a few reports available regarding corneal involvement in this disease. Here we report a case of keratoconjunctivitis as the only symptom of COVID-19 infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old man who worked as an obstetrics and gynecology resident came to the outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of eye discomfort, foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperemia, lacrimation, and photophobia in his right eye for the past 3 weeks. Fluorescence test showed a small corneal lesion. The patient was then diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis. A week after the treatment, all symptoms were resolved. A month later, the patient came to the emergency room with the same eye complaints but with a more severe pain. The fluorescence test showed wider corneal lesion compared to last month. The result from the corneal swab is negative for bacterial or fungal infection, indicating a viral infection. Afterwards, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test from nasopharyngeal swab was performed and revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This case report showed that keratoconjunctivitis may occur as the only manifestation of COVID-19 infection. Thus, patient presented with unexplainable eye symptoms should be evaluated for COVID-19 infection.","Hutama, Satria Audi; Alkaff, Firas Farisi; Intan, Ryan Enast; Maharani, Citra Dewi; Indriaswati, Luki; Zuhria, Ismi",Eur J Ophthalmol,,409

METHOD: Adjusted relative risks/hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the associations between BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, class 1 obesity, class 2 obesity, and class 3 obesity) and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or experiencing hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death among those testing positive. RESULTS: Higher BMI categories were associated with higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test compared with the normal weight category (class 3 obesity adjusted relative risk: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.28-1.42). Among 25,952 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, class 3 obesity was associated with higher risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.35-2.32) and mortality (aHR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.12-1.78) compared with normal weight individuals. These associations were present primarily in patients younger than 65 and were attenuated or absent in older age groups (interaction P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Veterans Affairs enrollees with higher BMI were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were more likely to be mechanically ventilated or die if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Higher BMI contributed relatively more to the risk of death in those younger than 65 years of age as compared with other age categories.","Eastment, McKenna C; Berry, Kristin; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; O039,; Hare, Ann; Crothers, Kristina; Dominitz, Jason A; Fan, Vincent S; Shah, Javeed A; Ioannou, George N",Obesity (Silver Spring),,409

In fact, social anxiety more than quadruples the risk of developing cannabis use disorder, yet it is inconsistently related to more cannabis use. Inconsistent findings may be due to lack of attention to protective behavioral strategies (PBS) among socially anxious cannabis users. PBS are cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce cannabis use and related problems. Yet socially anxious persons may be less likely to use PBS for a variety of reasons (e.g., fear of negative evaluation for engaging in behaviors to reduce use), leading to heavier or more frequent use and related problems. The current study examined the mediating role of PBS in the relationships of social anxiety with past-month cannabis use and related problems among current (past-month) cannabis users (Nâ¯=â¯102). Social anxiety was significantly positively related to past-month cannabis problems, but not directly related to cannabis use. Social anxiety was significantly negatively related to PBS. Social anxiety was indirectly (via PBS) related to more frequent use, greater peak use, and more cannabis problems. Serial mediation analyses indicated that social anxiety was indirectly related to more cannabis problems via the serial effects of PBS and cannabis use variables. Findings suggest that socially anxious persons may be vulnerable to heavier cannabis use and more cannabis problems due to PBS underutilization.

400728,Telemedicine comes of age during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): An international survey of oculoplastic surgeons,2020,"A patient-reported outcome (PRO) is a measurement of the patient’s condition, reported directly by the patient, without the interpretation by a clinician or anyone else [1] Recently, there has been a growing interest in the integration of PROs as part of data collection about toxicity and symptoms experienced by patients with cancer This integration could have relevant implications not only for a more accurate reporting of adverse events and definition of quality of life (QoL) within clinical trials [2], but also for a better patients’ management in routine clinical practice [3] Many tools and questionnaires have been validated to properly measure QoL and symptoms in patients with lung cancer The inclusion of these measures in clinical trials has several important advantages It allows providing a patient-focused assessment of the burden and the impact of disease Moreover, it allows completely assessing the clinical benefit of a therapy, by complementing the information provided by commonly used efficacy endpoints, including overall survival, and the traditional description of safety based on physicians’ assessment Furthermore, the availability of QoL data from trials could allow a more accurate patient-physician communication about the treatment strategies offered in clinical practice However, a systematic review that we performed in order to evaluate the adoption of QoL among endpoints in randomized phase III trials conducted in lung cancer, published between 2012 and 2018 in 11 major journals, showed quite disappointing findings [4] Beyond the importance in clinical trials, PROs can play an important role in clinical practice Several studies have demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of patients’ QoL [5,6] Our experience, focused on the adoption of PROs in patients receiving active anticancer treatment at Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, showed that the introduction of PROs, thanks to an active role of nurses, was feasible, produced high patients’ satisfaction and a significant QoL improvement compared to the traditional modality of visit [6] In details, we compared 2 groups: patients in the control group underwent “usual” visits, while patients in the “PRO” group received a paper questionnaire by a dedicated nurse before each visit, in order to provide information about symptoms and toxicities After 1 month, mean change from baseline of global QoL was significantly better in the PRO group, and significantly higher proportion of patients obtained a clinically significant improvement in global QoL score In addition to QoL benefit, several studies have shown a significant improvement in overall survival with the adoption of electronic PROs in patients with lung cancer [7-9] In a pivotal randomized trial involving US patients with different solid tumors (including lung cancer) undergoing chemotherapy, patients assigned to the control arm received usual care, while subjects assigned to experimental arm could report their symptoms remotely from home, using tablet computers or computer kiosks [5,7] Doctors received a report of symptoms referred by patients during visits, and nurses received email alerts when patients reported severe or worsening symptoms Beyond the QoL improvement (the primary endpoint of the trial), a significantly longer life expectancy in the experimental arm (median 31 2 months) compared to the usual care arm (26 0 months) was reported [7] A French randomized trial, conducted in lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after or during initial treatment, compared a web-mediated follow-up algorithm (experimental arm), based on weekly self-scored patient symptoms, with routine follow-up with CT scans scheduled every 3-6 months according to the disease stage (control arm) [8] In the experimental arm, the oncologist received automatically an alert email when self-scored symptoms matched predefined criteria Notably, a significant improvement in overall survival was found in patients assigned to experimental arm [9] The adoption of electronic PROs in clinical practice could have many advantages [10] Regular discussion of PROs questionnaires, filled out electronically by patients and received by nurses or doctors, could allow a systematic check of the clinical trend of symptoms and side-effects The early, proactive identification of worsening symptoms and toxicities could help prevent the occurrence of severe adverse events needing ER access and hospitalization Adoption and discussion of PROs would reasonably have a positive psychological impact on patients, increasing their satisfaction with healthcare services While the adoption of electronic PROs could initially appear as a challenging organizational effort, we believe that their benefits will definitely be evident in the long-term The use of PROs may allow a significant benefit in terms of patients’ QoL, and this should be more than enough to consider its adoption in clinical practice, which - overall survival benefit or not – is

The timely need to ensure the availability of healthcare facilities to isolate and manage the surge in COVID-19 cases without overwhelming existing hospital capacity has posed challenges in many countries. In this paper, we discuss the conceptualisation, preparations and operationalisation of a community healthcare facility that was set up within a short time frame to attend to the convalescent needs of a large number of COVID-19 patients in the early phase of handling the pandemic. In the first month of operations, we monitored a total of 2129 clinical encounters, with the majority of patients between 17-35 years of age and between day 2 to day 6 of illness upon admission. Overall, there was a good outcome for the patients, with only 2.3% requiring transfer back to restructured hospitals. There was also no mortality. We hope that the sharing of our experiences of the challenges and learning lessons gleaned may be useful to guide individuals in planning for the future preparedness of healthcare systems in managing pandemics.","Ong, Alvin Cong Wei; Wee, Clarice Li-Phing; Lee, Wei Lin; Goh, Lee Gan; Lim, Ghee Hian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,409

Coronavirus (CoV) is one of the severe pathogens that possess the RNA (ribonucleic acid) envelop, and extensively infect humans, birds, and other mammals. The novel strain ""SARS-CoV-2"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) causes deadly infection all over the world and presents a pandemic situation nowadays. The SARS-CoV-2 has 40 different strains that create a worrying situation for health authorities. The virus develops serious pneumonia in infected persons and causes severe damage to the lungs. There is no vaccine available for this virus up to present. To cure this type of infections by making vaccines and antiviral drugs is still a major challenge for researchers. Nanotechnology covering a multidisciplinary field may find the solution to this lethal infection. The interaction of nanomaterials and microorganisms is considered as a potential treatment method because the nanomaterials owe unique physicochemical properties. The aim of this review is to present an overview of previous and recent studies of nanomaterials against coronaviruses and to provide possible new strategies for upcoming research using the nanotechnology platform.","Muhammad, Wali; Zhai, Zihe; Gao, Changyou",Macromol Biosci,,409

401885,"A single-center, retrospective study of COVID-19 features in children: a descriptive investigation",2020,"BACKGROUND: There are currently rare satisfactory markers for predicting the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to establish a model based on the combination of serum cytokines and lymphocyte subsets for predicting the prognosis of the disease. METHODS: A total of 739 participants with COVID-19 were enrolled at Tongji Hospital from February to April 2020 and classified into fatal (n = 51) and survived (n = 688) groups according to the patient's outcome. Cytokine profile and lymphocyte subset analysis was performed simultaneously. RESULTS: The fatal patients exhibited a significant lower number of lymphocytes including B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells and remarkably higher concentrations of cytokines including interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; on admission compared with the survived subjects. A model based on the combination of interleukin-8 and the numbers of CD4+ T cells and NK cells showed a good performance in predicting the death of patients with COVID-19. When the threshold of 0.075 was used, the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model were 90.20% and 90.26%, respectively. Meanwhile, interleukin-8 was found to have a potential value in predicting the length of hospital stay until death. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of cytokines and decrease of lymphocyte subsets are found positively correlated with in-hospital death. A model based on the combination of three markers provides an attractive approach to predict the prognosis of COVID-19.","Luo, Ying; Mao, Liyan; Yuan, Xu; Xue, Ying; Lin, Qun; Tang, Guoxing; Song, Huijuan; Wang, Feng; Sun, Ziyong",J Clin Immunol,,409
402178,Managing Qt Prolongation In The Era Of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Simple SummaryKoreans consume more pork meat among the various meats, and as the consumption of pork meat increases, the amount of slaughtering is also increasing. Accordingly, the Korean government is sizing up and modernizing slaughterhouses to expedite the slaughter and to increase the safety of livestock products. The labor-intensive slaughter industry is undergoing major changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will speed up the automation of slaughterhouses. Various automation devices are also being introduced in Korea, and currently the Korean government is introducing a pork meat yield grading machine to increase the accuracy of judgments based on the increasing slaughter volume. However, because such equipment is quite expensive, it is not easy to introduce, and a detailed study on the utility of the related equipment and an economic feasibility analysis has not been conducted. Therefore, in this study, we tried to prove the validity of the introduction of the equipment through the effectiveness study and economic analysis of the automatic meat yield grading machine, and a plan to increase the economic effect was considered.AbstractCurrently, the pork industry is incorporating in-line automation with the aim of increasing the slaughtered pork carcass throughput while monitoring quality and safety. In Korea, 21 parameters (such as back-fat thickness and carcass weight) are used for quality grading of pork carcasses. Recently, the VCS2000 system—an automatic meat yield grading machine system—was introduced to enhance grading efficiency and therefore increase pork carcass production. The VCS2000 system is able to predict pork carcass yield based on image analysis. This study also conducted an economic analysis of the system using a cost—benefit analysis. The subsection items of the cost-benefit analysis considered were net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit/cost ratio (BC ratio), and each method was verified through sensitivity analysis. For our analysis, the benefits were grouped into three categories: the benefits of reducing labor costs, the benefits of improving meat yield production, and the benefits of reducing pig feed consumption through optimization. The cost-benefit analysis of the system resulted in an NPV of approximately 615.6 million Korean won, an IRR of 13.52%, and a B/C ratio of 1.65.","Kim, Juntae Hyo-Dong Han Wang Yeol Lee Collins Wakholi Lee Jayoung Youn-Bok Jeong Bae Jeong Hwan Byoung-Kwan Cho",Animals,,409

Sources and Data collection: A rigurous online search of CPG was accomplished among the main CPG compilers: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), National Guideline Clearinghouse, Agency for Healthcare, Research and Quality (AHRQ), Andalusian Health Technology Assessment Department (AETSA), American Academy of Family Physicians, Tripdatabase. Furthermore, because of the need to identify CPG that meet the inclusion criteria, a manual search, among the main national and international dental organizations as well as recognized web sites, was also accomplished. Selection of research studies: All of the guides focused on paediatric dental emergencies, available in the database and ""gray"" literature, and published between 2000 and 2020 (applicable to COVID-19 pandemic) were included without any language restrictions. The CPG that did not contain the full paper or were addressed to adults or children with special needs, were excluded from the selection. The evaluation of the CPG, independently included, were achieved by four (04) experts by using AGREE II. Results: Five (05) out of twenty-three (23) selected CPG, were classified as ""acceptable"" according to AGREE II. These five guides were evaluated to determine their ""Recommendation degree"". Only one (01) CPG ""Guía Clínica AUGE de Urgencias Odontológicas Ambulatorias-Chile, 2011"" reached a score of 75%, the highest among the other guides (5 domains with a score >= 60%, including the domain III ""Rigour of Development"") to be considered as a ""highly recommended"" CPG. Conclusions: According to the quality assessment and recommendation degrees criteria from AGREE II, high, middle and low quality CPG were identified. Only one CPG reached a score of 75%, to be classified as ""highly recommended"". Therefore, it is suggested that the existing CPG updates and future CPG use the available tools and methodologies during their elaboration, in order to guarantee their quality. Clinical significance: High quality CPG for the management of dental emergencies are designed to support dental health professionals in decision-making to adopt specific dental procedures in the current COVID-19 pandemic. As a matter of fact, these CPG might contribute to reduce the risk of transmission, in case of fresh outbreak of the illness. Likewise, they might help to determine which cases warrant medical attention in centres with special facilities for COVID-19.","Arieta-Miranda, Jessica; Alcaychahua, Abad Salcedo; Santos, Gary Pereda; Sevillano, Gustavo Chávez; Verástegui, Rosa Lara; Victorio, Daniel Blanco; Ramos, Gilmer Torres",Heliyon,,409

This is particularly relevant for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), that is the most common primary liver tumor, and it occurs in more than 90% of cases in the setting of cirrhosis. Methods: To address the increasing complexity of cancer care, multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTBs) have evolved to offer patients appropriate and tailored cancer treatments. In Sicily (Italy), MDTBs have been organized in a Regional Network, the Sicily Network for Liver Cancer, that answers to the need for an equal and fair access to cancer care, to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic appropriateness, to ease patients care, to improve the efficacy of cancer treatments, and finally to optimize the risk-cost-benefit ratio of therapies and follow-up. Results: It has been shown that multidisciplinary management is associated with significantly improved survival in patients with liver cancer. In this study, we present the aims, the organization, and the current and future activities of the Sicily Network for Liver Cancer, an integrated health care multidisciplinary network for the management of patients with primary liver tumors in Sicily. Conclusions: The coexistence of two diseases (HCC and cirrhosis) requires the expertise of many physicians to provide optimal care to patients with HCC. Treatment decisions should be discussed in multidisciplinary meetings, as no single treatment strategy can be applied to all patients, and treatment must be individualized to improve overall survival of patients with liver tumors.","Celsa, Ciro; Cabibbo, Giuseppe; Pagano, Duilio; di Marco, Vito; Cammà, Calogero; Gruttadauria, Salvatore","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",,409

The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease. In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication. Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis. Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification. The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification. It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.","Yang, Xiang-Hong; Sun, Ren-Hua; Zhao, Ming-Yan; Chen, Er-Zhen; Liu, Jiao; Wang, Hong-Liang; Yang, Rong-Li; Chen, De-Chang",,,409

In this study, blood samples of patients from Einstein Hospital in Brazil has collected and used for prediction on the severity level of Covid-19 with machine learning algorithms. The study was constructed in two stages; in stage-one, no preprocessing method has applied while in stage-two preprocessing has emphasized for achieving better prediction results. At the end of the study, 0.98 accuracy was obtained with the tuned Random Forest algorithm and several preprocessing methods.","Gök, Elif Ceren; Olgun, Mehmet Onur",Neural Comput Appl,,409

417690,Health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for obesity,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experienced prolonged interruption of their rehabilitation palliative care routines due to restrictive COVID-19 pandemic public health measures. This study assesses the effects of before and after the lockdown on functionality rates and quality of life (QoL) in patients with ALS. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was conducted. Participants were assessed three times - early January (T0), before mandatory lockdown (T1), and during lockdown (T2) - using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the ALS-Specific Quality of Life-Short Form (ALSSQOL-SF). The paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included with a mean age of 56.9 (SD 14.2) years and mean symptoms onset of 27.1 (SD 14.3) months. ALSFRS-R mean scores decayed significantly over time when comparing T0-T1 (0.26 ± 0.38) and T1-T2 (1.36 ± 1.43) slopes (p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed between T1 and T2 for ALSSQOL-SF scores (115.31 ± 17.06 vs. 104.31 ± 20.65), especially in four specific domains, and FSS scores (34.06 ± 16.84 vs. 40.09 ± 17.63). Negative correlations between negative emotions and physical symptoms assessed by ALSSQOL-SF and FSS were found. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS: Rehabilitation treatment routines in palliative care, such as physiotherapy and speech therapy, appear to mitigate the ALSFRS-R slope. Prolonged interruption of rehabilitation during the lockdown may have accelerated the functional decline in ALS patients' motor skills with as measured after 2 months by the ALSFRS-R in the limb and bulbar subscores, but not respiratory subscore. Other short-term effects, increased fatigue and negative impact on QoL, were also verified.","Gonçalves, Filipe; Magalhães, Bruno",Palliat Support Care,,409

418790,A snapshot of the prevalence of endocrine disorders in pregnancies complicated by coronavirus disease 2019: A narrative review with meta-analysis,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical schools to suspend on-campus live-sessions and shift to distance-learning (DL). This precipitous shift presented medical educators with a challenge, 'to create a ""simulacrum"" of the learning environment that students experience in classroom, in DL'. This requires the design of an adaptable and versatile DL-framework bearing in mind the theoretical underpinnings associated with DL. Additionally, effectiveness of such a DL-framework in content-delivery followed by its evaluation at the user-level, and in cognitive development needs to be pursued such that medical educators can be convinced to effectively adopt the framework in a competency-based medical programme. Main: In this study, we define a DL-framework that provides a 'simulacrum' of classroom experience. The framework's blueprint was designed amalgamating principles of: Garrison's community inquiry, Siemens' connectivism and Harasim's online-collaborative-learning;and improved using Anderson's DL-model. Effectiveness of the DL-framework in course delivery was demonstrated using the exemplar of fundamentals in epidemiology and biostatistics (FEB) course during COVID-19 lockdown. Virtual live-sessions integrated in the framework employed a blended-approach informed by instructional-design strategies of Gagne and Peyton. The efficiency of the framework was evaluated using first 2 levels of Kirkpatrick's framework. Of 60 students, 51 (85%) responded to the survey assessing perception towards DL (Kirkpatrick's Level 1). The survey-items, validated using exploratory factor analysis, were classified into 4-categories: computer expertise;DL-flexibility;DL-usefulness;and DL-satisfaction. The overall perception for the 4 categories, highlighted respondents' overall satisfaction with the framework. Scores for specific survey-items attested that the framework promoted collaborative-learning and student-autonomy. For, Kirkpatrick's Level 2 that is, cognitive-development, performance in FEB's summative-assessment of students experiencing DL was compared with students taught using traditional methods. Similar, mean-scores for both groups indicated that shift to DL didn't have an adverse effect on students' learning. Conclusion: In conclusion, we present here the design, implementation and evaluation of a DL-framework, which is an efficient pedagogical approach, pertinent for medical schools to adopt (elaborated using Bourdieu's Theory of Practice) to address students' learning trajectories during unprecedented times such as that during the COVID-19 pandemia.","Azar, A.

In this paper, we examine some of the major challenges that are being faced by teacher educators as they prepare for September 2020, struggling to re-imagine teaching and learning remotely. We also examine the issues facing teacher education using the lens of ‘complex adaptive systems’, systems that are unpredictable, have many interacting parts, and are characterised by constant uncertainty both from within and particularly from outside. Some issues affecting teacher education and teacher educators causing this uncertainty in Ontario include 1) access to effective online connection and support, 2) educator professional development for online learning, 3) conversion of face-to-face courses to successful online courses, and 4) the recognition of student teachers’ practica experiences. Although this article provides a snapshot of the Ontario context and the challenges it currently faces in teacher education, it also presents some solutions, and by thinking of the context as an example of a complex adaptive system, it also holds out hope for the future.","Van Nuland, Shirley; Mandzuk, David; Tucker Petrick, Krista; Cooper, Terri",J.

Partially governed on the hilt in hands of the authority, body of this sword is the prices of carbon emission right. How should the thermal power plants dance on the blade motivates this research. Considering the impact of price fluctuations of carbon emission right allowance, we investigate the operation of Chinese thermal power plant by modeling the decision-making with optimal stopping problem, which is established on the stochastic environment with carbon emission allowance price process simulated by geometric Brownian motion. Under the overall goal of maximizing the ultimate profitability, the optimal stopping indicates the timing of suspend or halt of production, hence the optimal stopping boundary curve implies the edge of life and death with regard to this enterprise. Applying this methodology, real cases of failure and survival of several Chinese representative thermal power plants were analyzed to explore the industry ecotope, which leads to the findings that: 1) The survival environment of existed thermal power plants becomes severer when facing more pressure from the newborn carbon-finance market. 2) Boundaries of survival environment is mainly drawn by the technical improvements for rising the utilization rate of carbon emission. Based on the same optimal stopping model, outlook of this industry is drawn with a demarcation surface defining the vivosphere of thermal power plants with different levels of profitability.

428514,Cardiovascular Considerations in Treating Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a protean clinical picture that can range from asymptomatic patients to life-threatening conditions. Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe pulmonary involvement and develop neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and strikingly elevated levels of IL-6. There is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia leading to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still's disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. Numerous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained inflammatory process. High levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. Iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. In addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic activity. Herein, we analyse the pathogenic role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion therapy as a novel therapeutic approach in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Perricone, Carlo; Bartoloni, Elena; Bursi, Roberto; Cafaro, Giacomo; Guidelli, Giacomo Maria; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Gerli, Roberto",Immunol Res,,409

Identifying vulnerable groups during the pandemic is essential for targeting psychological support, and in preparation for any second wave or future pandemic. Vulnerable groups are likely to vary across different societies; therefore, research needs to be conducted at a national and international level. This online survey explored generalized anxiety and depression symptoms in a community sample of adults (N = 1,039) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between April 8th and April 22nd, 2020. Respondents completed symptom measures of depression (PHQ8) and generalized anxiety (GAD7), along with psychosocial and demographic variables that might potentially influence such symptoms. Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for the main study variables. Levels of anxiety and depression were notably higher than those reported in previous (pre-pandemic) national studies. Similar variables were statistically significantly associated with both depression and anxiety, most notably younger age, being female, having a history of mental health problems, self or loved ones testing positive for COVID-19, and having high levels of COVID-related anxiety and economic threat. Sections of the UAE population experienced relatively high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic. Several COVID-related and psychosocial variables were associated with heightened symptomatology. Identifying such vulnerable groups can help inform the public mental health response to the current and future pandemics.","Thomas, Justin; Barbato, Mariapaola; Verlinden, Marina; Gaspar, Carl; Moussa, Mona; Ghorayeb, Jihane; Menon, Aaina; Figueiras, Maria J; Arora, Teresa; Bentall, Richard P",Front Psychiatry,,409

436672,Perspective: The Convergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Food Insecurity in the United States,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In patients with septic shock, low levels of circulating immunoglobulins are common and their kinetics appear to be related to clinical outcome. The pivotal role of immunoglobulins in the host immune response to infection suggests that additional therapy with polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins may be a promising option in patients with septic shock. Immunoglobulin preparations enriched with the IgM component have largely been used in sepsis, mostly at standard dosages (250 mg/kg per day), regardless of clinical severity and without any dose adjustment based on immunoglobulin serum titres or other biomarkers. We hypothesised that a personalised dose of IgM enriched preparation based on patient IgM titres and aimed to achieve a specific threshold of IgM titre is more effective in decreasing mortality than a standard dose. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a multicentre, interventional, randomised, single-blinded, prospective, investigator sponsored, two-armed study. Patients with septic shock and IgM titres <60 mg/dL will be randomly assigned to an IgM titre-based treatment or a standard treatment group in a ratio of 1:1. The study will involve 12 Italian intensive care units and 356 patients will be enrolled. Patients assigned to the IgM titre-based treatment will receive a personalised daily dose based on an IgM serum titre aimed at achieving serum titres above 100 mg/dL up to discontinuation of vasoactive drugs or day 7 after enrolment. Patients assigned to the IgM standard treatment group will receive IgM enriched preparation daily for three consecutive days at the standard dose of 250 mg/kg. The primary endpoint will be all-cause mortality at 28 days. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the coordinating centre (Comitato Etico dell'Area Vasta Emilia Nord) and collaborating centres. The results of the trial will be published within 12 months from the end of the study and the steering committee has the right to present them at public symposia and conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS: The trial protocol and information documents have received a favourable opinion from the Area Vasta Emilia Nord Ethical Committee on 12 September 2019. The trial protocol has been registered on EudraCT (2018-001613-33) on 18 April 2018 and on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04182737) on 2 December 2019.","Biagioni, Emanuela; Tosi, Martina; Berlot, Giorgio; Castiglione, Giacomo; Corona, Alberto; De Cristofaro, Maria Giovanna; Donati, Abele; Feltracco, Paolo; Forfori, Francesco; Fragranza, Fiorentino; Murino, Patrizia; Piazza, Ornella; Tullo, Livio; Grasselli, Giacomo; D039,; Amico, Roberto; Girardis, Massimo",BMJ Open,,409

438052,Public Health Emergency of International Concern: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"COVID-19 is continuing to ravage the globe. In many Western Countries, the populous has not embraced public health advice which has resulted in a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus. In the United States, there is an absence of a coordinated Federal response. Instead, frontline workers and average citizens are having to cope with extensive mixed messaging regarding mask usage and social distancing from the highest levels of government. This has resulted in the United States not being able to achieve a low level of infection since the pandemic began. In addition, many citizens hold a profound belief that individual freedoms must be preserved, even at the expense of public health; and view the wearing of masks as renouncing this right. These engrained political beliefs can be traced back to the late 1800s. The response of the United States has also been hampered by a highly cost-efficient healthcare system, which does not provide universal care and has a just-in-time supply chain, with far too few supplies in reserve. This efficiency prevented a rapid scaling up of the healthcare response, which resulted in severe deficiencies in available personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare staff. To compound issues many healthcare staff are not provided an economic or healthcare safety net. Other frontline workers, such as those who work in transportation and food services, are working under even greater adversities. Many of these workers are from diverse backgrounds, who, along with their families, are at even greater risk for COVID-19. This vulnerable population of frontline workers are faced with a choice of going to work with inadequate PPE or placing food on their families' table. In the United States, official recommendations seem to be ever changing, based more upon supply and test availability, than on science. We must rely on science and learn from the lessons of past pandemics or we will relive, even to a greater degree, the deaths and devastations experienced by our ancestors over 100 years ago.","Kavanagh, Kevin T; Pare, Judith; Pontus, Christine",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,,409

Multiple diagnostic tests are available without enough perspective on their reliability. Therefore, it is important to choose the most suitable test according to its sensitivity and specificity but also to the stage of the disease. Currently, the RT-PCR detection of the viral genome in respiratory samples is the most reliable test to confirm the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has to be done in Class II biological safety laboratory. However, it may lack sensitivity, particularly in the advanced phase of infection, and depends closely on the samples' quality. Rapid PCR by cartridge system reduces response times but is not suitable for laboratories with high throughput of requests. Detection of virus antigens on respiratory samples is a quick and easy to use technique; however it has not good specificity and sensitivity and cannot be used for diagnosis and patient management. The detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is better used for epidemiological analyses. Research should be encouraged to overcome the limits of the currently available diagnostic tests.","Thabet, Lamia; Mhalla, Salma; Naija, Habiba; Jaoua, Mohamed Amine; Hannachi, Naila; Fki-Berrajah, Lamia; Toumi, Adnene; Karray-Hakim, Héla",Tunis Med,,409

The exaggerated host immune response, incapable of viral clearance, instead aggravates respiratory distress, as well as cardiac, and/or damage to other organs. The mortality pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection, higher in older versus younger adults and almost absent in children, is possibly caused by the effects of age and pre-existing comorbidities on innate and adaptive immunity. Here, we speculate that the abnormal and excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection partly depends on T cell immunological memory, which is more pronounced in adults compared with children, and may significantly contribute to immunopathology and massive collateral damage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.","de Candia, Paola; Prattichizzo, Francesco; Garavelli, Silvia; Matarese, Giuseppe",Trends Immunol,,409

The cumulative numbers of cases and deaths, as of July 25th, 2021, recorded in the 33 areas of Montreal are modelled through a bivariate hierarchical Bayesian model using Poisson distributions. The Poisson means are decomposed in the log scale as the sums of fixed effects and latent effects. The areal median age, the educational level, and the number of beds in long-term care homes are included in the fixed effects. To explore the correlation between cases and deaths inside each area and across areas, three bivariate models are considered for the latent effects, namely an independent one, a conditional autoregressive model, and one that allows for both spatially structured and unstructured sources of variability. As the inclusion of spatial effects change some of the fixed effects, we extend the Spatial+ approach to a Bayesian areal set up to investigate the presence of spatial confounding. Results show that the cumulative totals of cases and deaths are negatively correlated inside and across the boroughs of Montreal. The covariates are not associated in a similar manner for the cases and deaths due to COVID-19.

To date, there is little information available on the impact of the interaction between these comorbidities in the risk of death by COVID-19. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the impact of the combinations of MetS components in overall survival (OS) and risk of death among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using public data of the Ministry of Health, suspected, and confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 25-June 6, 2020 was analyzed. Mortality odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a univariate analysis (95% CI) and attributable risk. Interactions between components and survival curves were analyzed and a multivariate logistics regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The analysis included 528,651 cases out of which 202,951 were confirmed for COVID-19. Probabilities of OS among confirmed patients were 0.93, 0.89, 0.87, 0.86, and 0.83 while the OR of multivariate analysis was 1.83 (1.77-1.89), 2.58 (2.48-2.69), 2.83 (2.66-3.01), and 3.36 (2.83-3.99) for zero, one, two, three, and four MetS components, respectively. The combination with the highest risk was DM2â¯+â¯hypertension at 2.22 (2.15-2.28), and the attributable risk for any component was 9.35% (9.21-9.49). Only the combination obesityâ¯+â¯CVD showed no significant interaction. CONCLUSION: The presence of one MetS component doubles the risk of death by COVID-19, which was higher among patients with DM2â¯+â¯hypertension. Only obesity and CVD do not interact significantly.","León-Pedroza, José Israel; Rodríguez-Cortés, Octavio; Flores-Mejía, Raúl; Gaona-Aguas, Cinthia Vianney; González-Chávez, Antonio",Arch. med. res,,409

In this work, we assess the 3D structure of the 5' untranslated region of its RNA, in the hopes that stable secondary structures can be targeted, interrupted, or otherwise measured. To this end, we have combined molecular dynamics simulations with previous Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements for stem loop 2 of SARS-CoV-1 to refine 3D structure predictions of that stem loop. We find that relatively short sampling times allow for loop rearrangement from predicted structures determined in absence of water or ions, to structures better aligned with experimental data. We then use molecular dynamics to predict the refined structure of the transcription regulatory leader sequence (TRS-L) region which includes stem loop 3, and show that arrangement of the loop around exchangeable monovalent potassium can interpret the conformational equilibrium determined by in-cell dimethyl sulfate (DMS) data.","Bergonzo, Christina; Szakal, Andrea L",,,409

We identify factors indicating COVID-19 positivity in non-hospitalized patients and prognosticators of moderate-to-severe disease. METHODS: Appeals conducted in April-June 2020 in social media, collaborating medical societies and patient advocacy groups recruited 20,476 participants &#8805;18 years who believed they had COVID-19 exposure. Volunteers consented on-line and reported height, weight, concomitant illnesses, medication and supplement use, residential, occupational or community COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and symptom severity on a 4-point scale. Of the 12,117 curated analytic population 2279 reported a COVID-19 viral test result: 865 positive (COVID+) and 1414 negative (COVID-). RESULTS: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever best distinguished COVID+ from COVID-participants (OR 6.07, 95% CI: 4.39 to 8.47). COVID + subjects with BMI&#8805;30, concomitant respiratory disorders or an organ transplant had increased risk of moderate-to- severe dyspnoea. Race and anti-autoimmunity medication did not affect moderate-to-severe dyspnea risk. CONCLUSIONS: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever differentiates COVID-19. Elevated risks of severe symptoms outside the hospital were most evident among the obese and those with pulmonary comorbidity.

457405,Fetal Transient Skin Edema in Two Pregnant Women With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"There is marked increase in the demand for online learning in nursing curriculums. However, online learning has been criticised for being detached and impersonal resulting in low levels of engagement. In a world that is rapidly shifting to online learning as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic creating quality online learning environments has become more pressing. The Community of Inquiry (COI) is a well-established model used to frame online environments in many disciplines including nursing. The COI model proposes that social, cognitive and teacher presences must exist in the online learning space for learning to occur. It is argued that social presence remains less understood despite being one of the essential elements. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to understand how facilitators and participants engage with and use a social presence in an online seminar. It is concluded that when facilitators include the use of a social presence in the design of the online learning space in-depth engagement with online content also increases. This can happen rapidly (less than an hour) and continue for several weeks. It is deduced that a social presence enhances a sense of realness among participants of online learning and through an increased sense realness engagement increases.","Waddington, Andrew; Porter, Shannon",Nurse Educ Pract,,409

This study aims to understand telehealth utilization for HIV care services in South Carolina (SC), identify barriers to telehealth during COVID-19, and investigate strategies to facilitate remote HIV care delivery. In-depth interviews with 11 management personnel from 8 HIV-related facilities in SC were analyzed using thematic analysis. Utilizations of telehealth were diverse in delivering medical and non-medical HIV care services. Barriers included technological challenges, digital literacy, client/provider experiences, low socio-economic status of client population, and reimbursement issues. Various strategies were mentioned for promoting telehealth utilization, from client empowerment, provider training to improved organizational readiness. For successful telehealth use during and after COVID-19, it is necessary to continue efforts to promote telehealth and remove barriers to telehealth by implementing inclusive multi-level strategies for non-technologically savvy or disadvantaged populations living with HIV.","Yelverton, Valerie; Qiao, Shan; Weissman, Sharon; Olatosi, Bankole; Li, Xiaoming",AIDS behav,,409

Texture analysis might be an additional tool for the evaluation of Chest X-ray in patients with clinical suspicion of Covid-19 related pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis and machine learning models for the diagnosis of Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia in Chest X-ray images. METHODS: Chest X-ray images were accessed from a publicly available repository (https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Lung areas were manually segmented using a polygonal regions of interest covering both lung areas, using MaZda, a freely available software for texture analysis. A total of 308 features per ROI was extracted. One hundred-ten Covid-19 Chest X-ray images were selected for the final analysis. RESULTS: Six models, namely NB, GLM, DL, GBT, ANN and PLS-DA were selected and ensembled. According to Youden's index, the Covid-19 Ensemble Machine Learning Score showing the highest Area Under the Curve (0.971±0.015) was 132.57. Assuming this cut-off the Ensemble model performance was estimated evaluating both true and false positive/negative, resulting in 91.8% accuracy with 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Moving the cut-off value to -100, although the accuracy resulted lower (90.6%), the Ensemble Machine Learning showed 100% sensitivity, with 80% specificity. CONCLUSION: Texture analysis of Chest X-ray images and machine learning algorithms may help in differentiating patients with Covid-19 pneumonia. Despite several limitations, this study can lay ground for future researches in this field and help developing more rapid and accurate screening tools for these patients.","Cavallo, Armando Ugo; Troisi, Jacopo; Forcina, Marco; Mari, Pier-Valerio; Forte, Valerio; Sperandio, Massimiliano; Pagano, Sergio; Cavallo, Pierpaolo; Floris, Roberto; Garaci, Francesco",,,409

Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from February 1st through May 12th, 2020 with study period ending on June 11th, 2020. Antecedent statin use was assessed using medication information available in the electronic medical record. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the propensity of receiving statins, adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and outpatient medications. The primary endpoint includes in-hospital mortality within 30 days. A total of 2626 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 951 (36.2%) were antecedent statin users. Among 1296 patients (648 statin users, 648 non-statin users) identified with 1:1 propensity-score matching, statin use is significantly associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in the propensity-matched cohort (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36-0.62, p < 0.001).

At the time of writing, changes to the structure and nature of the surgical workforce are occurring rapidly, even daily. Surgical educators are utilizing remote learning solutions, including flipped classroom approaches, online educational materials, telemedicine, and simulations, to continue education for surgical residents despite cancelations of face-to-face instruction. Our objective is to delineate an interdisciplinary strategy, utilizing the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), by which we can optimize learning during this pandemic. DESIGN: This perspective describes the UDL framework which can be used to situate solutions to issues with delivery of surgical education during this pandemic within the broader view of strategic inclusive instructional design to meet diverse learning needs.. CONCLUSION: The principles of UDL can inform curricular and pedagogical changes in surgical education that may be employed during a time of social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. UDL involves planning flexibility into curricular design from the outset, recognizing that learners are varied in their learning preferences and capabilities, motivational characteristics, and environmental constraints. Viewing the design of remote learning opportunities through the UDL lens aims to remove barriers to learning during this pandemic by targeting three areas: expansion of the means that information is communicated, ways that learners are supported and motivated, and approaches to assessing learning through available distance learning technologies.","Dickinson, Karen J; Gronseth, Susie L",J Surg Educ,,409

461606,Aesthetically Thriving through Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): An Evaluation of Patient Motivation and Perception on Aesthetic Surgery and Minimally Invasive Procedures,2021,"BACKGROUND: The assessment of spinal stiffness by manual palpation in clinical settings has demonstrated both poor accuracy and reliability. More recently, mechanical methods for assessment of spinal stiffness have demonstrated superior accuracy and reliability. However, mechanical methods of spinal stiffness assessment can be expensive, time consuming and/or unsuited to clinical practice. While a new device has been designed to address these issues (VerteTrack), its benchtop performance remains unknown. AIM: To measure the bench-top performance of VerteTrack. METHODS: A series of laboratory-based experiments were conducted in February 2018 to investigate the accuracy (precision and bias) of load and displacement measurements obtained by VerteTrack and then were compared against an appropriate reference standard. Measurements of both multiple-level continuous assessment (multiple spinal levels measured), and single-level assessment (single spinal level measured) were performed on a viscoelastic foam medium (AIREX® balance beam, Switzerland) and the resulting stiffness calculated. RESULTS: VerteTrack demonstrated high precision at all loads and displacements. There was minimal systematic measurement bias identified for applied versus reference load (mean bias = - 0.123 N; 95%CI - 0.182 to 0.428 N, p < .001), and no systematic measurement bias for measured versus reference displacement (mean difference = 0.02 mm; 95%CI - 0.09 to 0.14 mm, p < .001). The magnitude of stiffness obtained during multiple-level continuous assessment was on average 0.25 N/mm (2.79%) less than that for single-level assessment (95%CI - 0.67 to 0.17 N/mm, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: VerteTrack demonstrated high accuracy (high precision, low bias) under bench-top conditions. The difference in stiffness found between multiple versus single spinal levels should be considered in the research context, but is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The results of this study demonstrate that VerteTrack may be suitable for both single and multi-level spinal stiffness measurements in-vivo.","Young, Anika; Swain, Michael S; Kawchuk, Gregory N; Wong, Arnold Y L; Downie, Aron S",Chiropr Man Therap,,409

Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2017. Patients with BSIs caused by CR-GNB confirmed by in vitro susceptibility tests were enrolled, and patient medical record data on antimicrobial agents and microbiological and clinical outcomes were extracted. Results: A total of 175 individuals were included; 127 individuals (72.6%) received combination therapy (two or more antibiotics), while 48 individuals (27.4%) received monotherapy (single antibiotic). The all-cause 28-day mortality was 20.0%. Treatment success or presumed success rates were very similar between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups (58.3% versus 59.1%; P = 0.931). Combination therapy had a higher success rate trend than monotherapy in septic shock patients (40.7% versus 18.2%; P = 0.268). Improved therapeutic effects were observed in the active agent-containing group, although the differences were not significant. Conclusion: Combination therapy likely has better therapeutic effects on critical BSIs caused by CR-GNB than monotherapy. Choosing a proper active agent in an antimicrobial regime is relatively crucial to the ultimate treatment outcome.","Tan, Jiaying; Yu, Wenjin; Wu, Gang; Shen, Jun; Fang, Yong; Zhu, Hechen; Xiao, Qianyi; Peng, Weixia; Lan, Yukun; Gong, Ye",Infect Drug Resist,,409

As COVID-19-related infection and mortality rates in Devon and Cornwall were relatively low, however, urgent elective surgery continued in Plymouth, with the necessary precautions in place. This study aimed to assess outcomes following Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy (ILO) during the pandemic. METHODS: We prospectively analysed details of 20 consecutive patients who underwent ILO for cancer over a 3-month period between 17 March and 12 June 2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 swab testing 24-48 hours before surgery and during admission when clinically indicated. The primary outcome measure was COVID-19-related morbidity. Secondary outcome measures were non-COVID-19-related morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent ILO during the study period. All patients identified as white British. No patients tested positive for COVID-19 pre- or postoperatively. There was no COVID-19-related morbidity. There was no in-hospital mortality. Seven patients developed pneumonia, which settled with antibiotics. One patient developed an anastomotic leak, which was treated conservatively. One patient returned to theatre for a para-conduit hernia repair. The median length of hospital stay was nine days. One patient required admission to the high dependency unit for inotropic support for two days. CONCLUSIONS: ILO can be performed safely during the COVID-19 pandemic with the necessary precautions in place.","Chan, Dsy; MacCormick, A; Rashid, B; Ariyarathenam, A; Humphreys, L; Sanders, G; Wheatley, T; Berrisford, R",Ann.

This is why research into drugs to treat this infection remains essential in several research laboratories. Natural herbal remedies have long been the main, if not the only, remedy in the oral tradition for treating illnesses. Modern medicine has known its success thanks to traditional medicine, the effectiveness of which derives from medicinal plants. The objective of this study is to determine if the components of natural origin have an anti-viral effect and which can prevent humans from infection by this coronavirus using the most reliable method is molecular docking, which used to find the interaction between studied molecules and the protein, in our case we based on the inhibitor of Coronavirus (nCoV-2019) main protease. The results of molecular docking showed that among 67 molecules of natural origin, three molecules (Crocin, Digitoxigenin, and ß-Eudesmol) are proposed as inhibitors against the coronavirus based on the energy types of interaction between these molecules and studied protein.

In addition to the efforts to develop an effective vaccine, alternative approaches are essential to control this pandemic, which will most likely require multiple readily available solutions. Among them, monoclonal anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies have been isolated by multiple laboratories in record time facilitated by techniques that were first pioneered for HIV-1 antibody discovery. Here, we summarize how lessons learned from anti-HIV-1 antibody discovery have provided fundamental knowledge for the rapid development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RECENT FINDINGS: Research laboratories that successfully identified potent broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 have harnessed their antibody discovery techniques to isolate novel potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which have efficacy in animal models. These antibodies represent promising clinical candidates for treatment or prevention of COVID-19. SUMMARY: Passive transfer of antibodies is a promising approach when the elicitation of protective immune responses is difficult, as in the case of HIV-1 infection. Antibodies can also play a significant role in post-exposure prophylaxis, in high-risk populations that may not mount robust immune responses after vaccination, and in therapy. We provide a review of the recent approaches used for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery and upcoming challenges in the field.","Mendoza, Pilar; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Gaebler, Christian",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,,409

This report aims to inform about the changes in training volume and intensity distribution and their effects on functional performance due to a 7-week home-confinement period in professional road cyclists from a Union Cycliste Internationale Pro Team. METHODS: A total of 18 male professional cyclists (mean [SD] age = 24.9 [2.8] y, body mass = 66.5 [5.6] kg, maximal aerobic power = 449 [39] W; 6.8 [0.6] W/kg) were monitored during the 10 weeks before the lockdown (outdoor cycling) and the 7-week lockdown (indoor cycling turbo trainer). Data from the mean maximal power output (in watts per kilogram) produced during the best 5-minute and best 20-minute records and the training intensity distributions (weekly volumes at power-based training zones) were collected from WKO5 software. RESULTS: Total training volume decreased 33.9% during the lockdown (P < .01). Weekly volumes by standardized zones (Z1 to Z6) declined between 25.8% and 52.2% (effect size from 0.83 to 1.57), except for Z2 (P = .38). There were large reductions in best 5-minute and best 20-minute performance (effect size > 1.36; P < .001) with losses between 1% and 19% in all the cyclists. CONCLUSIONS: Total indoor volumes of 12 hours per week, with 6 hours per week at low intensity (Z1 and Z2) and 2 hours per week at high intensity over the threshold (Z5 and Z6), were insufficient to maintain performance in elite road cyclists during the COVID-19 lockdown. Such performance declines should be considered to enable a safe and effective return to competition.","Muriel, Xabier; Courel-Ibáñez, Javier; Cerezuela-Espejo, Victor; Pallarés, Jesús G",Int J Sports Physiol Perform,,409

473098,Coronavirus disease 2019: Affordable alternatives of household disinfectants for community,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and develop and internally validate a diagnostic risk score to predict risk of COVID-19 (including RT-PCR-negative COVID-19) among medical admissions. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two hospitals within an acute NHS Trust in London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to medical wards between 2 March and 3 May 2020. OUTCOMES: Main outcomes were diagnosis of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and mortality during hospital admission. For the diagnostic risk score, we report discrimination, calibration and diagnostic accuracy of the model and simplified risk score and internal validation. RESULTS: 4008 patients were admitted between 2 March and 3 May 2020. 1792 patients (44.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1391 were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and 283 had only negative RT-PCRs. Compared with a clinical reference standard, sensitivity of RT-PCR in hospital patients was 83.1% (95% CI 81.2%-84.8%). Broadly, patients with false-negative RT-PCR COVID-19 and those confirmed by positive PCR had similar demographic and clinical characteristics but lower risk of intensive care unit admission and lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27-0.61). A simple diagnostic risk score comprising of age, sex, ethnicity, cough, fever or shortness of breath, National Early Warning Score 2, C reactive protein and chest radiograph appearance had moderate discrimination (area under the receiver-operator curve 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.85), good calibration and was internally validated. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR-negative COVID-19 is common and is associated with lower mortality despite similar presentation. Diagnostic risk scores could potentially help triage patients requiring admission but need external validation.","Gupta-Wright, Ankur; Macleod, Colin Kenneth; Barrett, Jessica; Filson, Sarah Ann; Corrah, Tumena; Parris, Victoria; Sandhu, Gurjinder; Harris, Miriam; Tennant, Rachel; Vaid, Nidhi; Takata, Junko; Duraisingham, Sai; Gandy, Nemi; Chana, Harmeet; Whittington, Ashley; McGregor, Alastair; Papineni, Padmasayee",BMJ Open,,409

So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under state of the art care have not been systematically studied. METHODS: This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) ECMO support. Using multistate methodology, the estimated probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age &#8805;65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications-as judged by two independent reviewers-determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION: In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained very high. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.","Rieg, Siegbert; von Cube, Maja; Kalbhenn, Johannes; Utzolino, Stefan; Pernice, Katharina; Bechet, Lena; Baur, Johanna; Lang, Corinna N; Wagner, Dirk; Wolkewitz, Martin; Kern, Winfried V; Biever, Paul",PLoS One,,409

Patient was admitted to the hospital at 31 weeks of gestation with COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia. Anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial and immunomodulatory treatment was started. She received per os favipiravir 200 mg, azithromycin 500 mg, enfluvir 75 mg, plaquenil 200 mg, and ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously, piperacillin 4.5 g intravenously, methylprednisolone 40 mg intramuscular, enoxaparin 0.6 subcutaneously. The doses of insulin were changed. But maternal status became worse in several hours. Oxygen saturation dropped to 80%. Patient was intubated and connected to the artificial lung ventilator. The cesarean was performed. The preterm born baby with early neonatal sepsis diseased the next day. The treatment could not counteract an inflammatory storm. Despite intensive resuscitation, the woman diseased. The fatal case of COVID-19 was associated with coexisted gestational diabetes mellitus and late admission to the hospital. The COVID-19 patients with gestational diabetes mellitus are at higher risk of severe pneumonia, systemic inflammatory response and carbohydrate metabolism decompensation. Oxidative stress caused by bilateral pneumonia initiated the chain of tissue injury-related reactions. The fat tissue is an additional source of free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines. Progression of the proinflammatory scenario enhanced multiple organ failure. We have found signs of acute pulmonary, hepatic, and renal insufficiency. The unresponsiveness to treatment contributed to systemic inflammatory response and maternal deterioration.

However, Ce2O3 NPs have not been further investigated in the treatment of acute oxidative injury in vivo. It is meaningful to improve the efficiency for treatment of acute oxidative injury with NPs in vivo. In this report, we designed Er3+-doped Ce2O3 (Er/Ce2O3) NPs with a size of 7.9 nm, which were used to treat acute liver injury. Er/Ce2O3 NPs realized high-efficiency catalysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at room temperature. An acute liver damage model was established through intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in C57 mice. By analyzing histopathological and biochemical indexes, Er/Ce2O3 NPs showed a significant improvement in LPS-induced acute liver injury. Acute liver oxidative damage can be treated within 24 hours, which proved the high catalytic efficiency of Er/Ce2O3 NPs in vivo. The activities of SOD, GPx and CTA increased and production of ROS decreased with Er/Ce2O3 NP treatment in comparison with LPS-induced injury, indicating that the mechanism of Er/Ce2O3 NPs in the treatment of acute oxidative damage of liver was mainly via catalysis of ROS products. Moreover, the protein expression levels of TNF-&#945;, CD45 and IL-1ß in liver decreased in the Er/Ce2O3 NPs-treated group, which indicated that Er/Ce2O3 NPs have the function of anti-inflammation property. Therefore, Er/Ce2O3 NPs can be applied to treat and prevent diseases caused by acute oxidative damage.","Li, Yongmei; Li, Yuemei; Bai, Yandong; Lin, Laixiang; Sun, Yina",,,409

Objective: To develop a model of bacterial peritonitis for the evaluation of the treatments through laparotomy and through videolaparoscopy. Methods: Male Wistar rats were submitted to occlusion of the ceacum (CLP) on a rigid mold of 3mm diameter, followed by 14 punctures of the ceacum with a 15 x 10 needle. Six hours after the induction of peritonitis, the animals were treated by laparotomy or videolaparoscopy, while analysing blood cultures and the mortality rates. The treatment involved typhlectomy followed or no by peritoneal lavage with saline solution. Results: The mortality rate in one week, after CLP without treatment, was 90%. The blood cultures were positive in 80 to 100% of the animals after 3 hours, and in 60 to 80% after 24 hours, in the animals when treated with laparotomy without peritoneal lavage and in the animals treated through videolaparoscopy with or without peritoneal lavage. The mortality rate after laparotomy was 20%, whereas after videolaparoscopy it was 80%.

The pandemic has resulted in a number of recent cyberattacks on hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization and its partners, and others. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify key cybersecurity challenges, solutions adapted by the health sector, and areas of improvement needed to counteract the recent increases in cyberattacks (eg, phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks), which have been used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in technology and people introduced through changes to working practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted by searching two major scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) using the search formula ""(covid OR healthcare) AND cybersecurity."" Reports, news articles, and industry white papers were also included if they were related directly to previously published works, or if they were the only available sources at the time of writing. Only articles in English published in the last decade were included (ie, 2011-2020) in order to focus on current issues, challenges, and solutions. RESULTS: We identified 9 main challenges in cybersecurity, 11 key solutions that health care organizations adapted to address these challenges, and 4 key areas that need to be strengthened in terms of cybersecurity capacity in the health sector. We also found that the most prominent and significant methods of cyberattacks that occurred during the pandemic were related to phishing, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and malware. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified the most impactful methods of cyberattacks that targeted the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges in cybersecurity, solutions, and areas in need of improvement. We provided useful insights to the health sector on cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics that may materialize in the future.","He, Ying; Aliyu, Aliyu; Evans, Mark; Luo, Cunjin",J Med Internet Res,,409

Although it has been described more than 100 years ago, the literature is limited to small retrospective studies. This study aimed to follow patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that developed PM during hospitalization and describe their clinical and radiological evolution. METHODS: A prospective cohort was developed with patients with PM, excluding those with aerodigestive trauma, inside a hospital COVID-19 dedicated hospital. Clinical variables including onset of symptoms, hemodynamic instability, associated complications, the need of interventions, and disease course were all recorded. Also, radiological findings such as the presence of the Macklin effect, extension of lung involvement by COVID-19, and characteristics of the PM were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with non-traumatic PM were followed, resulting in an overall incidence of 0.5% during the study period. Seven (33%) patients had associated pneumothorax and malignant/tension PM was observed in three (14%) cases. The Macklin effect could be found in 11 patients (52%) and the majority of them had more than 50% of lung involvement due to COVID-19. The mortality rate was 49%; however, no deaths were directly related to the PM. CONCLUSIONS: PM incidence is probably increased in the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, especially in those with greater involvement of the lungs, and the Macklin effect may be an important underlying mechanism of this complication. Usually, PM has a benign course, but complications like tension/malignant PM may occur requiring prompt detection and intervention.","Brito, João; Gregório, Paulo; Mariani, Alessandro; D039,; ambrosio, Paula; Filho, Mauro; Ferreira, Lorena; Sawamura, Marcio; Pêgo-Fernandes, Paulo Manuel",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,,409

This study examines two databases to probe any correlation between protests and increases of COVID-19 case rates afterward. METHODS: A BLM protest aggregator and a county-level COVID-19 database were crosswalked, matching the city that the protest occurred in with the county and its case rates at 0, 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the index protest, and was compared with a control county in the same state with the nearest match of population size and case rate at Week 0. RESULTS: In the 22 days after the killing of George Floyd, there were 326 counties participating in 868 protests, attended by an estimated 757 077 protestors. The median case rate at Week 3 was 0.0049 in protest counties versus 0.0041 in control counties, which was found to be statistically significant. Regression analysis found that each individual protestor contributed to the case rate by 7.65 × 10-9, which was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Although the increase was statistically significant, it was very small in magnitude and likely due to limitations of significantly different population sizes in comparators.","Neyman, Gregory; Dalsey, William",J. public health (Oxf),,409

The CF dyes enable the expansion of flow cytometry reagent panels to support high dimensional flow cytometry analysis of the resulting emissions of 30 to 40 fluorescent colors, a record in flow cytometry. The CF dyes can be used along with existing flow cytometry dyes to provide a quick, accurate, and cost-effective method for the diagnosis and immunology treatment of diseases such as minimal residual disease (MRD) after cancer therapy.

With multiple vaccines having now received regulatory approval, public health efforts to promote widespread vaccine dissemination are currently underway. There has been particular emphasis placed on vaccination of older populations, the age group in which COVID-19 infection has been most lethal. However, such widespread vaccination approaches have necessarily raised important questions related to potential interactions with underlying diseases and concomitant treatments among persons to be vaccinated. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition marked by reduced bone strength and an associated increased risk for fracture that generally requires sustained medical intervention(s). Osteoporosis is neither associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection nor by more pronounced disease severity following infection, such that individuals with osteoporosis need not be more highly prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. Osteoporosis therapies do not interfere with the efficacy or side effect profiles of COVID-19 vaccines and should not be stopped or indefinitely delayed because of vaccination. Depending on the specific drug profile within an anti-osteoporosis medication category, minor adjustments to the timing of drug administration may be considered with respect to the patient's COVID-19 vaccination schedule. Herein we provide practical recommendations for the care of patients requiring treatment for osteoporosis in the setting of COVID-19 vaccination. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).","Tsourdi, Elena; Yu, Elaine W; Jan de Beur, Suzanne M; Drake, Matthew T",J. bone miner. res,,409

487888,Outcomes of novel coronavirus disease in patients with diabetes mellitus: A retrospective analysis,2021,"We analyse the economics and epidemiology of different scenarios for a phased restart of the UK economy. Our economic model is designed to address the unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption. We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects, and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare, and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.","Pichler, Anton; Pangallo, Marco; Rio-Chanona, R.

Among disorders emerging in the aftermath of a disaster, depression is the second most common. Aim: The current study was aimed to estimate the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) at two-time points in individuals who have been hospitalized for the treatment of COVID 19. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out from May 2020 to October 2020 at a tertiary care center among patients discharged after recovery from novel coronavirus (COVID 19). A diagnostic clinical interview was conducted to diagnose MDD, and its severity in patients who had recovered from COVID 19 using 'Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)' at the time of discharge and 1 month after their discharge from the hospital. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used for the analysis, P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 440 participants participated in the study. Out of them, 30.90% of participants met the criteria for MDD at the time of discharge and 19.5% at 1 month post-discharge. Participants who stayed for more than 14 days, were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and those with co-morbid medical illness had a higher prevalence of MDD. Conclusion: High prevalence of MDD was observed at the time of discharge among hospitalized participants. Longer duration of hospital stay and admission in ICU is associated with more unpleasant events, subsequently resulting in higher rates of morbidity, such as depression. © 2021 Archives of Mental Health ;Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Kaur, K.; Patel, V.

Her past medical history was significant for Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis that was previously managed with Adalimumab and switched to Ustekinumab 2 months beforesymptoms. Initial diagnostic workup showed 10% peripheral eosinophilia and a CT chest showed numerous 5 mm nodules scattered throughout the lungs along with some peripheral reticulations.Her BAL fluid analysis showed abnormally high eosinophil count (67%), greatly limiting her potential diagnoses to eosinophilic pneumonia, EGPA, and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE). AEP typically causes more severe disease with a rapid onset and there was low suspicion for TPE based on history, leaving EGPA and CEP.Based on her negative autoimmune serology, a negative biopsy of the nasal mucosa (no vasculitis/granulomata or eosinophils), and negative infectious workup, the patient was diagnosed with CEP secondary to Ustekinumab and the drug was stopped. She was started on high dose prednisone and after a prolonged taper over 5 months, her symptoms and nodules and reticulations on her CT scan resolved.DiscussionThis case exemplifies the importance of identifying drug-induced lung diseases which in many cases might not have a strong temporal association with the symptom onset. It also highlights that some drugs owing to their long elimination half-time can remain in the system for a prolonged period and continue to cause symptoms despite their cessation and require prolonged treatment and reassurance.ConclusionThe association of eosinophilic pneumonia with Ustekinumab, a drug used in the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, is rare and there is a paucity of literature regarding this association.","Kalra, Saminder Singh; Trillo, Cesar; Papierniak, Eric",J Asthma,,409

METHODS: The concordance between the cobas 8800 SARS-CoV-2 and a laboratory developed (LD) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was assessed on 377 combined nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs in Hanks medium. RESULTS: The positive and negative agreement between these assays were 99.3 % (95 % CI, 97.3-99.9) and 77.1 % (95 % CI, 67.7-84.4), respectively, for an overall agreement of 93.6 % (95 % CI, 90.7-95.7) beyond random chance (kappa of 0.82, 95 % CI, 0.75-0.85). Of the 22 samples positive by cobas SARS-CoV-2 only, 9 were positive only for ORF-1 gene and had Cycle thresholds (Ct) > 35.1, 8 were positive only for the E gene with Ct > 35.5 and 5 were positive for both targets with Ct > 33.9. Samples positive only with the cobas assay were more often positive with only one gene target (77.3 %) than samples positive in both assays (16.9 %, p < 0.0001). Ct values in the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay were significantly higher in the 279 samples testing positive in both assays (32.9 %, 95 % CI 32.3-33.6) compared to the 22 samples with discordant results (36.6 %, 95 % CI 36.2-37.1; p = 0.0009). An excellent correlation (r2 = 0.98) was obtained between Ct values of the ORF-1 and E targets in the cobas assays and a good correlation was obtained between LD RT-PCR test and cobas SARS CoV-2 ORF-1 target (r2 = 0.82). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated an excellent concordance between a LD RT-PCR and the cobas SARS-CoV-2 tests on the 8800 platform.","Boutin, Catherine-Audrey; Grandjean-Lapierre, Simon; Gagnon, Simon; Labbé, Annie-Claude; Charest, Hugues; Roger, Michel; Coutlée, François",J Clin Virol,,409

RESULTS: One-quarter of IPFs were in counties with high or very high COVID-19 vulnerability. On average, 84% of patients at IPFs were screened for influenza immunization status and were offered an immunization if indicated. Only 57% of patients had their records transmitted to another provider within 24 hours of discharge, and 50% had a follow-up visit with a mental health provider within 30 days. Scores on attainment of follow-up care were worse in counties with higher COVID-19 vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: IPFs may be well positioned to offer COVID-19 vaccinations but will need new processes and improved rates of follow-up care to ensure that patients receive the second dose.","Brown, Jonathan D; Bell, Nadia",Psychiatr Serv,,409

It is important to understand patient health-related behaviors and perceptions to guide public health vaccination strategies. OBJECTIVES: To examine perceptions of COVID-19 and vaccination beliefs, and identify predictors of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the US. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey guided by the Health Belief Model was conducted using a web-based Qualtrics survey panel of US adults. The main outcome was the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Additional measures included: demographics, perceptions of COVID-19 severity, risk and susceptibility, views of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, virus and vaccine information sources, vaccine beliefs and behaviors, and seasonal flu vaccine history. RESULTS: A total of 1047 complete responses were included. Females had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than males (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.80). Those with a two-year degree/some college had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those with a high school degree/GED (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36-0.97). Respondents who perceived the severity of the virus to be higher, perceived a greater COVID-19 vaccine benefit, and perceived greater general vaccine benefits had higher odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.09-1.91; AOR = 2.82, 95% CI: 2.24-3.56; AOR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.41-2.21, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine varied across demographics, perceived virus severity, COVID-19 vaccine and general vaccine beliefs. Successful implementation of a COVID-19 immunization strategy by healthcare providers and public health officials will need to incorporate diverse COVID-19 vaccination education strategies tailored to patients' health beliefs.","Coe, Antoinette B; Elliott, Marissa H; Gatewood, Sharon B S; Goode, Jean-Venable R; Moczygemba, Leticia R",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,409
494462,P.663 Stress and anxiety among healthcare workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Russia,2020,"Radiological image is currently adopted as the visual evidence for COVID-19 diagnosis in clinical. Using deep models to realize automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset (2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19 diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

on the use of computer models that evaluate the specific binding (energy minimization) of such drugs to target molecules that are important for the life cycle Thus, a few well-known antiviral drugs against HIV, hepatitis C and others selected on this basis exerted an antiviral effect in vitro, but their real effectiveness was far from expected It should be emphasized that the severe clinical

unlimited potential for COVID-19 therapy, the advantage of such compounds in their low toxicity In this review, we tried to focus on the clinical and pharmacological properties of natural substances, mainly flavonoids, which can become promising drugs for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 The review includes information on possible virus targets and antiviral drugs Much attention is paid to the question of inhibition of viral activity Based on published data, including structural features of various compounds, a prediction is made about the prospects of using these compounds as inhibitors of viral activity, as well as anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 An important step in the analysis of compounds was the study of the possibility of their interaction with cellular targets of the virus, as well as the ability to bind to the proteins of the Sars-CoV-2 virus itself Эпидемия, связанная с новым коронавирусом Sars-CoV-2, поразила практически все страны земного шара, и надежных лечебных средств от этой инфекции пока не существует Многие лаборатории в мире в настоящее время ведут интенсивные экспериментальные и теоретические исследования с целью поиска эффективных препаратов, специфичных для этого заболевания (COVID-19), но, к сожалению, может потребоваться много времени, прежде чем новые лекарства появятся в клинической практике Один из самых популярных подходов основан на возможности использования для лечения существующих препаратов, одобренных правительственными медицинскими организациями Их выбор основан на скрининге, в основе которого лежит использование компьютерных моделей, оценивающих специфическое связывание (минимизация энергии связывания) таких препаратов с молекулами-мишенями, важных для жизненного цикла Так, ряд известных антивирусных препаратов против ВИЧ, гепатита С, выбранных подобным образом, оказывали противовирусный эффект in vitro, но их клиническая эффективность была невысокой Следует подчеркнуть, что тяжелая форма клинического проявления заболевания представляет собой острый респираторный дистресс-синдром, опосредованный окислительным стрессом и агрессивной иммунной атакой на собственные клетки В этой связи применение соединений с высокой антиоксидантной активностью может иметь преимущества как в профилактическом, так и в лечебном плане Существует огромный спектр природных соединений, включая препараты официальной и традиционной медицины, которые представляют неограниченный потенциал, в том числе для терапии вирусных заболеваний Основным преимуществом подобных соединений является их низкая токсичность В данном обзоре мы постарались сделать акцент на клинические и фармакологические свойства природных веществ, преимущественно флавоноидов, которые могут стать перспективными препаратами для лечения и профилактики COVID-19 В обзор включена информация о возможных мишенях вируса и противовирусных препаратах Большое внимание уделено вопросу ингибирования вирусной активности На основе литературных данных, в том числе о структурных особенностях различных соединений, сделан прогноз о перспективности использования данных соединений в качестве ингибиторов вирусной активности, а также в качестве противовоспалительных средств для терапии COVID-19 Важным этапом при анализе соединений было изучение возможности их взаимодействия с клеточными мишенями вируса, а также способности связывания с белками самого вируса Sars-CoV-2","Andreev, Sergey M.; Shershakova, Nadezhda N.; Kozhikhova, Ksenia V.; Shatilov, Artyom A.; Timofeeva, Anastasiia V.; Turetskiy, Evgeny A.; Kudlay, Dmitry

Unfortunately, challenges to a robust oncology nursing workforce include nursing shortages, recruitment barriers (eg, perceptions of a demanding specialty with complex care and hazardous work environments), and burnout. Innovative recruitment strategies, onboarding and continuing education programmes, occupational safety measures, and burnout prevention interventions are documented solutions. The long-term effect of COVID-19 on oncology care worldwide is unknown, but immediate therapy interruptions, workforce consequences, and threats to standard oncology nursing practice are addressed here. Retention of experienced oncology nurses is crucial for future cancer control in all countries and must be addressed, particularly in resource-constrained countries with few oncology nursing staff and continuing out-migration of nurses to resource-rich countries. As the cancer burden worldwide increases, the future of the oncology nursing workforce is reflected in the call from the International Council of Nurses, Nursing Now, and WHO for nurses to move to higher levels of leadership, advocacy, and policy making (ie, national cancer control planning) and assume responsibility for their key role in achieving global goals for cancer control.","Challinor, Julia M; Alqudimat, Mohammad R; Teixeira, Tamara O A; Oldenmenger, Wendy H",Lancet Oncol,,409

This dreaded pandemic is responsible for escalated mortality rate across the globe and thus is the worst catastrophes in the history of mankind. Since its outbreak, substantial scientific explorations focusing on formulation of novel therapeutical and/or adjunct intervention against the disease are continuously in pipeline. However, till date no effective therapy has been approved and hence the present alarming situation urges the necessity of exploring novel, safe and efficient interventional strategies. Functionally, terpenoids are a class of secondary plant metabolites having multi facet chemical structures and are categorically documented to be the largest reservoir of bioactive constituents, predominant in nature. Intriguingly, very little is scientifically explored or reviewed in regards with the anti-CoV-2 attributes of terpenoids. The present article thus aims to revisit the antiviral efficacy of terpenoids by reviewing the current scientific literature and thereby provide an opinion on the plausibility of exploring them as potential therapeutical intervention to deal with ongoing CoV-2 pandemic.","Ahmad, Afza; Tiwari, Rohit Kumar; Ansari, Irfan Ahmad",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,,409

Here, we demonstrated that gut microbiome modulation attenuated emphysema development. To modulate the gut microbiome, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and diet modification were adopted in mice exposed to smoking and poly I:C for the emphysema model. We analyzed the severity of emphysema by the mean linear intercept (MLI) and apoptosis by the fluorescent TUNEL assay. Microbiome analysis was also performed in feces and fecal extracellular vesicles (EVs). The MLI was significantly increased with smoking exposure. FMT or a high-fiber diet (HFD) attenuated the increase. Weight loss, combined with smoking exposure, was not noted in mice with FMT. HFD significantly decreased macrophages and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Furthermore, IL-6 and IFN-Î³ were decreased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum. The TUNEL score was significantly lower in mice with FMT or HFD, suggesting decreased cell apoptosis. In the microbiome analysis, Bacteroidaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which are alleged to metabolize fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), increased at the family level with FMT and HFD. FMT and HFD attenuated emphysema development via local and systemic inhibition of inflammation and changes in gut microbiota composition, which could provide a new paradigm in COPD treatment.","Jang, Yoon Ok; Lee, Se Hee; Choi, Jong Jin; Kim, Do-Hyun; Choi, Je-Min; Kang, Min-Jong; Oh, Yeon-Mok; Park, Young-Jun; Shin, Yong; Lee, Sei Won",Exp. mol. med,,409

It was an ecological study utilising spatiotemporal analysis techniques that included all deaths confirmed by COVID-19 in Sergipe, from 2 April to 14 June 2020. Mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 inhabitants and the temporal trends were analysed using a segmented log-linear model. For spatial analysis, the Kernel estimator was used and the crude mortality rates were smoothed by the empirical Bayesian method. The space-time prospective scan statistics applied the Poisson's probability distribution model. There were 391 COVID-19 registered deaths, with the majority among â©¾60 years old (62%) and males (53%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes (31%) and cardiovascular disease (15%). An increasing mortality trend across the state was observed, with a higher increase in the countryside. An active spatiotemporal cluster of mortality comprising the metropolitan area and neighbouring cities was identified. The trend of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe was increasing and the spatial distribution of deaths was heterogeneous with progression towards the countryside. Therefore, the use of spatial analysis techniques may contribute to surveillance and control of COVID-19 pandemic.","Andrade, L A; Gomes, D S; Lima, S V M A; Duque, A M; Melo, M S; Góes, M A O; Ribeiro, C J N; Peixoto, M V S; Souza, C D F; Santos, A D",Epidemiol Infect,,409

This study aimed to investigate the medical care and management that provided or would provide for such newborns. METHODS: The web-survey was conducted between September and October 2020. A total of 624 hospitals, which generally accept pregnant women for delivery, were involved in this study. The survey included the number of newborns born to mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated the policies regarding the medical care and management of newborns born to mothers with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Pregnant women with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were accepted or planned to be accepted in 54% (334 hospitals). Out of 52 newborns born to mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, one newborn detected a SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the nasopharyngeal swab shortly after birth. The types of personal protective equipment during the delivery, the separation of the newborns from the mothers, the SARS-CoV-2 testing methods, and the use of incubators during the quarantine period were uniformly provided. However, the methods of ventilatory treatment in the event of respiratory disorders, feeding during maternal isolation, and de-quarantine and discharge criteria varied. CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrated that one newborn detected a SARS-CoV-2 RNA shortly after birth out of 52 newborns who were born to mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Inhaled dry powder is easy to administer and delivers antiviral agent directly to the primary site of infection, thereby minimizing systemic side effects. Here, spray freeze drying (SFD) technique is employed to formulate tamibarotene, a retinoid derivative with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, as inhalable powder. The SFD tamibarotene powder exhibits desirable physicochemical and aerodynamic properties for inhalation. Pulmonary delivery of tamibarotene powder results in rapid absorption and higher bioavailability compared with intraperitoneal injection of unformulated drug in animals. More importantly, inhalation or intranasal delivery of SFD tamibarotene formulation displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and pandemic 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1) in mouse and hamster models by targeting lower or upper airways, and the efficacy is comparable or superior to the commercially available antivirals remdesivir and zanamivir against specific virus.

PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO during the COVID-19 pandemic over eight most polluted Indian cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Kolkata, and Ahmedabad). A significant reduction in the PM2.5 (63%), PM10 (56%), NO2 (50%), SO2 (9%), and CO (59%) were observed over Major Dhyan Chand Stadium. At Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, a decline of 44% in PM2.5 and 50% in PM10 was seen just a week during the initial phase of the lockdown. Gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2 & CO) dropped up-to 36, 16, and 41%, respectively. The Air Quality Index (AQI) shows a dramatic change from 7% to 67% during observation at Chandigarh and Ballygunge during the inspection. Whereas, Ahmedabad, Worli, Income Tax Office, Talkatora, Lalbagh, and Ballygaunge have showed a significant change in AQI from 25.76% to 68.55%. However, Zoo Park, CST, Central School, and Victoria show relatively low variation in AQI in the range of 3.0% to 14.50% as compare to 2019 after lockdown. Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) analysis suggested that long range transportation of pollutants were also a part and parcel contributing to changes in AQI which were majorly coming from the regions of Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, as well as a regional grant from Indian Gangatic plains and Delhi Non-capital region.","Gautam, Alok Sagar; Kumar, Sanjeev; Gautam, Sneha; Anand, Aryan; Kumar, Ranjit; Joshi, Abhishek; Bauddh, Kuldeep; Singh, Karan",Asia Pac J Atmos Sci,,409

Findings: This report gives a brief awareness on the global public health transformation to digital platforms and understand the technical uses of artificial intelligence (AI). During COVID-19, use of Telemedicine has increased, as a tool that reaches patient’s home. In the current situation, where social distancing and quarantine have been adopted as effective method to reduce the spread of COVID, telemedicine and virtual software platforms gained more importance to provide health service. Conclusion: The findings show that telemedicine and virtual software will minimize emergency department visits, protect healthcare resources and reduce the spread of COVID-19 by remotely treating patients during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine has continued to increase in uptake and shows tremendous promise in expanding access to health care, promoting patient disease management, and facilitating in-between health care visit monitoring. Although the future is bright, more research is needed to determine optimal ways to integrate telemedicine, especially remote monitoringinto routine clinical care.","Nayak, P.; Purohit, A.; Shrivastava, A.; Samuel, M.; Harsh, J.; Singhi, R.",Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development,,409
521545,Need for Transparency and Reliable Evidence in Emergency Use Authorizations for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Therapies,2020,"To determine whether quaternary ammonium (k21) binds to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein via computational molecular docking simulations, the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain complexed with ACE-2 (PDB ID: 6LZG) was downloaded from RCSB PD and prepared using Schrodinger 2019-4. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 inside humans is through lung tissues with a pH of 7.38-7.42. A two-dimensional structure of k-21 was drawn using the 2D-sketcher of Maestro 12.2 and trimmed of C18 alkyl chains from all four arms with the assumption that the core moiety k-21 was without C18. The immunogenic potential of k21/QA was conducted using the C-ImmSim server for a position-specific scoring matrix analyzing the human host immune system response. Therapeutic probability was shown using prediction models with negative and positive control drugs. Negative scores show that the binding of a quaternary ammonium compound with the spike protein's binding site is favorable. The drug molecule has a large Root Mean Square Deviation fluctuation due to the less complex geometry of the drug molecule, which is suggestive of a profound impact on the regular geometry of a viral protein. There is high concentration of Immunoglobulin M/Immunoglobulin G, which is concomitant of virus reduction. The proposed drug formulation based on quaternary ammonium to characterize affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using simulation and computational immunological methods has shown promising findings.","Daood, Umer; Gopinath, Divya; Pichika, Malikarjuna Rao; Mak, Kit-Kay; Seow, Liang Lin",Molecules (Basel),,409
522453,Headache may not be linked with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"OBJECTIVES: Examine possible pooling strategies designed to expand SARS-CoV-2 serological testing capacity. METHODS: Negative pools were assessed to determine optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs, followed by spiking weak or strong positive samples to assess initial assay performance. Samples were then randomly subjected to pool and individual testing approaches. RESULTS: Single positive specimens consistently converted pools of 5, 10, or 20 into positive outcomes. However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes. Finally, examination of 150 samples configured into pools of 5, 10, 20 or 50 accurately predicted the presence of positive or negative specimens within each pool. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pooling strategies may allow expansion of serological testing capacity. While limitations exist, such strategies may aid in large-scale epidemiological screening or identification of optimal convalescent plasma donors.","Allen, J W L; Verkerke, H; Owens, J; Saeedi, B; Boyer, D; Shin, S; Roback, J D; Neish, A S; Stowell, S R",Transfus. clin. biol,,409

METHODS: The patients were divided into 2 groups: surfactant (n = 33) and control (n = 32). The subjects in the surfactant group received the inhaled surfactant at daily dose of 150-300 mg. The oxygenation parameters and several clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: On the 5 day of therapy, PaO2/FiO2 improved significantly in the surfactant group compared to the control group (184 (155-212) mmHg vs 150 (91-173) mmHg, p = 0.02). The inhaled surfactant significantly reduced the need for transfer of patients to intensive care units (24.2% vs 46.9%, p = 0.05) and invasive mechanical ventilation (18.2% vs 40.6%, p = 0.04).

We aim to identify risk factors specific to each state of COVID-19 progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection through death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 648,202 participants from the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-). We identified characteristics and 1,809 ICD code-based phenotypes from the electronic health record. We used logistic regression to examine the association of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, and prevalent phenotypes to the stages of COVID-19 disease progression: infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality (separate models for each). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of visit months and ICD codes, state infection rate and controlled for multiple testing using false discovery rate (&#8804;0.1). As of August 10, 2020, 5,929 individuals were SARS-CoV-2 positive and among those, 1,463 (25%) were hospitalized, 579 (10%) were in ICU, and 398 (7%) died. We observed a lower risk in women vs. men for ICU and mortality (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.48 (0.30-0.76) and 0.59 (0.31-1.15), respectively) and a higher risk in Black vs. Other race patients for hospitalization and ICU (OR (95%CI): 1.53 (1.32-1.77) and 1.63 (1.32-2.02), respectively).

Methods An observational interrupted time series of all patients admitted to an academic health system between March 15, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Given testing limitations from March 15 to April 24, all patients receiving a SARS-CoV-2 test were symptomatic. On April 24, testing was expanded to all ED admissions. The primary and secondary outcome was ED LOS and number needed to test (NNT) to obtain a positive, respectively. Results A total of 70,856 patients were cared for in the EDs during the seven month period. The testing change increased admission LOS by 1.89 hours (SE 0.25, 95% CI: 1.39, 2.38). The NNT was 2.5 patients and was highest yield on April 1, 2020 when the state positivity rate was 39.7%, however the NNT exceeded 170 patients by Sept 1, 2020 at which point the state positivity rate was 0.5%. Discussion While universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of ED admissions may meaningfully support mitigation and containment efforts, the clinical cost of testing all admissions amidst low community positivity is notable. In our system, universal ED SARS-CoV-2 testing was associated with a 24% increase in admission LOS alongside the detection of only one positive case every other day. Given the known harms and risks of ED boarding and crowding, solutions must be developed to support regular operational flow while balancing infection prevention needs.","Sangal, Rohit B.; Peaper, David R.; Rothenberg, Craig; Landry, Marie L.; Sussman, L.

However, NETs that is not properly regulated can propagate inflammation and thrombosis. It was recognized that viruses can induce NETs. As a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded (ds) RNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] is known to induce inflammation and thrombosis. However, whether and how poly(I:C) modulates NETs remains unclear. Here, we have demonstrated that poly(I:C) induced extracellular DNA traps in human neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner. Further, poly(I:C) or dsRNA virus elevated the levels of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and citrullinated histone H3, which are specific markers of NETs, in both neutrophil supernatants and mouse plasma. Interestingly, a potent peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitor, BB-CL-Amidine (BB-CLA) or PAD4 knockdown effectively prevented poly(I:C)-induced NETs formation and release. In addition, BB-CLA abrogated poly(I:C)-triggered neutrophil activation and infiltration, and vascular permeability in lungs. BB-CLA also attenuated poly(I:C)-induced thrombocytopenia in circulation, fibrin deposition and thrombus formation in tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that viral mimetic poly(I:C) may induce NETs-dependent inflammation and thrombosis through PAD4, and that inhibiting PAD4 may become a good strategy to protect against viral infection-caused inflammation/thrombosis-related pathological conditions of diseases.","Ai, Peng; Pan, Hao; Chen, Kui; Zheng, Jihang; Gao, Zimian; Jin, Ge",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.05.091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098313/,409

Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanic individuals in the United States using the most recent population-based data. An estimated 176,600 new cancer cases and 46,500 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanic individuals in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2021. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), Hispanic men and women had 25%-30% lower incidence (2014-2018) and mortality (2015-2019) rates for all cancers combined and lower rates for the most common cancers, although this gap is diminishing. For example, the colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rate ratio for Hispanic compared with NHW individuals narrowed from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.78) in 1995 to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.93) in 2018, reflecting delayed declines in CRC rates among Hispanic individuals in part because of slower uptake of screening. In contrast, Hispanic individuals have higher rates of infection-related cancers, including approximately two-fold higher incidence of liver and stomach cancer. Cervical cancer incidence is 32% higher among Hispanic women in the continental US and Hawaii and 78% higher among women in Puerto Rico compared to NHW women, yet is largely preventable through screening. Less access to care may be similarly reflected in the low prevalence of localized-stage breast cancer among Hispanic women, 59% versus 67% among NHW women. Evidence-based strategies for decreasing the cancer burden among the Hispanic population include the use of culturally appropriate lay health advisors and patient navigators and targeted, community-based intervention programs to facilitate access to screening and promote healthy behaviors.

Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3.

Understanding bubble phenomenon and dating the period of bubbles in real time can provide an early warning diagnosis for financial bubbles and help regulatory authorities to control it and maintain market order. The generalized sup ADF (GSADF) and backward sup ADF (BSADF) tests with flexible window width can effectively detect and date periodically collapsing bubbles in real time. Based on the financial present value model, this paper applies right-tail recursive ADF test to test multiple bubbles in China’s multi-level stock market. Unlike the other researches in China, the ratios of the real stock prices’ natural logarithm to the real dividends’ natural logarithm are used for our testing instead of stock price index. Empirical results show that there are 8 bubbles in the Main-Board Market, 6 bubbles in the Small and Medium Enterprises Board (SMEs), and 4 bubbles in the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM). These bubbles are liquidity-driven and presuppose a loose credit cycle, with the exception of bubbles in 2014–2015. The frequent emergence of bubbles in a short time indicates that China’s stock market is still emerging market. In addition, frequent fluctuations imply there is a serious “herd effect” and a lack of monitoring mechanism for bubble risk.

602084,Neuro-Ophthalmologic Complications of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020-11-25,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Understanding the unique features for HBV-induced HCC can shed new light on the unmet needs in its early diagnosis and effective therapy. During decades of chronic hepatitis B, hepatocytes undergoing repeated damage and regeneration accumulate genetic changes predisposing to HCC development. In addition to traditional mutations in viral and cellular oncogenes, HBV integration into the cell chromosomes is an alternative genetic change contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis. A striking male dominance in HBV-related HCC further highlights an interaction between androgen sex hormone and viral factors, which contributes to the gender difference via stimulating viral replication and activation of oncogenes preferentially in male patients. Meanwhile, a novel circulating tumor biomarker generated by HBV integration shows great potential for the early diagnosis of HCC. These unique HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenic mechanisms provide new insights for the future development of superior diagnosis and treatment strategies. ABSTRACT: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the important risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide, accounting for around 50% of cases. Chronic hepatitis B infection generates an inflammatory microenvironment, in which hepatocytes undergoing repeated cycles of damage and regeneration accumulate genetic mutations predisposing them to cancer. A striking male dominance in HBV-related HCC highlights the influence of sex hormones which interact with viral factors to influence carcinogenesis. HBV is also considered an oncogenic virus since its X and surface mutant proteins showed tumorigenic activity in mouse models. The other unique mechanism is the insertional mutagenesis by integration of HBV genome into hepatocyte chromosomes to activate oncogenes. HCC survival largely depends on tumor stages at diagnosis and effective treatment. However, early diagnosis by the conventional protein biomarkers achieves limited success. A new biomarker, the circulating virus–host chimera DNA from HBV integration sites in HCC, provides a liquid biopsy approach for monitoring the tumor load in the majority of HBV–HCC patients. To maximize the efficacy of new immunotherapies or molecular target therapies, it requires better classification of HCC based on the tumor microenvironment and specific carcinogenic pathways. An in-depth study may benefit both the diagnosis and treatment of HBV-related HCC.","Wang, Sheng-Han; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Chen, Pei-Jer",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13102454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070067/,409

Respiratory disorders, lymphopenia, cytokine cascades, and the immune responses provoked by this virus play a major and fundamental role in the severity of the symptoms and the immunogenicity which it causes. Owing to the decrease in the inflammatory responses' regulation in the immune system and the sudden increase in the secretion of cytokines, it seems that an investigation of inhibitory immune checkpoints can influence theories regarding this disease's treatment methods. Acquired cell-mediated immune defense's T-cells have a key major contribution in clearing viral infections thus reducing the severity of COVID-19's symptoms. The most important diagnostic feature in individuals with COVID-19 is lymphocyte depletion, most importantly, T-cells. Due to the induction of interferon-γ (INF-γ) production by neutrophils and monocytes, which are abundantly present in the peripheral blood of the individuals with COVID-19, the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints including, PD-1 (programmed death), PD-L1 and CTLA4 on the T-cells' surface is enhanced.

605198,Internet Addiction and Related Psychological Factors Among Children and Adolescents in China During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Epidemic,2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent a novel cellular mechanism of antimicrobial defense activity. Intravascular neutrophils produce extracellular web-like structures composed of chromatin, histones, and cytoplasmic granule proteins to attack and kill microbes. They may impact both pathogen and host; NETs correlate strongly with disseminated intravascular coagulation and mortality in critically ill humans. The mechanism was first discovered in human neutrophils in 2004. Presumptive heterophil extracellular traps (HETs) in a non-avian reptile species were first described in blood films of a gopher tortoise with systemic inflammation. OBJECTIVE: While prior reports are limited to blood film review and in vitro studies, this descriptive case series highlights the cytological identification of presumptive HETs in nine reptile patients. METHODS: Subjects included six gopher tortoises, one blood python (Python curtus), one Burmese python (P. bivittatus), and one desert king snake (Lampropeltis getula splendida). All six gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) had upper respiratory disease with bacterial etiology (including Helicobacter sp. and/or Mycoplasma sp.), and snakes had upper respiratory tract infection confirmed with serpentovirus (n = 2) or bacterial dermatitis (n = 1). RESULTS: Cytology samples with identified HETs included tissue imprints (n = 4), nasal discharge (n = 3), an oral swab (n = 1), and a fine needle aspirate of a skin lesion (n = 1). The identification of specific bacterial (n = 6) and/or viral pathogens (n = 2) was notable. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of presumptive HETs recognized in reptile cytology specimens, suggesting an active cellular process in vivo in response to systemic inflammation in non-avian reptiles, and contributing to further understanding of extracellular traps in these species.","Flanders, A.

In this comment, we review first evidence of individual and political changes made so far. Findings suggest that economies worldwide are not yet building back better. Against this background, we argue that a naïve opportunity narrative may even impair the progress of transitions towards environmental sustainability because it may render green recovery measures ineffective, costly, or infeasible. Based on these observations, we derive conditions for green recovery policies to succeed. They should consist of a policy mix combining well-targeted green subsidies with initiatives to price emissions and scrap environmentally harmful subsidies. Moreover, green recovery policies must be embedded into a narrative that avoids trading off environmental sustainability with other domains of sustainability—and rather highlights respective synergies that can be realized when recovering from the COVID-19 crisis.","Lehmann, Paul; de Brito, Mariana Madruga; Gawel, Erik; Groß, Matthias; Haase, Annegret; Lepenies, Robert; Otto, Danny; Schiller, Johannes; Strunz, Sebastian; Thrän, Daniela",Sustain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276827/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01003-z,409

However, pseudotyping systems that predominantly produce non-filamentous particles have frequently been used to prove this concept. Here, we report that GP-mediated entry of retroviral-, rhabdoviral and filoviral particles depends on CatB/CatL activity and that this effect is cell line-independent. Moreover, we show that the human cell line Calu-3, which expresses low amounts of CatL, is largely resistant to entry driven by diverse filovirus GPs. Finally, we demonstrate that Calu-3 cell entry mediated by certain filovirus GPs can be rescued upon directed expression of CatL or DC-SIGN. Our results identify Calu-3 cells as largely resistant to filovirus GP-driven entry and demonstrate that entry is limited at the stage of virion attachment and GP priming.","González-Hernández, Mariana; Müller, Andreas; Hoenen, Thomas; Hoffmann, Markus; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.03.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219300911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999160/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219300911,409

Although the vaccine is free, rollout might still be compromised by hesitancy or concerns about COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We conducted two online surveys of Australian adults in April (during national lockdown; convenience cross-sectional sample) and November (virtually no cases of COVID-19; nationally representative sample) 2020, prior to vaccine rollout. We asked about intentions to have a potential COVID-19 vaccine (If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, I will get it) and free-text responses (November only). Results: After adjustment for differences in sample demographics, the estimated proportion agreeing to a COVID-19 vaccine if it became available in April (n=1146) was 76.2%. In November (n=2034) this was estimated at 71.4% of the sample; additional analyses identified that the variation was driven by differences in perceived public health threat between April and November. Across both surveys, female gender, being younger, having inadequate health literacy and lower education were associated with reluctance to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Lower perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, belief that data on the efficacy of vaccines is largely made up, having lower confidence in government, and lower perception of COVID-19 as a public health threat, were also associated with reluctance to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The top three reasons for agreeing to vaccinate (November only) were to protect myself and others, moral responsibility, and having no reason not to get it. For those who were indifferent or disagreeing to vaccinate, safety concerns were the top reason, followed by indecision and lack of trust in the vaccine respectively. Conclusions: These findings highlight some factors related to willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine prior to one being available in Australia. Now that the vaccine is being offered, this study identifies key issues that can inform public health messaging to address vaccine hesitancy.","Dodd, R.

Design: Observational, retrospective (audit of medical records). Location: Urban Primary Care Center of Andalusia (Spain). Participants: Probable cases of SARS-CoV-2 (from 20/03/15 to 20/06/15) Principal measurements: Initial medical assessment (place and modality) and telephone follow-up (number of calls and duration). Sociodemographic variables (including family structure). Clinical course (symptoms, vulnerability, tests, hospital admission and outcome). Results: 301 patients (51.5±17.8 years; 23% vulnerable people; 17% non-nuclear family structure). First assessment in Primary Care by phone (59.8%) and face-to-face (25.2%). At the hospital emergency department (11%), patients were more frequently from non-nuclear families (p<0.05 Χ2) and more tests were carried out (p <0.05 Χ2) despite having similar symptoms. Vulnerable elderly patients needed home health care (p <0.01 ANOVA). 8.2± 4.4 follow-up phone calls were made per patient, for 17.1± 10.3 days. It increases after ≥2 face-to-face consultations (OR 4.8), the presence of alarm symptoms (OR 2.3) and age ≥45 years (OR 2.0). Few confirmatory tests were performed (19.3% antigenic, 13% serology). 15.3% hospital admissions (all assessed previously in Primary Care), with 6.3% severe cases and 2.3% death. Conclution: Population chose to be attended in Primary Care during the pandemic first wave, above all by phone. Telephone follow-up was well accepted and useful to select patients with serious complications. Initial medical assessment in the hospital emergency department was related to a lack of social support but not with greater clinical severity.","Pérez-Milena, Alejandro; Leyva-Alarcón, Ana; Barquero-Padilla, Raquel Mª; Peña-Arredondo, Melody; Navarrete-Espinosa, Cristóbal; Rosa-Garrido, Carmen",Aten Primaria,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0212656721001906; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0212656721001906?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aprim.2021.102156,409

We analyzed 185 commonly administered TCM recipes comprised of 210 herbs nationwide to reveal mechanistic insight. Eight out of the 10 most commonly used herbs showed anti-coronavirus potential by intersecting with COVID-19 targets. Intriguingly, 17 compounds from the 5 most commonly used herbs were revealed to have direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential by docking with the two core structures [CoV spike (S) glycoprotein (6SVB) and CoV 3CL hydrolase (6LU7)]. Seven reported COVID-19 drugs served as positive controls; among them, retionavir (-7.828 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-8.738 kcal/mol) performed best with 6VSB and 6LU7, respectively. The top candidate was madreselvin B (6SVB: -8.588 kcal/mol and 6LU7: -9.017 kcal/mol), an appreciable component of Flos Lonicerae. Eighty-six compounds from 22 unlisted herbs were further identified among 2,042 natural compounds, completing our arsenal for TCM formulations. The mechanisms have been implicated as multifactorial, including activation of immunoregulation (Th2, PPAR and IL10), suppression of acute inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-1α/β, TNF, COX2/1, etc.), enhancement of antioxidative activity (CAT and SOD1), and modulation of apoptosis (inhibited CASP3). It is of interest to understand the biological mechanisms of TCM recipes. We then analyzed 18 representative remedies based on molecular targets associated with 14 medical conditions over the disease course, e.g., pyrexia, coughing, asthenia, lymphopenia, cytokine storm, etc. The significant level of coherence (SLC) revealed, in part, the potential uses and properties of corresponding TCMs. Thus, herbal plants coordinate to combat COVID-19 in multiple dimensions, casting a light of hope before effective vaccines are developed.","Zhang, Yuejian; Li, Yibo; Wang, Xiting; Qu, Rendong; Li, Juan; Li, Tengteng; He, Tian; Wang, Zheyi; Liu, Yansong; Shao, Xiangming; Lu, Tao",Int J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173434/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.50260,409

One common theory is that the de-differentiation of topographic maps links to impairments in everyday behavior due to less precise functional map readouts. Here, we tested this theory by characterizing de-differentiated topographic maps in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of younger and older adults by means of ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging together with perceptual finger individuation and hand motor performance. Older adults’ SI maps showed similar amplitude and size to younger adults’ maps, but presented with less representational similarity between distant fingers. Larger population receptive field sizes in older adults’ maps did not correlate with behavior, whereas reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 related to worse finger individuation but better motor performance. Our data uncover the drawbacks of a simple de-differentiation model of topographic map function, and motivate the introduction of feature-based models of cortical reorganization.","Liu, Peng; Chrysidou, Anastasia; Doehler, Juliane; Hebart, Martin N; Wolbers, Thomas; Kuehn, Esther",eLife,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003108/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.60090,409

614938,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Home Quarantine Strategy Implementation Among Chinese Residents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021-09-14,"Abstract The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which was officially declared by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, some of which have been known to cause common colds. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation from person-to-person and aerosol/droplet transmission, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of COVID-19 patients but in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. Currently available data are also limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.","Kitajima, Masaaki; Ahmed, Warish; Bibby, Kyle; Carducci, Annalaura; Gerba, Charles P.; Hamilton, Kerry A.; Haramoto, Eiji; Rose, Joan B.",The Science of the total environment,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758929/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325936?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139076,409
614964,Challenges and cares to promote rational use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: a timely review,2020-04-12,"In its severe manifestation, COVID-19 compromises oxygenation in a manner that is refractory to maximal conventional support and requires escalation to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Maintaining ECMO support for extended durations requires a delicately balanced anticoagulation strategy to maintain circuit viability by preventing thrombus deposition, while avoiding excessive anticoagulation yielding hemorrhage; a task that is complicated in COVID-19 secondary to an inherent hypercoagulable state. Bivalirudin, a member of the direct thrombin inhibitor drug class, offers potential advantages during ECMO including to its ability to exert its effect by directly attaching to and inhibiting freely circulating and fibrin-bound thrombin. Herein, we report the successful use of an anticoagulation strategy employing the off-label use of a continuous infusion of bivalirudin in a case of severe hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 requiring VV-ECMO. Importantly, therapeutic anticoagulation intensity was rapidly achieved with stable pharmacokinetics and there was no need for any circuit interventions throughout the patient's 27 day ECMO course. In COVID-19, bivalirudin offers a potential option for maintaining systemic anticoagulation during ECMO in a manner that may mitigate the pro-thrombotic nature of the underlying pathophysiologic state.","Seelhammer, Troy G.; Rowse, Phillip; Yalamuri, Suraj",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32660924/; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2020.06.059; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053077020306017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053077020306017?v=s5,409
616073,Time Course of Evolving Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury: The “Shrinking Baby Lung”,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: The Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre (PTAC) was established as a part of the emergency response in Ontario, Canada to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Prior to 2003, data relating to inter-facility patient transfers were not collected in a systematic manner. Then, in an emergency setting, a comprehensive database with a complex data collection process was established. For the first time in Ontario, population-based data for patient movement between healthcare facilities for a population of twelve million are available. The PTAC database stores all patient transfer data in a large database. There are few population-based patient transfer databases and the PTAC database is believed to be the largest example to house this novel dataset. A patient transfer database has also never been validated. This paper presents the validation of the PTAC database. METHODS: A random sample of 100 patient inter-facility transfer records was compared to the corresponding institutional patient records from the sending healthcare facilities. Measures of agreement, including sensitivity, were calculated for the 12 common data variables. RESULTS: Of the 100 randomly selected patient transfer records, 95 (95%) of the corresponding institutional patient records were located. Data variables in the categories patient demographics, facility identification and timing of transfer and reason and urgency of transfer had strong agreement levels. The 10 most commonly used data variables had accuracy rates that ranged from 85.3% to 100% and error rates ranging from 0 to 12.6%. These same variables had sensitivity values ranging from 0.87 to 1.0. CONCLUSION: The very high level of agreement between institutional patient records and the PTAC data for fields compared in this study supports the validity of the PTAC database. For the first time, a population-based patient transfer database has been established. Although it was created during an emergency situation and data collection is dependent on front-line medical workers, the PTAC data has achieved a high level of validity, perhaps even higher than many purpose built databases created during non-emergency settings.","Robinson, Victoria A; MacDonald, Russell D; Manuel, Doug; Goel, Vivek",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17026763/,409

We aimed to explore whether the manner in which Saudi patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) manage their disease has changed during this unparalleled lockdown. METHODS: An online survey exploring the effect of lockdown on T1D outcomes was distributed among T1D patients residing in KSA during lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 1010 patients responded to the survey. Around 40% reported communicating with their physicians during lockdown. Age, level of education, residence, previous visits to diabetes education clinics, last HbA1c value, and average monthly income were all significantly associated with communication with the treating physician (p = 0.008, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Age, level of education, and average monthly income were significantly associated with experiencing severe hypoglycemia (p = 0.036, p = 0.03, and p < 0.001, respectively), while average monthly income and level of education were significantly associated with experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0039, respectively); during lockdown. Patients who communicated with their physicians reported lower rates of severe hypoglycemia compared to those who did not (25.2% vs 30.7%, respectively).

Poorly treated DFU leads to osteomyelitis, gangrene and limb amputation. There is an increased risk of mortality for the amputees and increased number of bacterial resistance in survived patients. Struggle on choice of the best antibiotic(s) for DFU is escalating. OBJECTIVES: To determine risk factors associated with mortality in patients with DFU. To investigate bacterial drug resistance in survived or deceased patients around amputation. METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective cohort study that involved all diabetic patients who had DFU or minor or major amputation at Hebron Governmental Hospital from 2013 to 2020. Antibiotic use and bacterial isolates along with culture and sensitivity test results were retrieved from patients’ profiles and laboratory records. Major outcome of study was survival rate around amputation. Patients who missed test results for FBS or HbAc1, or who had no wound culture were excluded. SPSS version 22 was used to analyze data. RESULTS: Eighty four subjects were included in this study, 64.8 ± 12.58 years old, 63.1% males who had diabetic foot ulcer, minor or major limb amputation between 2013 and 2020 at Hebron Governmental Hospital. Forty tow patients (50%) had diabetic foot ulcer, 28 patients (33.3%) had major limb amputation, and 14 patients (16.7%), succumbed to minor amputation. Average FBS was 292.8 ± 136.33 mg/dl and average HbA1C was 8.55 ± 1.89%. Mortality rate was 9.5%. Using the Chi square test, we found a significant relationship between mortality and type of isolated bacteria, p = 0.033 and between diabetic complications (nephropathy) and mortality, p = 0.033. There was a significant relationship between antibiotic use and mortality, p = 0.04, especially with metronidazole and colistin, if they were used around limb amputation.

617457,Perspective: The Convergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Food Insecurity in the United States,2020-09-24,"This study aims to examine the impact of periodontal disease in obesity on COVID-19 infection and associated outcomes. This retrospective longitudinal study included 58,897 UK Biobank participants tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and February 2021. Self-reported oral health indicators (bleeding gums, painful gums, and loose teeth) were used as surrogates for periodontal disease. Body fat levels were quantified by body mass index (BMI) and categorized as normal weight (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m(2)), and obese (≥30 kg/m(2)). Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to quantify risk of COVID-19 infection, hospital admission, and mortality, adjusted for participants’ demographics and covariates. Of 58,897 participants, 14,466 (24.6%) tested positive for COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 infection was higher for participants who were overweight (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.24) and obese (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.41) as compared with those of normal weight, but infection was not affected by periodontal disease. The hospital admission rate was 57% higher (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.97) in the obese group with periodontal disease than without periodontal disease, and admission rates increased with BMI category (normal weight, 4.4%; overweight, 6.8%; obese, 10.1%). Mortality rates also increased with BMI category (normal weight, 1.9%; overweight, 3.17%; obese, 4.5%). In addition, for participants with obesity, the mortality rate was much higher (hazard ratio, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.91 to 5.06) in participants with periodontal disease than those without. Obesity is associated with higher hospitalization and mortality rates, and periodontal disease may exacerbate this impact. The results could inform health providers, policy makers, and the general public of the importance to maintain good oral health through seamless provision of dental services and public oral health prevention initiatives.","Larvin, H.; Wilmott, S.; Kang, J.; Aggarwal, V.R.; Pavitt, S.; Wu, J.",J Dent Res,https://doi.org/10.1177/00220345211029638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34271846/,409

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among elementary and kindergarten school teachers in the area of Western Greece from June 2020 to August 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed via an internet-based link along with an invitation e-mail. Responses from 399 participants were retrieved. 139 (34.8%) had received the annual influenza vaccine in the season 2019-2020, whereas 215 (53.9%) stated that they would get it in the forthcoming season 2020-2021 (p < .001). 152 (38.1%) intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine when available. For COVID-19 vaccine factors that were independently associated with the intention to uptake included more than 15 years at work (p = .001), prior influenza vaccine uptake (p = .003), believing that COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory (p = .04) and that school teachers are a high-risk group for COVID-19 (p = .001). In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic appeared to have an impact on the intention of school teachers to get vaccinated for influenza. The low level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance intention among the teachers in our cohort warrants further attention. Public health interventions should aim to increase knowledge on both influenza and COVID-19 and prevention of them via immunization in this particular at-risk population.","Gkentzi, Despoina; Benetatou, Eleni; Karatza, Ageliki; Kanellopoulou, Aimilia; Fouzas, Sotirios; Lagadinou, Maria; Marangos, Markos; Dimitriou, Gabriel",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1945903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242115/,409

621338,"Clinical and radiologic features of the first cured Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient in Guangzhou City, China",2020-08-25,"The recent outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 virus has had a significant effect on human respiratory health around the world. The contagious disease infected a large proportion of the world population, resulting in long-term health issues and an excessive mortality rate. The SARS CoV-2 virus can spread as small aerosols and enters the respiratory systems through the oral (nose or mouth) airway. The SARS CoV-2 particle transport to the mouth–throat and upper airways is analyzed by the available literature. Due to the tiny size, the virus can travel to the terminal airways of the respiratory system and form a severe health hazard. There is a gap in the understanding of the SARS CoV-2 particle transport to the terminal airways. The present study investigated the SARS CoV-2 virus particle transport and deposition to the terminal airways in a complex 17-generation lung model. This first-ever study demonstrates how far SARS CoV-2 particles can travel in the respiratory system. ANSYS Fluent solver was used to simulate the virus particle transport during sleep and light and heavy activity conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that a higher percentage of the virus particles are trapped at the upper airways when sleeping and in a light activity condition. More virus particles have lung contact in the right lung than the left lung. A comprehensive lobe specific deposition and deposition concentration study was performed. The results of this study provide a precise knowledge of the SARs CoV-2 particle transport to the lower branches and could help the lung health risk assessment system.","Islam, Mohammad S.; Larpruenrudee, Puchanee; Paul, Akshoy Ranjan; Paul, Gunther; Gemci, Tevfik; Gu, Yuantong; Saha, Suvash C.",Phys Fluids (1994),https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0053351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149275/,409

Method Cross-sectional descriptive study. The population were healthcare professionals working in institutions caring for COVID-19 patients and also confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A questionnaire with sociodemographic, occupational and epidemiological variables was used. Descriptive and bivariate analysis was performed according to the nature of the variables. Results Twenty-two hundred and thirty questionnaires were analysed on a potential population of 41,239 (5.47%). The diagnosis was made based on a suspicious case (63.4%) and a probable case (12.3%). A study of contacts was carried out at 50.3%. The perception about the availability of protective measures as ""always/frequently"" were: FPP1 mask 57.3%, gloves 89.5%, soap 95% and hydroalcoholic solution 91.5%. In PPE, FPP2, FPP3 mask, goggles and disposable gowns at around 50%. The availability of protective measures, by field of work, presented significant differences. The average number of patients attended related to the performance of hand hygiene at moment 4 and the perception of performing it correctly at moments 4 and 5. Conclusions Preliminary data are presented, with variability in the response rate by Autonomous Region. Healthcare professionals infected by SARS-CoV-2 identified the management of the chain of infection transmission, the use and adequacy of protective equipment, as well as the effectiveness of handwashing as factors related to the transmission of the virus among professionals.","Moreno-Casbas, María Teresa; Abad-Corpa, Eva; Albornos-Muñoz, Laura; Casado-Ramírez, Elvira; Camacho-Bejarano, Rafaela; Cidoncha-Moreno, María Ángeles; Company-Sancho, María Consuelo; Esteban-Sepúlveda, Silvia; Feria-Raposo, Isabel; González-María, Esther; González-Pisano, Ana Covadonga; Iruzubieta-Barragán, Francisco Javier; Manuel Meijome Sánchez, Xosé; Jiménez, Daniel Muñoz; Orts-Cortés, María Isabel; Pinilla-Navas, Lorena; Rich-Ruiz, Manuel; Rodríguez-Baz, Pilar; Sánchez-López, Dolores; Clara Vidal Thomàs, M.",Enfermería Clínica (English Edition),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2445147920300503; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2445147920300503,409

This study developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method with the potential to detect a broad range of MNV. RT-LAMP, using a set of five primers containing mixed bases, obtained results under isothermal conditions at 62°C for 90min. Sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 50-fold less than that of two-step TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan RT-PCR). Diagnostic performance of RT-LAMP on RNA extracted from mouse fecal specimens was compared with TaqMan RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR. MNV was detected in 54 of 120 mouse fecal specimens by RT-LAMP, and RT-LAMP had an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 96.4% and 100% compared with TaqMan RT-PCR, and 94.7% and 100% compared with nested RT-PCR.

The robots and kit evaluated represent major commercially available methods that are capable of simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from respiratory specimens, and included platforms based on magnetic-bead technology (KingFisher mL, Biorobot EZ1, easyMAG, KingFisher Flex, and MagNA Pure Compact) or glass fiber filter technology (Biorobot MDX and the manual kit Allprep). All methods yielded extracts free of cross-contamination and RT-PCR inhibition. All automated systems recovered L. pneumophila and adenovirus DNA equivalently. However, the MagNA Pure protocol demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the S. pyogenes than other methods. The KingFisher mL and easyMAG protocols provided 1- to 3-log wider linearity and extracted 3- to 4-fold more RNA from the human influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus.

624424,Active smoking and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): the use of significance testing leads to an erroneous conclusion,2020-05-08,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the psychological status of patients and staff, and the implementation of preventative measures in hemodialysis centers in Guangdong province, China, during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire survey was carried out anonymously between March 28 and April 3, 2020. All of the 516 hemodialysis centers registered in Guangdong province were invited to participate in the survey. The questionnaires were designed to investigate the psychological status of hemodialysis patients and general staff members (doctors, nurses, technicians, and other staff), and to address the implementation of preventative measures for administrators (directors or head nurses) of the hemodialysis centers. RESULTS: A total of 1782 patients, 3400 staff, and 420 administrators voluntarily participated in this survey. Patients living in rural areas reported a higher incidence of severe anxiety compared to those living in other areas (in rural areas, towns, and cities, the incidence rate was 17.0%, 9.0%, and 8.9%, respectively, P < 0.001). Medical staff were less likely to worry about being infected than non-medical staff (13.1% vs 30.3%, respectively, P < 0.001). With respect to the implementation of preventative measures, hemodialysis centers in general hospitals outperformed stand-alone blood purification centers, while tertiary hospitals outperformed hospitals of other levels. However, restrictions regarding the admission of non-resident patients were lower in tertiary hospitals than in other hospitals. In this situation, only one patient imported from Hubei province was diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 did not significantly affect the psychological status of most patients and medical staff members. Due to the implementation of comprehensive preventative measures, there were no cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers. This provincial-level survey may provide referential guidance for other countries and regions that are experiencing a similar pandemic.","Chen, Yuanhan; Wu, Yanhua; Hu, Penghua; Fu, Xia; Liu, Shuangxin; Song, Li; Dong, Wei; Yu, Xueqing; Liang, Xinling",Int Urol Nephrol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-021-02875-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195909/,409

626986,Peripheral oxygen saturation to inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio-based identification of critically ill coronavirus disease patients for early therapeutic interventions,2021-08-15,"Summary The unprecedented pandemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in China and beyond has had major public health impacts on a global scale [1,2]. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 [3], the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur naturally in animal betacoronaviruses.","Zhou, Hong; Chen, Xing; Hu, Tao; Li, Juan; Song, Hao; Liu, Yanran; Wang, Peihan; Liu, Di; Yang, Jing; Holmes, Edward C.; Hughes, Alice C.; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Weifeng",Curr Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096098222030662X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416074/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098222030662X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.05.023,409

In order to determine the cis-acting sequences necessary for RNA replication, encapsidation, and budding and to approximate the minimal size of RNA that can be packaged into infectious particles, we constructed a series of internal deletions in the DI cDNA to generate plasmids that could be transcribed to yield RNAs which ranged in size from 2209 nucleotides down to 102 nucleotides. All the deletion plasmids retained at least 36 nucleotides from the 5′-terminus and 51 nucleotides from the 3′-terminus of the DI genome. In cells expressing the five VSV proteins, the deleted DI RNAs were examined for their ability to be encapsidated, to replicate, and to bud to produce infectious DI particles. An RNA as small as 191 nucleotides, which contained 46 nucleotides from the 5′-end and 145 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the DI genome was encapsidated, replicated, and budded at least as efficiently as the full-length wild-type DI RNA. In contrast, a 102-nucleotide RNA that contained only the 51 nucleotides from the 5′-end of the DI RNA and its perfect 51-nucleotide complement at the 3′-end replicated poorly and failed to bud infectious DI particles. However, an RNA with an insertion of 1499-nucleotide “stuffer” sequences of non-VSV origin between the two 51-nucleotide complementary termini not only replicated but also budded infectious particles. These data show that the signals necessary for RNA encapsidation, replication, and packaging into infectious DI particles are contained within the 5′-terminal 36 nucleotides and the 3′-terminal 51 nucleotides of the DI RNA genome. Furthermore, the results show that a heterologous sequence can be replicated and packaged into infectious particles if it is flanked by the DI RNA termini.","Pattnaik, Asit K.; Ball, L.

METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational survey and audit of medical doctors at a tertiary health service in Queensland. The Research Capacity and Culture (RCC) validated survey was used to measure self-reported research capacity/culture at organisation, team and individual levels, and presence of barriers and facilitators to research. An audit of publications and ethically approved research projects was used to determine research activity. RESULTS: Approximately, 10% of medical doctors completed the survey (n= 124). Overall, median scores on the RCC were 5 out of 10 for organisational level, 5.5 for specialty level, and 6 for individual level capacity and culture; however, specialty-level scores varied significantly between specialty groups (range 3.1–7.8). Over 80% of participants reported lack of time and other work roles taking priority as barriers to research. One project was commenced per year for every 12.5 doctors employed in the health service, and one article was published for every 7.5. There was a positive association between a team’s number of publications and projects and their self-reported research capacity and culture on the RCC. This association was stronger for publications. CONCLUSION: Health service research capacity building interventions may need a tailored approach for different specialty teams to accommodate for varying baselines of capacity and activity.

632441,Giant Retroperitoneal Hematoma during Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in a Patient with 2019-Coronavirus Pneumonia,2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND: Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY; eg, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth) are at greater risk than their cisgender heterosexual peers for adolescent relationship abuse (ARA; physical, sexual, or psychological abuse in a romantic relationship). However, there is a dearth of efficacious interventions for reducing ARA among SGMY. To address this intervention gap, we designed a novel web-based methodology leveraging the field of human-centered design to generate multiple ARA intervention concepts with SGMY. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe study procedures for a pilot study to rigorously test the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of using web-based human-centered design methods with SGMY to create novel, stakeholder-driven ARA intervention concepts. METHODS: We are conducting a longitudinal, web-based human-centered design study with 45-60 SGMY (aged between 14 and 18 years) recruited via social media from across the United States. Using MURAL (a collaborative, visual web-based workspace) and Zoom (a videoconferencing platform), the SGMY will participate in four group-based sessions (1.5 hours each). In session 1, the SGMY will use rose-thorn-bud to individually document their ideas about healthy and unhealthy relationship characteristics and then use affinity clustering as a group to categorize their self-reported ideas based on similarities and differences. In session 2, the SGMY will use rose-thorn-bud to individually critique a universal evidence-based intervention to reduce ARA and affinity clustering to aggregate their ideas as a group. In session 3, the SGMY will use a creative matrix to generate intervention ideas for reducing ARA among them and force-rank the intervention ideas based on their potential ease of implementation and potential impact using an importance-difficulty matrix. In session 4, the SGMY will generate and refine intervention concepts (from session 3 ideations) to reduce ARA using round robin (for rapid iteration) and concept poster (for fleshing out ideas more fully). We will use content analyses to document the intervention concepts. In a follow-up survey, the SGMY will complete validated measures about the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the web-based human-centered design methods (a priori benchmarks for success: means >3.75 on each 5-point scale). RESULTS: This study was funded in February 2020. Data collection began in August 2020 and will be completed by April 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Through rigorous testing of the feasibility of our web-based human-centered design methodology, our study may help demonstrate the use of human-centered design methods to engage harder-to-reach stakeholders and actively involve them in the co-creation of relevant interventions. Successful completion of this project also has the potential to catalyze intervention research to address ARA inequities for SGMY. Finally, our approach may be transferable to other populations and health topics, thereby advancing prevention science and health equity.

The development of transgenesis has created new directions in research and possibilities for its practical application. Generating transgenic animal species is not only aimed towards accelerating traditional breeding programs and improving animal health and the quality of animal products for consumption but can also be used in biomedicine. Animal studies are conducted to develop models used in gene function and regulation research and the genetic determinants of certain human diseases. Another direction of research, described in this review, focuses on the use of transgenic animals as a source of high-quality biopharmaceuticals, such as recombinant proteins. The further aspect discussed is the use of genetically modified animals as a source of cells, tissues, and organs for transplantation into human recipients, i.e., xenotransplantation. Numerous studies have shown that the pig (Sus scrofa domestica) is the most suitable species both as a research model for human diseases and as an optimal organ donor for xenotransplantation. Short pregnancy, short generation interval, and high litter size make the production of transgenic pigs less time-consuming in comparison with other livestock species This review describes genetically modified pigs used for biomedical research and the future challenges and perspectives for the use of the swine animal models.","Hryhorowicz, Magdalena; Lipiński, Daniel; Hryhorowicz, Szymon; Nowak-Terpiłowska, Agnieszka; Ryczek, Natalia; Zeyland, Joanna",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11060670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32575461/,409
634071,Prolonged sedentary time under the state of emergency during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019: Assessing the impact of work environment in Japan,2021-08-04,"Background. Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6–24.0]), or 23–24 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3–4 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27–29, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26713252/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1505,409
635081,Advanced Research and Development of Face Masks and Respirators Pre and Post the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Critical Review,2021-06-18,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of obesity is rising in Japan and represents a considerable unmet medical need. The Awareness, Care and Treatment in Obesity MaNagement – International Observation (ACTION‐IO) study was designed to identify the perceptions, attitudes and barriers to obesity care among people with obesity (PwO) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online, cross‐sectional survey was carried out in 11 countries, including Japan. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 2,001 PwO and 302 HCPs in Japan. Fewer PwO (58%) than HCPs (85%) perceived obesity as a chronic disease. Most PwO (81%) thought that weight loss was their own responsibility, and waited a considerable time before seeking support from their HCP (mean 6 years). Most PwO (64%) had made one or more serious weight loss attempt in the past. In contrast, a serious attempt at losing weight was reported by HCPs for just 21% of their patients. Just 24% of PwO had weight discussions with an HCP in the past 5 years; of those, 56% expressed positive feelings after such a conversation, and just 2% felt offended. Lack of patient motivation (68%) and patient disinterest (61%) were reported by HCPs as barriers to weight management conversations. A higher proportion of obesity specialists (37%) than non‐specialists (22%) thought their patients were motivated to lose weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our Japanese dataset shows a need to raise awareness of the pathophysiological basis and clinical management of obesity among PwO and HCPs. The largely positive feelings expressed by PwO after weight loss conversations should encourage HCPs to initiate earlier discussions before obesity‐related complications occur.","Iwabu, Masato; Yamauchi, Toshimasa; Shimomura, Iichiro; Eguchi, Kosei; Ogawa, Yoshihiro",J Diabetes Investig,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdi.13427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021048/,409
635591,The effects of N95 mask and face shield on speech perception among healthcare workers in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic scenario,2020-09-28,"The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak has created interest in personal protective equipment (PPE) content and usage. PPE testing has historically been done by individual component, rather than as a bundle for contact isolation. Fluorescent agents are commonly used in training for infection control techniques. The purpose of our study was to compare 2 PPE bundles and to evaluate the feasibility of fluorescent markers as an assessment tool for PPE effectiveness. Eight healthcare providers volunteered for this preliminary study. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 PPE bundles that meet current (October 20, 2014) CDC recommendations. One PPE bundle utilized commercial EVD-recommended components. The other PPE bundle used components already available at local hospitals or retail stores. Participants were also randomized to standard or high volume exposures (HVE) to simulate fluid splash. Each participant was assisted in PPE donning and doffing by an experienced trainer. A training mannequin was contaminated with fluorescent agents to simulate bodily fluids. Participants were then given clinical tasks to care for the EVD “patient.” De-gowned participants were examined under “black light” for fluorescence indicative of contamination. One participant in each PPE arm had evidence of contamination. One of the contamination events was suspected during the patient care exercise. The other contamination event was not suspected until black light examination. In spite of a large difference in cost of PPE, the two bundle arms performed similarly. Bundle testing using fluorescent markers could help identify optimal PPE systems.","Bell, Todd; Smoot, John; Patterson, Justin; Smalligan, Roger; Jordan, Richard",IDCases,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214250914000468; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214250914000468; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idcr.2014.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26793445/,409
635636,The Battle Against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Emergency Management and Infection Control in a Radiology Department,2020-03-24,"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has required measures to contain the contagion, including social isolation. However, this and other factors have caused mental health problems, both in patients and health professionals and in family members or asymptomatic population. Religious support can be an ally for this type of confrontation. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, spiritual/religious care has been restricted and insufficient. When accessible to patients and frontline professionals, they are offered by virtual means, almost always by recorded media and made available in bulk. This essay argues, based on references in the areas of psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, biosafety, and military, that the face-to-face and personalized relationship between religious leaders, patients, health professionals, family members, and faith communities is as essential as possible for the dignified treatment victims, referral to spiritual needs and resilience of society, in addition to contributing to the improvement of the immune response of all. Practical examples are cited in the areas of military chaplaincy and hospital civilian chaplaincy. The essay also proposes the adoption of protocols already published by WHO and other safety measures such as the use of robotics and the recruitment/training of mass chaplains. In addition to contributing to the improvement of COVID-19 pandemic coping processes, the study also contributes to improving the delivery of spiritual/religious care as an ally to physical and mental, individual, and collective health.","Dutra, Cláunei C.

For stockbrokers, understanding trends and supported by prediction software for forecasting is very important for decision making. This paper proposes a data science model for stock prices forecasting in Indonesian exchange based on the statistical computing based on R language and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). FINDINGS: The first Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease-19) confirmed case in Indonesia is on 2 March 2020. After that, the composite stock price index has plunged 28% since the start of the year and the share prices of cigarette producers and banks in the midst of the corona pandemic reached their lowest value on March 24, 2020. We use the big data from Bank of Central Asia (BCA) and Bank of Mandiri from Indonesia obtained from Yahoo finance. In our experiments, we visualize the data using data science and predict and simulate the important prices called Open, High, Low and Closing (OHLC) with various parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experiment, data science is very useful for visualization data and our proposed method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can be used as predictor in short term data with accuracy 94.57% comes from the short term (1 year) with high epoch in training phase rather than using 3 years training data.","Budiharto, Widodo",J Big Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723498/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00430-0,409
638816,Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic stress and its effects on irritable bowel syndrome patients in Saudi Arabia,2020-12-18,"Access to safe, clean water and sanitation is globally recognized as essential for public health. Public toilets should be accessible to all members of a society, without social or physical barriers preventing usage. A public toilet facility’s design and upkeep should offer privacy and safety, ensure cleanliness, provide required sanitation-related resources, and be gender equitable, including enabling comfortable and safe management of menstruation. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) refers to the need to ensure that girls, women and all people who menstruate have access to clean menstrual products, privacy to change the materials as often as needed, soap and water for washing the body as required, and access to facilities to dispose of used materials. Challenges around menstruation faced by people experiencing homelessness, which tend to be greater than those facing the general population, include inadequate toilet and bathing facilities, affordability issues around menstrual products, and menstrual stigma. Public toilets are a vital resource for managing menstruation, particularly for vulnerable populations without reliable access to private, safe, and clean spaces and menstrual products. This mixed-methods study sought to: 1) understand the lived experiences of MHM among people experiencing homelessness in New York City with respect to public toilets; 2) describe general and MHM-related characteristics of public toilets in high need areas of Manhattan and analyze their interrelationships; and 3) examine the associations among neighborhood-level demographics and the public toilet characteristics in those areas. Qualitative methods included key informant interviews (n = 15) and in-depth interviews (n = 22) with people with experience living on the street or in shelters, which were analyzed using Malterud’s ‘systematic text condensation’ for thematic cross-case analysis. Quantitative methods included audits and analyses of public toilet facilities (n = 25) using traditional statistics (e.g., Spearman’s correlations) and spatial analyses (e.g., proximity buffers). Qualitative findings suggest cleanliness, access to restrooms, and availability of resources are critical issues for the participants or prospective users. Quantitative analyses revealed insufficiently provided, maintained, and resourced public toilets for managing menstruation in high-needs areas. Findings also suggest that toilets with more MHM-related resource availability, such as menstrual products and toilet stall disposal bins, were more difficult to access. Neighborhood-level characteristics showed a potential environmental injustice, as areas characterized by higher socioeconomic status are associated with more access to MHM-specific resources in public restrooms, as well as better overall quality.","Maroko, Andrew R.; Hopper, Kim; Gruer, Caitlin; Jaffe, Maayan; Zhen, Erica; Sommer, Marni",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161351/,409

The main protease encoded by SARS-CoV-2 is essential for processing of the polyproteins translated from the viral RNA genome, making this protein a potential drug target. A recently reported mutation in the protease, P108S, may be responsible for milder symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients in Tokyo. Starting from a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease in the dimeric form, we performed triplicate 5.0-μs molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and P108S mutant. Our computational results suggest a link between the mutation P108S and dynamics of the catalytic sites in the main protease: The catalytic dyad become considerably inaccessible to substrates in the P108S mutant. Our results also demonstrate the potential of molecular dynamics simulations to complement experimental techniques and other computational methods, such as protein design calculations, which predict effects of mutations based on static crystal structures. Further studies are certainly necessary to quantitively understand the relationships between the P108S mutation and physical properties of the main protease, but the results of our study will immediately inform development of new protease inhibitors.","Kuroda, Daisuke; Tsumoto, Kouhei",Biophys Physicobiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631338/; https://doi.org/10.2142/biophysico.bppb-v18.022,409
640507,Pregnancy Outcomes and Maternal Complications During the Second Wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India,2021-07-06,"Nearly 500’000 fatalities due to COVID-19 have been reported globally and the death toll is still rising. Most deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as a result of an excessive immune response and a cytokine storm elicited by severe SARS-CoV-2 lung infection, rather than by a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. In the most severe forms of the disease therapies should aim primarily at dampening the uncontrolled inflammatory/immune response responsible for most fatalities. Pharmacological agents - antiviral and anti-inflammatory molecules - have not been able so far to achieve compelling results for the control of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Cells derived from the placenta and/or fetal membranes, in particular amniotic epithelial cells (AEC) and decidual stromal cells (DSC), have established, well-characterized, potent anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties that make them attractive candidates for a cell-based therapy of COVID19 pneumonia. Placenta-derived cells are easy to procure from a perennial source and pose minimal ethical issues for their utilization. In view of the existing clinical evidence for the innocuousness and efficiency of systemic administration of DSCs or AECs in similar conditions, we advocate for the initiation of clinical trials using this strategy in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease.","Berishvili, Ekaterine; Kaiser, Laurent; Cohen, Marie; Berney, Thierry; Scholz, Hanne; Floisand, Yngvar; Mattsson, Jonas",Stem Cell Rev Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-10004-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696426/,409

Our objective is to assess patients’ self-reported impact of health care lockdown measures on their fears and anxieties during the crisis period of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. METHODS: We conducted a digital, self-reported, patient care survey distributed by an e-mail at Columbia University’s Department of Ophthalmology outpatient faculty practice. Inclusion criteria were age greater than or equal to 18 years, a diagnosis of either retinal disease or glaucoma, and a canceled or rescheduled ophthalmology established patient appointment during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients without an e-mail address listed in their electronic medical records were excluded. The survey occurred between March 2, 2020, to May 30, 2020. Primary measures were survey responses to assess key areas of patient anxiety or concern during the pandemic including the safety of care delivery in a COVID pandemic, difficulties contacting or being seen by their ophthalmologist, concern of vision loss or disease progression, and concern over missed or access to treatments. Secondary measures were correlating survey response to factors such as visual acuity, intraocular pressure, diagnosis, disease severity, follow-up urgency, recent treatments, and diagnostic testing data. RESULTS: Of the 2594 surveys sent out, 510 (19.66%) were completed. Over 95% of patients were at least as concerned as in normal circumstances about their ocular health during the peak of the pandemic. Overall, 76% of respondents were more concerned than normal that they could not be seen by their ophthalmologist soon enough. Increased concern over ocular health, disease progression, and access to care all showed positive correlations (P<0.05) with worse disease severity as measured with testing such as visual fields and optical coherence tomography. In addition, 55% of patients were afraid of contracting COVID-19 during an office visit. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We found a majority of our patients were concerned about limitations in access to ophthalmic care and were fearful of disease progression. In addition, we found a number of demographic and clinical factors that correlated with increased anxiety in our patients.","Dar, Salman; De Moraes, Carlos G.; Karani, Rabia; Khan, Sabine; Chen, Royce; Blumberg, Dana; Harizman, Noga; Krawitz, Brian; Valenzuela, Ives A.; Aliancy, Joah; Tezel, Tongalp; Horowitz, Jason; Bearelly, Srilaxmi; Coleman, Donald Jackson; Chang, Stanley; Cioffi, George A.; Liebmann, Jeffrey M.",J Glaucoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979109/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001877,409

The highly variable manifestation of the COVID-19 disease, from completely asymptomatic to fatal, is both a clinical and a public health issue. The criteria for discharge of hospitalized patients have been based so far on the negative result of Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, but the persistence of viral fragments may exceed that of the integral virus by weeks. The aim of our study was to verify the clearance of the virus at viral culture in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that have clinically recovered but are still positive on nasopharyngeal swab. Methods. The study was conducted in hospitalized patients with positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Patients included were from asymptomatic to severe cases and performed nasopharyngeal control swabbing on day 14 for asymptomatic patient or at least three days after remission of symptoms. RT-PCR positive specimens were sent to a biosafety level 3 laboratory for viral culture. Results. We performed a combined analysis of RT-PCR and a highly sensitive in vitro culture from 84 samples of hospitalized patients. The average age was 46 ± 20.29, and 40.5% of the subjects had radiologically confirmed pneumonia, with average PaO(2) of 72.35 ± 12.12and P/F ratio of 315 ± 83.15. Ct values for the N gene were lower in the first swab than in the control one (p < 0.001). The samples from 83 patients were negative at viral culture, and RT-PCR on the respective supernatants always confirmed the absence of viral growth. Conclusions. Our preliminary results demonstrate that patients clinically recovered for at least three days show the viral clearance at viral culture, and presumably they continued to not be contagious.","Manzulli, Viviana; Scioscia, Giulia; Giganti, Giulio; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Lacedonia, Donato; Pace, Lorenzo; Cipolletta, Dora; Tondo, Pasquale; De Nittis, Rosella; Rondinone, Valeria; Serrecchia, Luigina; Parisi, Antonio; Galante, Domenico; Lo Caputo, Sergio; Santantonio, Teresa Antonia; Moschetta, Damiana; Dattoli, Vitangelo; Fasanella, Antonio; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10020309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467628/,409

As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, educators at academic health centers are faced with a crucial question: How can continuing professional development (CPD) within teams and health systems be improved so that health care providers will be ready for the next disruption? How can new information about the next disruption be collected and disseminated so that interprofessional teams will be able to effectively and efficiently manage a new disease, new information, or new procedures and keep themselves safe? Unlike undergraduate and graduate/postgraduate education, CPD does not always have an identified educational home and has had uneven and limited innovation during the pandemic. In this commentary, the authors explore the barriers to change in this sector and propose 4 principles that may serve to guide a way forward: identifying a home for interprofessional continuing education at academic health centers, improving workplace-based learning, enhancing assessment for individuals within health care teams, and creating a culture of continuous learning that promotes population health.","Sklar, David; Yilmaz, Yusuf; Chan, Teresa M.",Acad Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292194/,409

We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in critically ill COVID-19 patients both at the acute and recovery phases of infection. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study including critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation discharged alive from a medical ICU of a university hospital. We collected demographic, anthropometric and ICU stay data (SAPS2, recourse to organ support and daily energy intake). Nutritional status and nutritional support were collected at one month after ICU discharge (M1) by phone interview and at 3 months after ICU discharge (M3) during a specialized and dedicated consultation conducted by a dietitian. Malnutrition diagnosis was based on weight loss and body mass index (BMI) criteria following the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition. Primary outcome was the prevalence of malnutrition at M3 and secondary outcomes were the evolution of nutritional status from ICU admission to M3 and factors associated with malnutrition at M3. RESULTS: From march 13th to may 15th, 2020, 38 patients were discharged alive from the ICU, median [IQR] age 66 [59–72] years, BMI 27.8 [25.5–30.7] kg/m(2) and SAPS2 47 [35–55]. Thirty-three (86%) patients were followed up to M3. Prevalence of malnutrition increased during the ICU stay, from 18% at ICU admission to 79% at ICU discharge and then decreased to 71% at M1 and 53% at M3. Severe malnutrition prevailed at ICU discharge with a prevalence of 55% decreasing 32% at M3. At M3, the only factors associated with malnutrition in univariate analysis were the length of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay (25 [16–39] vs. 11 [9–12] days, P = 0.006 and 28 [21–42] vs. 15 [11–17] days, P = 0.010, respectively), while no ICU preadmission and admission factors, nor energy and protein intakes distinguished the two groups. Only 32% of undernourished patients at M3 had benefited from a nutritional support. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is frequent, protracted and probably underrecognized among critically ill Covid-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation with more than half patients still being undernourished three months after ICU discharge. A particular attention should be paid to the nutritional status of these patients not only during their ICU stay but also following ICU discharge.","Rives-Lange, C.; Zimmer, A.; Merazka, A.; Carette, C.; Martins-Bexinga, A.; Hauw-Berlemont, C.; Guerot, E.; Jannot, A.S.; Diehl, J.L.; Czernichow, S.; Hermann, B.",Clin Nutr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561421002570?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561421002570; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134915/,409

Pyroptosis plays an important role in various diseases. Nevertheless, there are few bibliometric analysis systematically studies this field. We aimed to visualize the research hotspots and trends of pyroptosis using a bibliometric analysis to help understand the future development of basic and clinical research. METHODS: The articles and reviews regarding pyroptosis were culled from Web of Science Core Collection. Countries, institutions, authors, references and keywords in this field were visually analyzed by using CtieSpace and VOSviewer software. RESULTS: A total of 2845 articles and reviews were included. The number of articles regarding pyroptosis significantly increased yearly. These publications mainly come from 70 countries led by China and the USA and 418 institutions. We identified 605 authors, among which Thirumaladevi Kanneganti had the most significant number of articles, and Shi JJ was co-cited most often.

We further investigated our research question during the COVID-19 pandemic with 164 YA (18–30 years) and 171 OA (60–80 years). Participants responded to an online survey about the COVID-19 pandemic across 13 days during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States (U.S.). Both YA and OA preferred to read positive over negative news about the coronavirus, but OA were even more likely than YA to prefer the positive news article. No age differences in the fear of contraction were found, but OA engaged in more health-protective behaviors compared to YA. Although OA may not always report greater fear than YA or seek out negative information related to a health concern, they still engage in protective health behaviors. Thus, although positivity effects were observed in attention and emotional reports (in the COVID-19 study), OA still modified their behaviors more than YA (giveaway in both studies, and health-protective behavior change in the COVID-19 study), suggesting that positivity effects did not hamper OA ability to respond to a health crisis.","Villalba, Anthony A.; Stanley, Jennifer Tehan; Turner, Jennifer R.; Vale, Michael T.; Houston, Michelle L.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424705/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.589390,409

Based on a survey of 346 Korean adults, this study showed that information avoidance, but not information seeking, was a positive predictor of misinformation exposure. In addition, heuristic processing, but not systematic processing, moderated the relationship between misinformation exposure and misinformation acceptance, such that the relationship between misinformation exposure and misinformation acceptance was stronger among those who showed greater tendency for heuristic processing. In addition, information insufficiency was a negative predictor of both information avoidance and heuristic processing.

While snapshots of the up and down states have been obtained by cryoEM and cryoET, details of the RBD opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here, over 200 μs of weighted ensemble (WE) simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD opening pathways. Together with biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408, and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein achieves a new high-water mark for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection.","Sztain, Terra; Ahn, Surl-Hee; Bogetti, Anthony T.; Casalino, Lorenzo; Goldsmith, Jory A.; McCool, Ryan S.; Kearns, Fiona L.; McCammon, J.

649298,SARS-CoV-2: recommendations for treatment in intensive care medicine,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the People’s Republic of China in December 2019. Thereafter, a global logarithmic expansion of cases occurred. Some countries have a higher rate of infections despite the early implementation of quarantine. Air pollution might be related to high susceptibility to the virus and associated case fatality rates (deaths/cases*100). Lima, Peru, has the second highest incidence of COVID-19 in Latin America and also has one the highest levels of air pollution in the region. METHODS: This study investigated the association of levels of PM(2.5) exposure in previous years (2010–2016) in 24 districts of Lima with cases, deaths and case fatality rates for COVID-19. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate this association controlled by age, sex, population density and number of food markets per district. The study period was from March 6 to June 12, 2020. RESULTS: There were 128,700 cases in Lima and 2382 deaths due to COVID-19. The case fatality rate was 1.93%. Previous exposure to PM(2.5) (2010—2016) was associated with the number of COVID-19- cases (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.034–0.107) and deaths (β = 0.0014; 95% CI: 0.0006–0.0.0023) but not with the case fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for age, sex and number of food markets, the higher rates of COVID-19 in Metropolitan Lima are attributable to the increased PM(2.5) exposure in the previous years, among other reasons. Reduction in air pollution from a long-term perspective and social distancing are needed to prevent the spread of virus outbreaks.

649904,Mental Health of Nursing Students amid Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021-08-12,"Europe is now considered as the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, France being among the most impacted country. In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (R0=3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (R0=2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Our analysis shows that, even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed. While drastic social distancing measures may temper our results, a massive reorganization leading to an expansion of French ICU capacities seems to be necessary to manage the coming wave of critically affected COVID-19 patients.","Massonnaud, Clément; Roux, Jonathan; Crépey, Pascal",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036939,409
649938,Medical students’ pattern of self-directed learning prior to and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic period and its implications for Free Open Access Meducation within the United Kingdom,2021-04-06,"Background: From January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has raged around the world, causing nearly a million deaths and hundreds of severe economic crises. In this terrible scenario, Italy was one of the most affected countries. ------------ Objective: The aim of this study is to look for significant correlations between COVID-19 cases and demographic, geographical, and environmental statistics of each Italian region from February 26 to August 12, 2020. Finally, we further investigated the link between SARS-CoV-2 spread and particulate matter 2.5 and 10 concentrations before the lockdown in Lombardy. ------------ Methods: All demographic data were taken from the AdminStat Italia website, while the geographic data from the Il Meteo website. The collection frequency was 1 week. Data on PM2.5 and PM10 average daily concentrations were collected from previously published articles. We used Pearson's coefficients to correlate quantities that followed a normal distribution, and Spearman's coefficient to correlate quantities that did not follow a normal distribution. To evaluate this, we used the kurtosis (k) and skewness (s) coefficients according to the following scheme: we considered data compatible with a normal distribution only when t_k=k(24/n)^(-1/2) [≤] 1.5 and t_s=s(6/n)^(-1/2) [≤] 1.5; here, the Pearson correlation index was deemed more reliable. When t_k in ]1.5,3],t_s [≤] 3 or t_k [≤] 3, t_s in ]1.5,3], we considered it appropriate to evaluate both correlations. Finally, when t_k,t_s > 3, we judged the Spearman correlation index more appropriate. When the linear correlations were significant, we interpolated the data linearly. We reported in round brackets () the week in which the correlation approached the threshold of statistical significance e.g. Abruzzo (4). The chosen p-value threshold was =.05. ------------ Results: We found significant strong correlations between COVID-19 cases and population density in 60.0% of regions, such as Calabria (5), Campania (1), Lazio (1), Liguria (2), Lombardy (4), Piedmont (2), Sardinia (3), Sicily (1), and Veneto (4) (R_best=.935, 95% CI: .830 -1.000,p_best=.046,95% CI:.006-.040). The average of the angular coefficients resulting from the linear interpolations of the pairs (COVID-19 cases, population number) is b=.0037 (95% CI .0009-.0065). We found a significant strong correlation between the angular coefficients b of the various regions and their latitude. This data shows the dependence of COVID-19 on geographical and/or climatic factors (R=.926,p=.001,r=.886,p=.003). in particular, we found a significant correlation with the historical averages (last 30 years) of the minimum temperatures of the Italian regions (R=-.849,p=.008,r=-.940,p=.005 for March, R=-.923,p=.001,r=-.872,p = .005 for February). We found a significant strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases until August 12 and the average daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Lombardy until February 29, 2020 (r=.76,p=.004). No significant correlation with PM10 was found in the same periods. Until February 26, 2020, we found both a correlation with PM2.5 (r=.63,p=.029) and PM10 (r=.72,p=.009). In the second week of March, the correlation with PM10 disappeared while that with PM2.5 continued to exist until nowadays. We found that 40 g/m^3 for PM2.5 and 50 g/m^3 for PM10 are plausible thresholds beyond which particulate pollution clearly favors the spread of SARS-CoV-2. ------------ Conclusion: Since SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with historical minimum temperatures and particulate matter 10 and 2.5, health authorities are urged to monitor pollution levels and to invest in precautions for the arrival of autumn. Furthermore, we suggest creating awareness campaigns for the recirculation of air in closed places and to avoid exposure to cold.","Rovetta, A.; Castaldo, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.20196980; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20196980v1?rss=1,409

However, there are several barriers to offering adequate IPE, including space restrictions and lack of human resources, prompting exploration of alternative modalities. In 2019, an IPE activity was offered in person with 213 pharmacy and 45 physician assistant (PA) students participating in one-on-one team huddles focusing on managing an acutely ill patient. In 2020, the same IPE activity, including 194 pharmacy and 45 PA students, was offered virtually. Peer evaluations, an attitudes survey, and confidence surveys were administered to evaluate the impact of the IPE activity. A student t-test and descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the data. On average, PA students in the virtual group rated their peers higher than PA students in the in-person group, with little difference in the pharmacy peer evaluation of their PA partner. Ninety percent of pharmacy students and 91% of PA students in the virtual group felt that “they learned something new regarding therapeutic management” from their partner versus 84% of pharmacy and 81% of PA students in the in-person group.

651922,Multidrug-Resistant Infections and Outcome of Critically Ill Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Single Center Experience.,2021-02-17,"Viruses often encode proteins that mimic host proteins in order to facilitate infection. Little work has been done to understand the potential mimicry of the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV spike proteins, particularly the receptor-binding motifs, which could be important in determining tropism and druggability of the virus. Peptide and epitope motifs have been detected on coronavirus spike proteins using sequence homology approaches; however, comparing the three-dimensional shape of the protein has been shown as more informative in predicting mimicry than sequence-based comparisons. Here, we use structural bioinformatics software to characterize potential mimicry of the three coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding motifs. We utilize sequence-independent alignment tools to compare structurally known protein models with the receptor-binding motifs and verify potential mimicked interactions with protein docking simulations. Both human and non-human proteins were returned for all three receptor-binding motifs. For example, all three were similar to several proteins containing EGF-like domains: some of which are endogenous to humans, such as thrombomodulin, and others exogenous, such as Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1. Similarity to human proteins may reveal which pathways the spike protein is co-opting, while analogous non-human proteins may indicate shared host interaction partners and overlapping antibody cross-reactivity. These findings can help guide experimental efforts to further understand potential interactions between human and coronavirus proteins.","Beaudoin, Christopher A.; Jamasb, Arian R; Alsulami, Ali F.; Copoiu, Liviu; van Tonder, Andries J.; Hala, Sharif; Bannerman, Bridget P.; Thomas, Sherine E.; Vedithi, Sundeep Chaitanya; Torres, Pedro H.M.; Blundell, Tom L.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021002798?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234921/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037021002798; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.06.041,409

However, we still don’t know how specific SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins contribute to viral pathogenicity. We found that SARS-CoV-2-encoded membrane glycoprotein M could induce caspase-dependent apoptosis via interacting with PDK1 and inhibiting the activation of PDK1-PKB/Akt signaling. Our investigation further revealed that SARS-CoV-2-encoded nucleocapsid protein N could specifically enhance the M-induced apoptosis via interacting with both M and PDK1, therefore strengthening M-mediated attenuation of PDK1-PKB/Akt interaction. Furthermore, when the M-N interaction was disrupted via certain rationally designed peptides, the PDK1-PKB/Akt signaling was restored, and the boosting activity of N on the M-triggered apoptosis was abolished. Overall, our findings uncovered a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2-encoded M triggers apoptosis with the assistance of N, which expands our understanding of the two key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and sheds light on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening virus.","Ren, Yujie; Wang, An; Fang, Yuan; Shu, Ting; Wu, Di; Wang, Chong; Huang, Muhan; Min, Juan; Jin, Liang; Zhou, Wei; Qiu, Yang; Zhou, Xi",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.706252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513728/,409

Despite compelling evidence that proper hand washing can reduce the transmission of pathogens to patients and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, the adherence of health care workers to recommended hand-hygiene practices has remained unacceptably low. One of the key elements in improving hand-hygiene practice is the use of an alcohol-based hand rub instead of washing with soap and water. An alcohol-based hand rub requires less time, is microbiologically more effective, and is less irritating to skin than traditional hand washing with soap and water. Therefore, alcohol-based hand rubs should replace hand washing as the standard for hand hygiene in health care settings in all situations in which the hands are not visibly soiled. It is also important to change gloves between each patient contact and to use hand-hygiene procedures after glove removal. Reducing health care-associated infections requires that health care workers take responsibility for ensuring that hand hygiene becomes an everyday part of patient care.","Trampuz, Andrej; Widmer, Andreas F.",Mayo Clin Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14708954/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619611632631; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619611632631,409

Another reduction that has been reported is in the number of strokes presenting to hospitals, despite the virus implicated in causing a hypercoagulable state. Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to increase in stroke incidence and the improvement in air quality may be responsible for the decrease in stroke presentations. METHODS: To explore this hypothesis, we compared the air quality index (AQI) of Karachi, the largest cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, during the lockdown period in 2020 to the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: We found a significant drop in AQI depicting an improvement in air quality. Simultaneously, we identified a drop in number of stroke admissions to less than half from 2019 to 2020 at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals of the city, during this period of interest. Conclusion: We hypothesize that one important reason for this drop in stroke admissions, may be an actual reduction in stroke incidence brought about by an improvement in air quality.","Hameed, Sajid; Khan, Maria; Fatmi, Zafar; Wasay, Mohammad",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305721002639?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029889/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105860; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305721002639,409

As people turn to the internet to support health decision-making, it is critical that we improve the supportiveness of the virtual health setting for cancer prevention. INTERVENTION: In 2014, the Alberta Cancer Prevention Legacy Fund launched an online HPV Decision Aid Tool to support evidence-informed decision-making in response to suboptimal uptake of the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine. Google Analytics data from approximately 2000 recent interactions with this tool have yielded insights into the concerns that impact people’s decision-making about the vaccine. OUTCOMES: Most users of this tool are adults interested in the vaccine for themselves (69%), rather than parents considering immunizing their children (31%). No differences were found in the information-seeking behaviour of parents of girls compared with parents of boys, suggesting that mental models among those who are considering the HPV vaccine may have shifted in recent years. Concerns differed by respondent; cost was the most important concern among adults (62.0%), while parents were most concerned about vaccine safety (61.5%). Only 23% of users asked “what is HPV”, suggesting that many people in Alberta now have basic knowledge about the virus. IMPLICATIONS: Results provide a real-time “pulse” on knowledge and attitudes towards HPV immunization, which informs our approach to tailoring messaging with the aim of increasing vaccine uptake in Alberta.

However, the pandemic's impact on the wide range of conditions seen in EDs, and the resources required for treating them, has been less studied. We sought to provide a comprehensive analysis of ED visits and associated resource utilization during the initial COVID-19 surge. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis from 5 hospitals in a large health system in Massachusetts, comparing ED encounters from 3/1/2020–4/30/2020 to identical weeks from the prior year. Data collected included demographics, ESI, diagnosis, consultations ordered, bedside procedures, and inpatient procedures within 48 h. We compared raw frequencies between time periods and calculated incidence rate ratios. RESULTS: ED volumes decreased by 30.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. Average acuity of ED presentations increased, while most non-COVID-19 diagnoses decreased. The number and incidence rate of all non-critical care ED procedures decreased, while the occurrence of intubations and central lines increased. Most subspecialty consultations decreased, including to psychiatry, trauma surgery, and cardiology.

Existing studies examine the environmental effect of lockdowns at a city- or country-level, few examines it from a global perspective. Using a novel COVID-19 government response tracker dataset, combining the daily air pollution data and weather data across 597 major cities worldwide between January 1, 2020, and July 5, 2020, this study quantifies the causal impacts of 8 types of lockdown measures on changes of a range of individual pollutants based on a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the NO2 air quality index value falls more precipitously (23 ~ 37%) relative to the pre-lockdown period, followed by PM10 (14 ~ 20%), SO2 (2 ~ 20%), PM2.5 (7 ~ 16%), and CO (7 ~ 11%), but the O3 increases 10 ~ 27%. Furthermore, intra/intercity travel restrictions have a better performance in curbing air pollution. These results are robust to a set of alternative specifications, including different panel sizes, independent variables, estimation strategies. The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the lockdown effects are more remarkable in cities from lower-income, more industrialized, and populous countries. We also do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 99,270 to 146,649 among 76 countries and regions involved in this study during the COVID-19 lockdown. These findings underscore the importance of continuous air pollution control strategies to protect human health and reduce the associated social welfare loss both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Fenglong; Wang, Meichang; Pu, Zhengning",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142533; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720360629?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039885/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720360629,409

The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) mounts a lot of stress on the healthcare sector and the scientific society to search continuously for novel components with antiviral possibility. Herein, we narrated the different tactics of using biopeptides as antiviral molecules that could be used as an interesting alternative to treat COVID-19 patients. The number of peptides with antiviral effects is still low, but such peptides already displayed huge potentials to become pharmaceutically obtainable as antiviral medications. Studies showed that animal venoms, mammals, plant, and artificial sources are the main sources of antiviral peptides, when bioinformatics tools are used. This review spotlights bioactive peptides with antiviral activities against human viruses, especially the coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2 or SARS-nCOV19). We also showed the data about well-recognized peptides that are still under investigations, while presenting the most potent ones that may become medications for clinical use.","Ashaolu, Tolulope Joshua; Nawaz, Asad; Walayat, Noman; Khalifa, Ibrahim",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11267-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33876282/,409

Most studies examining change in mental health during the pandemic have assumed population homogeneity which may conceal evidence of worsening mental health for some. In this study, we applied a heterogeneous perspective to determine if there were distinct groups in the population characterised by different patterns of change in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: : Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative sample of Irish adults (N = 1,041) at four time-points between April and December 2020. RESULTS: : In the entire sample, mean levels of internalizing symptoms significantly declined from March to December 2020. However, we identified four distinct groups with different patterns of change. The most common response was ‘Resilience’ (66.7%), followed by ‘Improving’ (17.9%), ‘Worsening’ (11.3%), and ‘Sustained’ (4.1%). Belonging to the ‘Worsening’ class was associated with younger age, city dwelling, current and past treatment for a mental health problem, higher levels of empathy, and higher levels of loneliness. LIMITATIONS: : Sample attrition was relatively high and although this was managed using robust statistical methods, bias associated with non-responses cannot be entirely ruled out. CONCLUSION: : The majority of adults experienced no change, or an improvement in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic, and a relatively small proportion of adults experienced a worsening of internalizing symptoms. Limited public mental health resources should be targeted toward helping these at-risk individuals.","Hyland, Philip; Vallières, Frédérique; Daly, Michael; Butter, Sarah; Bentall, Richard P.; Fox, Robert; Karatzias, Thanos; MacLachlan, Malcolm; McBride, Orla; Murphy, Jamie; Murphy, David; Spikol, Eric; Shevlin, Mark",J Affect Disord,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721009502?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721009502; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.145,409

We conducted this analysis to better understand tocilizumab treatment for COVID-19 patients. MAIN TEXT: We searched major databases for manuscripts reporting the effects of tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A total of 25 publications were analyzed with Revman 5.3 and R for the meta-analysis. Significant better clinical outcomes were found in the tocilizumab treatment group when compared to the standard care group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidential interval (C): 0.54–0.90, P = 0.007]. Tocilizumab treatment showed a stronger correlation with good prognosis among COVID-19 patients that needed mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.37–0.93, P = 0.02). Among stratified analyses, reduction of overall mortality correlates with tocilizumab treatment in patients less than 65 years old (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.60–0.77, P < 0.00001), and with intensive care unit patients (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55–0.70, P < 0.00001). Pooled estimates of hazard ratio showed that tocilizumab treatment predicts better overall survival in COVID-19 patients (HR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24–0.84, P = 0.01), especially in severe cases (HR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.49–0.68, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that tocilizumab treatment is associated with a lower risk of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement among COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab may have substantial effectiveness in reducing mortality among COVID-19 patients, especially among critical cases.

Significant data are showing that glycyrrhizin and licorice extract have multiple beneficial activities in combating most features of SARS-CoV-2 Purpose The aim of current review was to highlight recent progresses in research that showed the evidence of the potential use of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract against COVID-19. Methodology We have reviewed the information published from 1979 to October 2020. These studies demonstrated the effects , use and safety of glycyrrhizin and icorice extract against viral infections,bacterial infections, inflammatory disorders of lung ( in vitro and in vivo). These studies were collated through online electronic databases research (Academic libraries as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Egyptian Knowledge Bank). Results Pooled effect size of articles provides information about the rationale for using glycyrrhizin and licorice extract to treat COVID-19. Fifty studies demonstrate antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract. The most frequent mechanism of the antiviral activity is due to disrupting viral uptake into the host cells and disrupting the interaction between receptor- binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV2 and ACE2 in recent articles. Fifty studies indicate that glycyrrhizin and licorice extract have significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Twenty five studies provide evidence for the protective effect of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract against inflammation-induced acute lung injury and cardiovascular disorders. Conclusion The current study showed several evidence regarding the beneficial effects of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract in combating COVID-19.

Brain pathology in SAE, which is manifested by impaired perception, consciousness and cognition, results from multifactorial events, including high levels of systemic cytokines, microbial components and endotoxins, which all damage the brain barriers, instigate neuroinflammation and cause homeostatic failure. Astrocytes, being the principal homeostatic cells of the central nervous system contribute to the brain defence against infection. Forming multifunctional anatomical barriers, astroglial cells maintain brain-systemic interfaces and restrict the damage to the nervous tissue. Astrocytes detect, produce and integrate inflammatory signals between immune cells and cells of brain parenchyma, thus regulating brain immune response. In SAE astrocytes are present in both reactive and astrogliopathic states; balance between these states define evolution of pathology and neurological outcomes. In humans pathophysiology of SAE is complicated by frequent presence of comorbidities, as well as age-related remodelling of the brain tissue with senescence of astroglia; these confounding factors further impact upon SAE progression and neurological deficits.","Shulyatnikova, Tatyana; Verkhratsky, Alexei",Neurochem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30778837/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-019-02743-2,409

In this study, we characterized the interaction between erythrocytes and unrelated Ad serotypes, human 5 (HAd5) and 37 (HAd37), and canine 2 (CAV-2). While these serotypes agglutinate human erythrocytes, they use different receptors, have different tropisms and/or infect different species. Using molecular, biochemical, structural and transgenic animal-based analyses, we found that the primary erythrocyte interaction domain for HAd37 is its sialic acid binding site, while CAV-2 binding depends on at least three factors: electrostatic interactions, sialic acid binding and, unexpectedly, binding to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on human erythrocytes. We show that the presence of CAR on erythrocytes leads to prolonged in vivo blood half-life and significantly reduced liver infection when a CAR-tropic Ad is injected intravenously. This study provides i) a molecular and structural rationale for Ad–erythrocyte interactions, ii) a basis to improve vector-mediated gene transfer and iii) a mechanism that may explain the biodistribution and pathogenic inconsistencies found between human and animal models.","Seiradake, Elena; Henaff, Daniel; Wodrich, Harald; Billet, Olivier; Perreau, Matthieu; Hippert, Claire; Mennechet, Franck; Schoehn, Guy; Lortat-Jacob, Hugues; Dreja, Hanna; Ibanes, Sandy; Kalatzis, Vasiliki; Wang, Jennifer P.; Finberg, Robert W.; Cusack, Stephen; Kremer, Eric J.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19119424/,409

The country’s economy, landscape of neurology practice, and disease burden are hypothesized to correlate with scientific output. This study aimed to objectively measure the impact of published studies on primary brain tumors in SEA and to assess for correlation with socioeconomic determinants and burden of disease. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases for relevant articles from SEA on primary CNS tumor until July 31, 2020. Bibliometric indices were reported and subjected to correlational analysis with population size, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, percentage (%) GDP for research and development (R&D), total number of neurologists, disease incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years. RESULTS: A total of 549 articles were included, consisting primarily of case reports (n=187, 34.06%) and discussed gliomas (n=195, 35.52%). Singapore published the most number of the articles (n=246, 44.8%). Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between %GDP for R&D and total publication. Additionally, negative relationships were noted between burden of disease and total neurologist with most bibliometric indices. However, GDP per capita was not correlated with measures for research productivity. CONCLUSION: The low impact of scientific output on primary CNS tumors in SEA does not address the growing epidemiology and burden of this disease.

METHODS: We identified enrollees in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs healthcare system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 2/28/2020 and 9/30/2020 (n=55,952), with follow-up extending to 11/19/2020. We determined trends over time in incidence of the following outcomes that occurred within 30 days of testing positive: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and death. RESULTS: Between February and July 2020, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), which subsequently plateaued between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, documented symptoms and laboratory tests, including among subgroups of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ICU or treated with mechanical ventilation. From February to September, there were decreases in the use of hydroxychloroquine (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%) vasopressors (20.6% to 8.7%), and dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) and increases in the use of dexamethasone (3.4% to 53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%) and remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%) among hospitalized patients.

671936,A Modular Approach for a Patient Unit for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Simulator,2021-05-31,"Periodontal diseases are initiated by bacterial species living in polymicrobial biofilms at or below the gingival margin and progress largely as a result of the inflammation initiated by specific subgingival species. In the past few decades, efforts to understand the microbiota of periodontal diseases have led to an exponential increase in information about biofilms associated with periodontal health and disease. In fact, the oral microbiota is one of the best characterized microbiomes that colonize the human body. Despite this increased knowledge, one has to ask if our fundamental concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal diseases have really changed. In this chapter we will review how our comprehension of the structure and function of the subgingival microbiota evolved over the years in search of lessons learned and unlearned in periodontal microbiology. More specifically, this review focuses on: 1) how the data obtained through molecular techniques has impacted our knowledge of the etiology of periodontal infections; 2) the potential role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases; 3) how concepts of microbial ecology have expanded our understanding of host microbial interactions that might lead to periodontal diseases; 4) the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; and 5) the impact of these evolving concepts on treatment and preventive approaches to periodontal infections. We will conclude by reviewing how novel systems biology approaches promise to unravel new details of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and, hopefully, lead to a better understanding of periodontal disease mechanisms.","Teles, Ricardo; Teles, Flavia; Frias-Lopez, Jorge; Paster, Bruce; Haffajee, Anne",Periodontology 2000,https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23574465/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3912758?pdf=render,409
672465,Commentary: Patients first with physicians safe: Controlled apneic tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020-12-26,"Wireless body area networks (WBANs) have strong potential in the field of health monitoring. However, the energy consumption required for accurate monitoring determines the time between battery charges of the wearable sensors, which is a key performance factor (and can be critical in the case of implantable devices). In this paper, we study the inherent trade-off between the power consumption of the sensors and the probability of misclassifying a patient’s health state. We formulate this trade-off as a dynamic problem, in which at each step, we can choose to activate a subset of sensors that provide noisy measurements of the patient’s health state. We assume that the (unknown) health state follows a Markov chain, so our problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision problem (POMDP). We show that all the past measurements can be summarized as a belief state on the true health state of the patient, which allows tackling the POMDP problem as an MDP on the belief state. Then, we empirically study the performance of a greedy one-step look-ahead policy compared to the optimal policy obtained by solving the dynamic program. For that purpose, we use an open-source Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) dataset of 232 patients over six months and extract the transition matrix and sensor accuracies from the data. We find that the greedy policy saves ≈50% of the energy costs while reducing the misclassification costs by less than 2% compared to the most accurate policy possible that always activates all sensors. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that the greedy policy remains nearly optimal across different cost parameters and a varying number of sensors. The results also have practical importance, because while the optimal policy is too complicated, a greedy one-step look-ahead policy can be easily implemented in WBAN systems.","David, Yair Bar; Geller, Tal; Bistritz, Ilai; Ben-Gal, Irad; Bambos, Nicholas; Khmelnitsky, Evgeni",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21124245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205774/,409

A cross-sectional study was conducted among a universal sample of dental students in the Palestinian territories. Willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine was related to the following factors: Demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experiences, beliefs and knowledge about the vaccine, attitudes toward vaccinations in general, and other factors outlined by the WHO SAGE Vaccination Hesitancy Questionnaire. Four hundred and seventeen students completed the questionnaire (response rate = 41.7%). In general, 57.8% (n = 241) were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it became available to them, 27% (n = 114) were hesitant, and 14.9% (n = 62) were not willing to get vaccinated. The final regression model explained 46% of the variation in the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as follows: Attitudes towards new vaccines (β = 6.23, p < 0.001), believing in a favorable risk–benefit ratio (β = 5.64, p < 0.001), trust in the pharmaceutical industry (β = 5.92, p = 0.001), believing that natural immunity is better than being vaccinated (β = −4.24, p < 0.001), and having enough information about the vaccine (β = 4.12, p < 0.001). Adequate information about vaccines, their risk–benefit ratios, and natural and acquired immunity are important to build trust and favorable attitudes towards vaccines among future dentists.","Kateeb, Elham; Danadneh, Mayar; Pokorná, Andrea; Klugarová, Jitka; Abdulqader, Huthaifa; Klugar, Miloslav; Riad, Abanoub",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579190/,409

However, only a certain group of patients benefit from PD-1 blockade therapy and many patients succumb to hyperprogressive disease. Although, CD8 T cells and conventional T cells are generally considered to be the primary source of PD-1 in cancer, accumulating evidence suggests that other distinct cell types, including B cells, regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, tumor-associated macrophages and cancer cells, also express PD-1. Hence, the response of patients with cancer to PD-1 blockade therapy is a cumulative effect of anti-PD-1 antibodies acting on a myriad of cell types. Although, the contribution of CD8 T cells to PD-1 blockade therapy has been well-established, recent studies also suggest the involvement of non-canonical PD-1 signaling in blockade therapy. This review discusses the role of non-canonical PD-1 signaling in distinct cell types and explores how the available knowledge can improve PD-1 blockade immunotherapy, particularly in identifying novel biomarkers and combination treatment strategies.","Zha, Haoran; Jiang, Ying; Wang, Xi; Shang, Jin; Wang, Ning; Yu, Lei; Zhao, Wei; Li, Zhihua; An, Juan; Zhang, Xiaochun; Chen, Huoming; Zhu, Bo; Li, Zhaoxia",J Immunother Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-001230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593825/,409

SARS is a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Originating in Guangdong, Southern China, at the end of 2002, it has spread to regions all over the world, affecting more than 8000 people. With high morbidity and mortality, SARS is an important respiratory disease which may be encountered world-wide. The causative virus was identified by a WHO-led network of laboratories, which identified the genome sequence and developed the first molecular assays for diagnosis. For the respiratory physician, detecting SARS in its earliest stages, identifying pathways of transmission, and implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies are all important. The WHO and the CDC have published helpful definitions of ‘suspected’ and ‘probable’ cases. However, the symptoms of the disease may change, and laboratory tests and definitions are still limited. Even in a situation of no new cases of infection, SARS remains a major respiratory health hazard.

The current study evaluated self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms as a potential mediator of the relationship between prior dCBT-I and subsequent insomnia and depressive symptoms assessed during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHOD Participants were 208 adults who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I versus sleep education in 2016-2017 and also completed self-report assessments of insomnia, depression, and self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms. Data were collected in May 2020, five weeks into state-wide COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the extent to which self-efficacy accounted for the relationship between treatment condition and improvement in insomnia and depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to COVID-19 follow-up. RESULTS Prior dCBT-I predicted greater self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms. Self-efficacy accounted for 49% and 67% of the protective effect of dCBT-I against COVID-era insomnia and depressive symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study affirms the importance of self-efficacy as a key intervention outcome and potential mechanism by which dCBT-I predicts future sleep and mental health. Future studies that evaluate the role of self-efficacy in treatment effectiveness and resilience can provide additional clues about how to optimize dCBT-I for maximum benefit to public health.","Cheng, Philip; Casement, Melynda D; Kalmbach, David A; Cuamatzi Castelan, Andrea; Drake, Christopher L",Behavioral sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2021.1976780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511016/,409

Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3′ end by 3′-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 3′-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3′ end. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation.","Kim, Geon-Woo; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Cho, Hee; Kim, Minwoo; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Oh, Jong-Won",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27366906/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005714,409

These hematologic abnormalities are suspected to occur in the context of underlying immune dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction. Elevated D-dimer levels, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and positive lupus anticoagulants are the most common findings to date. Current guidelines suggest that all patients with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. CASE REPORT: An 89-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and advanced prostate cancer in remission presented with generalized weakness. At our center, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but the patient did not have symptoms of COVID-19. He was also found to have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, secondary to both a high titer of factor VIII inhibitor and a lupus anticoagulant. He eventually developed respiratory compromise, during which his disease manifested as a bleeding rather than a prothrombotic state. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of prolonged partial thromboplastin time, rather than making an assumption based on a positive lupus anticoagulant result. In the case presented, the concomitant factor VIII inhibitor caused the patient to have a greater bleeding tendency. It is imperative that physicians balance the risk of bleeding and clotting in patients with COVID-19 because patients seem to have varying presentations based on disease severity and level of immune dysregulation.","Ghafouri, Sanaz; Rettig, Matthew; Kahlon, Kanwarpal S.",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.926728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33122620/,409

680655,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19),2020-11-30,"Background: University campuses present an ideal environment for viral spread and are therefore at extreme risk of serving as a hotbed for a COVID-19 outbreak. While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.","Rennert, L.; Kalbaugh, C.

These factors can contribute to toxic stress, which has been shown to negatively impact children’s health. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this project was to partner with community organizations to obtain a baseline needs assessment from families in Maywood regarding sources of toxic stress and to identify interventions of interest. METHODS: In total, 75 anonymous surveys were collected from the Loyola Outpatient Center Pediatric Clinic and a Maywood community center. Survey responses were statistically analyzed in order to determine toxic stressors most commonly impacting families in Maywood as well as interventions of most interest to the community. RESULTS: There were 78 respondents for a response rate of approximately 71%. The most common stressors were smoking in the home (33.3%), food insecurity (29.5%), and exposure to violence (26.9%). In this sample, Black respondents were 11.5 times more likely than non-Black respondents to report that their child was exposed to violence in the community – even after controlling for concern about their child’s behavior which served as a surrogate measure of the child’s exposure to toxic stress (P = 0.001). Further, those living with food insecurity were 7.40 times more likely to report that access to food and transportation vouchers were important (P < .001). For every 1-point increase in the total toxic stress score, respondents were 1.35 times more likely to report that increasing access to mental health resources was important to them, though this was not significant (P = .10). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that toxic stressors, health risks and unmet social needs are prevalent in the Maywood community, which puts local children at risk for future adverse health outcomes. With this information, pediatricians at Loyola Medical Center can work with community organizations to allocate resources to address toxic stressors in Maywood.","McCune, Erin; Wojtowicz, Jennifer; Adams, William; Sigman, Garry; Williams, Collette; Ahn, Pauline; Ciliberti, Ashley; Hatchett, Lena; O’Keefe, Julie",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211030136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34247533/,409

Eurofins performed >700 tests on 78 unique samples from 18 sites in Denmark, France and Belgium. Ten variant test protocols were trialed. Protocol variations trialed included centrifugation, precipitation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, agitation prior to precipitation, cooling, and pasteurization of the samples. A method was succesfully developed and reliability was supported by stability, reproducibility, and dilution & linearity studies. Results obtained showed a direct link to number of RNA copies in the sample using a calibration curve with synthetic SARS-CoV-2. Analysis was performed on both the liquid phase and solid phase of wastewater samples, with virus RNA detected in both phases but more frequently in the liquid phase. The virus was present in a sample from a Danish community wastewater treatment plant collected on February 24, 3 days before the first COVID-19 case was officially reported in the country. The greatest concentration of virus detected corresponded to when the COVID-19 crisis was at its peak in Denmark. Based on studies carried out in a Danish hospital, the wastewater testing method is expected to be able to detect a community COVID-19 prevalence rate as low as a 0,02%-0,1% (i.e. between 2 virus shedders per 10000 and 1 virus shedder per 1000). The wastewater testing method was used to monitor a Danish Community after a COVID-19 outbreak and it was shown that the method can be used as a semi-quantitative method to monitor the development of an outbreak.","Jorgensen, A.

Based on existing evidence, neurologists should recommend COVID-19 vaccination to their patients. For those patients being treated with immunotherapies, attention should be paid to timing of vaccination with respect to treatment and the potential for an attenuated immune response.","Marsh, Elisabeth B; Kornberg, Michael; Kessler, Kevin; Haq, Ihtsham; Patel, Anup D; Nath, Avindra; Schierman, Becky; Jones, Lyell K",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326180/,409

The changes in the food production and supply processes introduce changes to the global dietary patterns. SCOPE AND APPROACH: To study the COVID-19 impact on food consumption process, we have analyzed two data sets that consist of food preparation recipes published before (69,444) and during the quarantine (10,009) period. Since working with large data sets is a time-consuming task, we have applied a recently proposed artificial intelligence approach called DietHub. The approach uses the recipe preparation description (i.e. text) and automatically provides a list of main ingredients annotated using the Hansard semantic tags. After extracting the semantic tags of the ingredients for every recipe, we have compared the food consumption patterns between the two data sets by comparing the relative frequency of the ingredients that compose the recipes. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using the AI methodology, the changes in the food consumption patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic are obvious. The highest positive difference in the food consumption can be found in foods such as “Pulses/ plants producing pulses”, “Pancake/Tortilla/Outcake”, and “Soup/pottage”, which increase by 300%, 280%, and 100%, respectively. Conversely, the largest decrease in consumption can be food for food such as “Order Perciformes (type of fish)”, “Corn/cereals/grain”, and “Wine-making”, with a reduction of 50%, 40%, and 30%, respectively. This kind of analysis is valuable in times of crisis and emergencies, which is a very good example of the scientific support that regulators require in order to take quick and appropriate response.","Eftimov, Tome; Popovski, Gorjan; Petković, Matej; Seljak, Barbara Koroušić; Kocev, Dragi",Trends Food Sci Technol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924224420305823; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224420305823?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905099/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.08.017,409

Mentors provide guidance and structure to junior faculty so that they can meet their academic and professional goals. Mentors also convey skills in balancing life and academic pursuits. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive study was to provide additional insight from a training program called Leading Emerging and Diverse Scientists to Success (LEADS) regarding successful strategies and challenges of mentoring relating to lessons learned from the scholars and mentees’ perspective. The LEADS program provided multiple training platforms to increase skills and knowledge regarding research to promote expertise in grant writing and submission for funding opportunities among diverse scientists. These findings reinforce the knowledge about the value of a mentor in helping define the research pathway of their mentee and underscoring the importance of mentoring.","Talbert, Patricia Y.; Perry, George; Ricks-Santi, Luisel; Soto de Laurido, Lourdes E.; Shaheen, Magda; Seto, Todd; Kumar, Deepak; Quarshie, Alexander; Thakar, Maya; Rubio, Doris M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200278/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116155,409
690475,PIN90 Characteristics of Patients Died Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hungary,2020-12-31,"AIMS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess various antidiabetic agents’ association with mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed comprehensive literature retrieval from the date of inception until February 2, 2021, in medical databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library), regarding mortality outcomes in patients with T2DM who have COVID-19. Pooled OR and 95% CI data were used to assess relationships between antidiabetic agents and mortality. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 17,338 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Metformin (pooled OR, 0.69; P=0.001) and sulfonylurea (pooled OR, 0.80; P=0.016) were associated with lower mortality risk in patients with T2DM who had COVID-19. However, patients with T2DM who had COVID-19 and received insulin exhibited greater mortality (pooled OR, 2.20; P=0.002). Mortality did not significantly differ (pooled OR, 0.72; P=0.057) between DPP-4 inhibitor users and non-users. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin and sulfonylurea could be associated with reduced mortality risk in patients with T2DM who have COVID-19. Furthermore, insulin use could be associated with greater mortality, while DPP-4 inhibitor use could not be. The effects of antidiabetic agents in patients with T2DM who have COVID-19 require further exploration.

690525,A rare manifestation of indolent systemic mastocytosis and its management during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; educational lessons from Syria,2021-01-21,"We have previously described a synthetic T7-driven cDNA minigenome containing the antisense sequence of luciferase gene and internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus flanked by 5′- and 3′-end sequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) that contain cis-acting replication elements. Synthesis of minus-strand RNA from the artificial minigenome was determined by using Huh-7 cells harboring autonomously replicating HCV subgenome as a helper for provision of functional replication components. To further confirm and extend these studies, we investigated here whether the minigenome replication system could be reconstituted by transfection of naïve Huh-7 cells with plasmid expressing nonstructural (NS) proteins. Reporter assay and Northern blot analysis revealed that trans-expression of NS proteins from 3 to 5 resulted in high level of luciferase activity and synthesized minus-strand RNA. The analogous result was also obtained with the minigenome derived from HCV 2a, and both HCV 1b- and 2a-derived NS protein were able to support the chimeric minigenomes whose 5′- or 3′-end was replaced by the respective region of the heterologous virus. These results provide a basis for establishing the reverse genetic system that is helpful to study cis- and trans-acting factors involved in HCV RNA replication.","Zhang, Jing; Yamada, Osamu; Yoshida, Hiroshi; Sakamoto, Takashi; Araki, Hiromasa; Shimotohno, Kunitada",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X0602451X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112469/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0602451X,409
