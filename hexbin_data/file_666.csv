To avoid further exacerbation of these crises, profound transformative processes in all sectors of society are needed (e.g. transport, energy production, and food systems). Based on the ethical imperative of non-maleficence and the high levels of trust in society, health professionals have great potential to make an important contribution to the necessary transformative processes. In order to fully harness this potential, health professionals should be supported in developing competencies to take transformative action during their pre- and postgraduate education and professional training. In this article, we introduce the concept of planetary health, as this concept provides orientation for this both ethically and with regards to the subject matter. Furthermore, we provide an overview of current teaching and learning formats and identify aspects that could contribute to further developing planetary health education.","Wabnitz, Katharina; Galle, Sophia; Hegge, Louise; Masztalerz, Oskar; Schwienhorst-Stich, Eva‑Maria; Eichinger, Michael",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,666,20

However, because de novo molecular generation methods rely on abundant known molecules, generated molecules may have a problem of novelty. Novelty is important in highly competitive areas of medicinal chemistry, such as the discovery of kinase inhibitors. In this study, de novo molecular generation based on recurrent neural networks was applied to discover a new chemical space of kinase inhibitors. During the application, the practicality was evaluated, and new inspiration was found. With the successful discovery of one potent Pim1 inhibitor and two lead compounds that inhibit CDK4, AI-based molecular generation shows potentials in drug discovery and development.

However, the drug delivery is limited owing to the barrier created by the stratum corneum. Microneedles are a transdermal drug delivery system that is painless, less invasive, and easy to self-administer, with a high drug bioavailability. AREA COVERED: The dose, delivery rate, and efficacy of the drugs can be controlled by the microneedle design and drug formulations. This review introduces the types of microneedles and their design, materials used for fabrication, and manufacturing methods. Additionally, recent biological applications and clinical trials are introduced. EXPERT OPINION: With advancements made in formulation technologies, the drug-loading capability of microneedles can be improved. 3D printing and digital technology contribute to the improvement of microneedle fabrication technology. However, regulations regarding the manufacture of microneedle products should be established as soon as possible to promote commercialization.","Jung, Jae Hwan; Jin, Sung Giu",J Pharm Investig,666,3

A total of 1,899 noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) images of cerebral hemorrhage patients were retrospectively analyzed to establish a predicting model and 1,117 to validate the model. And a total of 118 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria so as to validate the value of the model for clinical prediction. The baseline noncontrast computed tomography images within 6 h of intracerebral hemorrhage onset and the second noncontrast computed tomography performed at 24 ± 3 h from the onset were used to evaluate the prediction of intracerebral hemorrhage growth. In validation dataset 1, the AUC was 0.778 (95% CI, 0.768–0.786), the sensitivity was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.790–0.843), and the specificity was 0.601 (95% CI, 0.565–0.632). In validation dataset 2, the AUC was 0.780 (95% CI, 0.761–0.798), the sensitivity was 0.732 (95% CI, 0.682–0.788), and the specificity was 0.709 (95% CI, 0.658–0.759). The sensitivity of intracerebral hemorrhage hematoma expansion as predicted by an artificial intelligence imaging system was 89.3%, with a specificity of 77.8%, a positive predictive value of 55.6%, a negative predictive value of 95.9%, and a Yoden index of 0.671, which were much higher than those based on the manually labeled noncontrast computed tomography signs. Compared with the existing prediction methods through computed tomographic angiography (CTA) image features and noncontrast computed tomography image features analysis, the artificial intelligence model has higher specificity and sensitivity in the prediction of early hematoma enlargement in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.","Teng, Linyang; Ren, Qianwei; Zhang, Pingye; Wu, Zhenzhou; Guo, Wei; Ren, Tianhua",Front Aging Neurosci,666,22

Most prior studies of companions in clinical encounters focus on non-Hispanic White patients. However, there is generally lower-quality patient-physician communication during encounters with Black patients; these communication differences may contribute to racial health disparities. The purpose of the present study was to examine effects of the presence and active participation of companions on encounters between Black patients with cancer and non-Black oncologists. METHODS This was a secondary analysis of data collected during a larger intervention study. Participants were Black patients with breast, colon, or lung cancer who had a treatment-discussion encounter with a participating non-Black medical oncologist. Video recordings of encounters were coded for patient, companion, and oncologist communication. After the encounter, patients reported perceptions of the recommended treatment; patients and oncologists reported perceptions of each other. RESULTS Data from 114 patients and 19 oncologists were included in analyses. Only 47% of patients brought a companion to the encounter. Oncologists spent more time with accompanied Black patients, used more patient-centered communication with them, and perceived them as having more social support compared with unaccompanied Black patients. Oncologists reported that accompanied patients asked more questions. When companions participated more actively in the encounter, oncologists used more patient-centered communication. DISCUSSION Bringing a companion to oncology appointments may be beneficial to Black patients because oncologists spend more time with patients, use more patient-centered communication, and perceive patients more positively, all of which may ultimately improve patient health and well-being outcomes.","Otto, Amy K; Reblin, Maija; Harper, Felicity W K; Hamel, Lauren M; Moore, Tanina F; Ellington, Lee; Eggly, Susan",JCO oncology practice,666,24
66134,66134,66134,A pregnant woman and the SARS-CoV-2 infection: how are barriers easily crossed?,11.67077,11.417472,2020-04-01,"We use a new method based on the Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM) to perform quantitative measurements of the dielectric constants of individual electrospun nanofibers of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), as well as composite fibers of PLLA with embedded multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-PLLA). The EFM data record the oscillation phase of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever as a function of the AFM tip position. In our experiments the relative dielectric constants of the sample are measured from the EFM phase shifts vs. the tip-surface separation, according to a simple analytical model describing the tip-surface interactions. We perform a comprehensive study of how the dielectric constant depends on the fiber diameter for both electrospun PLLA and MWCNT/PLLA fiber composites. Our measurements show that EFM can distinguish between dielectric properties of PLLA fibers and fiber composites with different diameters. Dielectric constants of both PLLA and MWCNT-PLLA composite fibers decrease with increasing fiber diameter. In the limit of large fiber diameters (D > 100 nm), we measure dielectric constants in the range:  = 3.4-3.8, similar to the values obtained for unoriented PLLA films:film = 2.4-3.8. Moreover, the dielectric constants of the small diameter MWCNT-PLLA composites are significantly larger than the corresponding values obtained for PLLA fibers. For MWCNT-PLLA nanofiber composites of small diameters (D < 50 nm),  approaches the values measured for neat MWCNT:CN = 12 ± 2. These results are consistent with a simple fiber structural model that shows higher polarizability of thinner fibers, and composites that contain MWCNTs. The experimental method has a high-resolution for measuring the dielectric constant of soft materials, and is simple to implement on standard atomic force microscopes. This non-invasive technique can be applied to measure the electrical properties of polymers, interphases, and polymer nanocomposites.","Yurchenko, Ilya; Jayasekara, Anuja; Cebe, Peggy; Staii, Cristian",Nanotechnology,666,24

METHODS Case numbers from calendar weeks 1 through 22 of the two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 were obtained from 29 university hospitals and 7 non-university hospitals in Germany. Information was also obtained on the patients' age, sex, and urgency, along with the type of case (outpatient/inpatient), admitting ward, and a small number of tracer diagnoses (I21, myocardial infarction; J44, COPD; and I61, I63, I64, G45, stroke /TIA), as well as on the number of COVID-19 cases and of tests performed for SARS-CoV-2, as a measure of the number of cases in which COVID-19 was suspected or at least included in the differential diagnoses. RESULTS A total of 1 022 007 emergency room consultations were analyzed, of which 546 940 took place in 2019 and 475 067 in 2020. The number of consultations with a positive test for the COVID-19 pathogen was 3122. The total number of emergency room consultations in the observation period was 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a maximum drop by 38% coinciding with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (calendar week 14; 572 cases). After the initiation of interpersonal contact restrictions in 2020, there was a marked drop in COVID-19 case numbers, by a mean of -240 cases per week per emergency room (95% confidence interval [-284; -128]). There was a rise in case numbers thereafter, by a mean of 17 patients per week [14; 19], and the number of cases of myocardial infarction returned fully to the level seen in 2019. CONCLUSION In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in medical emergencies of all kinds presenting to the nation's emergency departments. A recovery effect began to be seen as early as calendar week 15, but the levels seen in 2019 were not yet reached overall by calendar week 22; only the prevalence of myocardial infarction had renormalized by then. The reasons for this require further investigation.","Slagman, Anna; Behringer, Wilhelm; Greiner, Felix; Klein, Matthias; Weismann, Dirk; Erdmann, Bernadett; Pigorsch, Mareen; Möckel, Martin",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,666,1

However, this term is neither a scientific nor an epidemiologic classification that is helpful in describing either the source or the mode of transmission in outbreaks. In this paper, the authors provide examples of how and when the public health community has recognized potentially flawed or misleading taxonomy in the past and taken steps to improve the taxonomy's accuracy and usefulness. We also offer examples of alternative terms for classifying outbreaks since inaccurate descriptions of outbreaks could potentially lead to a flawed or incomplete set of underlying assumptions about the outbreak's causal factors. This, in turn, could lead to implementing a flawed or incomplete intervention or response strategy which could extend the duration of the outbreak, resulting in avoidable morbidity and mortality.","Posid, Joseph M; Goodman, Richard A; Khan, Ali S",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,666,16

The purpose of this review is to characterize how the CFIR has been applied in LMIC contexts, to evaluate the utility of specific constructs to global implementation science research, and to identify opportunities to refine the CFIR to optimize utility in LMIC settings. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed to evaluate the use of the CFIR in LMICs. Citation searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. Data abstraction included study location, study design, phase of implementation, manner of implementation (ex., data analysis), domains and constructs used, and justifications for use, among other variables. A standardized questionnaire was sent to the corresponding authors of included studies to determine which CFIR domains and constructs authors found to be compatible with use in LMICs and to solicit feedback regarding ways in which CFIR performance could be improved for use in LMICs. RESULTS Our database search yielded 504 articles, of which 34 met final inclusion criteria. The studies took place across 21 countries and focused on 18 different health topics. The studies primarily used qualitative study designs (68%). Over half (59%) of the studies applied the CFIR at study endline, primarily to guide data analysis or to contextualize study findings. Nineteen (59%) of the contacted authors participated in the survey. Authors unanimously identified culture and engaging as compatible with use in global implementation research. Only two constructs, patient needs and resources and individual stages of change were commonly identified as incompatible with use. Author feedback centered on team level influences on implementation, as well as systems characteristics, such as health system architecture. We propose a ""Characteristics of Systems"" domain and eleven novel constructs be added to the CFIR to increase its compatibility for use in LMICs. CONCLUSIONS These additions provide global implementation science practitioners opportunities to account for systems-level determinants operating independently of the implementing organization. Newly proposed constructs require further reliability and validity assessments.

DESIGN Quasi-experimental study with the rate of nosocomial respiratory virus infection as the primary dependent variable and rate of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection as a nonequivalent dependent variable comparator. SETTING Cohen Children's Medical Center of NY, a tertiary-care children's hospital attached to a large general hospital. INTERVENTION During years 1 and 2 (July 2012 through June 2014), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee's recommended isolation precautions for inpatients with selected respiratory virus infections were in effect. Enhanced isolation precautions were in effect during years 3 and 4 (July, 2014 through June, 2016), except for influenza, for which enhanced precautions were in effect during year 4 only. RESULTS During the period of enhanced isolation precautions, the rate of nosocomial respiratory virus infections with any of 4 virus categories decreased 39% from 0.827 per 1,000 hospital days prior to enhanced precautions to 0.508 per 1,000 hospital days (P<.0013).

Recognition of dsRNA byproducts released from apoptotic and necrotic cells is a recently proposed mechanism for the amplification of toxicity, suggesting a pivotal participation of TLR3 in viral infection, as well as in lung diseases where apoptosis plays a critical role, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to metabolic control, insulin signaling was postulated to be protective by inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, we explored the role of insulin signaling in protecting against TLR3-mediated apoptosis of human bronchial epithelial cells. Significant TLR3-mediated apoptosis was induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, a dsRNA analog, via caspase-8-dependent mechanisms. However, insulin efficiently inhibited TLR3/polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced human bronchial epithelial cell apoptosis via PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways, at least in part, via upregulation of cellular FLIPs and through protein synthesis-independent mechanisms. These results indicate the significance of TLR3-mediated dsRNA-induced apoptosis in the pathogenesis of apoptosis-driven lung disease and provide evidence for a novel protective role of insulin.","Numata, Takanori; Araya, Jun; Fujii, Satoko; Hara, Hiromichi; Takasaka, Naoki; Kojima, Jun; Minagawa, Shunsuke; Yumino, Yoko; Kawaishi, Makoto; Hirano, Jun; Odaka, Makoto; Morikawa, Toshiaki; Nishimura, Stephen L; Nakayama, Katsutoshi; Kuwano, Kazuyoshi",Journal of immunology,666,4

They have been extensively produced since 1940s due to enormous applications as a surface-active agent, and water and oil repellent characteristics. PFASs are made to be non-biodegradable, therefore, many of them have been found in the environment albeit strict regulations have been in place since 2002. PFASs are extremely toxic compounds that can impart harm in both fauna and flora. Recent investigations have shown that wetlands might be useful for their removal from the environment as a passive and nature-based solution. To this end, understanding the role of plants, microbes, and their combined plant-microbe interplay is crucial because it could help design a sophisticated passive treatment wetland system. This review focuses on how these components (plants, microbe, substrate) can influence PFASs removal in wetlands under natural and controlled conditions. The information on underlying removal mechanisms is mostly retrieved from laboratory-based studies; however, pilot- and field-scale data are also presented to provide insights on their real-time performance. Briefly, a traditional wetland system works on the principles of phytouptake, bioaccumulation, and sorption, which are mainly due to the fact that PFASs are synthetic compounds that have very low reactivity in the environment. Nevertheless, recent investigations have also shown that Feammox process in wetlands can mineralize the PFASs; thus, opens new opportunities for PFASs degradation in terms of effective plant-microbe interplay in the wetlands. The choice of plants and bacterial species is however crucial, and the system efficiency relies on species-specific, sediment-specific and pollutant-specific principles. More research is encouraged to identify genetic elements and molecular mechanisms that can help us harness effective plant-microbe interplay in wetlands for the successful removal of PFASs from the environment.","Arslan, Muhammad; Gamal El-Din, Mohamed",The Science of the total environment,666,5

Case Report. This case report discusses the induction of a thermal ureteral injury associated with the use of LigaSure. An 80-year-old gentleman was operated for bowel cancer. LigaSure was used for securing haemostasis and tissue dissection. Postoperatively, he was found to have damage to the right ureter secondary to lateral spread of energy from the jaws of LigaSure with high abdominal drain output. Conclusion. Judicious and careful use of electrosurgical devices should be done to prevent inadvertent damage to the surrounding structures. Early recognition and involvement of a urologist can prevent long-term complications.","Tahir, Muazzam; Gilkison, William",Case reports in urology,666,1

We conducted an updated systematic review to incorporate studies published between January 2009 and June 2017 to examine the relationship between HCs and incident or recurrent STIs. METHODS We searched PubMed and EMBASE to identify prospective studies comparing risk of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Treponema pallidum, or Trichomonas vaginalis, between women using HC versus nonhormonal methods or no methods. We summarize results by type of STI and HC and study quality using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. RESULTS Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria. Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) reduces the risk of trichomoniasis (consistent evidence) and may increase the risk of HSV-2 (strong effect, few studies); inconclusive evidence exists for HPV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Data on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs; generally not differentiated whether combined or progestin-only pills) suggest that use is associated with a reduced risk of trichomoniasis with inconclusive findings for HSV-2, HPV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Very few studies included norethisterone enanthate (Net-En) injectable, implants or the levonorgestrel intrauterine device. CONCLUSIONS Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate and OCPs reduce the risk of trichomoniasis and DMPA may increase the risk of HSV-2. However, the potential for confounding cannot be ruled out. Future studies should specify the type of injectable or OCP used to increase understanding of biological pathways; more research is needed on implants and hormonal intrauterine devices.","McCarthy, Katharine J; Gollub, Erica L; Ralph, Lauren; van de Wijgert, Janneke; Jones, Heidi E",Sexually transmitted diseases,666,1

PURPOSE The study aimed to describe a perfusion-based cadaveric simulation model with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reconstitution and to compare spine dural repair techniques. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING The study is set in a fresh tissue dissection laboratory. SAMPLE SIZE The sample includes eight fresh human cadavers. OUTCOME MEASURES A watertight closure was achieved when pressurized saline up to 40 mm Hg did not cause further CSF leakage beyond the suture lines. METHODS Fresh human cadaveric specimens underwent cannulation of the intradural cervical spine for intrathecal reconstitution of the CSF system. The cervicothoracic dura was then exposed from C7-T12 via laminectomy. The entire dura was then opened in six cadavers (ALLSPINE) and closed with 6-0 Prolene (n=3) or 4-0 Nurolon (n=3), and pressurized with saline via a perfusion system to 60 mm Hg to check for leakage. In two cadavers (INCISION), six separate 2-cm incisions were made and closed with either 6-0 Prolene or 4-0 Nurolon, and then pressurized. A hydrogel sealant was then added and the closure was pressurized again to check for further leakage. RESULTS Spinal laminectomy with repair of intentional durotomy was successfully performed in eight cadavers. The operative microscope was used in all cases, and the model provided a realistic experience of spinal durotomy repair. For ALLSPINE cadavers (mean: 240 mm dura/cadaver repaired), the mean pressure threshold for CSF leakage was observed at 66.7 (±2.9) mm Hg in the 6-0 Prolene group and at 43.3 (±14.4) mm Hg in the 4-0 Nurolon group (p>.05). For INCISION cadavers, the mean pressure threshold for CSF leakage without hydrogel sealant was significantly higher in 6-0 Prolene group than in the 4-0 Nurolon group (6-0 Prolene: 80.0±4.5 mm Hg vs. 4-0 Nurolon: 32.5±2.7 mm Hg; p<.01). The mean pressure threshold for CSF leakage with the hydrogel sealants was not significantly different (6-0 Prolene: 100.0±0.0 mm Hg vs. 4-0 Nurolon: 70.0±33.1 mm Hg). The use of a hydrogel sealant significantly increased the pressure thresholds for possible CSF leakage in both the 6-0 Prolene group (p=.01) and the 4-0 Nurolon group (p<.01) when compared with mean pressures without the hydrogel sealant. CONCLUSIONS We described the feasibility of using a novel cadaveric model for both the study and training of watertight dural closure techniques. 6-0 Prolene was observed to be superior to 4-0 Nurolon for watertight dural closure without a hydrogel sealant. The use of a hydrogel sealant significantly improved watertight dural closures for both 6-0 Prolene and 4-0 Nurolon groups in the cadaveric model.","Bakhsheshian, Joshua; Strickland, Ben A; Patel, Neil N; Jakoi, Andre M; Minneti, Michael; Zada, Gabriel; Acosta, Frank L; Hsieh, Patrick C; Wang, Jeffrey C; Liu, John C; Pham, Martin H",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,666,17

For example, a double dissociation between grasping and between perceptual estimates was reported in previous experiments that pit real against illusory object size differences in the context of the Ponzo illusion. While most previous research on the relation between action and perception focused on one-handed grasping, everyday visuomotor interactions also entail the simultaneous use of both hands to grasp objects that are larger in size. Here, we examined whether this double dissociation extends to bimanual movement control. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with different-sized objects embedded in the Ponzo Illusion. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the dissociation between perception and action extends to a different illusion, the Wundt-Jastrow illusion, which has not been previously used in grasping experiments. In both experiments, bimanual grasping trajectories reflected the differences in physical size between the objects; At the same time, perceptual estimates reflected the differences in illusory size between the objects. These results suggest that the double dissociation between action and perception generalizes to bimanual movement control. Unlike conscious perception, bimanual grasping movements are tuned to real-world metrics, and can potentially resist irrelevant information on relative size and depth.","Ozana, Aviad; Ganel, Tzvi",Scientific reports,666,24

However, many patients are skeptical about having several surgeries, as they may result in additional anesthesiological risks as well as multiple visible scars. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of prophylactic mastectomy and breast reconstruction combined with simultaneous transmammary salpingo-oophorectomy for BRCA carriers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of the six patients (1 %) who chose prophylactic mastectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy at our hospital four patients had BRCA-1 mutations, one patient had a BRCA-2 mutation and one patient had a family inheritance pattern with no mutations. All patients chose to reduce their risk for mammary and ovarian cancer by undergoing bilateral mastectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was performed, followed by bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with a procedure that relies on transmammary access and reduces the number of necessary surgeries without compromising cosmetic results, surgical risks and operating time. RESULT The mean age of the patients was 46.7 ± 1.8 years (SD). The mean operative time was 190.2 ± 13.7 min. No complications were observed during the operations. The mean intra-operative loss of blood was 363.3 ± 77.9 ml. The operative method was successful in all six cases and was performed with no complications. All of the patients were satisfied with the cosmetic results. CONCLUSION In conclusion, prophylactic mastectomy and breast reconstruction combined with simultaneous laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy via transmammary access is feasible, easy to perform and provides an intriguing and novel approach to female BRCA carriers who desire operative prophylactic measures in one surgical session with no visible abdominal scars and no additional risks and complications.","Perabò, Marta; Fink, Visnja; Günthner-Biller, Maria; von Bodungen, Vera; Friese, Klaus; Dian, Darius",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,666,1

From an agricultural perspective, their accumulation in crops from contaminated soil threatens food security and quality, leading to many diseases in humans. The Cucurbitaceae family can accumulate high concentrations of hydrophobic pollutants in their aerial parts. The Cucurbitaceae family contains major latex-like proteins (MLPs) as transporting factors for hydrophobic pollutants. MLP genes are expressed in the roots in which the MLPs bind hydrophobic pollutants. MLPs transport these hydrophobic pollutants to the aerial parts of the plant through the xylem vessels. As a result, hydrophobic pollutant contamination occurs in the Cucurbitaceae family. In this study, we suppressed the expression of MLP genes in the roots and reduced the amounts of MLPs with pesticide treatments. First, the fungicides Benlate and Daconil that deceased the hydrophobic pollutant, perylene, concentration in the xylem sap of zucchini plants were selected. Daconil suppressed the transcription activity of MLP in the roots. In the Daconil treatment, the amount of MLPs in the roots and xylem sap of zucchini plants was decreased, and the concentrations of the hydrophobic pollutants, pyrene and dieldrin, were significantly decreased.

We sought to identify risk factors of post-hospital discharge VTE events following colorectal surgery. METHODS The NSQIP database was utilized to examine patients developed VTE after hospital discharge following colorectal surgery during 2005-2013. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to quantify risk factors of VTE after discharge. RESULTS We evaluated a total of 219,477 patients underwent colorectal resections. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.1 % (4556). 33.8 % (1541) of all VTE events occurred after hospital discharge. The length of postoperative hospitalization had a strong association with post-discharge VTE, with the highest risk in patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after operation (AOR 9.08, P < 0.01). Other factors associated with post-discharge VTE included chronic steroid use (AOR 1.81, P < 0.01), stage 4 colorectal cancer (AOR 1.40, P = 0.03), obesity (AOR 1.37, P < 0.01), age >70 (AOR 1.21, P = 0.04), and open surgery (AOR 1.36, P < 0.01). Patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after an open colorectal resections had a 12 times higher risk of post-discharge VTE event compared to patients hospitalized less than 4 days after a laparoscopic resection (AOR 12.34, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS VTE is uncommon following colorectal resections; however, a significant proportion occurs after patients are discharged from the hospital (33.8 %). The length of postoperative hospitalization appears to have a strong association with post-discharge VTE. High-risk patients may benefit from continued VTE prophylaxis after discharge.","Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin; Alizadeh, Reza Fazl; Hanna, Mark H; Hwang, Grace; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Pigazzi, Alessio; Stamos, Michael J",World journal of surgery,666,12

However, little is known about how socially anxious individuals use this technology. Here, we examined the visual attention patterns of high and low socially anxious individuals during a live interaction with a study confederate using a typical online VMC setup. METHODS High (n = 30) and low (n = 30) socially anxious participants completed a VMC-based social interaction task comprised of two parts: A one-on-one acquaintance interview followed by a one-on-one short presentation assignment. State anxiety was measured before and after the task, and gaze data was collected throughout. RESULTS High socially anxious participants experienced elevated anxiety following the interaction task, whereas no elevation was observed for low socially anxious participants. Gaze data revealed that high socially anxious participants dwelled longer on the confederate's image during the acquaintance interview compared with the presentation task, and dwelled longer on non-face areas during the presentation relative to during the acquaintance interview. This task-related gaze pattern was not observed among low socially anxious participants. LIMITATIONS An analog sample was used in this study and future research should replicate its findings in a clinical sample. Future studies may also wish to counterbalance confederate's gender and task order across participants. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that during VMC, socially anxious individuals observe their environment differently than non-socially anxious individuals, depending on the context of the interaction. This context-dependency might help explain mixed findings in previous studies. Further theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","Azriel, Omer; Lazarov, Amit; Segal, Adva; Bar-Haim, Yair",Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry,666,17

The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of different NMS therapies and to analyze its outcome depending on NMS severity. METHOD Systematic search for NMS cases in biomedical databases. The focus of the analysis was on therapy with dantrolene, bromocriptine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) when each was compared with symptomatic therapy. Primary outcomes were the survival rate and the duration of treatment. RESULT 405 case reports were included. Overall, no statistically significant differences regarding mortality rate or duration of treatment were found between dantrolene, bromocriptine or ECT compared to supportive care. A subgroup analysis regarding NMS severity showed that the mortality under specific NMS pharmacotherapy (dantrolene, bromocriptine) and under ECT was significantly lower than under purely symptomatic therapy in severe NMS (p = 0.018). The difference was not significant in mild and moderate cases. DISCUSSION An overall superiority of the specific NMS therapy (dantrolene, bromocriptine and ECT) was not found in this study. When regarding severity classification, specific therapies were superior but only in severe cases, and ECT showed the lowest mortality rate. In previous case-series, an effect on survival or the duration of the disease could only be observed in part for specific therapies, but the evidence available is inconsistent. The results of this study support our hypothesis that NMS treatment with dantrolene, bromocriptine and ECT is advantageous over purely symptomatic therapy in severe NMS cases.","Kuhlwilm, Lilli; Schönfeldt-Lecuona, Carlos; Gahr, Maximilian; Connemann, Bernhard J; Keller, Ferdinand; Sartorius, Alexander",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,666,19

Modeling diffusion processes and predicting future events are crucial in many applications including epidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes offer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the influence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However, the triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced by the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the diffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also the current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness of the disease and people's current interests. In this paper, we propose a novel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of community states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of events based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic function that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks. Then we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its integral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a flexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities' states, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood, which makes parameter learning tractable. Extensive experiments on four real-world event datasets show that DHP outperforms five widely adopted methods for event prediction.","Okawa, Maya; Iwata, Tomoharu; Tanaka, Yusuke; Toda, Hiroyuki; Kurashima, Takeshi; Kashima, Hisashi",,666,20

The paper considers the conceptual principles of combining the bases of transparency and confidentiality of personal life and the need to track personal contacts, substantiates the need for such a combination and provides a possible technical solution using blockchain technology. The practical development and deployment of the system based on such protocols will allow each citizen to track the personal history of probable contact with infected persons or other potential risks (including deciding on the need for self-isolation or additional examination).

In this paper, the legal, environmental, economic, and social aspects related to water management in Ecuador are analyzed. In doing so, the incorporation of local governance structures such as water users’ associations (WUAs) are characterized within a national model of authorization under SENAGUA, Ecuador’s former water agency, highlighting the importance of integrated management for meeting the country’s geographically and environmentally diverse needs. Additionally, the role of anthropogenic activities such as crude oil production, artisanal and small-scale gold (ASGM) mining, agriculture, sewage discharge, and domestic practices are evaluated in the context of policy implementation and environmental quality concerns. Finally, individual and community-level responses are explored, highlighting the importance of geographically specific perceptions of water rights and quality in the adoption of coping strategies. In these ways, a multi-faceted analysis of Ecuadorian water policy shaped by community-level engagement, geographic diversity, and influential economic sectors is developed. This study highlights the need for increased financial and legislative support around extractive and polluting industries such as agriculture, ASGM, and sewage treatment for long-term safety and sustainability of water access in Ecuador. Additionally, increased efforts to educate industry-specific workers, local management boards, and individuals about potential solutions to water-related challenges will help improve the efficiency of current legislation. Finally, this study underscores a need for additional research related to water quality and sustainability in Ecuador, as well as for the social, economic, and environmentally specific factors that influence water security outcomes in the country.","Wingfield, Sarah Martínez-Moscoso Andrés Quiroga Diego Ochoa-Herrera Valeria",Water,666,7

Currently, there is little research characterizing loneliness and race. To investigate how HIV impacts older (age 50+) PLWH in the US, a study called Aging with Dignity, Health, Optimism and Community (ADHOC) was launched at ten sites to collect self-reported data. This study uses ADHOC data to compare loneliness between older Black and White PLWH. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was performed to compare loneliness between older Black and White PLWH. Loneliness was assessed using the Three-item Loneliness Scale, a validated patient-reported outcome measure (range 3-9), with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. Student's t-test was used to compare loneliness between White and Black people. Control variables for loneliness were identified a priori and included in a multivariable linear regression model. Results Of 868 participants, the average age was 60 (SD 6.2) years, 77% (N=671) were White and 23% (N=197) were Black, 85% were male, and 82% were gay or lesbian. In bivariate analyses, Black participants were less lonely than White participants (5.2 vs 5.6, P=.02). In the multivariable linear regression analysis, Black participants were again less lonely than Whites (coef. -0.45, P=0.01) while controlling for age, education, depression, anxiety, number of co-morbid conditions, being single, income, gender, sexual orientation, and spirituality (Adjusted R2=0.38;P<.01). Conclusion Among PLWH over age 50 in ADHOC, Black participants experienced less loneliness than White participants, even after controlling for a variety of factors. Additional research is needed to better understand the causes of these racial differences, so that programs designed to decrease loneliness among PLWH can consider the unique characteristics of each group.","Berko, J.; Loo, T.; MacLaren, L.; Huhn, G.; Nwafor, T.; Spinelli, F.; Zolopa, A.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,666,33

Therefore, following changes in desert soil bacterial communities during hydration-desiccation cycles in the field, was seldom attempted. Here, we assessed rain-mediated dynamics of active community in the Negev Desert biological soil crust (biocrust), and evaluated the changes in bacterial composition, potential function, and photosynthetic activity. We predicted that increased biocrust moisture would resuscitate the phototrophs, while desiccation would inhibit their activity. Our results show that hydration increased chlorophyll content, resuscitated the biocrust Cyanobacteria, and induced potential phototrophic functions. However, decrease in the soil water content did not immediately decrease the phototrophs activity, though chlorophyll levels decreased. Moreover, while the Cyanobacteria relative abundance significantly increased, Actinobacteria, the former dominant taxa, significantly decreased in abundance. We propose that, following a rain event biocrust moisture significantly decreased, almost to drought levels, yet the response of the active bacterial community lagged, in contrast to topsoil. Possible explanations to the described rain-mediated bacteria dynamics are discussed.","Baubin, Capucine; Ran, Noya; Siebner, Hagar; Gillor, Osnat",bioRxiv,666,2

Heterozygous variants of SETD1A involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation were previously identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we define the clinical features of the Mendelian syndrome associated with haploinsufficiency of SETD1A by investigating 15 predominantly pediatric individuals who all have de novo SETD1A variants. These individuals present with a core set of symptoms comprising global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, subtle facial dysmorphisms, behavioral and psychiatric problems. We examined cellular phenotypes in three patient derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with three variants: p.Gly535Alafs*12, c.4582-2_4582delAG, and p.Tyr1499Asp. These patient cell lines displayed DNA damage repair defects that were comparable to previously observed RNAi-mediated depletion of SETD1A. This suggested that these variants, including the p.Tyr1499Asp in the catalytic SET domain, behave as Loss-of-Function (LoF) alleles. Previous studies demonstrated a role for SETD1A in cell cycle control and differentiation. However, individuals with SETD1A variants do not show major structural brain defects or severe microcephaly, suggesting that defective proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors is unlikely the single underlying cause of the disorder. We show here that the Drosophila Melanogaster SETD1A orthologue is required in postmitotic neurons of the fly brain for normal memory, suggesting a role in post development neuronal function. Together, this study defines a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dominant de novo LoF variants in SETD1A and further supports a role for H3K4 methyltransferases in the regulation of neuronal processes underlying normal cognitive functioning.","Kummeling, Joost; Stremmelaar, Diante E; Raun, Nicholas; Reijnders, Margot RF; Willemsen, Marjolein H; Ruiterkamp-Versteeg, Martina; Schepens, Marga; Man, Calvin CO; Gilissen, Christian; Cho, Megan T; McWalter, Kirsty; Sinnema, Margje; Wheless, James W; Simon, Marleen EH; Genetti, Casie A; Casey, Alicia M; Terhal, Paulien A; van der Smagt, Jasper J; van Gassen, Koen L; Joset, Pascal; Bahr, Angela; Steindl, Katharina; Rauch, Anita; Keller, Elmar; Raas-Rothschild, Annick; Koolen, David A; Agrawal, Pankaj B; Hoffman, Trevor L; Powell-Hamilton, Nina N; Thiffault, Isabelle; Engleman, Kendra; Zhou, Dihong; Bodamer, Olaf; Hoefele, Julia; Riedhammer, Korbinian M; Schwaibold, Eva MC; Tasic, Velibor; Schubert, Dirk; Top, Deniz; Pfundt, Rolph; Higgs, Martin R; Kramer, Jamie M; Kleefstra, Tjitske",bioRxiv,666,19

For this reason, it is recommended to continue b/ tsDMARD treatments with maximum compliance with pandemic measures. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of patients using b/tsDMARDs on drug survival and rheumatic disease control during pandemic. Methods: In this study, patients diagnosed with rheumatic disease using b/tsDMARDs and who were followed up during the 12-month period (January 2020-2021) including the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic at Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine Rheumatology Clinic were evaluated. In the first 3 months of the pandemic (March-June 2020), the patients skipped at least 2 cycles of treatment with the fear of Covid-19 infection except for infection / surgical reasons was considered as a disruption of the drug. The drug retention rates of the patients on b/tsDMARDs treatments during the pandemic process and the factors affecting this situation were evaluated. Results: The rate of disrupting their b/tsDMARDs was higher in patients> 65 years of age, with a diagnosis of RA and who needed to come to the hospital for bDMARD treatment (p=0.007, p=0.015 and p=0.004, respectively). The overall 1-year b/tsDMARD retention rates was found 91%. It was determined that a history of interruption in b/tsDMARD treatments in the first 3 months of the pandemic [OR: 1.28 (CI: 1.042-8.71), p=0.014] and the need to come to the hospital to receive bDMARD [OR: 0.59 (CI: 0.64-13.11), p=0.041] caused unresponsiveness to return to the same bDMARD treatment and a significant increase in the risk of discontinuation of the biologic treatment. Conclusion: We conclude that it is important for patients to continue taking b/ tsDMARD treatments without interruption in the days past abnormal periods such as pandemic conditions and to make sufficient effort for minimum dose of CS and low disease activity by determining patient-based risk.","Gulle, S.; Erez, Y.; Karakas, A.; Yüce Inel, T.; Kocaer, S.

Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. Methods Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. Results Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. Conclusions Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.","Hill, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Levi, Jacob; Heath, Katie; Fortunak, Joseph",Journal of virus eradication,666,20

The Communities of Practice Model is a sociocultural approach that conceptualises the formation of professional identity through student engagement within a community. We argue the current suspension of clinical placements holds the potential to negatively influence such identity acquisition. In this commentary we explore how the Communities of Practice Model may inform professional identity development of medical students within the COVID-19 environment, considering digital communities and volunteering roles within primary care. We further encourage educators and institutions to consider professional identity in future planning to address the challenges posed by the current situation, both in terms of placement loss but also changes in the way primary care is delivered.

Methods: A total of 62 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. The CT scores based on lesion patterns and distributions in serial CT were investigated. The improvement and deterioration of pneumonia was assessed based on the changes of CT scores. Grouped by using the temperature, serum lymphocytes and high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) on admission respectively, the CT scores on admission, at peak time and at discharge were evaluated. Correlation analysis was carried out between the time to onset of pneumonia resolution on CT images and the recovery time of temperature, negative conversion of viral nucleic acid, serum lymphocytes and hs-CRP. Results: The CT scores of the fever group and lymphopenia group were significantly higher than those of normal group on admission, at peak time and at discharge; and the CT scores of normal hs-CRP group were significantly lower than those of the elevated hs-CRP group at peak time and at discharge (P all<0.05). The time to onset of pneumonia resolution on CT image was moderately correlated with negative conversion duration of viral nucleic acid (r =0.501, P<0.05) and the recovery time of hs-CPR (r =0.496, P<0.05). Conclusions: COVID-19 pneumonia patients with no fever, normal lymphocytes and hs-CRP had mild lesions on admission, and presented with more absorption and fewer pulmonary lesions on discharge. The negative conversion duration of viral nucleic acid and the recovery time of hs-CPR may be the indicator of the pneumonia resolution.","Shi, Nannan; Song, Fengxiang; Liu, Fengjun; Song, Pengrui; Lu, Yang; Hou, Qinguo; Hua, Xinyan; Ling, Yun; Zhang, Jiulong; Huang, Chao; Shi, Lei; Zhang, Zhiyong; Shan, Fei; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Yuxin",J Thorac Dis,666,20

AIM: This study investigates COVID-19 incidence and mortality in patients transplanted in the North Italy Transplant program (NITp) during the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients transplanted from February 20 to April 3, 2020 (6 weeks), were included in our cohort and were observed for at least 4 weeks. Survival analyses were performed. RESULTS: In this study, 124 patients were transplanted with 12 (9.7%) hearts, 4 (3.2%) lungs, 39 (31.4%) livers, 67 (54%) kidneys, and 2 (1.6%) combined kidney-pancreas. Recipients' mean age was 51 years (standard deviation [SD] ± 16.6), and 76 of 124 (61%) were men. Five (4%) patients developed COVID-19 after a mean of 13 days (SD ± 6.7), with a cumulative incidence of 4.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-7.5). During the follow-up period, 5 of 124 (4%) recipients died; overall mortality was 4.3% (95% CI, 0.6-8.0), with only 1 patient dying of COVID-19, for a COVID-19-related mortality of 0.8% (95% CI, 0-6.0). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a low COVID-19 incidence and COVID-19-related mortality in patients transplanted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, these methods lack of a good semantic understanding of what happens internally. The question, why a COVID-19 detector has classified a stack of lung-ct images as positive, is sometimes more interesting than the overall specificity and sensitivity. Especially when human domain expert knowledge disagrees with the given output. This way, human domain experts could also be advised to reconsider their choice, regarding the information pointed out by the system. In addition, the deep learning model can be controlled, and a present dataset bias can be found. Currently, most explainable AI methods in the computer vision domain are purely used on image classification, where the images are ordinary images in the visible spectrum. As a result, there is no comparison on how the methods behave with multimodal image data, as well as most methods have not been investigated on how they behave when used for object detection. This work tries to close the gaps. Firstly, investigating three saliency map generator methods on how their maps differ across the different spectra. This is achieved via accurate and systematic training. Secondly, we examine how they behave when used for object detection. As a practical problem, we chose object detection in the infrared and visual spectrum for autonomous driving. The dataset used in this work is the Multispectral Object Detection Dataset, where each scene is available in the FIR, MIR and NIR as well as visual spectrum. The results show that there are differences between the infrared and visual activation maps. Further, an advanced training with both, the infrared and visual data not only improves the network's output, it also leads to more focused spots in the saliency maps.","Bayer, Jens; Munch, David; Arens, Michael",,666,24

Methods: Psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency psychiatric attendances carried out between January 7th and May 28th, 2020, were evaluated, covering the periods before and after lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Fortaleza, capital of the state of Ceara, Brazil. The data in the two periods were described and presented in time series graphs. Attendances were also described according to the severity categories. Comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U test and test for proportions. Results: The daily average of hospitalizations and of attendances decreased in the evaluated periods from 16.0 to 10.8 (p < 0.001) and 67.9 to 35.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. This absolute reduction was observed in all categories of severity. No difference was observed in the proportion of severe attendances (2.3% vs. 2.8%;p = 0.207). The proportion of mild cases decreased from 18.6% to 10.7% (p < 0.001) and of intermediate severity cases increased from 79.1% to 86.5% (p < 0.001).

As programs have begun to reopen, potential donor candidates often inquire about their risk of a COVID-19 infection and its potential impact on kidney function after donation. To address their concerns, we surveyed 1740 former live kidney donors at four transplant centers located in New York and Michigan. Of these, 839 (48.2%) donors responded, their mean age was 46 ± 12.5 years, 543 (65%) were females, and 611 (73%) were white. Ninety-two donors (11%) had symptoms suggestive of a COVID-19 infection with fever (48%) and fatigue (43%) being the most common. Among those with symptoms, 42 donors underwent testing and 16 tested positive. Testing was more common among donors with private insurance, and a positive test result was more common among young black donors. Only one donor surveyed required hospitalization and none required dialysis. Fourteen donors have recovered completely and two partially. Our survey highlights that a COVID-19 infection in former donors results in a mild disease with good recovery. These data will be useful for transplant programs to counsel living donors who are considering kidney donation during this pandemic.","Doshi, Mona D; Tsapepas, Demetra; Prashar, Rohini; Mohan, Sumit; Edusei, Emmanuel; Aull, Meredith J; Sherman, Eric; Dadhania, Darshana M",Clin Transplant,666,26

There is a natural succession between the two courses. Since the beginning of 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has suddenly swept the world. During this special period, to ensure that the medical students understand and master the basic medical knowledge, lay a solid foundation for the future medical bridge courses and professional courses, and so an online teaching team of medical morphology mainly including the ""Histology and Embryology"" and ""Pathology"" teachers was set up. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore a new teaching mode of ""Histology and Embryology"" and ""Pathology"" under COVID-19 circumstances, and to illustrate its feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: From March to July 2020, our team selected Grade 2018 and 2019 clinical medicine undergraduates as objects for online teaching. Meanwhile, Grades 2019 and 2020 nursing undergraduates were selected for traditional offline teaching as the control group. For online teaching, our team used ""Xuexi Tong Platform"" as the major platform to realize a new ""Seven-in-One"" teaching method, i.e., ""video + materials + chapter test + interaction + homework + live broadcast + case analysis/discussion"". This new teaching mode involved diverse online teaching methods and contents, which included: 1. flipped classroom, 2. screen-to-screen experimental teaching, 3. drawing competitions, and 4. a writing activity themed What I Know about - the COVID-19"". When the teaching is about to end, then the ""Questionnaire Star"" is used to make investigation with regard to the feedback of teaching performance. In the meantime, the final written examination of Pathology of online teaching and traditional offline teaching were compared to test the mastery of knowledge of the students. RESULTS: Using ""Xuexi Tong Platform"" as the major platform to carry out ""Seven-in-One"" teaching mode is feasible and acceptable. With regard to the teaching performance of this new online teaching mode, students demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction, and the questionnaire showed that more than 71.3% of students had a greater degree/very satisfied. There are even more high score students (90-100) in the online learning group than that in the offline learning control group(P=.019). Especially, the number of students with objective scores of over 60 in the online learning group was more than that in the offline learning control group(P=.045). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that this online teaching mode was not inferior to that of traditional offline teaching mode, proving the feasibility and acceptability during the COVID-19 period. It laid a solid theoretical foundation for the follow-up study of medical students.","Liu, Qinlai; Sun, Wenping; Du, Changqing; Yang, Leiying; Yuan, Na; Cui, Haiqing; Song, Wengang; Ge, Li",,666,16

OBJECTIVE: The aim of current study was to undertake an in-depth exploration of the experiences of health-care staff working during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: Using a thematic analysis approach, a qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 97 health care professionals. Participants were health care professionals including pre-hospital emergency services (EMS), physicians, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, radiology technicians, hospital managers and managers in the ministry of health who work directly or indirectly with COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Data analysis highlighted four main themes, namely: 'Working in the pandemic era', 'Changes in personal life and enhanced negative affect', 'Gaining experience, normalization and adaptation to the pandemic' and 'Mental Health Considerations' which indicated that mental ill deteriorations unfolded through a stage-wise process as the pandemic unfolded. CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced a wide range of emotions and development during the unfolding of the pandemic. Providing mental health aid should thus be an essential part of services for healthcare providers during the pandemic.

However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in hMDM. Although, hMDM expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, no or very low levels of transmembrane protease serine 2 were found. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.","García-Nicolás, Obdulio; V039,; kovski, Philip; Zettl, Ferdinand; Zimmer, Gert; Thiel, Volker; Summerfield, Artur",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,666,3

METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted through an online survey of patients with cancer who were sheltering at home from 29th March to 3rd May 2020. Perception of self-isolation was assessed using the ISOLA scale, after evaluation of its psychometric properties. Content analysis was used to analyse two open-ended questions. RESULTS: The participants were 195 adult patients with cancer (female = 76%; mean age = 50.3 ± 11.2; haematological malignancy = 51.3%).

Thus, the aim of this scoping review is to map out the existing evidence on the impact of long-distance truck drivers on the spread of COVID-19 and measures that countries can implement to mitigate this route of spread in the African region. Methods: we searched the PubMed database and the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 for eligible studies. Results: the search strategy identified 669 citations, of which six met the inclusion criteria. The most frequently reported interventions were maintaining hand hygiene, social distance, testing truck drivers, regulation of trade and transport e.g. only trucks with the food, medical supplies, fuels, agricultural supplies will be allowed to operate in interstate operations and regulating and controlling trucks carrying essential goods and services e.g. truck drivers are required to declare their final destination and are urged to stop only at designated points. Two studies from the African region reported about border closures and entry and exit screening, two studies from the US reported about the threat for public safety and risks and mitigation plans and 2 guidelines reported about harmonisation and facilitation of cross border in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.

In the study, the gravity model and social network analysis were used to determine the variables of industrial sectors’ information distance and quality, and to construct the IIN of industrial sectors. The results show that the overall relevance of the IIN of industrial sectors is low, and the network density fluctuates, with high network efficiency and poor stability. Two-way, strong correlation between industrial sectors is relatively low. The spillover effect of industrial sectors in the upstream of the industrial chain is poor, and it is difficult to have a strong information integration driving effect on the downstream industrial sectors. The interplate linkage of the IIN of industrial sectors is insufficient.

Several departments have reported their experiences and protocols to provide insights for others impacted. The goals of this study are to report the load and variety of neurosurgical cases and clinic visits after discontinuing the COVID-19 Battle Plan at an academic tertiary care referral center to provide insights for other departments going through the same transition. METHODS: The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between May 4, 2020, and June 4, 2020 were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group were retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions and clinic visits performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one patients underwent neurosurgical interventions, and seven-hundred one patients were seen in clinic appointments, in the 4-week period following easing back from our COVID-19 ""Battle Plan."" Discontinuing the ""Battle Plan"" resulted in increases in case load to above-average practice after a week but a continued decrease in clinic appointments throughout the 4 weeks compared with average practice. CONCLUSIONS: As policy-shaping crises like pandemics abate, easing back to ""typical"" practice can be completed effectively by appropriately allocating resources. This can be accomplished by anticipating increases in neurosurgical volume, specifically in the functional/epilepsy and brain tumor subspecialties, as well as continued decreases in neurosurgical clinic volume, specifically in elective spine.","Pressman, Elliot; Noureldine, Mohammad Hassan A; Kumar, Jay I; Krafft, Paul R; Mantei, Braden; Greenberg, Mark S; Agazzi, Siviero; van Loveren, Harry; Alikhani, Puya",World Neurosurg,666,24

The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in February by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. COVID-19 presents as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia. In a small subset of severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death. Since the 21st century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent pandemic of COVID-19. Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development. Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would prove useful for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.","Ye, Zi-Wei; Jin, Dong-Yan",Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,666,20

We now describe major developments in recent months and provide an outlook on the expected consequences. METHODS: PubMed literature search, clinical survey. RESULTS: To date, the course of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by several new but overall rare ocular manifestations, the ophthalmological shared management of COVID-19 patients on intensive care units, and a significant decrease in case numbers, associated with an increase in case severity and relative proportion of emergencies, as a result of delayed presentation of patients and reduced treatment adherence. With the introduction of hygiene measures and infection control procedures, ophthalmic patient care was maintained - including emergencies and urgent treatments. Due to the extensive postponement of elective surgeries, scarce therapeutic and health care professional resources, and the prioritisation of critically ill patients from other specialties, there is a reasonable likelihood that urgent treatments will be delayed as infection rates rise. CONCLUSION: Outpatient and inpatient care in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic is primarily accompanied by additional organisational or medical challenges and a decline in case volume. Although to date emergency and urgent ophthalmic treatments have been maintained, long-term persistence of pandemic conditions will require additional strategies to provide continuation of ophthalmic care at the required level.","Hattenbach, Lars-Olof; Feltgen, Nicolas; Eter, Nicole; Al-Nawaiseh, Sami; Chronopoulos, Argyrios",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,666,19

In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Wuhan City, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are found in the vast majority of all COVID-19 cases. Early diagnosis, treatment and future prevention are keys to COVID-19 management. Currently, the unmet need to develop cost-effective point-of-contact test kits and efficient laboratory techniques for confirmation of COVID-19 infection has powered a new frontier of diagnostic innovation. No proven effective therapies or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. The rapidly increasing research regarding COVID-19 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Remdesivir may be the most promising therapy up till now.

Many statistical questions related to designing platform trials - such as the impact of decision rules, sharing of information across cohorts, and allocation ratios on operating characteristics and error rates - remain unanswered. In many platform trials, the definition of error rates is not straightforward as classical error rate concepts are not applicable. In particular, the strict control of the family-wise Type I error rate often seems unreasonably rigid. For an open-entry, exploratory platform trial design comparing combination therapies to the respective monotherapies and standard-of-care, we define a set of error rates and operating characteristics and then use these to compare a set of design parameters under a range of simulation assumptions. When setting up the simulations, we aimed for realistic trial trajectories, e.g. in case one compound is found to be superior to standard-of-care, it could become the new standard-of-care in future cohorts. Our results indicate that the method of data sharing, exact specification of decision rules and quality of the biomarker used to make interim decisions all strongly contribute to the operating characteristics of the platform trial. Together with the potential flexibility and complexity of a platform trial, which also impact the achieved operating characteristics, this implies that utmost care needs to be given to evaluation of different assumptions and design parameters at the design stage.","Meyer, Elias Laurin; Mesenbrink, Peter; Dunger-Baldauf, Cornelia; Glimm, Ekkehard; Li, Yuhan; Konig, Franz",,666,20

At the same time, once again, it showed the importance of analysing and creating suitable conditions for sustainable development. Resilient economies are less exposed to the risk of economic crises or slowdowns, which is vital for ensuring stable incomes and high level of living standards. Therefore, the presented analysis was aimed at evaluating the level of economic resilience of provincial cities in Poland in relation to the situation on their labour markets. For this purposes, selected measures of the variation in the distribution feature (e.g., coefficient of variation) and the degree of structure diversification of the examined feature (Amemiya's index) were used. Subsequently, using correlation analysis, the research determined whether any relationships could be observed between the investigated variables. The results of the research indicate that for provincial cities sub-regions in Poland, a statistically significant, moderate negative correlation could be observed between the degree of employment structure diversification in 2009 and the scale and scope of the collapse in the number of employed persons in subsequent years. This suggests that a high level of employment diversification restricted the level of economic resilience in this case.","Bogdanski, M.",Sustainability,666,20

Methods: We included consecutive patients with COVID-19-related HRF treated with HFNO at two tertiary hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who were successfully weaned from HFNO, whilst failure comprised intubation or death on HFNO. Findings: The median (IQR) arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was 68 (54-92) in 293 enroled patients. Of these, 137/293 (47%) of patients [PaO2/FiO2 76 (63-93)] were successfully weaned from HFNO. The median duration of HFNO was 6 (3-9) in those successfully treated versus 2 (1-5) days in those who failed (p<0.001). A higher ratio of oxygen saturation/FiO2 to respiratory rate within 6 h (ROX-6 score) after HFNO commencement was associated with HFNO success (ROX-6; AHR 0.43, 0.31-0.60), as was use of steroids (AHR 0.35, 95%CI 0.19-0.64). A ROX-6 score of &#8805;3.7 was 80% predictive of successful weaning whilst ROX-6 &#8804; 2.2 was 74% predictive of failure. In total, 139 patents (52%) survived to hospital discharge, whilst mortality amongst HFNO failures with outcomes was 129/140 (92%).

Though many might want it to, birth does not stop during a pandemic. In emergency times, birth practices need to be adjusted to safeguard the health of birthing mothers, babies, birth providers, and the general population. In Bologna, Italy, one of the emergency measures employed by local hospitals in response to COVID-19 was to suspend women's right to be accompanied by a person of their choice for the whole duration of labor and childbirth. In this work, we look at how this measure was disputed by the local activist birth community. Through the analysis of a social campaign empowered by Voci di Nascita-an association of parents, birth providers, and activists-we examine how social actors negotiated the balance between public health and reproductive rights in a time of crisis. We argue that this process unveils several structural issues that characterize maternity care at the local and national levels, including the (re)medicalization of birth, the discourse on risk and safety, the internal fragmentation of Italian midwifery, and the fragility of reproductive rights. The Covidian experience forced the reshaping of the birth carepath during the peak of the emergency. We suggest that it also offered an opportunity to rethink how birth is conceived, experienced, and accompanied in times of unprecedented global uncertainty-and beyond.","Benaglia, B.; Canzini, D.",Frontiers in Sociology,666,25

The variables to be considered include protection of patients and healthcare providers, accuracy and availability of testing, and responsible use of PPE resources. This article also explores the concerns of surgeons regarding possible transmission to their own family members as a result of caring for COVID-19 patients.","Fillingham, Yale A; Grosso, Matthew J; Yates, Adolph J; Austin, Matthew S",J Arthroplasty,666,6

It is challenging to discriminate COVID-19-related cutaneous manifestations from other closely resembling skin lesions. The aim of this study was to generate and evaluate a novel CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) ensemble architecture for detection of COVID-19-associated skin lesions from clinical images. An ensemble model of three different CNN-based algorithms was trained with clinical images of skin lesions from confirmed COVID-19 positive patients, healthy controls as well as 18 other common skin conditions, which included close mimics of COVID-19 skin lesions such as urticaria, varicella, pityriasis rosea, herpes zoster, bullous pemphigoid and psoriasis. The multi-class model demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 86.7% for all 20 diseases. The sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19-rash detection were found to be 84.2 ± 5.1% and 99.5 ± 0.2%, respectively. The positive predictive value, NPV and area under curve values for COVID-19-rash were 88.0 ± 5.6%, 99.4 ± 0.2% and 0.97 ± 0.25, respectively. The binary classifier had a mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 76.81 ± 6.25%, 99.77 ± 0.14% and 98.91 ± 0.17%, respectively for COVID-19 rash. The model was robust in detection of all skin lesions on both white and skin of color, although only a few images of COVID-19-associated skin lesions from skin of color were available. To our best knowledge, this is the first machine learning-based study for automated detection of COVID-19 based on skin images and may provide a useful decision support tool for physicians to optimize contact-free COVID-19 triage, differential diagnosis of skin lesions and patient care.","Mathur, Jyoti; Chouhan, Vikas; Pangti, Rashi; Kumar, Sharad; Gupta, Somesh",Dermatol Ther,666,22

However, it is primarily provided in hospital setting due to the need for expensive equipment and experienced radiologists. An accurate, rapid yet inexpensive test that is suitable for COVID-19 population screenings at mobile, urgent and primary care clinics is urgently needed. We present COVID-MobileXpert: a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) based mobile app that can use noisy snapshots of chest X-ray (CXR) for point-of-care COVID-19 screening. We design and implement a novel three-player knowledge transfer and distillation (KTD) framework including a pre-trained attending physician (AP) network that extracts CXR imaging features from large scale of lung disease CXR images, a fine-tuned resident fellow (RF) network that learns the essential CXR imaging features to discriminate COVID-19 from pneumonia and/or normal cases using a small amount of COVID-19 cases, and a trained lightweight medical student (MS) network that performs on-device COVID-19 screening. To accommodate the need for screening using noisy snapshots of CXR images, we employ novel loss functions and training schemes for the MS network to learn the robust imaging features for accurate on-device COVID-19 screening. We demonstrate the strong potential of COVID-MobileXpert for rapid deployment via extensive experiments with diverse MS network architecture, CXR imaging quality, and tuning parameter settings.

The key guiding question of this paper is ""How do women academics explain their experience of combining the challenging job of online teaching and familial responsibilities in this very demanding and difficult pandemic time?” The aim is to outline the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on women academics. We employed a qualitative research design and collected data through in-depth qualitative telephonic interviews with thirteen women academics in four public sector universities in Pakistan. The data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The findings show that women academics remained overwhelmed by the workload, lacked support, and endured a tiring struggle to manage their official duties and familial responsibilities. Remote teaching had been a difficult experience for them as they struggled to adapt to online learning and worked to meet the demands of students and the university. They were stressed and stuck in their children and family care and online teaching and had hardly any time for academic writing. The participants expressed being burned out, depressed, exhausted, angry, and in desperate need of personal time. The study results suggest that women experienced the lockdown differently compared to men in academia, and because of that, universities should consider compensating them accordingly for the time they spent in fulfilling their double roles.","Ali, Rabia Ullah Hazir",Asian Journal of Social Science,666,20

There is a paucity of information about the attitudes of cancer patients towards vaccinations and the role of clinical oncologists in influencing vaccination acceptance. (2) Methods: Cancer patients and caregivers were invited to participate in a webinar and two surveys (pre- and post-webinar) assessing intention and thought processes associated with receiving COVID-19 vaccines. (3) Results: Two hundred and sixty-four participants participated in the webinar and registered to take at least one survey. Participants reported receiving most of their COVID-19 vaccine information from their doctor, clinic, or hospital. Before the webinar, 71% of participants reported the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 24% were unsure, and 5% had no intention of receiving a vaccine. The strongest predictors of vaccine enthusiasm were (a) planning to encourage the vaccination of family, friends, co-workers, and community, and (b) physician recommendation. The chief reason for vaccine hesitancy was a fear of side effects. After the webinar, 82.5% reported the intention to receive a vaccine, 15.4% were still unsure, and 2% stated that they had no intention of receiving a vaccine. The webinar shifted the attitude towards vaccine enthusiasm, despite an already vaccine-enthusiastic population. Communicating about vaccines using positive framing is associated with greater vaccine enthusiasm. (4) Conclusions: Patient education programs co-hosted by multiple stakeholders and delivered by oncologists can increase cancer patient enthusiasm for COVID-19 vaccination.","Kelkar, Amar H; Blake, Jodian A; Cherabuddi, Kartikeya; Cornett, Hailee; McKee, Bobbie L; Cogle, Christopher R",,666,26

METHODS: AtT rate of patients with scheduled intravitreal injections (IVT) during the COVID-19 outbreak from 23/02/20 to 31/03/20 was compared to the previous trimester and with March 2019. The impact of age, sex, visual function and diagnosis on the AtT rate during unlocked/locked weeks (from March 8) was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 650 consecutive patients with scheduled IVT, AtT rate during the COVID-19 outbreak was 0.37. This was significantly lower compared to AtT registered in the previous trimester (0.92) and in the same weeks in 2019 (0.90) (both p <0.001). Patients adherent to treatment were significantly younger (p<0.001) and had a lower best-corrected visual acuity in the fellow eye (p=0.046). During the lockdown weeks AtT rate was significantly lower than in the two unlocked weeks (0.19 vs 0.73, p<0.001). In addition, the AtT rate in patients classified as ""Emergent"" during the lockdown weeks was 0.60.

Apart from respiratory complications, acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD) has been observed in some patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we described the clinical characteristics, laboratory features, treatment and outcomes of CVD complicating SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes were collected and analysed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with COVID-19 with or without new-onset CVD were compared. RESULTS: Of 219 patients with COVID-19, 10 (4.6%) developed acute ischaemic stroke and 1 (0.5%) had intracerebral haemorrhage. COVID-19 with new onset of CVD were significantly older (75.7±10.8 years vs 52.1±15.3 years, p<0.001), more likely to present with severe COVID-19 (81.8% vs 39.9%, p<0.01) and were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and medical history of CVD (all p<0.05). In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state as reflected in C reactive protein (51.1 (1.3-127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1-212.0) mg/L, p<0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3-20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1-20.0) mg/L, p<0.001). Of 10 patients with ischemic stroke; 6 received antiplatelet treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel; and 3 of them died. The other four patients received anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin and 2 of them died. As of 24 March 2020, six patients with CVD died (54.5%). CONCLUSION: Acute CVD is not uncommon in COVID-19. Our findings suggest that older patients with risk factors are more likely to develop CVD. The development of CVD is an important negative prognostic factor which requires further study to identify optimal management strategy to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Yanan; Li, Man; Wang, Mengdie; Zhou, Yifan; Chang, Jiang; Xian, Ying; Wang, David; Mao, Ling; Jin, Huijuan; Hu, Bo",Stroke Vasc Neurol,666,23

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, that still keeps its impacts worldwide, numerous scheduled medical activities have been postponed and this interruption has a potential to modify the management of many cutaneous conditions including pemphigus. This narrative review aims to discuss the management of pemphigus in the era of COVID-19, considering the necessity to balance suitable pemphigus treatment with minimal risk of COVID-19-related mortality and morbidity. The data on the effect of treatments used for pemphigus on COVID-19 are limited. However, the evidence to manage patients properly is evolving and our knowledge is updated. Current expert recommendations include that patients with pemphigus should be informed clearly to avoid mismanagement and they should be monitored regularly for symptoms of COVID-19. Patients with mild disease can be managed with topical or intralesional corticosteroids, dapsone, or doxycycline. Systemic corticosteroids should be tapered to the lowest effective dose during the pandemic. Prednis(ol)one &#8804;10 mg/d can be continued in patients with COVID-19 while prednis(ol)one >10 mg/d may be reduced considering the activity of the disease. Conventional immunosuppressive therapies should only be discontinued in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Postponing rituximab treatment should be considered on a case by case basis. Intravenous immunoglobulin is not likely to increase the risk of infection and may be considered a safe option in patients with COVID-19.

The aim was to study subjective well-being in the situation of the pandemic and its relationship to coping and anxiety about coronavirus. 409 people filled Satisfaction With Life Scale, Scale of Positive And Negative Experiences, situational version of COPE, checklists assessing anxiety of infection and anxiety of the negative consequences of the pandemic. The comparison groups were three samples of 98, 66 and 293 people who filled Satisfaction With Life Scale and Scale of Positive And Negative Experiences in 2017 and 2019. There was a lower level of positive emotions among respondents in a situation of self-isolation, but the same level of satisfaction with life and negative emotions. Anxiety about the pandemic is related to higher negative emotions only. Emotionally oriented coping strategies and mental disengagement are associated with a higher level of pandemic anxiety. Problem-oriented and active coping strategies are weakly associated with lower anxiety that could be explained by the lack of ready effective methods of resolving this new and uncertain situation. Anxiety associated with current, acute and imminent risk (such as risk of infection), concentration on emotions and acceptance may not be dysfunctional strategies, as they are not associated with deterioration in overall well-being.

On the other hand, the lack of proper policymaking in the production and pricing of red meat and the lack of a comprehensive study on the beef supply chain has led to a reduction in the role of this protein product in the household food basket. Thus, in this research, comprehensive strategic planning considering the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been illustrated to overcome the aforementioned problems. Design/methodology/approach: To study the intended objectives, first, using qualitative methods, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) to the studied company's supply chain in Iran were identified and then using the SWOT-Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) technique, the surrounding strategies have been analysed. Findings: The results indicate that the most important strength of the studied company is the “access to the red meat market of the retirement plan”;the most important weakness is the “lack of required and on-time funding, especially in the condition of the COVID-19 pandemic”;the highest-ranked opportunity is the “access to banking facilities” and the main threat to the company is the “COVID-19 pandemic limitations and health protocols”. In the same vein, by examining the attractiveness score of internal and external factors, it was observed that diversity and competitive strategies would have a higher priority. Finally, the QSPM illustrated that activating the full capacity of existing infrastructure has the highest priority. Originality/value: According to the red meat supply chain and the link amongst different market levels, identifying, analysing and improving the beef supply chain is of particular importance. One of the threats facing the international community is the emergence of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires businesses to choose the right strategy to deal with the issue. Therefore, the main distinction of this study is to identify, analyse and improve the red meat supply chain of a real case due to the condition of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Riahi Dorcheh, F.; Razavi Hajiagha, S.

However, surveys have found concerning numbers of U.S. adults hesitant or unwilling to be vaccinated. Online misinformation may play an important role in vaccine hesitancy, but we lack a clear picture of the extent to which it will impact vaccination uptake. Here, we study how vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy are associated with levels of online misinformation about vaccines shared by 1.6 million Twitter users geolocated at the U.S. state and county levels. We find a negative relationship between misinformation and vaccination uptake rates. Online misinformation is also correlated with vaccine hesitancy rates taken from survey data. Associations between vaccine outcomes and misinformation remain significant when accounting for political as well as demographic and socioeconomic factors. While vaccine hesitancy is strongly associated with Republican vote share, we observe that the effect of online misinformation on hesitancy is strongest across Democratic rather than Republican counties. These results suggest that addressing online misinformation must be a key component of interventions aimed to maximize the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.","Pierri, Francesco; Perry, Brea; DeVerna, Matthew R.; Yang, Kai-Cheng; Flammini, Alessandro; Menczer, Filippo; Bryden, John",,666,26

Adequate prevention strategies are necessary to guarantee HCWs' safety, as well as to prevent dissemination of the infection among patients. AIMS: To describe a case series of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in a large public healthcare organization in Milan (Italy) during the most devastating weeks of the epidemic and analyse the sources, symptoms and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This study included 172 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs who were infected between the 25th of February and the 7th of April 2020. A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were used to indicate. RESULTS: Initially, the most common sources of infection were other positive HCWs (49%). Medical doctors and nursing assistants were most frequently infected, with infection rates of 53/1000 and 50/1000, respectively. COVID-19 departments were less affected than internal medicine, surgery, intensive care, or emergency room. The most commonly reported symptom was mild cough, while loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) were reported as moderate and severe by 30-40% of HCWs. The time necessary for 50% of workers to recover from the infection was 23 days, while it took 41 days for 95% of HCWs to become virus-free. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are commonly infected due to close contacts with other positive HCWs, and non-COVID departments were most affected. Most HCWs were asymptomatic or subclinical but contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic HCWs help identify and isolate infected workers.","Mandic-Rajcevic, S; Masci, F; Crespi, E; Franchetti, S; Longo, A; Bollina, I; Velocci, S; Amorosi, A; Baldelli, R; Boselli, L; Negroni, L; Zà, A; Orfeo, N V; Ortisi, G; Centanni, S; Colosio, C",Occup. med,666,26

In order to reduce the spread of coronavirus, people often wear masks to protect themselves. This makes face recognition a very difficult task since certain parts of the face are hidden. A primary focus of researchers during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is to come up with suggestions to handle this problem through rapid and efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a reliable method based on occlusion removal and deep learning-based features in order to address the problem of the masked face recognition process. The first step is to remove the masked face region. Next, we apply three pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) namely, VGG-16, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, and use them to extract deep features from the obtained regions (mostly eyes and forehead regions). The Bag-of-features paradigm is then applied to the feature maps of the last convolutional layer in order to quantize them and to get a slight representation comparing to the fully connected layer of classical CNN. Finally, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is applied for the classification process. Experimental results on Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset show high recognition performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.","Hariri, Walid",,666,16

We estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in District Srinagar. METHODS: 2906 persons >18 years of age selected from hospital visitors across District Srinagar participated in the study. We tested samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay-based serologic test. RESULTS: Age- and gender-standardized seroprevalence was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9% to 4.3%). Age 30-69 years, a recent history of symptoms of an influenza-like-illness, and a history of being placed under quarantine were significantly related to higher odds of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies. The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two weeks preceding the study, adjusted for test performance, was 32602 with an estimated (median) infection-to-known-case ratio of 46 (95% CI 36 to 57). CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies is low in the District. A large proportion of the population is still susceptible to the infection.

Preliminary cross-sectional research has demonstrated increases in mental health problems in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-pandemic estimates. We aimed to study an existing longitudinal cohort of mothers to assess changes in the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and at the individual level. METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time. FINDINGS: Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (35·21%, 95% CI 32·48-38·04) and anxiety symptoms (31·39%, 28·76-34·15) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (8·31, 95% CI 7·97-8·65) and anxiety score (11·90, 11·66-12·13) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·05, 4·85-5·25; mean anxiety score 9·51, 9·35-9·66), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·43, 5·20-5·66; mean anxiety score 9·49, 9·33-9·65), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·79, 5·55-6·02; mean anxiety score 10·26, 10·10-10·42). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 2·30 points (95% CI 1·95-2·65) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 1·04 points (0·65-1·43) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. INTERPRETATION: Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

Since the research under the public health emergency is different from that carried out in familiar situations to design and implementation, the strategy for a satisfactory ERC response should balance the duty of protecting individual participants as well as the special public needs derived from the disease control. It is suggested that the ethical review-related regulations need to be updated, and a unified supervision system to the overall ERC is required. ERC collaboration, capacity-improving and efficiency-improving measures need to be taken. With respect to the reviewing guidelines, it is suggested that the international norms should be explained with more consideration of the local condition and the exceptional circumstances in this public health emergency. A joint effort needs to be taken for better research conduction.","Ma, Xitao; Wang, Yanqiao; Gao, Tian; He, Qing; He, Yan; Yue, Rensong; You, Fengming; Tang, Jianyuan",J Evid Based Med,666,33

The objective of this study was to describe and compare the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation and quarantine. Methods: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study. Participants were Bahrainis aged &gt;18 years who had undergone either isolation or quarantine. Eligible participants were identified from the COVID-19 contacts (quarantine) and cases (isolation) database of Bahrain. Validated questionnaires for self-reported depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies - depression [CES-D]), posttraumatic stress (Impact of Event Scale - revised [IES-R]), and perceived stigma (Stigma Scale [SS]) were administered. Results: Mean CES-D, IES-R, and SS scores were 16.76+/-5.65, 13.50+/-14.67, and 25.29+/-7.99, respectively. In sum, 40% (205 of 502) of participants showed clinically significant depression, and &lt;20% (98 of 502) had indications of some posttraumatic distress, with greater depression and distress in those isolated than those quarantined. Perceived stigma was reported by 53.4% (268 of 502) of participants, more prominent among those quarantined. Depression and posttraumatic stress scores were significantly higher in females, college students, those with a history of mental health conditions, knowing a COVID-19 fatality, and experiencing social conflict. Age was a significant variable correlated with all three scales, with younger participants indicating more distress, depression, and stigma. Duration of segregation was significantly correlated with CES-D, score showing more depressive symptoms as the duration of isolation increased. Significant predictors were age, sex, history of mental illness, and COVID-19 status. Conclusion: Isolated and quarantined individuals reported depression, perceived stigma, and to a lesser extent distress. Psychological interventions identifying and targeting people with different-severity psychological burdens are in urgent need.","Jassim, G.; Jameel, M.; Brennan, E.; Yusuf, M.; Hasan, N.; Alwatani, Y.",Neuropsychiatric Disease &amp; Treatment,666,1

Objetivo Este estudio propone una metodología para estimar el momento de saturación de las camas de cuidados intensivos hospitalarios (camas críticas) y determinar el número de unidades requeridas para compensar dicha saturación. Método Se analizaron 22 016 pacientes con confirmación diagnóstica para COVID-19 provocada por SARS-CoV-2, entre el 4 de marzo y el 5 de mayo de 2020 a nivel nacional. Sobre la base de información del Ministerio de Salud de Chile y a anuncios ministeriales en medios de prensa, se estimó una disponibilidad total actual de 1900 a 2200 camas críticas totales. Se utilizó la función de Gompertz para estimar el número esperado de pacientes COVID-19 y evaluar su exposición a la oferta disponible de camas de cuidados intensivos en varios escenarios posibles. Para ello se tomó en cuenta la oferta de camas críticas totales, el índice ocupacional promedio, y la demanda de pacientes COVID-19 que requerirán cama de cuidados intensivos. Resultados Considerando diferentes escenarios, entre el 11 y el 27 de mayo podría ser alcanzado el 100% de ocupación de camas críticas totales. Esta condición podría extenderse por unos 48 días dependiendo como se maneje la sobredemanda esperada. Conclusión Se puede establecer una ventana de operaciones relativamente estrecha, de 4 a 8 semanas, para mitigar la inminente saturación de camas críticas hospitalarias, producto de la demanda de pacientes COVID-19.","Peña, Víctor Hugo; Espinosa, Alejandra",Medwave,666,16

Consequently, the current study aimed to investigate the associations between the consumption of COVID-19-related news and mental health in a large sample of Canadian families. We recruited 924 Canadian parents, between April 14th and August 9th 2020, to participate in an online survey, which assessed their demographics, media consumption patterns, and their levels of anxiety, and depression. Relationships between COVID-19-related media consumption and parental mental health were analyzed using a series of multiple regression analyses. Multiple regression was also used to examine whether pediatric health status (i.e., chronic disease vs. no chronic disease), parent health status, and the prevalence of COVID-19 in the participant's province of residence moderated the relationship between news consumption and parental mental health. Greater consumption of news related to COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of depression, and anxiety after controlling for a number of covariates. Contrary to predictions, neither the prevalence of COVID-19, parent health status, nor child health status significantly moderated the relationship between media consumption and parental mental health.

Seven patients expired (8.75%) and nine patients required MV (11.25%). Median IL-6 levels pre-administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25-666.25) pg/mL compared with post-administration on day 3 (563; 162-783) pg/mL (P < .00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50-678.50) pg/mL compared with day 3 (P = .709). CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels were reduced after TCZ therapy. Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels. The sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. IL-6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool.","Antony, Suresh J; Davis, Michelle A; Davis, Monique G; Almaghlouth, Nouf K; Guevara, Roberto; Omar, Fahad; Del Rey, Fernando; Hassan, Ali; Arian, Muhammad U; Antony, Nishaal; Prakash, Bharat V",J. med. virol,666,7

In this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is capable of modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during people's social activities. Taking advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, it's found that people tend to spend more time in grocery stores once their travel frequencies are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase in dwell time could balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy people's demand. Based on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined non-pharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are evaluated. Numerical simulations show that restrictions on people's travel frequency and open-hours of indoor places may not be universally effective in reducing average infection risks for each pedestrian who visit the place. Entry limitations can be a widely effective alternative, whereas the decision-maker needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase in queue length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel needs.","Xiao, Yao; Yang, Mofeng; Zhu, Zheng; Yang, Hai; Zhang, Lei; Ghader, Sepehr",,666,24

Physical performance is a central component of health. However, its relationship with isolation and loneliness is not well understood. We therefore assessed the relationship between loneliness, different aspects of social isolation, and physical performance over time. 8,780 participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, assessed three times over 8 years of follow-up, were included. Measures included physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery), loneliness (modified UCLA Loneliness Scale), and isolation considered in three ways (domestic isolation, social disengagement, low social contact). Fixed effects regression models were used to estimate the relationship between changes in these parameters. Missing data were imputed to account for variable response and ensure a representative sample. Loneliness, domestic isolation and social disengagement were longitudinally associated with poorer physical performance when accounting for both time-invariant and time-variant confounders (loneliness: coef = - 0.06, 95% CI - 0.09 to - 0.02; domestic isolation: coef = - 0.32, 95% CI - 0.46 to - 0.19; social disengagement: coef = - 0.10, 95% CI - 0.12 to - 0.07).

Following the first reports of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in 2019 and its rapid spread worldwide and the outbreak of a new highly variable strain of influenza A virus (H1N1) in 2009, developing quick, accurate monitoring and diagnostic approaches for emerging infections is considered critical. Efficient air sampling of coronaviruses and the H1N1 virus allows swift, real-time identification, triggering early adjuvant interventions. Electrostatic precipitation is an efficient method for sampling bio-aerosols as hydrosols; however, sampling conditions critically impact this method. Corona discharge ionizes surrounding air, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may impair virus structural components, leading to RNA and/or protein damage and preventing virus detection. Herein, ascorbic acid (AA) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as the sampling solution of an electrostatic sampler to counteract virus particle impairment, increasing virus survivability throughout sampling. The findings of this study indicate that the use of PBS+AA is effective in reducing the ROS damage of viral RNA by 95%, viral protein by 45% and virus yield by 60%.","Piri, Amin; Kim, Hyeong Rae; Park, Dae Hoon; Hwang, Jungho",J Hazard Mater,666,31

There is a race to develop suitable drugs and vaccines for the disease. The anti-HIV protease drugs are currently repurposed for the potential treatment of COVID-19. The drugs were primarily screened against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. With an urgent need for safe and effective drugs to treat the virus, we have explored natural products isolated from edible and medicinal mushrooms that have been reported to possess anti-HIV protease. Experimental procedures: We have examined 36 compounds for their potential to be SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors using molecular docking study. Moreover, drug-likeness properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity were evaluated by in silico ADMET analysis. Results: Our AutoDock study showed that 25 of 36 candidate compounds have the potential to inhibit the main viral protease based on their binding affinity against the enzyme's active site when compared to the standard drugs. Interestingly, ADMET analysis and toxicity prediction revealed that 6 out of 25 compounds are the best drug-like property candidates, including colossolactone VIII, colossolactone E, colossolactone G, ergosterol, heliantriol F and velutin. Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential of existing mushroom-derived natural compounds for further investigation and possibly can be used to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The immediate animal origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, remains unknown, a notoriously challenging task for emerging disease investigations. Coevolution with hosts leads to specific evolutionary signatures within viral genomes that can inform likely animal origins. We obtained a set of 650 spike protein and 511 whole genome nucleotide sequences from 222 and 185 viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, respectively. We then trained random forest models independently on genome composition biases of spike protein and whole genome sequences, including dinucleotide and codon usage biases in order to predict animal host (of nine possible categories, including human). In hold-one-out cross-validation, predictive accuracy on unseen coronaviruses consistently reached ~73%, indicating evolutionary signal in spike proteins to be just as informative as whole genome sequences. However, different composition biases were informative in each case. Applying optimised random forest models to classify human sequences of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed evolutionary signatures consistent with their recognised intermediate hosts (camelids, carnivores), while human sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted as having bat hosts (suborder Yinpterochiroptera), supporting bats as the suspected origins of the current pandemic. In addition to phylogeny, variation in genome composition can act as an informative approach to predict emerging virus traits as soon as sequences are available. More widely, this work demonstrates the potential in combining genetic resources with machine learning algorithms to address long-standing challenges in emerging infectious diseases.","Brierley, Liam; Fowler, Anna",PLoS Pathog,666,16

In the evaluation of the data, mean, standard deviation, percentages, t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used. 33% of healthcare workers did not have anxiety, 50% had mild, and 17% had severe anxiety. The anxiety scores of those who were nurses (p < 0.001), who were working in the emergency room (p < 0.001), who were involved in treatment for COVID-19 patients (p = 0.040), who left their homes to prevent transmission to their families and relatives during the pandemic (p = 0.038), and whose working hours had changed (p = 0.036) were found to be significantly higher. It was observed that there was a positive and significant relationship between the fear of death and disease transmission, uncertainty, loneliness, anger, and hopelessness, and anxiety levels in healthcare workers. The main factors that significantly affected the anxiety levels of healthcare workers were male gender, weekly working hours, the presence of chronic diseases, and feelings of anger and uncertainty.

Enormous quantities of data are accumulated and stored within VDL LIMSs. There is a need for platforms that allow VDLs to exchange and share portions of laboratory data using standardized, reliable, and sustainable information technology processes. Here we report concepts and applications for standardization and aggregation of data from swine submissions to multiple VDLs to detect and monitor porcine enteric coronaviruses by RT-PCR. Oral fluids, feces, and fecal swabs were the specimens submitted most frequently for enteric coronavirus testing. Statistical algorithms were used successfully to scan and monitor the overall and state-specific percentage of positive submissions. Major findings revealed a consistently recurrent seasonal pattern, with the highest percentage of positive submissions detected during December-February for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine deltacoronavirus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). After 2014, very few submissions tested positive for TGEV. Monitoring VDL data proactively has the potential to signal and alert stakeholders early of significant changes from expected detection.

The proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (61.1%) was higher than the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group (51.5%) and the RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (46.9%) at day 14; however, the difference between these groups was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group developed a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than the LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group and the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are no significant differences among the three regimens in terms of antiviral effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the combination of RBV and LPV/r is associated with a significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, suggesting that RBV and LPV/r should not be co-administered to COVID-19 patients simultaneously.

The genomics of SARS-CoV-2 has been instrumental to the timely development of diagnostics and vaccines and in elucidating transmission dynamics. Global disease control programmes, including those for tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, foodborne pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance, also recommend genomics-based surveillance as an integral strategy towards control and elimination of these diseases. Despite the potential benefits, capacity remains low for many public health programmes in Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to reassess and strengthen surveillance systems and potentially integrate emerging technologies for preparedness of future epidemics and control of endemic diseases. We discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating pathogen genomics into public health surveillance systems in Africa. Improving accessibility through the creation of functional continent-wide networks, building multipathogen sequencing cores, training a critical mass of local experts, development of standards and policies to facilitate best practices for data sharing, and establishing a community of practice of genomics experts are all needed to use genomics for improved disease surveillance in Africa. Coordination and leadership are also crucial, which the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention seeks to provide through its institute for pathogen genomics.","Inzaule, Seth C; Tessema, Sofonias K; Kebede, Yenew; Ogwell Ouma, Ahmed E; Nkengasong, John N","Lancet, Infect. dis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to aging and was recently reported to be among the major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in older people. The symptomatology of COVID-19 indicates that lethal outcomes of infection rely on neurogenic mechanisms. The present review compiles the available knowledge pointing to the convergence of COVID-19 complications with the mechanisms of autonomic dysfunctions in AD and aging. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is prone to neuroinvasion from the lung along the vagus nerve up to the brainstem autonomic nervous centers involved in the coupling of cardiovascular and respiratory rhythms. The brainstem autonomic network allows SARS-CoV-2 to trigger a neurogenic switch to hypertension and hypoventilation, which may act in synergy with aging- and AD-induced dysautonomias, along with an inflammatory ""storm"". The lethal outcomes of COVID-19, like in AD and unhealthy aging, likely rely on a critical hypoactivity of the efferent vagus nerve cholinergic pathway, which is involved in lowering cardiovascular pressure and systemic inflammation tone. We further discuss the emerging evidence supporting the use of 1) the non-invasive stimulation of vagus nerve as an additional therapeutic approach for severe COVID-19, and 2) the demonstrated vagal tone index, i.e., heart rate variability, via smartphone-based applications as a non-serological low-cost diagnostic of COVID-19. These two well-known medical approaches are already available and now deserve large-scale testing on human cohorts in the context of both AD and COVID-19.","Rangon, C.

Despite the commitment of professional societies such as the American College of Radiology to diversity in Radiology, the field and its residency training programs remain the least diverse. With COVID-19 related suspension of in-person medical student rotations, our Department of Radiology redesigned and implemented a virtual radiology internship for underrepresented minority (URM) medical students. METHODS: A four-week virtual radiology internship was designed to provide clinical exposure to radiology and to allow students to gain an understanding of what a career in radiology entails. Course design included videoconference patient care sessions, didactic lectures, online modules, mentoring, and extra-clinical curriculum. Feedback from students was collected using online surveys assessing pre- and postcourse attitudes and understanding of a career in radiology and the students' perceived aptitude for such a career, as well as course component evaluation. RESULTS: Three participants were enrolled in the inaugural clerkship. All noted exceptional educational course content and ample opportunities to build connections with faculty and residents-with mentoring seen as the highlight of the course. All indicated a significant shift in perception of the field and in declaring interest in pursuing a career in radiology. CONCLUSION: Virtual radiology internship for URM students is a feasible paradigm to address potential impediments to diversification of the specialty by both engaging interested URM medical students in a career in radiology and arming them with the tools for a successful application to radiology residency.","Dodelzon, Katerina; Belfi, Lily; Schweitzer, Andrew D; Lamparello, Nicole; Legasto, Alan C; McGinty, Geraldine; Spottswood, Stephanie; Min, Robert J; Babagbemi, Kemi",Acad. radiol,666,16

The first case of COVID-19 in New York City was officially confirmed on 1 March 2020 followed by a severe local epidemic1. Here, to understand seroprevalence dynamics, we conduct a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in weekly intervals from the beginning of February to July 2020 using more than 10,000 plasma samples from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. We describe the dynamics of seroprevalence in an 'urgent care' group, which is enriched in cases of COVID-19 during the epidemic, and a 'routine care' group, which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups; seropositive samples were found as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. From May to July, seroprevalence remained stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced in New York City earlier than previously documented and describe the dynamics of seroconversion over the full course of the first wave of the pandemic in a major metropolitan area.","Stadlbauer, Daniel; Tan, Jessica; Jiang, Kaijun; Hernandez, Matthew M; Fabre, Shelcie; Amanat, Fatima; Teo, Catherine; Arunkumar, Guha Asthagiri; McMahon, Meagan; Capuano, Christina; Twyman, Kathryn; Jhang, Jeffrey; Nowak, Michael D; Simon, Viviana; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; van Bakel, Harm; Krammer, Florian",Nature (Lond.),666,20

For lesions adjacent to the perirolandic area and descending motor tracts, mapping can be done with both awake craniotomy (AC) and under general anesthesia (GA). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine which anesthetic protocol-AC vs. GA-provides better patient outcomes by comparing EOR and postoperative morbidity for surgeries using IS mapping in gliomas located near or in motor areas of the brain. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out to identify relevant studies from 1983 to 2019. Seven databases were screened. A total of 2351 glioma patients from 17 studies were analyzed. RESULTS: A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a trend towards a higher mean EOR in AC [90.1% (95% C.I. 85.8-93.8)] than with GA [81.7% (95% C.I. 72.4-89.7)] (p = 0.06).

DESIGN: Vignettes study. SETTING: 200 primary care vignettes. INTERVENTION/COMPARATOR: For eight apps and seven general practitioners (GPs): breadth of coverage and condition-suggestion and urgency advice accuracy measured against the vignettes' gold-standard. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proportion of conditions 'covered' by an app, that is, not excluded because the user was too young/old or pregnant, or not modelled; (2) proportion of vignettes with the correct primary diagnosis among the top 3 conditions suggested; (3) proportion of 'safe' urgency advice (ie, at gold standard level, more conservative, or no more than one level less conservative). RESULTS: Condition-suggestion coverage was highly variable, with some apps not offering a suggestion for many users: in alphabetical order, Ada: 99.0%; Babylon: 51.5%; Buoy: 88.5%; K Health: 74.5%; Mediktor: 80.5%; Symptomate: 61.5%; Your.MD: 64.5%; WebMD: 93.0%. Top-3 suggestion accuracy was GPs (average): 82.1%±5.2%; Ada: 70.5%; Babylon: 32.0%; Buoy: 43.0%; K Health: 36.0%; Mediktor: 36.0%; Symptomate: 27.5%; WebMD: 35.5%; Your.MD: 23.5%. Some apps excluded certain user demographics or conditions and their performance was generally greater with the exclusion of corresponding vignettes. For safe urgency advice, tested GPs had an average of 97.0%±2.5%. For the vignettes with advice provided, only three apps had safety performance within 1 SD of the GPs-Ada: 97.0%; Babylon: 95.1%; Symptomate: 97.8%. One app had a safety performance within 2 SDs of GPs-Your.MD: 92.6%. Three apps had a safety performance outside 2 SDs of GPs-Buoy: 80.0% (p<0.001); K Health: 81.3% (p<0.001); Mediktor: 87.3% (p=1.3×10-3).

Nesse contexto, este artigo objetiva identificar a vulnerabilidade socioeconômica dos municípios do Ceará, epicentro da região Nordeste, quanto à pandemia da COVID-19. Para tal, realizou-se um estudo exploratório-quantitativo, utilizando-se informações secundárias obtidas em bases de dados públicas governamentais. A vulnerabilidade socioeconômica dos municípios foi avaliada de forma dinâmica, baseando-se em modelo matemático de previsão do número de casos da COVID-19 aplicado à cidade de Wuhan, na China. Os indicadores de vulnerabilidade foram calculados sob duas trajetórias: valor de produção e número de pessoal ocupado, considerando-se características municipais como densidade demográfica, mobilidade interurbana e índice de desenvolvimento humano (IDH). No caso do estado do Ceará, os achados evidenciaram uma série de determinantes demográficos, sociais e econômicos locais que agravam os impactos da crise. Os indicadores de vulnerabilidade construídos na pesquisa podem servir de base para as decisões de governos municipais e estadual na cronologia da abertura econômica do estado por setores, municípios e regiões.","Câmara, Samuel Façanha; Pinto, Francisco Roberto; Silva, Felipe Roberto da; Gerhard, Felipe",Rev. adm. pública (Online),666,16

Additionally, correlation analysis was performed between students' self- and examiners' assessment of the treatment results. Methods: Within 4 hours, 22 examinees each had to place a multi-surface adhesive anterior and posterior restoration, performed an endodontic treatment on a maxillary premolar and a periodontal debridement of one quadrant. All treatments were performed on a model fixed in a phantom head. Compliance with the prescribed hygiene and social distancing guidelines and self-assessment of the practical performance was part of the practical examination as well. One examiner per examination part evaluated anonymously the final results. The historical control was based on the exam results of a cohort from 2019. Mean values (standard deviation), non-parametric correlations (Spearman's Rho) and group comparisons (Mann-Whitney) were calculated for statistical analysis. Results: Examination results under simulated treatment conditions were significantly worse (p<0.05) than in the cohort that took their state exam in patients, with exception of the endodontic partial exam. The overall scores in restorative dentistry and periodontology of both groups, which include a structured theoretical examination, did not differ. The majority of the candidates rated their performance worse than the examiners, and there was no correlation between self- and third-party assessment. Conclusion: In the comparison of two years, a simulated practical examination without patients in restorative dentistry, endodontics and periodontology resulted in matchable results compared with an examination on patients. Equal conditions for the candidates resulting in better comparability and avoidance of ethical dilemmas of patient treatment under examination conditions could also be arguments towards a state examination under phantom conditions in the future.","Wicht, Michael J; Höfer, Karolin; Derman, Sonja H M; Noack, M J; Barbe, A Greta",GMS J Med Educ,666,15

MATERIALS AND METHOD: The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model. RESULTS: If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1-2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.","Akladios, Cherif; Azais, Henri; Ballester, Marcos; Bendifallah, Sofiane; Bolze, Pierre-Adrien; Bourdel, Nicolas; Bricou, Alexandre; Canlorbe, Geoffroy; Carcopino, Xavier; Chauvet, Pauline; Collinet, Pierre; Coutant, Charles; Dabi, Yohann; Dion, Ludivine; Gauthier, Tristan; Graesslin, Olivier; Huchon, Cyrille; Koskas, Martin; Kridelka, Frederic; Lavoue, Vincent; Lecointre, Lise; Mezzadri, Matthieu; Mimoun, Camille; Ouldamer, Lobna; Raimond, Emilie; Touboul, Cyril",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,666,20

In this paper, based on in-depth remote interviews conducted from April 2020 through June 2020, with more than 130 gig and precarious workers in New York City, we find that precarious workers experience three main hurdles in regard to accessing unemployment assistance that can be broadly categorized as knowledge, sociological, and temporal/financial barriers. Drawing on worker interview responses, we have named these responses: (1) Didn’t Know, (2) Didn’t Want, and (3) Can’t Wait. These challenges have led workers to turn to gig and precarious work, further highlighting the inequities of the pandemic. As a result, for some workers, so-called “side hustles” have become their primary social safety net.

RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 45 (sd 17) years, 45% were male, and the case fatality rate was 0.9%. We performed 2,065 low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans highlighting lung lesions in 592 of the 991 (59.7%) patients with minimal clinical symptoms (NEWS scoreâ¯=â¯0). A discrepancy between spontaneous dyspnoea, hypoxemia and lung lesions was observed. Clinical factors (age, comorbidities, NEWS-2 score), biological factors (lymphocytopenia; eosinopenia; decrease in blood zinc; and increase in D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, troponin and C-reactive protein) and moderate and severe lesions detected in low-dose CT scans were associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment with HCQ-AZ was associated with a decreased risk of transfer to ICU or death (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.18 0.11-0.27), decreased risk of hospitalization &#8805;10 days (odds ratios 95% CI 0.38 0.27-0.54) and shorter duration of viral shedding (time to negative PCR: HR 1.29 1.17-1.42). QTc prolongation (>60â¯ms) was observed in 25 patients (0.67%) leading to the cessation of treatment in 12 cases including 3 cases with QTc> 500â¯ms. No cases of torsade de pointe or sudden death were observed. CONCLUSION: Although this is a retrospective analysis, results suggest that early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of COVID-19 patients, with at least 3 days of HCQ-AZ lead to a significantly better clinical outcome and a faster viral load reduction than other treatments.","Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Million, Matthieu; Gautret, Philippe; Colson, Philippe; Cortaredona, Sébastien; Giraud-Gatineau, Audrey; Honoré, Stéphane; Gaubert, Jean-Yves; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Chabrière, Eric; Stein, Andreas; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Fenollar, Florence; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Obadia, Yolande; Jacquier, Alexis; La Scola, Bernard; Brouqui, Philippe; Drancourt, Michel; Parola, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Travel Med Infect Dis,666,5

These autoantibodies neutralized most type I IFNs but rarely IFN-beta. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define the prevalence of autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with IFN-beta-1b during hospitalization and to analyze their impact on various clinical variables and outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed stored serum/plasma samples and clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated subcutaneously with IFN-beta-1b from March to May 2020, at the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 47 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, 16 of whom (34%) had a critical progression requiring ICU admission. The median age was 71 years, with 28 men (58.6%). Type I IFN-alpha- and omega-neutralizing autoantibodies were found in 5 of 47 patients with severe pneumonia or critical disease (10.6%), while they were not found in any of the 118 asymptomatic controls (p = 0.0016). The autoantibodies did not neutralize IFN-beta. No demographic, comorbidity, or clinical differences were seen between individuals with or without autoantibodies. We found a significant correlation between the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies and higher C-reactive protein levels (p = 5.10e-03) and lower lymphocyte counts (p = 1.80e-02). No significant association with response to IFN-beta-1b therapy (p = 0.34) was found. Survival analysis suggested that neutralizing autoantibodies may increase the risk of death (4/5, 80% vs 12/42, 28.5%). CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN underlie severe/critical COVID-19 stages in at least 10% of cases, correlate with increased C-RP and lower lymphocyte counts, and confer a trend towards increased risk of death. Subcutaneous IFN-beta treatment of hospitalized patients did not seem to improve clinical outcome. Studies of earlier, ambulatory IFN-beta treatment are warranted.","Troya, Jesús; Bastard, Paul; Planas-Serra, Laura; Ryan, Pablo; Ruiz, Montse; de Carranza, María; Torres, Juan; Martínez, Amalia; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Pujol, Aurora",J. clin. immunol,666,24

The classic symptoms of the disease have been well defined by the World Health Organization; however, olfactory/gustatory disorders have been reported in some studies, but there are still several missing points in the understanding and in the consensus about the clinical management of these cases. OBJECTIVE: To identify evidence in the scientific literature about olfactory/gustatory disorders, their clinical presentation, prevalence and possible specific treatments associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review of articles published up to April 25, 2020 was performed in Medline, Cochrane Clinical Trials, ScienceDirect, Lilacs, Scopus and Google Schoolar, OpenGrey.eu, DissOnline, The New York Academy of Medicine and Reasearch Gate. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) Studies on patients with COVID-19; (2) Records of COVID-19 signs/symptoms, and olfactory/gustatory functions. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) Studies on non-human coronavirus; (2) Review articles; (3) Experimental studies (in animals or in vitro); (4) Olfactory/gustatory disorders initiated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk assessment of bias of the selected studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Six articles from the 1788 records met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. A total of 1457 patients of different ethnicities were assessed; of them, 885 (60.7%) and 822 (56.4%) had smell and taste disorders, respectively, with women being most often affected. There were olfactory/gustatory disorders even without nasal obstruction/rhinorrhea and beginning even before the signs/symptoms of COVID-19; the recovery of smell/taste, when it occurs, usually happened in the first two weeks after COVID-19 resolution. There is evidence that olfactory/gustatory disorders are strong predictors of infection by SARS-CoV-2, and it is possible to recommend patient isolation, as early as of the medical consultation, preventing the spread of the virus. No scientific evidence has been identified for effective treatments for any of the disorders. CONCLUSION: Olfactory/gustatory disorders may occur at varying intensities and prior to the general symptoms of COVID-19 and should be considered as part of the clinical features of COVID-19, even in mild cases. There is still no scientific evidence of specific treatments for such disorders in COVID-19 disease.","Costa, Klinger V T da; Carnaúba, Aline Tenório Lins; Rocha, Katianne Wanderley; Andrade, Kelly Cristina Lyra de; Ferreira, Sonia M S; Menezes, Pedro de L",Braz J Otorhinolaryngol,666,16

Our study investigates coagulation markers and the incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients receiving recommended anticoagulation strategies. METHODS: In a retrospective single-center analysis at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, we investigated 31 adult COVID-19 patients between April 6th and May 13th, 2020 and with at least one laboratory assessment of the coagulation markers prothrombin time/Quick, thrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimers. For antithrombotic prophylaxis low-molecular-weight-heparin or unfractionated heparin was administered and two patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia received argatroban. RESULTS: We analyzed 31 patients (68% male, mean age 60± SD 15 years). 22 (71%) of these required intensive care unit treatment, 5 (16%) were hospitalized in a ward, and 4 (13%) were outpatients. Mean fibrinogen levels were markedly elevated to 6.4± SD 1.8g/l, with a peak in the third week of the disease and no significant decrease over time. D-dimers were elevated to a mean value of 5.1±4.4mg/l with peak levels of 6.8±5.3mg/l in the fourth week of disease, and a subsequent decrease. Platelet count (308±136G/l) and PT/Quick (85±22%) showed no significant changes over time. Sensitivity analyses for patients treated in the ICU showed that D-dimer levels were higher in this group. The results of other sensitivity analyses were comparable. Thromboembolic events were diagnosed in 4 (13%) patients and 5 (16%) patients died during the observation period. CONCLUSION: We find coagulation alterations in COVID-19 patients indicating significant hypercoagulability.

The high observed rate of venous thromboembolism prompted us to increase the prophylactic doses of enoxaparin from 40 mg daily up to 1 mg/kg twice daily in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), 0.7 mg/kg twice daily in high-intensity of care wards and 1 mg/kg daily in low-intensity of care wards. Patients on high enoxaparin doses were compared to those who received prophylaxis with the standard dosage. Efficacy endpoints were mortality, clinical deterioration, and the occurrence of venous thromboembolism, safety endpoint was the occurrence of major bleeding. Of 278 patients with Covid-19, 127 received prophylaxis with high enoxaparin doses and 151 with standard dosage. At 21 days, the incidence rate of death and clinical deterioration were lower in patients on higher doses than in those on the standard dosage (hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.62), and the incidence of venous thromboembolism was also lower (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.05). Major bleeding occurred in four of 127 patients (3.1%) on the high enoxaparin dosage. In conclusion, in the cohort of patients with Covid-19 treated with high enoxaparin dosages we observed a 60% reduction of mortality and clinical deterioration and a 50% reduction of venous thromboembolism compared to standard dosage prophylaxis. However, 3% of patients on high enoxaparin dosages had non-fatal major bleeding.","Martinelli, Ida; Ciavarella, Alessandro; Abbattista, Maria; Aliberti, Stefano; De Zan, Valentina; Folli, Christian; Panigada, Mauro; Gori, Andrea; Artoni, Andrea; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Monzani, Valter; Grasselli, Giacomo; Blasi, Francesco; Peyvandi, Flora",Intern. emerg. med,666,24

SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits similar clinical symptoms and immunopathological sequelae to SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, much of the developmental progress on SARS-CoV vaccines can be utilized for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Careful antigen selection during development is always of utmost importance for the production of effective vaccines that do not compromise recipient safety. This holds especially true for SARS-CoV vaccines, as several immunopathological disorders are associated with the activity of structural and nonstructural proteins encoded in the virus's genetic material. Whole viral protein and RNA-encoding full-length proteins contain both protective and ""dangerous"" sequences, unless pathological fragments are deleted. In light of recent advances, peptide vaccines may present a very safe and effective alternative. Peptide vaccines can avoid immunopathological pro-inflammatory sequences, focus immune responses on neutralizing immunogenic epitopes, avoid off-target antigen loss, combine antigens with different protective roles or mechanisms, even from different viral proteins, and avoid mutant escape by employing highly conserved cryptic epitopes. In this review, an attempt is made to exploit the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vaccine antigen screening, with particular attention to the pathological and immunogenic properties of SARS proteins.","Shalash, Ahmed O; Hussein, Waleed M; Skwarczynski, Mariusz; Toth, Istvan",Adv Sci (Weinh),666,24

Ancient professors of Hygiene such as Celli, Pagliani, Sclavo, Petragnani, Seppilli and Giovanardi flanked politicians in other critical moments. They helped them to manage healthcare reforms, earthquakes response, Seveso Dioxin disaster, cholera and poliomielitis epidemics and other health threats. The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the paramount importance of the practical application of basic concepts of public health, which were considered so far became obsolete, such as personal hygiene, quarantine, individual protective devices or basic epidemiological measures. Hygiene and Public Health used to have a targeted audience in professionals and lecturers. Nowadays, these topics are critical and of concern of a much larger audience. Public Health women and men are now asked to act in task forces, media broadcasts, webinars and consulting activities. In phase 2 of this epidemic - which is about to begin when this volume is to be published - the role of Public Health professionals could become even more relevant. However, this unexpected season must be managed with seriousness and intelligence, capitalizing it also for the future.

The secondary aims were to determine whether: 1) there were clinical predictors of COVID-19 status; and 2) whether social lockdown influenced the incidence and epidemiology of hip fractures. METHODS: A national multicentre retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting to six trauma centres or units with a hip fracture over a 46-day period (23 days pre- and 23 days post-lockdown). Patient demographics, type of residence, place of injury, presentation blood tests, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, anaesthetic, length of stay, COVID-19 status, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Of 317 patients with acute hip fracture, 27 (8.5%) had a positive COVID-19 test. Only seven (26%) had suggestive symptoms on admission. COVID-19-positive patients had a significantly lower 30-day survival compared to those without COVID-19 (64.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 45.7 to 83.3 vs 91.7%, 95% CI 88.2 to 94.8; p < 0.001). COVID-19 was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality risk adjusting for: 1) age, sex, type of residence (hazard ratio (HR) 2.93; p = 0.008); 2) Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (HR 3.52; p = 0.001); and 3) ASA (HR 3.45; p = 0.004). Presentation platelet count predicted subsequent COVID-19 status; a value of < 217 × 109/l was associated with 68% area under the curve (95% CI 58 to 77; p = 0.002) and a sensitivity and specificity of 63%. A similar number of patients presented with hip fracture in the 23 days pre-lockdown (n = 160) and 23 days post-lockdown (n = 157) with no significant (all p &#8805; 0.130) difference in patient demographics, residence, place of injury, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, ASA, or management. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was independently associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate for patients with a hip fracture. Notably, most patients with hip fracture and COVID-19 lacked suggestive symptoms at presentation. Platelet count was an indicator of risk of COVID-19 infection. These findings have implications for the management of hip fractures, in particular the need for COVID-19 testing.

In Indonesia, the B.1.1.7 cases have been found in several provinces since January 2021, although they are still in a lower number than the old variant of COVID-19. Therefore, this study aims to create a forecast analysis regarding the occasions of COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases based on data from the 1st January to 18th March 2021, and also analyze the association between meteorological factors with B.1.1.7 incidences in three different provinces of Indonesia such as the West Java, South Sumatra and East Kalimantan. METHODS: We used the Autoregressive Moving Average Models (ARIMA) to forecast the number of cases in the upcoming 14 days and the Spearman correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between B.1.1.7 cases and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, sunshine, and wind speed. RESULTS: The results of the study showed the fitted ARIMA models forecasted there was an increase in the daily cases in three provinces. The total cases in three provinces would increase by 36% (West Java), 13.5% (South Sumatra), and 30% (East Kalimantan) as compared with actual cases until the end of 14 days later. The temperature, rainfall and sunshine factors were the main contributors for B.1.1.7 cases with each correlation coefficients; r = -0.230; p < 0.05, r = 0.211; p < 0.05 and r = -0.418; p < 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We recapitulated that this investigation was the first preliminary study to analyze a short-term forecast regarding COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases as well as to determine the associated meteorological factors that become primary contributors to the virus spread.","Rendana, Muhammad; Idris, Wan Mohd Razi",J. infect. public health,666,7

To date, no real- world data about the efficacy of NmAb has been reported from clinical practice. We assessed the impact of NmAb treatment given in the outpatient clinical practice setting on hospital utilization. METHODS: Electronic medical records were used to identify adult COVID-19 patients who received NmAbs [bamlanivimab (BAM) or casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2)] and historic COVID-19 controls. Post-index hospitalization rates were compared. RESULTS: 707 confirmed COVID-19 patients received NmAb and 1709 historic COVID-19 controls were included; 553 (78%) received BAM, 154 (22%) received REGN-COV2. Patients receiving NmAb infusion had significantly lower hospitalization rate (5.8% vs. 11.4%, p<0.0001); a shorter length of stay if hospitalized (mean 5.2 days vs. 7.4 days, p=0.02), and fewer ED visits within 30 days post-index (8.1% vs 12.3%, p=0.003) than controls. Hospitalization-free survival was significantly longer in NmAb patients compared to controls (p<0.0001). There was a trend towards a lower hospitalization rate among patients who received NmAb within 2-4 days after symptom onset. In multivariate analysis, having received a NmAb transfusion was independently associated with a lower risk of hospitalization after adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI and referral source: adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.54 (0.38 - 0.79), p=0.0012. Overall mortality was not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: NmAb treatment reduced hospital utilization especially when received within a few days of symptom onset. Further study is needed to validate these findings.","Verderese, John Paul; Stepanova, Maria; Lam, Brian; Racila, Andrei; Kolacevski, Andrej; Allen, David; Hodson, Erin; Aslani-Amoli, Bahareh; Homeyer, Michael; Stanmyre, Sarah; Stevens, Helen; Garofalo, Stephanie; Henry, Linda; Venkatesan, Chapy; Gerber, Lynn H; Motew, Steve; Jones, J Stephen; Younossi, Zobair M",Clin. infect. dis,666,16

In contrast, the widely spread human coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63 tend to cause only mild symptoms.

A list of such epitopes is provided. The number of these epitopes and the prevalence of the common coronaviruses suggest that a large part of the world population has some degree of specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 already, even without having been infected by that virus. For inducing protection, booster vaccinations enhancing existing immunity are less demanding than primary vaccinations against new antigens. Therefore, for the discussion on vaccination strategies against COVID-19, the available immune memory against related viruses should be part of the consideration.","Dijkstra, Johannes M; Hashimoto, Keiichiro",F1000Res,666,26

The secondary objective was to define the priority to be assigned to each principle. SETTING: The study was conducted from March to June 2020 within the context of an ethical committee (EC) in Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven EC members and five additional external healthcare and bioethical professionals, forming a multidisciplinary panel, took part in the study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The compilation of a list of ethical principles (maximum of 10 items) and their priority ranking and application within an emergency pandemic context was established as the expected outcome of this work. RESULTS: A consensus on 10 guiding ethical principles was reached by the multidisciplinary panel. Transparency ranked first on the priority list as the most frequently voted principle, followed by the number of lives saved, life-years saved, respect for individuals' autonomy and equity. Other principles including life cycle, 'sickest first', reciprocity, instrumental value and lottery were also considered appropriate as potential tiebreakers. These principles were discussed and made consistent with the current Italian pandemic context by producing an explanatory document. CONCLUSIONS: The identified principles could be used in preparedness plans to guide resource allocation during pandemic events. By combining their rank and relevance in relation to disease, health system organisations, social and economic settings, and critical resources at risk of scarcity, these principles could help to maximise the benefit of resource use for the community, thus reducing inequalities for individuals.","Zeneli, Anita; Brandi, Giovanni; Di Pasquale, Giuseppe; Orlandini, Danilo; De Carolis, Piero; Bravi, Francesca; Pugliese, Francesco; Poluzzi, Elisabetta; Catena, Fausto; Giovanardi, Filippo; Valpiani, Giorgia; Mantovani, Renato; Magnanimi, Eugenia; Iannone, Primiano",BMJ Open,666,27

General Practitioners (GPs) played an important role in controlling the epidemic, and GP trainees also took an active part in this approach. This study was to explore Chinese GP trainees' career perspectives after COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative research study which included 12 GP trainees from three teaching hospitals in China. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. Grounded theory and thematic analysis were used to code the data and identify categories and factors. RESULTS: Eleven participants chose to continue a GP career after COVID-19, and nearly half of the participants strengthened their determination to dedicate themselves to this career. Only one participant decided to change the career choice because of interest in another specialty. Four main themes influencing GP trainees' perceptions of career development after COVID-19 emerged from the interviews: changes of GPs' work content in COVID-19, challenges of being a GP, psychological changes of the career, how to provide better primary care. Although some negative psychological changes existed, most of participants were inspired by role models and medical colleagues. They had more in-depth understanding of GPs' role and responsibility during COVID-19, and exhibited intensions for self-improvement in career development, especially in public health education and self-protection in preventing infectious diseases. In addition, the wide use of telemedicine provided a new work way for GP trainees. However, challenges, such as increased workloads, low income, lack of resources in primary medical institutions, and distrust of GPs are faced by trainees during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no substantial changes were seen in the career choice of GP trainees after COVID-19 outbreak. However, they were inspired and had an in-depth understanding about the GP's work and responsibility during an epidemic. Owing to the challenges faced by the GPs, measures are needed to improve the GP education and work environment in the training phase.","Yin, Yue; Chu, Xiaotian; Han, Xinxin; Cao, Yu; Di, Hong; Zhang, Yun; Zeng, Xuejun",BMC Fam Pract,666,1

Method: This international multi-centre cohort study included patients undergoing elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types, without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients fromlocal emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until 19 April 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19 free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theatre, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with COVID-19 patients). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications. Results: Of 9171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2481 were operated in COVID-19 free surgical pathways. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.2% versus 4.9%, OR: 0.62 [0.44-0.86]). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses and a propensity-score matched model. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.1% versus 3.6%;OR 0.53 [0.36-0.76]). Conclusions: Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19 free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Anonymous,",British Journal of Surgery,666,16

Deep learning methods are promising in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images. Most of these works first train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune the model on the newly collected COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset, often at a much smaller scale. However, simple fine-tuning may lead to poor performance due to two issues, firstly the large domain shift present in chest x-ray datasets and secondly the relatively small scale of the COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. In an attempt to address these issues, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting and propose a novel domain adaptation method, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA). SODA is designed to align the data distributions across different domains in the general domain space and also in the common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models in separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia. We also present results showing that SODA produces better pathology localizations.","Zhou, Jieli; Jing, Baoyu; Wang, Zeya; Xin, Hongyi; Tong, Hanghang",IEEE/ACM trans. comput. biol. bioinform.

COVID-19 has taken the lives of more than 2.1 million people worldwide, with a global mortality rate of 2.2%. Current COVID-19 treatment options include supportive respiratory care, parenteral corticosteroids, and remdesivir. Although COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with comorbidities, the vulnerability, clinical course, optimal management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with organ transplants has not been well described in the literature. The treatment of COVID-19 differs based on the organ(s) transplanted. Preliminary data suggested that liver transplant patients with COVID-19 did not have higher mortality rates than untransplanted COVID-19 patients. Table 1 depicts a compiled list of current published data on COVID-19 liver transplant patients. Most of these studies included both recent and old liver transplant patients. No distinction was made for early liver transplant patients who contract COVID-19 within their posttransplant hospitalization course. This potential differentiation needs to be further explored. Here, we report 2 patients who underwent liver transplantation who acquired COVID-19 during their posttransplant recovery period in the hospital. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two patients who underwent liver transplant and contracted COVID-19 in the early posttransplant period and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. This article includes a description of their hospital course, including treatment and recovery. CONCLUSION: The management of post-liver transplant patients with COVID-19 infection is complicated. Strict exposure precaution practice after organ transplantation is highly recommended. Widespread vaccination will help with prevention, but there will continue to be patients who contract COVID-19. Therefore, continued research into appropriate treatments is still relevant and critical. A temporary dose reduction of immunosuppression and continued administration of low-dose methylprednisolone, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma might be helpful in the management and recovery of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in post-liver transplant patients. Future studies and experiences from posttransplant patients are warranted to better delineate the clinical features and optimal management of COVID-19 infection in liver transplant recipients.","Dale, Miles; Sogawa, Hiroshi; Seyedsaadat, Seyed Mohammad; Wolf, David C; Bodin, Roxana; Partiula, Bernard; Nog, Rajat; Latifi, Rifat; John, Devon; Veillette, Gregory; Diflo, Thomas; Nishida, Seigo",Transplant Proc,666,26

Understanding hesitancy towards immunization is even more important nowadays, with the continuous threat of COVID-19 pandemic. Medical conspiracy beliefs, scientific skepticism, as well as low trust in governmental institutions, and evidence-based knowledge all have troubling effects on immunization. OBJECTIVE: To examine how these factors cross-react to influence vaccine behavior against any vaccine preventable disease (VPD), we hypothesized a model consisting of the belief in conspiracy theories as the predictor, and as the mediators subjective and objective vaccine knowledge, and trust in the health care system and science. The model was tested by examining the vaccine intentions for the children and self for any VPD. METHODS: Two separate studies were conducted on the representative samples of Serbian population; the first study investigated the intentions for child vaccination and the second study examined the vaccine intentions against any VPD, including adult vaccination. We used path analysis followed by logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results revealed high vaccine hesitancy motivated by the belief in the vaccine conspiracy theories, through its effect on reduced trust in medical science and institutions, and low objective vaccine knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may be used to implement appropriate policy changes and implementation of the public health campaigns to promote immunization with a wide range of vaccines against common diseases, such as measles, human papillomaviruses, or pertussis, and novel diseases, such as COVID.","Milosevic Dordevic, J; Mari, S; Vdovic, M; Milosevic, A",Soc Sci Med,666,16

Previous literature shows that 17% of patients with COVID-19 were found to have acute pancreatitis without any additional risk factors. However, the role of hypertriglyceridemia has not yet been examined. We present a case of acute pancreatitis secondary to triglyceridemia in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Case Report: A 31 year old man with morbid obesity (body mass index of 41.5 kg/m2) and no other past medical history presented with abdominal pain at the periumbilical region radiating to the back associated with nausea and vomiting for five days. He also complained of polyuria and polydipsia for one week. He denied any history of diabetes mellitus (DM), high triglycerides, alcohol use, and gallstones. He also denied any family history of hyperlipidemia. Of note, the patient's wife was sick with COVID-19 3 weeks prior and he tested negative at that time. His vitals were remarkable for sinus tachycardia of 140/minute. Labs were notable for positive PCR for COVID-19 pneumonia, lipase of 520, elevated triglycerides of 7265, and evidence of pancreatitis on computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis.

His chemistry revealed a glucose of 377, anion gap of 26, and a bicarbonate of 8, consistent with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for management of acute pancreatitis and DKA. He was managed with intravenous (IV) insulin drip, Atorvastatin, Niacin, Gemfibrozil and isotonic IV fluids. Following a 10 day ICU course he had complete resolution of DKA and hypertriglyceridemia and was subsequently transferred to the medical floor. Discussion:The proposed mechanism of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 infection is the entry of the virus via angiotensin II receptor that causes damage to pancreatic cells. This results in decreased insulin production leading to increased peripheral lipolysis and hypertriglyceridemia. The breakdown of triglycerides then often results in DKA. In the case of our patient it is possible that COVID-19 infection is a coincidence but the timing of symptoms, lack of prior history of triglyceridemia, and lack of family history makes COVID 19 the most likely cause. Therefore, in COVID-19 patients with abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis should be considered.","Gonuguntla, V.; Shajahan, S.; Waseem, H.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,666,3

In this study, multiple saliva omics from an individual were monitored over three periods (100 timepoints) involving: (1) hourly sampling over 24 h without intervention, (2) hourly sampling over 24 h including immune system activation using the standard 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (3) daily sampling for 33 days profiling the post-vaccination response. At each timepoint total saliva transcriptome and proteome, and small RNA from salivary extracellular vesicles were profiled, including mRNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial RNA. The two 24-h periods were used in a paired analysis to remove daily variation and reveal vaccination responses. Over 18,000 omics longitudinal series had statistically significant temporal trends compared to a healthy baseline. Various immune response and regulation pathways were activated following vaccination, including interferon and cytokine signaling, and MHC antigen presentation. Immune response timeframes were concordant with innate and adaptive immunity development, and coincided with vaccination and reported fever. Overall, mRNA results appeared more specific and sensitive (timewise) to vaccination compared to other omics. The results suggest saliva omics can be consistently assessed for non-invasive personalized monitoring and immune response diagnostics.","Mias, George I; Singh, Vikas Vikram; Rogers, Lavida R K; Xue, Shuyue; Zheng, Minzhang; Domanskyi, Sergii; Kanada, Masamitsu; Piermarocchi, Carlo; He, Jin",Sci Rep,666,3

The early identification and timely treatment of severe patients are crucial to reducing the mortality of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and early predictors for severe COVID-19, and to establish a prediction model for the identification and triage of severe patients. Methods: All confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University were enrolled in this retrospective non-interventional study. The patients were divided into a mild group and a severe group, and the clinical data were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the independent early predictors for severe COVID-19, and the prediction model was constructed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the prediction model and each early predictor. Results: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 19 were mild and 21 were severe. The proportions of patients with venerable age (&#8805;60 years old), comorbidities, and hypertension in severe patients were higher than that of the mild (P < 0.05). The duration of fever and respiratory symptoms, and the interval from illness onset to viral clearance were longer in severe patients (P < 0.05). Most patients received at least one form of oxygen treatments, while severe patients required more mechanical ventilation (P < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that venerable age, hypertension, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and elevated neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were the independent high-risk factors for severe COVID-19. ROC curves demonstrated significant predictive value of age, lymphocyte count, albumin and NLR for severe COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly constructed prediction model for predicting severe COVID-19 was 90.5% and 84.2%, respectively, and whose positive predictive value, negative predictive value and crude agreement were all over 85%. Conclusions: The severe COVID-19 risk model might help clinicians quickly identify severe patients at an early stage and timely take optimal therapeutic schedule for them.","Hu, Haifeng; Du, Hong; Li, Jing; Wang, Yage; Wu, Xiaoqing; Wang, Chunfu; Zhang, Ye; Zhang, Gufen; Zhao, Yanyan; Kang, Wen; Lian, Jianqi",J Glob Health,666,16

However, coverage amongst at-risk adults for recommended vaccines continues to be suboptimal. This study examined the perceptions of middle and older aged Australian adults towards hospital-based immunization programs and their previous exposures to receiving vaccines via tertiary care. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with Australian adults 45 years and older in late 2019 to capture influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake, exposure to hospital-based immunization programs, missed opportunities to vaccinate and receptiveness towards the promotion and/or delivery of vaccines in the hospital setting. RESULTS: Only 13 respondents reported receiving a vaccine at hospital, yet 72.2% (931/1292) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated in that setting. Amongst those who attended hospital during 2019 and were eligible for vaccination, 57.2% and 28.3% of respondents were not immunized for pneumococcal and influenza, respectively. Missed opportunities for both vaccines were significantly higher amongst those at low-risk for influenza (&#8804;65 years (low-risk): 52.9%, &#8804;65 years (high-risk): 18.3%, >65 years: 15.1%; p < 0.001) and pneumococcal (&#8804;65 years (low-risk): 79.1%, &#8804;65 years (high-risk): 52.4%, >65 years: 44%; p < 0.001). Among those with a missed opportunity for hospital-based vaccination, the most common reason for not getting immunized was a lack of recommendation. Most (86.4%) reported that their general practitioner was the person or group they trusted most to receive vaccine information from. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this Australian study support international work that shows very low rates of opportunistic vaccination in hospitals despite national recommendations to vaccinate prior to discharge. Considering the need for high levels of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, hospitals may need to be considered to opportunistically capture those not accessing the vaccine in other settings.","McFadden, Kathleen; Heywood, Anita; Dyda, Amalie; Kaufman, Jessica; Seale, Holly",Vaccine,666,24

METHODS: One hundred forty patients referred for FDG PET/CT during February and March 2021 after first or second vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna were retrospectively included. FDG-avidity of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes was measured and compared. Assuming no knowledge of prior vaccination, metastatic risk was analyzed by two readers and the clinical impact was evaluated. RESULTS: FDG PET/CT showed FDG-avid lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccine injection in 75/140 (54%) patients with a mean SUVmax of 5.1 (range 2.0 - 17.3). FDG-avid lymph nodes were more frequent in patients vaccinated with Moderna than Pfizer-BioNTech (36/50 [72%] vs. 39/90 [43%] cases, p < 0.001). Metastatic risk of unilateral FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes was rated unlikely in 52/140 (37%), potential in 15/140 (11%), and likely in 8/140 (6%) cases. Clinical management was affected in 17/140 (12%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes are common after COVID-19 vaccination. The avidity of lymph nodes is more frequent in Moderna compared to that in Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. To avoid relatively frequent clinical dilemmas, we recommend carefully taking the history for prior vaccination in patients undergoing FDG PET/CT and administering the vaccine contralateral to primary cancer. KEY POINTS: â¢ PET/CT showed FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccine injection site in 54% of 140 oncological patients after COVID-19 vaccination. â¢ FDG-avid lymphadenopathy was observed significantly more frequently in Moderna compared to patients receiving Pfizer-BioNTech-vaccines. â¢ Patients should be screened for prior COVID-19 vaccination before undergoing PET/CT to enable individually tailored recommendations for clinical management.","Skawran, Stephan; Gennari, Antonio G; Dittli, Manuel; Treyer, Valerie; Muehlematter, Urs J; Maurer, Alexander; Burger, Irene A; Mader, Cäcilia; Messerli, Olivia; Grünig, Hannes; Gebhard, Catherine; Huellner, Martin W; Curioni-Fontecedro, Alessandra; Berger, Christoph; Messerli, Michael",Eur. radiol,666,26

We aimed to assess whether there are differences in clinical manifestations between COVID-19 patients from the East (East and South-East Asian countries including China, South Korea, and Thailand) and the West (North American, European, and Middle East countries, including the United States, Italy, France, and Iran). METHODS: For this meta-analysis, we searched for eligible studies about COVID-19 in three databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were divided into two cohorts for analysis: the East and the West. Stata 13·1 software was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of the 1527 studies initially identified by the literature search, 169 full-text articles were retrieved and screened for eligibility. Fifty-seven of these, describing 19 353 patients, were deemed eligible for inclusion. Of these, 45 studies with 8 416 patients were from the East while 12 studies with 10 937 patients were from the West. The results indicated that the incidences of cough, headache, dizziness, nasal congestion, and digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients from the East were lower than those in the West. The laboratory data showed that there were no significant differences in the levels of lymphocytes, leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and platelet counts between the two groups. In addition, our results also showed that the incidence of cardiac and kidney injury, as well as increased levels of creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase, were significantly higher in patients from the West than from the East. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that there are differences in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients from the East and the West.

Patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of bleeding complications. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with signs and symptoms of acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out for articles published until until November 11, 2020, in the Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. We included studies on COVID-19 patients with signs and symptoms of GIB. Results: Our search yielded 49 studies, of which eight with a collective 127 patients (86 males and 41 females) met our inclusion criteria. Conservative management alone was performed in 59% of the patients, endoscopic evaluation in 31.5%, and interventional radiology (IR) embolization in 11%. Peptic ulcer disease was the most common endoscopic finding, diagnosed in 47.5% of the patients. Pooled overall mortality was 19.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 12.7%-27.6%) and pooled mortality secondary to GIB was 3.5% (95% CI; 1.3%-9.1%). The pooled risk of rebleeding was 11.3% (95% CI; 6.8%-18.4%). Conclusion: The majority of COVID-19 patients with GIB responded to conservative management, with a low mortality rate associated with GIB and the risk of rebleeding. Thus, we suggest limiting endoscopic and IR interventions to those with hemodynamic instability and those for whom conservative management was unsuccessful.","Iqbal, Umair; Anwar, Hafsa; Siddiqui, Hafiz Umair; Khan, Muhammad Ali; Kamal, Faisal; Confer, Bradley D; Khara, Harshit S",,666,1

Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is a new vaccination approach based on intramuscular injection of DNA expression vectors coding for a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) with an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs, even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells can freely circulate into the body and are internalized by antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, EV-associated antigens can be cross-presented to prime antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a strategy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we designed DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and different viral antigens, namely N- and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. We provided evidence that all fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity became detectable in spleens and, most important, in lung airways. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lungs. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed for new anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies.","Ferrantelli, Flavia; Chiozzini, Chiara; Manfredi, Francesco; Giovannelli, Andrea; Leone, Patrizia; Federico, Maurizio",,666,16

It is a leading public health emergency across the globe in general and developing countries in particular. Strengthening good preventive behavior is the best way to tackle such pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The study assessed preventive behavior and associated factors towards COVID-19 among residents of Qellam Wallaga Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted with a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected by interview and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. Binomial logistic regression was used to test the association between the variables. An Adjusted Prevalence with 95% CI was used to express the associations and interpret the findings. RESULTS: Among 634 participants, 417(65.8%) were from urban residences, and 347 (54.7%) belongs to a female. Age ranges 18 years through 87 years. Only 68(10.7%) participants showed good preventive behavior for COVID-19. The majority of them (84.7%) perceived that the disease is very dangerous and 450(71.0%) of them believe that they are at high risk. More than 17% of the respondents have sufficient knowledge. Respondents with sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 were about 2 times more likely to exercise good preventive behavior compare to those with insufficient knowledge, [(APR: 2.1; 95% CI: [1.2, 3.9)]. The urban residents was 3.3 more than that of rural residents to practice good preventive behavior, [(APR: 3.3; 95% CI: [1.6, 6.4)]. Respondents who use social media as a source of information were more than 2 times more likely to have good preventive behavior compared to those who did not, [(APR: 2.3; 95% CI: [1.3, 3.4)]. CONCLUSION: Adoptions of COVID-19 preventive behavior in the study population is very low. Due emphasis should be given to rural residents. Risk communication activities should be strengthened through effective community engagement to slow down and stop the transmssion of the disease in the community.","Gutu, Birhanu; Legese, Genene; Fikadu, Nigussie; Kumela, Birhanu; Shuma, Firafan; Mosisa, Wakgari; Regassa, Zelalem; Shiferaw, Yoseph; Tesfaye, Lata; Yohannes, Buli; Palanimuthu, Kogila; Birhanu, Zewudie; Shiferaw, Desalegn",PLoS One,666,24

The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy.

Thus, several commercial immunoassays have recently been developed. The purpose of our study was to assess the performance of five commonly used immunoassays in Greece (3 ELISA, namely Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2, GA GENERIC SARS-CoV-2 and Vircell COVID-19; and 2 chemiluminescent, namely ABBOTT SARS-CoV-2 and ROCHE Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Sera specimens derived from 168 individuals were utilized to assess the specificity and sensitivity score of each assay. Among them, we included 99 COVID-19 patients (29 asymptomatic, 36 with symptom onset 4 to 14 days before serum sampling, and 34 with symptom initiation &#8805; 15 days ago), and 69 volunteers with sera specimens collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and maintained at -80°C. We demonstrated that chemiluminescent immunoassays exhibit a significantly higher specificity score but a lower sensitivity, compared to ELISA immunoassays. Moreover, immunoassays detecting IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N protein instead of S protein alone are more reliable, considering both specificity and sensitivity scores. Interestingly, all asymptomatic patients displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, confirmed by at least two immunoassays. We suggest that chemiluminescent assays could be used as screening methods for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to evaluate the possible prevalence of disease in the general population, while ELISA assays would be more reliable to evaluate, and follow-up confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Speletas, Matthaios; Kyritsi, Maria A; Vontas, Alexandros; Theodoridou, Aikaterini; Chrysanthidis, Theofilos; Hatzianastasiou, Sophia; Petinaki, Efthimia; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos",Front Immunol,666,6

After the pandemic, when the science finds a medicine with which the contagion will not be so widespread - vaccine or other “medicine” that cures it -, travel will resume inevitably but slowly in different ways from those we all know. Imagining new scenarios of international tourism and redesigning the geography of tourist flows will not be easy, especially in Italy where the reasons of beauty probably will not be the only ones to attract millions of tourists. Therefore, tourism activities must be reconsidered with respect to the “new normality” and the limitations to tourism by health authorities and the results of the economic crisis induced by social distancing measures. The paper, therefore, after a careful assessment of the forecasts already made by international organizations at different levels of scale post Covid-19, will verify how the Covid-19 phenomenon will affect perceived geographies, in relation to markets.

We aim to describe the perception of telemedicine by both surgical patients and providers to understand the preferences for future incorporation in future surgical practice. METHODS: An anonymous survey was administered to providers that transitioned clinic visits to telemedicine encounters since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second part of the study, patients who underwent video telemedicine appointments answered survey questions via telephone. RESULTS: Twenty-six out of 36 (72.7%) providers responded. Over 75% reported that they could effectively communicate with patients over telemedicine. Six (23.1%) reported that they could adequately assess surgical sites. Of 361 patients, 187 consented to the study (consent rate 51.8%). Among patients, the most common result to choose a telemedicine appointment was to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission (84, 44.9%), though the minority reported that they would choose telemedicine after the pandemic (64, 34.2%). Those patients who would choose an in-person visit were more likely to have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Score, body mass index, and use friends or family for transportation. In open-ended feedback, patients suggested that telemedicine would be better suited for long-term follow-up rather than the immediate postoperative setting. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and providers reported a high degree of satisfaction using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic but noted concern with limited physical examinations. Telemedicine may be suited for preoperative evaluation and medium-term and long-term postoperative follow-up for surgical patients.","Zhu, Clara; Williamson, John; Lin, Andrew; Bush, Kathryn; Hakim, Abraham; Upadhyaya, Kirtan; Hunter, Krystal; Sensenig, Richard; Spitz, Francis; Atabek, Umur; Hong, Young Ki",Am Surg,666,20

There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes polyproteins, four structural proteins and six accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of various mammals. The imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the renin-angiotensin system leads to multi-system inflammation. The early symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough and fatigue. Vigilant screening is important.

The double burden of infectious and chronic diseases constitutes major causes of morbidity and mortality. Over the last two decades, there has been a rise in infectious diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), the H1N1 pandemic influenza, the Ebolavirus and the Covid-19 virus. These diseases have rapidly spread across the world and have reminded us of the unprecedented connectivity that defines our modern civilization. Though some countries have made substantial progress toward improving global surveillance for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), the vast majority of Low-and Middle-income Countries (LMICs) with fragile health systems and various system-related bottlenecks remain vulnerable to outbreaks and, as such, experience dramatic social and economic consequences when they are reported. Lessons learned from past outbreaks suggest that gender inequalities are common across a range of health issues relating to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), with women being particularly disadvantaged, partially due to the burden placed on them. Though these countries are striving to improve their health systems and be more inclusive to this vulnerable group, the national/ global outbreaks have burdened the overall system and thus paralyzed normal services dedicated to the delivery of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services. In this paper, we discuss the global commitments to SRH, the impact of the EIDs on the LMICs, the failure in the delivery of SRH services, and the strategies for successful implementation of recovery plans that must address the specific and differentiated needs of women and girls in resource-poor settings.","Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Yaya, Sanni",Reprod Health,666,16

We hypothesized that if negative dominance appeared, it would be a reflection of peaks in adverse events related to the vaccine, that negative content would attract more engagement on social media than other vaccine-related posts, and posts referencing adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccination would have a higher average toxicity score. METHODS: We collected data using Google Trends for search behavior, CrowdTangle for social media data, and Media Cloud for media stories, and compared them against the dates of key adverse events related to COVID-19. We used Communalytic to analyze the toxicity of social media posts by platform and topic. RESULTS: While our first hypothesis was partially supported, with peaks in search behavior for image and YouTube videos driven by adverse events, we did not find negative dominance in other types of searches or patterns of attention by news media or on social media. CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence in our data to prove the negative dominance of adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccination on social media.

This article explores the factors associated with an increase in domestic violence incidents during COVID-19 by applying routine activity theory (RAT) framework. Data were drawn from the incidents of domestic violence reported in newspapers. Data was analyzed using content analysis and three major themes, i.e., three principle components of RAT-motivated offender, suitable target, and absence of capable guardian-were drawn. Findings reveal that sources of motivation in domestic violence perpetrators during the lockdown were alcohol and unemployment. The symbolic value that perpetrators associated with women, lower inertia, visibility, and accessibility to the perpetrators made women suitable targets of domestic violence. Lastly, shortage of police force and travel restrictions on formal and informal sources resulted in the absence of capable guardians. We conclude that changes in the routine activities of people during the COVID-19 lockdown provided more opportunities to the perpetrators of domestic violence.","Krishnakumar, Akshaya; Verma, Shankey",Asian J Criminol,666,11

One of the first things during inflammation is the response by acute phase proteins coupled with coagulation. The angiotensinogen (a substrate for hypertension) is one such acute phase protein and goes on to explain an association of covid-19 with that of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2, a metallopeptidase). Therefore, it is advisable to administer, and test the efficacy of specific blocker(s) of angiotensinogen such as siRNAs or antibodies to covid-19 subjects. Covid-19 activates neutrophils, macrophages, but decreases T-helper cells activity. The metalloproteinases promote the activation of these inflammatory immune cells, therefore; we surmise that doxycycline (a metalloproteinase inhibitor, and a safer antibiotic) would benefit the covid-19 subjects. Along these lines, an anti-acid has also been suggested for mitigation of the covid-19 complications. Interestingly, there are three primary vegetables (celery, carrot, and long-squash) which are alkaline in their pH-range as compared to many others. Hence, treatment with fresh juice (without any preservative) from these vegies or the antioxidants derived from purple carrot and cabbage together with appropriate anti-coagulants may also help prevent or lessen the detrimental effects of the covid-19 pathological outcomes. These suggested remedies might be included in the list of putative interventions that are currently being investigated towards mitigating the multi-organ damage by Covid-19 during the ongoing pandemic.","Tyagi, Suresh C; Singh, Mahavir",Mol. cell. biochem,666,5

SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome named COVID-19, which presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia, with acute respiratory distress syndrome and frequent death. All age groups are susceptible to the infection, but children, especially infants, seem to be partially spared, having a more favorable clinical course than other age groups. There is currently no clear evidence showing vertical transmission and intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 infection in fetuses of women developing COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, and even if transmission is possible, the SARS-CoV2 positivity of the mother does not require delivery by caesarean section, does not contraindicate the management of the infant in rooming-in and allows breastfeeding. This review provides an overview on the biology of the virus, on the pathogenesis of the infection, with particular attention to pregnancy and neonatal age, on the clinical presentation of infection in newborns and young infants and summarizes the international recommendations currently available on the clinical care of neonates with SARS-CoV2 infection or at risk of catching the virus.

Due to nosocomial spread of infection and the variable incubation period with the virus, follow-up past 30 days after injury is required to evaluate the true mortality amongst these patients. We aim to assess 120-day mortality rates in hip fracture patients with COVID-19 infection and compare this to hip fracture patients without COVID-19 infection presenting during the same time period. Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter review of all patients aged &#8805; 60 years admitted with a fractured neck of femur between March 5 and April 5, 2020, at nine U.K. trauma units. COVID-19 status, demographic data, comorbidities, and date of death (if applicable) were collected. Results: Data were collected for 265 hip fracture patients. Forty-six patients (17.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 infection. There were no significant differences in age or Charlson comorbidity score between those with or without COVID-19. Those with COVID-19 infection were more likely to be male (p = 0.01). Patients with COVID-19 had a 30-day mortality of 35% versus 10% in patients without (p < 0.01). One hundred twenty-day mortality was also greater in those with COVID-19 infection at 63% compared to those without at 17% (p < 0.01). Previous history of myocardial infarction was the only independent factor that showed to increase mortality rate (p = 0.03). Subgroup analysis also revealed significantly increased mortality rates at 120 days in men (27% vs. 67%), women (14% vs. 59%), and those undergoing surgery (56% vs. 30%). Conclusions: We report a significantly increased mortality rate at 30 and 120 days after injury in an already high-risk cohort of surgical patients. With nearly half of patients being diagnosed with COVID-19 at 14 days or greater following admission, this study highlights the importance of taking appropriate measures to decrease the incidence of nosocomial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in hip fracture patients.","Oputa, Tobenna J; Dupley, Leanne; Bourne, James T",Clin Orthop Surg,666,20

We investigated avelumab (anti-programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1]) maintenance after first-line induction chemotherapy for GC/GEJC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: JAVELIN Gastric 100 was a global, open-label, phase III trial. Eligible patients had untreated, unresectable, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic GC or GEJC. Patients without progressive disease after 12 weeks of first-line chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus a fluoropyrimidine were randomly assigned 1:1 to avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or continued chemotherapy, stratified by region (Asia v non-Asia). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) after induction chemotherapy in all randomly assigned patients or the PD-L1-positive randomly assigned population (&#8805; 1% of tumor cells; 73-10 assay). RESULTS: A total of 805 patients received induction; 499 were randomly assigned to avelumab (n = 249) or continued chemotherapy (n = 250). Median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 12.0 months) versus 10.9 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 12.4 months) and 24-month OS rate was 22.1% versus 15.5% with avelumab versus chemotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11; P = .1779). In the PD-L1-positive population (n = 54), the HR for OS was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57 to 2.23; P = .6352). In an exploratory analysis of the PD-L1-positive population, defined as combined positive score &#8805; 1 (22C3 assay; n = 137), median OS was 14.9 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 17.3 months) with avelumab versus 11.6 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 12.6 months) with chemotherapy (unstratified HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.05).

This study assessed the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contaminating surfaces and objects in two hospital isolation units and a quarantine hotel. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 virus stability and infectivity on non-porous surfaces was tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Surface and air sampling were conducted at two COVID-19 isolation units and in a quarantine hotel. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR and infectivity was assessed by VERO E6 CPE test. RESULTS: In laboratory-controlled conditions, SARS-CoV-2 gradually lost its infectivity completely by day 4 at ambient temperature, and the decay rate of viral viability on surfaces directly correlated with increase in temperature. Viral RNA was detected in 29/55 surface samples (52.7%) and 16/42 surface samples (38%) from the surroundings of symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation units of two hospitals and in a quarantine hotel for asymptomatic and very mild COVID-19 patients. None of the surface and air samples from the three sites (0/97) were found to contain infectious titres of SARS-Cov-2 on tissue culture assay.

An efficient and convenient method based on clinical characteristics was needed to evaluate the potential deterioration in patients. We aimed to develop a simple and practical risk scoring system to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients on admission. We retrospectively investigated the clinical information of confirmed COVID-19 patients from 10 February 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan Union Hospital. Predictors of severity were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 147 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were grouped into non-severe (94 patients) and severe (53 patients) groups. We found that an increased level of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, D-dimer, fibrinogen (FIB), IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), serum amyloid A (SAA) and a decreased level of lymphocytes were important risk factors associated with severity. Furthermore, three variables were used to formulate a clinical risk scoring system named COVID-19 index = 3 × D-dimer (µg/L) + 2 × lgESR (mm/hr) - 4 × lymphocyte (×109 /L) + 8. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.843 (95% CI, 0.771-0.914). We propose an effective scoring system to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients. This simple prediction model may provide healthcare workers with a practical method and could positively impact decision-making with regard to deteriorating patients.","Dong, Yalan; Zhou, Haifeng; Li, Mingyue; Zhang, Zili; Guo, Weina; Yu, Ting; Gui, Yang; Wang, Quansheng; Zhao, Lei; Luo, Shanshan; Fan, Heng; Hu, Desheng",Transbound. emerg. dis.

The purpose of this report was to describe the possible association between COVID-19 and PIMS in children. METHODS: From 28 March to 24 June 2020, 10 febrile children were admitted with COVID-19 infection showing characteristics of PIMS in Buali tertiary hospital of Sari, in Mazandaran province, northern Iran. Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, and therapeutic modalities were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 5.37 ± 3.9 years (13 months to 12 years). Six of them were boys. Kawasaki disease, myocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, appendicitis, sepsis, urosepsis, prolonged febrile seizure, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, and COVID-19-related pneumonia were their first presentation. All of them had increased C-reactive protein levels, and most of them had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lymphopenia, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Three of them had thrombocytopenia(PLT < 106). Six of them were serologically or polymerase chain reaction positive for COVID-19, and 4 of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 just by chest computed tomography scan. Most of the patients improved without a residual sequel, except one who died with multiorgan failure and another case was discharged with a giant coronary aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: Children with COVID-19 may present symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and inflammatory syndromes. PIMS should be considered in children with fever, rash, seizure, cough, tachypnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.","Shahbaznejad, Leila; Navaeifar, Mohammad Reza; Abbaskhanian, Ali; Hosseinzadeh, Fatemeh; Rahimzadeh, Golnar; Rezai, Mohammad Sadegh",BMC Pediatr,666,16

Further, as no effective management protocols to address this pandemic were available, a need was felt to explore the integration of modern and traditional medicines to treat Covid 19 cases. In view of this an exploratory nonrandomized prospective study has been undertaken for comparing the outcomes of traditional Ayurvedic classical formulation of Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Piper longum (Pippali) as an add on to standard of care (SOC) using modern medicine with SOC alone. This has been done in mild and moderate Covid - 19 cases, at a tertiary care integrative Medicine hospital in the National Capital Region, Gurgaon, India. The outcomes have been evaluated in terms of the duration of hospital stay, the time to clinical recovery, safety and non-interference/interaction of Ayurvedic and Further, long term impact of Covid - 19 treatment has been evaluated using quality of life questionnaire after 3 months of discharge. Findings of present study reveals that the Ayurveda add-on formulation of Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Piper longum (Pippali) has reduced the length of hospital stay and improve the recovery time. General feeling of wellbeing and activity levels were better in the 3 month follow-up post discharge in the Ayurveda add-on group.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, an AI system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19-infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. Five hundred thirty-one CT scans from 204 COVID-19 patients were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital. The automatically segmented lung abnormalities were compared with manual segmentation of two experienced radiologists using the Dice coefficient on a randomly selected subset (30 CT scans). Two imaging biomarkers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU), to assess disease severity and disease progression. The assessments were compared with patient status of diagnosis reports and key phrases extracted from radiology reports using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Cohen's kappa, respectively. RESULTS: The dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19-infected lung abnormalities was 0.74 ± 0.28 and 0.76 ± 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement (0.79 ± 0.25). The computed two imaging biomarkers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.97 (p value < 0.001). Very good agreement (&#954; = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists was achieved on evaluating the changes in infection volumes. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning-based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19-associated lung abnormalities and assess the disease severity and its progressions. KEY POINTS: â¢ A deep learning-based AI system was able to accurately segment the infected lung regions by COVID-19 using the thick-section CT scans (Dice coefficient &#8805; 0.74). â¢ The computed imaging biomarkers were able to distinguish between the non-severe and severe COVID-19 stages (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.97). â¢ The infection volume changes computed by the AI system were able to assess the COVID-19 progression (Cohen's kappa 0.8220).","Li, Zhang; Zhong, Zheng; Li, Yang; Zhang, Tianyu; Gao, Liangxin; Jin, Dakai; Sun, Yue; Ye, Xianghua; Yu, Li; Hu, Zheyu; Xiao, Jing; Huang, Lingyun; Tang, Yuling",Eur Radiol,666,0

Using a qualitative methodology, this study aims to explore why people in Germany and Switzerland were motivated to comply with policy measures during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and what factors hindered or limited their motivation. While quantitative surveys can measure the level of compliance, or broadly ask what motives people had for compliance, we here strive to explain why and how these motives lead to compliance. METHODS: This publication has been made possible by the joint work of the members of the ""Solidarity in times of pandemics"" (SolPan) research commons. Seventy-seven semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with members of the general public in Germany (n = 46) and the German-speaking part of Switzerland (n = 31) in April 2020. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed following a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Three themes were identified that summarize factors contributing to compliant or noncompliant behavior. (1) Social cohesion was, on the one hand, an important motivator for compliance, but at the same time related to conflicting needs, illustrating the limits of compliance. (2) Consequences were considered on both the individual level (eg, consequences of individual infection) and societal level (eg, the societal and economic consequences of restrictions). (3) While for some participants following the rules was perceived as a matter of principle, others stressed the importance of making their own risk assessment, which was often associated with with a need for evidence on the effectiveness and reasons behind measures. CONCLUSION: A variety of motives contribute to COVID-19 related compliance. Authorities should seek to address these multi-faceted aspects to support motivation for compliance in a large proportion of the population.","Zimmermann, Bettina M; Fiske, Amelia; McLennan, Stuart; Sierawska, Anna; Hangel, Nora; Buyx, Alena",Int. j. health policy manag,666,16

We develop a unified modeling framework to quantify and compare electricity usage changes in 58 countries and regions around the world from January-May 2020. We find that daily electricity demand declined as much as 10% in April 2020 compared to modelled demand, controlling for weather, seasonal and temporal effects, but with significant variation. Clustering techniques show that four impact groups capture systematic differences in timing and depth of electricity usage changes, ranging from a mild decline of 2% to an extreme decline of 26%. These groupings do not align with geography, with almost every continent having at least one country or region that experienced a dramatic reduction in demand and one that did not. Instead, we find that such changes relate to government restrictions and mobility. Government restrictions have a non-linear effect on demand that generally saturates at its most restrictive levels and sustains even as restrictions ease. Mobility offers a sharper focus on electricity demand change with workplace and residential mobility strongly linked to demand changes at the daily level. Steep declines in electricity usage are associated with workday hourly load patterns that resemble pre-COVID weekend usage. Quantifying these impacts is a crucial first step in understanding the impacts of crises like the pandemic and the associated societal response on electricity demand.","Buechler, Elizabeth; Powell, Siobhan; Sun, Tao; Zanocco, Chad; Astier, Nicolas; Bolorinos, Jose; Flora, June; Boudet, Hilary; Rajagopal, Ram",,666,16
489140,489140,489140,Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on Produce following a Low-Dose Aerosol Exposure,11.837723,11.566249,2020,"COVID-19 has recently caused a global health crisis and an effective interventional therapy is urgently needed. Remdesivir is one effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA replication. It supersedes other NTP analogues because it not only terminates the polymerization activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), but also inhibits the proofreading activity of intrinsic exoribonuclease (ExoN). Even though the static structure of Remdesivir binding to RdRp has been solved and biochemical experiments have suggested it to be a ""delayed chain terminator"", the underlying molecular mechanisms is not fully understood. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of Remdesivir on nucleotide addition and proofreading. We found that when Remdesivir locates at an upstream site in RdRp, the 1'-cyano group experiences electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge (Asp865-Lys593), which subsequently halts translocation. Our findings can supplement the current understanding of the delayed chain termination exerted by Remdesivir and provide an alternative molecular explanation about Remdesivir's inhibitory mechanism. Such inhibition also reduces the likelihood of Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on 3'-terminal nucleotides. Furthermore, our study also suggests that Remdesivir's 1'-cyano group can disrupt the cleavage site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduction in the cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible and novel mechanisms at the molecular level of how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Dong; Wang, Xiaowei; Yuan, Congmin; Li, Yongfang; Jia, Xilin; Gao, Xin; Yen, Hui-Ling; Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang; Huang, Xuhui",Phys Chem Chem Phys,666,24

In Survey 1, pet owners (n = 686) responded during the final week of the five-week Alert Level 4 lockdown (highest level of restrictions-April 2020), and survey 2 involved 498 respondents during July 2020 whilst at Alert Level 1 (lowest level of restrictions). During the lockdown, 54.7% of owners felt that their pets' wellbeing was better than usual, while only 7.4% felt that it was worse. Most respondents (84.0%) could list at least one benefit of lockdown for their pets, and they noted pets were engaged with more play (61.7%) and exercise (49.7%) than pre-lockdown. Many respondents (40.3%) expressed that they were concerned about their pet's wellbeing after lockdown, with pets missing company/attention and separation anxiety being major themes. In Survey 2, 27.9% of respondents reported that they continued to engage in increased rates of play with their pets after lockdown, however, the higher levels of pet exercise were not maintained. Just over one-third (35.9%) of owners took steps to prepare their pets to transition out of lockdown. The results indicate that pets may have enjoyed improved welfare during lockdown due to the possibility of increased human-pet interaction. The steps taken by owners to prepare animals for a return to normal life may enhance pet wellbeing long-term if maintained.","Esam, Fiona; Forrest, Rachel; Waran, Natalie",,666,16

AIM: To investigate patient preferences for treatment settings in the light of the current pandemic. METHODS: Patients, who prior to the pandemic had attended two different outpatient clinics in a university hospital for their infusions or injections, were interviewed by telephone. The semi-structured interviews were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Out of 49 patients with either anti-inflammatory or immunoglobulin treatments (response rate: 83 %), 24 (49.0 %) switched from subcutaneous (sc) injections in the hospital to the community setting, 18 (36.7 %) from intravenous infusions (iv) in the hospital to sc administration at home and 7 (14.3 %) moved to iv at home. During the pandemic 38 (80.9 %) wanted to continue their treatment at home, but after the pandemic 22 (46.8 %) would opt to go back to the hospital. Satisfaction was high with both settings, slightly favoring drug administration in hospital. Qualitative data shows that patients while emphasizing the importance of the relationship with the healthcare team, had increased concerns about safety as a result of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The experience during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased self-management-skills in some patients, but long-term follow-up is needed.

The aim of this multicenter phase II prospective study was to evaluate the role of MRD in identifying pts unlikely to be cured by IFRT, for whom an immunotherapy consolidation could improve outcome. Methods: 110 pts with stage I/II FL were enrolled and treated with 24 Gy IFRT. Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples were centralized to the FIL (Fondazione Italiani Linfomi) MRD Network of EuroMRD-certified laboratories. In BCL2/IGH+ pts at baseline by both nested PCR (NEST) and RQ-PCR (RQ) in BM a/o PB, MRD was analyzed after IFRT and every 6 months over a 3-year period. Pts with MRD+ by both NEST and RQ in BM a/o PB after IFRT or who became MRD+ during the follow-up were treated with 8 weekly doses of the anti-CD20 MoAb ofatumumab (OFA). The primary objective of the study was to define the efficacy of immunotherapy in obtaining a negative MRD. Results: Of the 106 evaluable pts, 50 were males. Median age was 55 y (29-83). The FLIPI score was 0 in 59% of pts, 1 in 35%, 2 in 6%. 68% of pts had inguinal site involvement. At baseline, 30% of pts had a BCL2/IGH rearrangement (30 MBR, 1 MBR and mcr, 1 mcr) in BM a/ o PB;the concordance between compartments was 90%. All but one pt achieved a clinical response after IFRT;one additional pt died soon after IFRT of unrelated causes. MRD evaluation after IFRT revealed the persistence of BCL2/IGH+ cells in PB a/o BM in 60% of pts. MRD + pts, either after IFRT (n = 18) or in case of conversion to MRD+ during the follow-up (n = 6), received OFA, obtaining a conversion to MRD-in 22/24 pts (91.7%-CI 73.0-99.0), significantly superior to the expected 50% (Fig). After a median F-U of 38 m, 17 pts who achieved a MRD-with OFA are still negative;5 converted to MRD+ (2 received OFA retreatment, achieving a second MRD-;2 pts were not re-treated due to Sars-Cov2 pandemic;1 relapsed). A clinical relapse or progression was observed in 23 pts: 18 (24.6%) among the 73 “no marker” pts and 5 (15.6%) among the 32 BCL2/IGH+ at baseline (p = 0.3), with no significant difference in PFS (p = 0.25). Two early relapses were observed among the 12 pts who became MRD-after IFRT and 3 among the 24 treated at least once with OFA (1 MRD+, 1 MRD-, 1 converted from MRD-to MRD+). Only 1 Pt relapsed while MRD-after OFA. Conclusions: MRD data indicate that RT alone is often insufficient to eradicate the disease, inducing a MRD-only in 40% of pts, notably long-lasting only in half of them. The primary objective of this study-MRD conversion after immunotherapy-was largely achieved. The strategy of an immunotherapy consolidation after IFRT in MRD+ pts allowed increasing molecular responses. However, this strategy is applicable only to 30% of enrolled pts. A clinical advantage of the MRD driven treatment strategy is suggested although not significan.","Pulsoni, A.; Tosti, M. E.; Ferrero, S.; Luminari, S.; Dondi, A.; Liberati, A.

COVID-19 caused significant impact on healthcare industry, depleting resources and manpower, which led to disruption to graduate medical education and residency training. Surgical residents were affected by the pandemic both by reduced operative opportunities in most training centers and inducing stress and concerns about safety and wellbeing among residents. Spread of the SARS-Cov-2 was naturally accompanied with a gradual decrease in numbers of healthcare personnel which consequently increased the burden on residents. During these times of crisis and uncertainty, it is crucial that residency programs find alternative learning opportunities and deploy pre-designed, dynamic operational strategies to ensure high quality surgical services while optimizing resident safety and wellbeing. The COVID-19 crisis was a natural call for the essential need to add another dimension to residency competencies, which is Crisis-based learning and practice. Times of public health crisis are opportunities to reflect on the medical practice from an interdisciplinary and interprofessional perspective and train the residents to function as part of a larger, globally responsible team. It also calls upon adopting innovative instructional and learning strategies such as utilizing digital and online learning tools to complement learning. A holistic approach to the crisis was taken by the surgical residency program at the University of Illinois in Chicago, which addressed the issue from a resident, hospital, and public health standpoints. An operational strategy was introduced to optimize resident safety, maximize learning opportunities, support other non-surgical services, and promote online teaching and learning. This strategy is meant to serve as a dynamic reference for surgical residency programs and as an infrastructure for dealing with this and any upcoming healthcare crises in an efficient and resident-centered way.","Obaid, Oday; Zimmermann, Jason; Ares, Guillermo",J. surg. educ,666,13

Because new SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging rapidly, as exemplified by the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, it is critical to understand whether antibody responses induced by infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or current vaccines remain effective. In this study, we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated spike pseudotypes based on divergence from SARS-CoV and then compare neutralization of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotype and individual mutations. Spike-specific monoclonal antibody neutralization is reduced dramatically; in contrast, polyclonal antibodies from individuals infected in early 2020 remain active against most mutated spike pseudotypes, but potency is reduced in a minority of samples. This work highlights that changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike can alter neutralization sensitivity and underlines the need for effective real-time monitoring of emerging mutations and their effect on vaccine efficacy.","Rees-Spear, Chloe; Muir, Luke; Griffith, Sarah A; Heaney, Judith; Aldon, Yoann; Snitselaar, Jonne L; Thomas, Peter; Graham, Carl; Seow, Jeffrey; Lee, Nayung; Rosa, Annachiara; Roustan, Chloe; Houlihan, Catherine F; Sanders, Rogier W; Gupta, Ravindra K; Cherepanov, Peter; Stauss, Hans J; Nastouli, Eleni; Doores, Katie J; van Gils, Marit J; McCoy, Laura E",Cell Rep,666,24

Its collaborative and reflexive process invites stakeholders (e.g. pharmacists and pharmacy support staff) to participate in analysing their everyday work practices as captured on video footage. Through close collaboration with practitioners and attention to their work contexts, VRE may be a useful methodology to engage a time-poor pharmacy workforce in research about themselves, encouraging more practitioner involvement in practice-based research. Aside from research, VRE has also been used effectively as an intervention to facilitate learning and change in healthcare settings, and could be effective in provoking change in otherwise resistant pharmacy environments. Much like traditional ethnographic approaches, VRE researchers have relied on being present 'in the field' to observe, record and make sense of practices with participants. The COVID-19 pandemic however, has introduced restrictions around travel and physical distancing, which has required researchers to contemplate the conduct of VRE 'at a distance', and to imagine new ways in which the methodological 'closeness' to stakeholders and their workplace contexts can be maintained when researchers cannot be on site. In this commentary, we outline the rationale for participatory methods, in the form of VRE, in pharmacy research. We describe the underlying principles of this innovative methodology, and offer examples of how VRE can be used in pharmacy research. Finally, we offer a reflexive account of how we have adapted the method for use in community pharmacy research, to adapt to physical distancing, without sacrificing its methodological principles. This paper offers not only a new methodology to examine the complexity of pharmacy work, but demonstrates also the responsiveness of VRE itself to complexity, and the potential breadth of future research applications in pharmacy both during and beyond the current pandemic.","Yong, Faith R; Hor, Su-Yin; Bajorek, Beata V",Res. soc. adm. pharm,666,15

First, DEA is applied to measure the efficiency of fifty U.S. states considering four inputs: number of tested, public funding, number of health care employees, number of hospital beds. Then, number of recovered from COVID-19 as a desirable output and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as a undesirable output are considered. In the second stage, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Boosted Tree (BT), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to predict the COVID-19 response performance based on fifteen environmental factors, which were classified into social distancing, health policy, and socioeconomic measures. The results showed that 23 states were efficient with an average efficiency score of 0.97. Furthermore, BT and RF models produced the best prediction results and CART performed better than LR. Lastly, urban, physical inactivity, number of tested per population, population density, and total hospital beds per population were the most influential factors on efficiency.","Xu, Yuan; Park, Yong Shin; Park, Ju Dong",,666,1

METHODS: Retrospective electronic health record review on patients seen in March 2020 for evaluation of potential COVID-19 symptoms, to assess the total number of interactions with physicians and office staff. RESULTS: Of 202 patients, 89 (44%) had initial telehealth, 55 (27%) telephone, and 52 (26%) in-person encounters. Patients initially evaluated through telehealth, telephone, and in-person encounters had a mean of 6.1 (S.D. = 3.7), 5.2 (S.D. = 3.6), and 4.5 (S.D. = 3.0) total interactions with the office, respectively (P = .03), and 9%, 12.7%, and 19.2%, respectively, had a subsequent in-person or emergency department visit (P = .22).

It has developed into a threatening international public health emergency. With the exception of China, the number of cases continues to increase worldwide. A number of studies about disease diagnosis and treatment have been carried out, and many clinically proven effective results have been achieved. Although information technology can improve the transferring of such knowledge to clinical practice rapidly, data interoperability is still a challenge due to the heterogeneous nature of hospital information systems. This issue becomes even more serious if the knowledge for diagnosis and treatment is updated rapidly as is the case for COVID-19. An open, semantic-sharing, and collaborative-information modeling framework is needed to rapidly develop a shared data model for exchanging data among systems. openEHR is such a framework and is supported by many open software packages that help to promote information sharing and interoperability. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a shared data model based on the openEHR modeling approach to improve the interoperability among systems for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: The latest Guideline of COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment in China was selected as the knowledge source for modeling. First, the guideline was analyzed and the data items used for diagnosis and treatment, and management were extracted. Second, the data items were classified and further organized into domain concepts with a mind map. Third, searching was executed in the international openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM) to find the existing archetypes that could represent the concepts. New archetypes were developed for those concepts that could not be found. Fourth, these archetypes were further organized into a template using Ocean Template Editor. Fifth, a test case of data exchanging between the clinical data repository and clinical decision support system based on the template was conducted to verify the feasibility of the study. RESULTS: A total of 203 data items were extracted from the guideline in China, and 16 domain concepts (16 leaf nodes in the mind map) were organized. There were 22 archetypes used to develop the template for all data items extracted from the guideline. All of them could be found in the CKM and reused directly. The archetypes and templates were reviewed and finally released in a public project within the CKM. The test case showed that the template can facilitate the data exchange and meet the requirements of decision support. CONCLUSIONS: This study has developed the openEHR template for COVID-19 based on the latest guideline from China using openEHR modeling methodology. It represented the capability of the methodology for rapidly modeling and sharing knowledge through reusing the existing archetypes, which is especially useful in a new and fast-changing area such as with COVID-19.","Li, Mengyang; Leslie, Heather; Qi, Bin; Nan, Shan; Feng, Hongshuo; Cai, Hailing; Lu, Xudong; Duan, Huilong",J Med Internet Res,666,25

Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. METHODS: The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11-85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. CONCLUSIONS: Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found. Presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined for an appropriate duration which, in our experience, is 2 months.","Yang, M-C; Hung, P-P; Wu, Y-K; Peng, M-Y; Chao, Y-C; Su, W-L",Public Health,666,1

However, NTBs predominantly exist at academic and/or specialized centers. In addition to increasing centralization throughout the healthcare system, changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have arguably resulted in advantages by conducting clinical meetings virtually. We therefore asked about the experience and acceptance of (virtualized) NTBs and their potential benefits. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via a web-based platform. Specialized neuro-oncological centers in Germany were identified based on the number of brain tumor cases treated in the respective institution per year. Only one representative per center was invited to participate in the survey. Questions targeted the structure/organization of NTBs as well as changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 65/97 institutions participated in the survey (response rate 67%). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, regular conventions of NTBs were maintained by the respective centers and multi-specialty participation remained high. NTBs were considered valuable by respondents in achieving the most optimal therapy for the affected patient and in maintaining/encouraging interdisciplinary debate/exchange. The settings of NTBs have been adapted during the pandemic with the increased use of virtual technology. Virtual NTBs were found to be beneficial, yet administrative support is lacking in some places. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual implementation of NTBs was feasible and accepted in the centers surveyed. Therefore, successful implementation offers new avenues and may be pursued for networking between centers, thereby increasing coverage of neuro-oncology care.

Antiviral innate immune responses can be triggered by multiple cellular receptors sensing viral components. The activated innate immune system produces interferons (IFNs) and cytokines that perform antiviral functions to eliminate invading viruses. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have a broad range of animal hosts. Coronaviruses have evolved multiple means to evade host antiviral immune responses. Successful immune evasion by coronaviruses may enable the viruses to adapt to multiple species of host organisms. Coronavirus transmission from zoonotic hosts to humans has caused serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), resulting in global health and economic crises. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying host sensing of and innate immune responses against coronavirus invasion, as well as host immune evasion strategies of coronaviruses.","Kasuga, Yusuke; Zhu, Baohui; Jang, Kyoung-Jin; Yoo, Ji-Seung",Exp Mol Med,666,3

In this study, we explored the impact of lactoferrin on three HAdV types that are being used as vectors for vaccines. Lactoferrin is a secreted globular glycoprotein that influences direct and indirect innate immune response against a range of pathogens following a breach in tissue homeostasis. The mechanism by which lactoferrin complexes increases HAdV uptake and induce maturation of human phagocytes is unknown. We show that lactoferrin redirects HAdV types from species B, C, and D to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) cell surface complexes. TLR4-mediated internalization of the HAdV-lactoferrin complex induced an NLRP3-associated response that consisted of cytokine release and transient disruption of plasma membrane integrity, without causing cell death. These data impact our understanding of HAdV immunogenicity and may provide ways to increase the efficacy of HAdV-based vectors/vaccines.","Chéneau, Coraline; Eichholz, Karsten; Tran, Tuan Hiep; Tran, Thi Thu Phuong; Paris, Océane; Henriquet, Corinne; Bajramovic, Jeffrey J.; Pugniere, Martine; Kremer, Eric J.",Front Immunol,666,23

They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), yield semi-quantitative results only. Reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), a technology that partitions each reaction into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets prior to amplification, offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. We evaluated eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for use in RT-ddPCR, and identified three (Charité-Berlin E-Sarbeco and Pasteur Institute IP2 and IP4) as the most efficient, precise and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. Analytical efficiency of the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set, for example, was ~83%, while assay precision, as measured by the coefficient of variation, was ~2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo. We further calibrated RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers against cycle threshold (Ct) values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform.

Despite the extensive efforts taken in the past decades, development of the “ideal” live attenuated FIPV vaccine was not successful yet. In the present study, we provide data of immunisation experiments with a recombinant FCoV pair differing only in the truncation (PBFIPV-DF-2) or completion (PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i) of their ORF3abc regions. In our previous in vivo studies, these viruses proved to show the characters of low virulent or avirulent FCoV phenotypes, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesised the ability of these viruses, as possible vaccine candidates, in conferring protection in specific pathogen free (SPF) Domestic Shorthair as well as in conventional purebred British Shorthair cats. In SPF cats, after two oronasal and two intramuscular vaccinations with two weeks intervals, both vaccine candidates provided 100% protection against lethal homologous challenge with the highly virulent FIPV DF-2 strain. In contrast, the conventional purebred British Shorthair cats did not develop protection when they were immunised with the same vaccination regimes. In these groups 100% of the PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i immunised animals developed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Prolonged survival was observed in 40% of the animals, while 60% showed fulminant disease course. Genetic and more probably immunological differences between the SPF and non-SPF purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment. Our data highlight the diverse immune responses between SPF and conventional cats and suggest a decisive role of previous infection by heterologous causative agents in the outcome of the vaccination against FIP.","Bálint, Ádám; Farsang, Attila; Szeredi, Levente; Zádori, Zoltán; Belák, Sándor",Vet Microbiol,666,20

Identification and development of drugs/vaccines is urgently needed for prevention and therapy of the COVID‐19 virus (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease (M(pro),) plays a key role in viral protein processing for its replication and inhibition of M(pro) leads to prevention of viral replication. The SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro is considered a promising drug target, as it is dissimilar to human proteases. Several peptidic protease inhibitors have been developed as SARS‐CoV‐2 M(pro) inhibitors for COVID‐19 treatment. In this study, we screened naturally occurring peptidic α‐hydroxy amides (PHAs) (phebestin, probestin, bestatin) for SARS‐CoV‐2 M(pro) inhibition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : In vitro COVID‐19 M(pro) fluorometric assay was performed to evaluate its inhibitory efficacy by PHAs. Isothermal titration calorimetry technique was used to demonstrate the binding affinity between COVID‐19 M(pro) and PHAs. Circular dichroism technique was used to determine the structural changes in secondary structure of COVID‐19 M(pro) induced by PHAs. Molecular docking studies were performed to demonstrate the molecular level mechanism behind COVID‐19 M(pro) inhibitory efficacy of PHAs. In addition, cytotoxic effects of PHAs were evaluated on lung epithelial cells of mice for its therapeutic applications for COVID‐19 through nasal delivery. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: : Phebestin (IC(50) = 17.98 µM) Probestin (IC(50) = 48.31 µM) and Bestatin (IC(50) > 100 µM) significantly inhibited the COVID‐19 M(pro) activity. The KD (dissociation constant) values of phebestin and probestin for COVID‐19 M(pro) were 31.23 and 43.51 µM, respectively. CD spectrum analysis demonstrated that phebestin and probestin (10 µM) induced changes in the secondary structure of COVID‐19 M(pro). Molecular docking studies demonstrated that Interactions of phebestin and probestin with active site amino acids. Phebestin and probestin did not show any cytotoxicity on normal mouse lung epithelial cells up to 100 µM. CONCLUSION: : Preliminary in vitro studies demonstrated that naturally occurring PHAs derivatives phebestin and probestin are SARS‐CoV‐2 M(pro) inhibitors and warranted further studies to develop as drugs for COVID‐19.","Yarla, Nagendra; Pathuri, Gopal; Gali, Hariprasad; Terzyan, Simon; Singh, Anil; Scotti, Marcus; Madka, Venkateshwar; Rao, Chinthalapally",FASEB J,666,20

Investigations characterizing the poultry enteric virome have identified novel poultry viruses, but the roles these viruses play in disease and performance problems have yet to be fully characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the poultry gut influences gut development, immune status, and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic investigation was undertaken to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the pre-contact intestinal microbiome with the altered microbiome following contact with poultry raised in the field. Analysis of the intestinal virome from contact birds (“sentinels”) placed on farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae that were not present in pre-contact birds or present in proportionally lower numbers. Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community in the post-contact birds, notably by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae and Astroviridae have been well-characterized and have historically been implicated in poultry enteric disease; members of the Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have only relatively recently been described in the poultry and avian gut, and their roles in the recognized disease syndromes and in poultry performance in general have not been determined. This metagenomic analysis has provided insight into the colonization of the poultry gut by enteric microbes circulating in commercial broiler flocks, and has identified enteric viruses and virus communities that warrant further study in order to understand their role(s) in avian gut health and disease.","Day, J.

METHOD: All patients receiving maintenance dialysis who received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines with antibody test results drawn ≥14 days after the second dose, as documented in the electronic health record through March 18, 2021, were included. Response was based on levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike-antigen (seropositive ≥2 U/L) using an FDA-approved semi-quantitative chemiluminescent assay (ADVIA Centaur® XP/XPT COV2G). RESULTS: Among 186 dialysis patients from 30 clinics in 8 states tested 23±8 days after receiving 2 vaccine doses, there were 165 (88.7%) responders with 70% at maximum titer. There was no significant difference between BNT162b2/Pfizer (148/168, 88.1%) and mRNA-1273/Moderna (17/18, 94.4%), p=0.42. All 38 patients with COVID-19 history were responders, with 97% at maximum titer. Among patients without COVID-19, 127/148 (85.8%) were responders, comparable between BNT162b2/Pfizer (113/133) and mRNA-1273/Moderna (14/15) vaccines (85.0% vs. 93.3%, p=0.38). CONCLUSION: Most patients receiving maintenance dialysis responded after two doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine, suggesting that the short-term development of anti-spike antibody is good, giving hope that most of these vulnerable patients, once immunized, will be protected from COVID-19. Longer-term evaluation is needed to determine antibody titer durability and if booster dose(s) are warranted. Further research to evaluate the approach to patients without a serologic response is needed, including benefits of additional dose(s) or administration of alternate options.","Lacson, Eduardo; Argyropoulos, Christos; Manley, Harold; Aweh, Gideon; Chin, Andrew; Salman, Loay; Hsu, Caroline; Johnson, Doug; Weiner, Daniel",J.

Patients were included following an in-hospital admission with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We analysed the outcomes of patients with a current or prior history of smoking compared with the non-smoking group. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital death. RESULTS: Finally, 5224 patients with COVID-19 with available smoking status were analysed. A total of 3983 (67.9%) patients were non-smokers, 934 (15.9%) were former smokers and 307 (5.2%) were active smokers. The median age was 66 years (IQR 52.0–77.0) and 58.6% were male.

This prospective longitudinal study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents’ mental health and substance use, and by assessing specific positive coping strategies among adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using multi-group autoregressive cross-lagged path models, the present study explored the reciprocal influence of positive coping behaviors on multiple adjustment outcomes including mental health symptoms, substance use, stress, and worry. Participants included 238 adolescents (132 male participants; ages 15–17; 118 with ADHD). Parents provided ratings of adolescent routines, and adolescents provided ratings of coping behaviors and psychological adjustment in spring (May/June), summer (July/August), and fall (October/November) 2020. All models included the effects of adjustment at the prior timepoint as well as relevant covariates including adolescent race, ethnicity, sex, medication status, and family income. Adolescents with ADHD were at greater risk for experiencing increases in mental health symptoms and substance use throughout the pandemic, relative to adolescents without ADHD. The use of positive coping strategies and adolescent routines buffered against increases in substance use and mental health problems for adolescents with ADHD.

However, very few studies have systematically compared HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence among MSM according to key venue type for sourcing sex partners. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between HIV/syphilis prevalence and the types of venues, namely saunas, parks, gay bars, and the Internet, which are mostly used for sourcing male sex partners by MSM in China. METHODS: Meta‐analyses using fixed‐effect and random‐effect methods were conducted. Secondary data were obtained from 10 concurrent surveys conducted in 10 cities basing on a common protocol. Pairwise comparisons (e.g., “saunas” vs. “parks”) were made. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Odds ratios (OR) for HIV/syphilis infection in relations to venue type for partner sourcing. RESULTS: The distribution of the most commonly used source to recruit male sex partner was 59.32% (Internet), 18.47% (gay bars), 14.18% (gay saunas), and 8.02% (parks). The median prevalence of HIV/syphilis was 10.49% and 19.38% (gay saunas), 2.12% and 16.25% (parks), 6.06% and 15.45% (Internet), and 4.41% and 11.90% (gay bars). We found significant between‐group differences when comparing “sauna” against “Internet” (HIV: OR = 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.65–3.12; syphilis: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.07–2.41), “sauna” against “bars” (HIV: OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.14–2.39; syphilis: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02–1.78), and “parks” against “Internet” (syphilis: OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.12–2.15) as the main source to recruit male sex partners. Other pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that those sourcing partners mainly from gay saunas have higher prevalence of HIV/syphilis when compared with those doing so via the Internet or gay bars. Venue based (sauna‐based) interventions using socio‐ecological approaches are greatly warranted in order to reduce HIV and syphilis prevalence among MSM in China.

Currently, very little is known about how long this coronavirus can survive in deceased human bodies or whether un-embalmed human cadavers can be contagious to people who handle them. Therefore, it would appear to be prudent to consider implementation of additional safety measures for all necessary post-mortem procedures. During the post-mortem examination of babies and young children, it is important to open the calvarium to enable visualization of the brain and its coverings, particularly in cases where a head injury is likely to have occurred. Since October 2013, the use of neurosurgical equipment to open the calvarium during infant and young child autopsies has become routine practice in our unit. Both the neurosurgical craniotome and a standard oscillating mortuary saw produce particulate matter consisting of bone and body fluids (including blood) which can become aerosolized. Within this paper, we discuss the use of a transparent plastic tent whilst opening the calvarium during pediatric post-mortems, to reduce the spread of aerosols into the mortuary environment.","Cheshire, Emma C.; Malcomson, Roger D.

A response model was developed from previous results and tested in groups of rats exposed to electric fields at various field strengths. Female rats were mated, and sperm-positive animals randomly distributed among four groups: sham-exposed or exposed to 10, 65, or 130 kV/m, 60-Hz vertical electric fields. Animals were exposed for 19 hr/day throughout the experiment. During gestation, exposure to the higher field strengths resulted in slightly depressed weight gains of dams. Offspring were born in the field and remained with their dams through the suckling period. Numbers of pups per litter and pup mortality did not differ among the exposure groups. Dams exposed at 65 kV/m lost slightly more weight through the lactation period than the control group. Male pups exposed to higher field strengths gained slightly less weight from 4 to 21 days of age than did sham-exposed animals. At weaning, two F1 females per litter (randomly selected) continued on the same exposure regimen were mated at 11 weeks of age to unexposed males, and euthanized at 20 days of gestation. Uterine contents were evaluated, and all liver fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Fertility and gestational weight gain of F1 females were not affected by exposure, nor was prenatal viability or fetal body weight. No significant increase in the incidence of litters with malformations was observed. Although no developmental toxicity was detected, exposures produced physical changes in the dams, evidenced as a rust-colored deposit on the muzzle and ears (chromodacryorrhea) that increased in incidence and severity at 65 and 130 kV/m. Incidence of chromodacryorrhea was not significantly different between sham-exposed rats and those exposed at 10 kV/m.","Rommereim, D. N.; Rommereim, R. L.; Sikov, M. R.; Buschbom, R.

Nonetheless, patients may have been billed if their plans did not implement waivers or if waivers did not capture all hospitalization-related care, including clinician services. Assessing out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in 2020 could demonstrate the financial burden patients may face if insurers allow waivers to expire, as many chose to do during early 2021. OBJECTIVE: To estimate out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in 2020 DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis SETTING: IQVIA PharMetrics Plus for Academics Database, a national claims database PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 hospitalizations for privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients during March-September 2020 MAIN OUTCOMES/MEASURES: Mean total out-of-pocket spending, defined as the sum of out-of-pocket spending for facility services billed by hospitals (e.g., accommodation charges) and for professional/ancillary services billed by clinicians and ancillary providers (e.g., clinician inpatient evaluation and management, ambulance transport) RESULTS: Analyses included 4,075 hospitalizations. Of the 1,377 hospitalizations for privately insured patients and the 2,698 hospitalizations for Medicare Advantage patients, 981 (71.2%) and 1,324 (49.1%) had out-of-pocket spending for facility services, professional/ancillary services, or both. Among these hospitalizations, mean (SD) total out-of-pocket spending was $788 (1,411) and $277 (363). In contrast, 63 (4.6%) and 36 (1.3%) hospitalizations had out-of-pocket spending for facility services. Among these hospitalizations, mean total out-of-pocket spending was $3,840 (3,186) and $1,536 (1,402). Total out-of-pocket spending exceeded $4,000 for 2.5% of privately insured hospitalizations, compared with 0.2% of Medicare Advantage hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Few COVID-19 hospitalizations in this study had out-of-pocket spending for facility services, suggesting most were covered by insurers with cost-sharing waivers. However, many hospitalizations had out-of-pocket spending for professional/ancillary services. Overall, 7 in 10 privately insured hospitalizations and half of Medicare Advantage hospitalizations had any out-of-pocket spending. Findings suggest insurer cost-sharing waivers may not cover all hospitalization-related care. Moreover, high cost-sharing for some hospitalizations suggests out-of-pocket burden could be substantial if waivers expire, particularly for privately insured patients. Rather than rely on voluntary insurer actions to mitigate this burden, federal policymakers should consider mandating insurers to waive cost-sharing for all COVID-19 hospitalization-related care throughout the pandemic.","Chua, K.-P.; Conti, R.

The occurrence of a cytokine storm in the lungs is a critical step in the disease pathogenesis, as it causes pathological lesions, pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, potentially resulting in death. Currently, there is no effective treatment that targets the cytokine storm and helps regenerate the damaged tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to act as anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory candidates and activate endogenous regeneration. As a result, MSC therapy is a potential treatment approach for COVID-19. Intravenous injection of clinical-grade MSCs into COVID-19 patients can induce an immunomodulatory response along with improved lung function. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are considered a potential source of MSCs for immunomodulation, tissue regeneration, and clinical application. Although some current clinical trials have treated COVID-19 patients with DPSCs, this therapy has not been approved.

METHODS: The Delphi technique was used to develop an instrument to assess social contacts, which was then applied in a cross-sectional pilot study. A panel of 15 medical professionals reviewed the feasibility and validity of each item. The minimum content validity ratio was 0.49. Thirty participants used the developed measure to record contacts during a 24-hour period. RESULTS: After a systematic review, the survey instrument (parts I and II) was developed. Part I assessed social contact patterns over a 24-hour period, and part II assessed perceptions of contacts in daily life and preventive behaviors (hand hygiene and coughing etiquette). High validity and feasibility were found. In the pilot study, the 30 participants had a combined total of 198 contacts (mean, 6.6 daily contacts per person). The participants’ age (p=0.012), occupation (p<0.001), household size (p<0.001), education (p<0.001), personal income (p=0.003), and household income (p<0.001) were significantly associated with the number of contacts.

From 2014, outbreaks were also reported from Central Europe. To characterize the Central European PEDV strains regarding their virulence in suckling piglets, and to assess the protective effect of maternally derived antibodies (MDA), four trial groups were randomly assigned, each consisting of two pregnant sows and their litter. To induce MDA in a subset of piglets, two sows received a cell culture-adapted PEDV strain, and another two sows were inoculated with field material from German PED outbreaks. Four sows stayed naïve. Subsequently, all piglets were inoculated with the corresponding PEDV strains at an age of 3 to 6 days, and virus shedding, clinical signs and occurrence of specific antibodies were assessed. Piglets without MDA showed a morbidity of 100% and low lethality, while almost all MDA-positive piglets stayed clinically healthy and showed considerably lower virus shedding. Taken together, the Central European PEDV strains showed rather low virulence under experimental conditions, and pre-inoculation of sows led to a solid protection of their offspring. The latter is the prerequisite for a sow vaccination concept that could help to prevent PED induced losses in the piglet sector.","Leidenberger, S.; Schröder, Ch.; Zani, L.; Auste, A.; Pinette, M.; Ambagala, A.; Nikolin, V.; de Smit, H.; Beer, M.; Blome, S.",Sci Rep,666,28

If strip readers were incorporated, their use could be extended to quantitative analysis. However, their cost and non-portability render commercial strip readers unavailable for use in either home testing, community or rural hospital diagnosis. This is particularly true for on-site testing. Here, a smartphone-based reader was designed and 3D-printed for quantitatively assess AuNPs-LFIS. The basic principle of the devise was relying on a smartphone’s ambient light sensor (SPALS). This sensor was harnessed to measure the transmitted light intensities originating from the T-lines on the strips, the transmitted light intensities vary with concentration of AuNP on the T-lines. To validate this approach, our newly developed smartphone’s ambient light sensor-based reader (SPALS-reader) was used to readout AuNPs-LFIS of three analytical targets: cadmium ion (Cd(2+); limit of detection (LOD) was 0.16 ng/mL), clenbuterol (CL; LOD was 0.046 ng/mL), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV; LOD was 0.055 μg/mL). The result showed good consistency with the results of conventional image analysis approaches, indicating that the smartphone-based device is appropriate for use in AuNPs-LFIS readouts. Compared with the traditional analysis method, the developed AuNPs-LFIS reader is easier operated, lower cost and more portable, which provided an on-site quantitative analysis tool for AuNPs-LFIS and enhances the applied range of AuNPs-LFIS.","Xiao, Wei; Huang, Caihong; Xu, Fei; Yan, Junjie; Bian, Hongfen; Fu, Qiangqiang; Xie, Kaixin; Wang, Lei; Tang, Yong",Sens Actuators B Chem,666,1

The Nepalese government announced a nationwide lockdown beginning on March 24, 2020 as an attempt to restrain the spread of COVID-19. The prohibition in flight operations and movement of vehicles, factory shutdowns and restriction in people's movement due to the lockdown led to a significant reduction in the amounts of pollutants degrading air quality in many countries. OBJECTIVES. The present study aimed to analyze changes in particulate matter (PM) emissions and the air quality index (AQI) of six cities in Nepal i.e., Damak, Simara, Kathmandu, Pokhara, Nepalgunj and Surkhet due to the nationwide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS. Daily PM concentrations of each of the six study cities from January 24 to September 21, 2020 were obtained from the World Air Quality Index project (https://aqicn.org) and analyzed using R Studio software. The drop percentage was calculated to determine the change in PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentration during different time periods. Independent sample Mann–Whitney U tests were performed to test the significance of differences in mean concentration for each site during the lockdown period (24 March–24 July 2020) and its corresponding period in 2019. Similarly, the significance of differences in mean concentrations between the lockdown period and the period immediately before lockdown (23 January–23 March) was also examined using the same test. RESULTS. During the lockdown period, in overall Nepal, AQI(PM2.5) and AQI(PM10) were within the moderate zone for the maximum number of days. As a result of the lockdown, the highest immediate and final drop of PM(2.5) was observed in Damak (26.37%) and Nepalgunj (80.86%), respectively. Similarly, the highest immediate drop of PM(10) was observed in Surkhet (37.22%) and finally in Nepalgunj (81.14%). Analysis with the Mann–Whitney U test indicated that for both PM types, all sites showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference in mean concentrations during lockdown and the corresponding period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS. The present study explored the positive association between vehicular movement and PM emissions, highlighting the need for alternative fuel sources to improve air quality and human health.

A vaccine that induces broad immunity to prevent K88 and F18 fimbrial ETEC bacterial attachment and colonization in pig small intestines and to neutralize enterotoxin enterotoxicity would be effective for PWD. Structure-based multiepitope-fusion-antigen (MEFA) technology using a backbone immunogen to present neutralizing epitopes of representing virulence factors capacitates development of broadly protective ETEC vaccines. Neutralizing epitopes have been identified from K88 fimbrial adhesin (FaeG) and enterotoxins but not F18 fimbrial adhesin. In this study, we in silico identified immunodominant epitopes from F18ac fimbrial subunit FedF which plays a critical role in F18 fimbrial adherence, genetically fused each epitope to a carrier, examined immunogenicity of each epitope fusion, and determined epitope-derived antibodies neutralizing activities against F18 fimbrial adherence. Data showed that seven immune-dominant epitopes were identified from FedF subunit. Fused to heterologous human ETEC adhesin subunit CfaB, epitope fusions induced anti-F18 antibodies in subcutaneously immunized mice. Moreover, antibodies derived from each fusion significantly blocked adherence of a F18-fimbrial E. coli bacteria to pig intestinal cell line IPEC-J2. While all seven epitopes exhibited neutralizing activity, results from this study identified FedF epitopes #3 (IPSSSGTLTCQAGT) and #7 (QPDATGSWYD) the most effective for antibodies against F18 fimbrial adherence, and suggested their future application in PWD vaccine development.","Lu, Ti; Seo, Hyesuk; Moxley, Rodney A.; Zhang, Weiping",Veterinary Microbiology,666,5

In this study we characterized the inhibition of PRRS virus (PRRSV) replication by antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). Of 12 peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO), four were found to be highly effective at inhibiting PRRSV replication in cell culture in a dose-dependant and sequence-specific manner. PPMO 5UP2 and 5HP are complementary to sequence in the 5′ end of the PRRSV genome, and 6P1 and 7P1 to sequence in the translation initiation regions of ORF6 and ORF7, respectively. Treatment of cells with 5UP2 or 5HP caused a 4.5 log(10) reduction in PRRSV yield, compared to a control PPMO. Combination of 6P1 and 7P1 led to higher level reduction than 6P1 or 7P1 alone. 5UP2, 5HP, and a combination of 6P1 and 7P1 inhibited PRRSV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages and protected the cells from PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect. Northern blot and real-time RT-PCR results demonstrated that the effective PPMO led to a reduction of PRRSV RNA level. 5UP2 and 5HP inhibited virus replication of 10 other strains of PRRSV. Results from this study suggest potential applications of PPMO for PRRS control.","Patel, Deendayal; Opriessnig, Tanja; Stein, David A.; Halbur, Patrick G.; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Iversen, Patrick L.; Zhang, Yan-Jin",Antiviral Res,666,10

Its impact on hospitalised patients is less well documented. METHODS: We collected viral sequences and clinical data of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 and hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs), sampled 16 November 2020 to 10 January 2021, from eight hospitals participating in the COG-UK-HOCI study. Associations between the variant and the outcomes of all-cause mortality and intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission were evaluated using mixed effects Cox models adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities, care home residence, pregnancy and ethnicity. FINDINGS: Sequences were obtained from 2341 inpatients (HOCI cases=786) and analysis of clinical outcomes was carried out in 2147 inpatients with all data available. The HR for mortality of B.1.1.7 compared with other lineages was 1.01 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.28, p=0.94) and for ITU admission was 1.01 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.37, p=0.96). Analysis of sex-specific effects of B.1.1.7 identified increased risk of mortality (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.78, p=0.096) and ITU admission (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.90, p=0.011) in females infected with the variant but not males (mortality HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.10, p=0.177; ITU HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, p=0.086). INTERPRETATION: In common with smaller studies of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2, we did not find an overall increase in mortality or ITU admission associated with B.1.1.7 compared with other lineages. However, women with B.1.1.7 may be at an increased risk of admission to intensive care and at modestly increased risk of mortality.","Stirrup, Oliver; Boshier, Florencia; Venturini, Cristina; Guerra-Assunção, José Afonso; Alcolea-Medina, Adela; Beckett, Angela; Charalampous, Themoula; da Silva Filipe, Ana; Glaysher, Sharon; Khan, Tabassum; Kulasegaran Shylini, Raghavendran; Kele, Beatrix; Monahan, Irene; Mollett, Guy; Parker, Matthew; Pelosi, Emanuela; Randell, Paul; Roy, Sunando; Taylor, Joshua; Weller, Sophie; Wilson-Davies, Eleri; Wade, Phillip; Williams, Rachel; Copas, Andrew; Cutino-Moguel, Maria-Teresa; Freemantle, Nick; Hayward, Andrew C; Holmes, Alison; Hughes, Joseph; Mahungu, Tabitha; Nebbia, Gaia; Partridge, David; Pope, Cassie; Price, James; Robson, Samuel; Saeed, Kordo; de Silva, Thushan; Snell, Luke; Thomson, Emma; Witney, Adam A; Breuer, Judith",BMJ Open Respir Res,666,1

Football leagues were suddenly stopped, and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019–2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.

Nos objectifs étaient : – d’étudier la mortalité associée à un traitement chronique par ISRA chez des patients hospitalisés pour une infection par le SARS-CoV-2 en France ; – les raisons expliquant les résultats discordants dans la littérature. Méthodes Nous avons sélectionné les sujets hypertendus inclus dans l’étude nationale prospective de 3512 patients hospitalisés avec COVID-19 (cohorte French-COVID) jusqu’au 30 juin 2020. L’exposition était définie par la prescription d’inhibiteurs de l’enzyme de conversion ou antagonistes des récepteurs de l’angiotensine II avant hospitalisation. Des modèles de Cox avec pondérations basées sur le score de propension ont permis d’estimer des hazard ratios (HR) de mortalité à 30 jours du diagnostic de COVID-19 chez les sujets exposés aux ISRA par rapport aux non exposés. Notre revue de la littérature s’est intéressée aux méthodes (plan expérimental, population, exposition, critères de jugement, méthodes statistiques) et aux résultats des études observationnelles publiées étudiant le rôle pronostique des ISRA dans la COVID-19. Résultats Nous avons analysé 1160 patients hypertendus ; 719 (62 %) hommes, 777 (67 %) âgés de plus de 65 ans. Les principales comorbidités étaient le diabète (n =416, 36 %), les maladies cardiaques (n =401, 35 %) et l’obésité (n =340, 29 %) ; 705 (61 %) patients étaient sous oxygène dans les deux jours suivant l’admission. Nous avons enregistré 135 (11,6 %) décès dans les 30jours. Aucune association entre l’exposition chronique aux ISRA et la mortalité (HR non ajusté=1,13, IC95 % [0,8–1,6] ; HR pondéré sur l’IPT=1,09 [0,86–1,39] ; HR pondéré sur le SMR=1,08 [0,79–1,47]) n’a été mise en évidence. Notre revue de littérature a retrouvé 51 études individuelles : 31 chez des patients hypertendus, et 39 chez des patients hospitalisés. Parmi ces dernières, 25/39 ont étudié l’effet du traitement chronique par ISRA avant l’hospitalisation, 11/39 ont étudié l’effet de l’exposition aux ISRA pendant le séjour, et pour 4/39 la temporalité de l’exposition était indéfinie. Un risque augmenté de mortalité associé à l’exposition aux ISRA était fréquemment rapporté dans les études menées dans des populations peu sélectionnées (non restreintes aux hypertendus) ou avec un ajustement inapproprié, généralement expliqué par un biais d’indication. A contrario, une diminution significative de la mortalité associée à l’exposition aux ISRA était le plus souvent rapportée dans des études où l’exposition était définie par le traitement ISRA au cours de l’hospitalisation, expliquée par un biais de causalité inverse et un biais d’immortalité. Conclusion Nos résultats ne montrent pas d’association significative entre la prise chronique d’ISRA et la mortalité chez des patients hypertendus hospitalisés pour COVID-19, en accord avec les recommandations des sociétés savantes qui recommandent la poursuite de ces traitements malgré la pandémie. La question d’introduire ces traitements en cours d’hospitalisation est en cours d’évaluation dans des essais randomisés.","Gault, N.; Esposito-Farese, M.; Revest, M.; Inamo, J.; Elisabeth, P.; Patrick, R.; Costagliola, D.; Vidal-Petiot, E.",Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,666,18

The effects of processing conditions such as: (1) binder saturation rates (55%, 100% and 150%), and (2) isothermal sintering temperatures (1000 °C to 1200 °C) on the porosity of 316L stainless steel parts were studied. By varying the processing conditions, porosity of 40% to 45% were achieved. To further increase the porosity values of 316L stainless steel parts, 30 vol. % (or 6 wt. %) of PMMA space holder particles were added to the 3D printing feedstock and porosity values of 57% to 61% were achieved. Mercury porosimetry results indicated pore sizes less than 40 µm for all the binder jetting processed 316L stainless steel parts. Anisotropy in linear shrinkage after the sintering process was observed for the SS316L parts with the largest linear shrinkage in the Z direction. The Young’s modulus and compression properties of 316L stainless steel parts decreased with increasing porosity and low Young’s modulus values in the range of 2 GPa to 29 GPa were able to be achieved.

This study surveyed student perspectives and academic performance in a pre-planned online second-year veterinary toxicology course given at North Carolina State University in Spring 2020. This course relied on asynchronous narrated presentations for content delivery. This method of delivery predated the pandemic and was used throughout the course. Academic performance and patterns of access to materials in the online course was compared with the access patterns and performance of students given classroom-based synchronous teaching in Spring 2019. Assessments evaluated in this study were identical across courses. Students’ academic performance was unaffected by delivery method. Lack of instructor interaction was an important perceived barrier in the asynchronous course. Asynchronous course materials were uniformly accessed across all days of the week, while supplemental materials for the face-to-face course showed a weekly pattern. Moving from letter grades to pass/fail did not change access frequency to supplemental course materials but led to decreased video usage in the asynchronous course.

Various methods for analyzing infectious disease occurrences have been proposed for effective prevention and proactive response to reduce such losses and costs. However, the results of the occurrence analyses were limited because numerous factors affect the outbreak of infectious diseases and there are complex interactions between these factors. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a cluster-based analysis scheme of infectious disease occurrences that can discover commonalities or differences between clusters by grouping elements with similar occurrence patterns. To do this, we collect and preprocess infectious disease occurrence data according to time, region, and disease. Then, we construct a tensor for the data and apply Tucker decomposition to extract latent features in the dimensions of time, region, and disease. Based on these latent features, we conduct k-means clustering and analyze the results for each dimension.

The purpose of this project was to investigate attitudes and anxiety among Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) residents during the early COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. OMS residents were invited electronically to answer a survey. The survey was sent in April and May 2020. Residents enrolled in OMS residency programs accredited by the Commission of Dental Accreditation (CODA) were included. Predictor variable was attitudes of OMS residents toward pandemic. The outcome variable was anxiety levels of OMS residents due to pandemic according to Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A (HADS-A). Other variables were: demographics, general knowledge regarding pandemic, and attitudes of OMS residents toward pandemic. Statistical analysis consisted of Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and univariate and multivariable logistic regression (P < 0.05 significance). RESULTS: We received 275 responses. Majority were males (74.5%) in 26-30 age group (52.7%). Residents reported different levels of anxiety (i.e. mild 58.2%, severe 41.8%). Based on multivariable analysis, moderate or severe anxiety was associated with being a female (p= 0.048) and a senior resident (p=0.049). Factors such as potential deployment to other services, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), and unclear disease status of patients contributed to anxiety. CONCLUSION: Our study found that during early COVID-19 pandemic, all residents experienced some anxiety. Senior OMS residents, and female OMS residents experience higher anxiety levels than other residents.","Amin, Dina; Austin, Thomas M.; Roser, Steven M.; Abramowicz, Shelly",Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol,666,14

We aimed to study the prehospital management of patients in acute respiratory distress with an indication for NIV and whether they received it or not. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients ≥18 years old who were cared for acute respiratory distress in a prehospital setting. Indications for NIV were oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) <90% and/or respiratory rate (RR) >25/min with a presumptive diagnosis of APE or COPD exacerbation. Study population characteristics, initial and at hospital vital signs, presumptive and definitive diagnosis were analyzed. For patients who received NIV, dyspnea level was evaluated with a dyspnea verbal ordinal scale (D-VOS, 0-10) and arterial blood gas (ABG) values were obtained at hospital arrival. RESULTS: Among the 187 consecutive patients included in the study, most (n = 105, 56%) had experienced APE or COPD exacerbation, and 56 (30%) received NIV. In comparison with patients without NIV, those treated with NIV had a higher initial RR (35 ± 8/min vs 29 ± 10/min, p < 0.0001) and a lower SpO(2) (79 ± 10 vs 88 ± 11, p < 0.0001). The level of dyspnea was significantly reduced for patients treated with NIV (on-scene D-VOS 8.4 ± 1.7 vs 4.4 ± 1.8 at admission, p < 0.0001). Among the 131 patients not treated with NIV, 41 (31%) had an indication. In the latter group, initial SpO(2) was 80 ± 10% in the NIV group versus 86 ± 11% in the non-NIV group (p = 0.0006). NIV was interrupted in 9 (16%) patients due to either discomfort (n = 5), technical problem (n = 2), persistent desaturation (n = 1), or vomiting (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the prehospital management of patients who present with acute respiratory distress and an indication for NIV. NIV was started on clinically more severe patients, even if predefined criteria to start NIV were present. NIV allows to improve vital signs and D-VOS in those patients. A prospective study could further elucidate why patients with a suspected diagnosis of APE and COPD are not treated with NIV, as well as the clinical impact of the different strategies.

It is necessary to examine the viral proteins that play a notorious role in the invasion of our body. The main protease (3CLpro) facilitates the maturation of the coronavirus. It is thought that the dimerization of 3CLpro leads to its catalytic activity; the detailed mechanism has, however, not been suggested. Furthermore, the structural differences between the predecessor SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have not been fully understood. Here, we show the structural and dynamical differences between the two main proteases, and demonstrate the relationship between the dimerization and the activity via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Simulating monomeric and dimeric 3CLpro systems for each protease, we show that (i) global dynamics between the two different proteases are not conserved, (ii) the dimerization stabilizes the catalytic dyad and hydration water molecules behind the dyad, and (iii) the substrate-binding site (active site) and hydration water molecules in each protomer fluctuate asymmetrically. We then speculate the roles of hydration water molecules in their catalytic activity.","Iida, Shinji; Fukunishi, Yoshifumi",BBA advances,666,0

Emerging data from China and Europe have consistently shown an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aimed to identify the VTE incidence and early predictors of VTE at our high-volume tertiary care center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 147 patients who had been admitted to Temple University Hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from April 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020. We first identified the VTE (pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) incidence in our cohort. The VTE and no-VTE groups were compared by univariable analysis for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes. Subsequently, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the early predictors of VTE. RESULTS: The 147 patients (20.9% of all admissions) admitted to a designated COVID-19 unit at Temple University Hospital with a high clinical suspicion of acute VTE had undergone testing for VTE using computed tomography pulmonary angiography and/or extremity venous duplex ultrasonography. The overall incidence of VTE was 17% (25 of 147). Of the 25 patients, 16 had had acute PE, 14 had had acute DVT, and 5 had had both PE and DVT. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-9.55) and the admission D-dimer level ≥1500 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-9.78) were independent markers associated with VTE. The all-cause mortality in the VTE group was greater than that in the non-VTE group (48% vs 22%; P = .007). CONCLUSION: Our study represents one of the earliest reported from the United States on the incidence rate of VTE in patients with COVID-19. Patients with a high clinical suspicion and the identified risk factors (invasive mechanical ventilation, admission D-dimer level ≥1500 ng/mL) should be considered for early VTE testing. We did not screen all patients admitted for VTE; therefore, the true incidence of VTE could have been underestimated. Our findings require confirmation in future prospective studies.","Rali, Parth; O'Corragain, Oisin; Oresanya, Lawrence; Yu, Daohai; Sheriff, Omar; Weiss, Robert; Myers, Catherine; Desai, Parag; Ali, Nadia; Stack, Anthony; Bromberg, Michael; Lubitz, Andrea L.; Panaro, Joseph; Bashir, Riyaz; Lakhter, Vladimir; Caricchio, Roberto; Gupta, Rohit; Dass, Chandra; Maruti, Kumaran; Lu, Xiaoning; Rao, A.

Our previous study has found that ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly immunogenic and shows high sensitivity in identifying COVID-19 disease. In this study, by employing overlapping linear peptides, we characterized the IgG immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein that are seropositive in the sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The major immunogenic epitopes are localized at (1) N-termini alpha helix, (2) the resides spanning beta 2 and 3 sheets, and (3) the loop between beta 4 and 5 sheets. Additionally, hamster model infected by SARS-CoV-2 further validates the seropositivity of the linear epitopes in vivo, demonstrating a potential application of the linear peptide-based immunization strategy. Taken together, identification and validation of these B-cell linear epitopes will provide insights into the design of serological diagnostics and peptide-based vaccination approach against this pandemic virus of high priority.","Wang, Xiaohui; Lam, Joy-Yan; Chen, Linlei; Au, Shannon Wing-Ngor; To, Kelvin K.

However, the extent to which assay signals relate to exhaled virus is unknown. We investigated the use of novel, non-invasive face-mask sampling (FMS) to detect exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two studies. Methods In an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations. Findings In cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10/40 (25%) samples (4/6 individuals), with no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards disease severity. In cohort 2, 19/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs negative: 61 [45-73], p=0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2], p<0.001) and have active cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p=0.003) and breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p=0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS negative patients. Of five patients who were FMS positive and asymptomatic at time of sampling, two died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia within one month of follow up.

We aimed to investigate the potential association between autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 early in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We did an exposure-driven, propensity score-matched study using a South Korean nationwide cohort linked to general health examination records. We analysed all South Korean patients aged older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, and received general health examination results from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We defined autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases) based on the relevant ICD-10 codes, with at least two claims (outpatient or inpatient) within 1 year. The outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, severe COVID-19 (requirement of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission, application of invasive ventilation, or death), and COVID-19-related death. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated after adjusting for the potential confounders. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, 133 609 patients (70 050 [52·4%] female and 63 559 [47·6%] male) completed the general health examination and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 4365 (3·3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 8297 (6·2%) were diagnosed with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. After matching, patients with an autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease showed an increased likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted OR 1·19, 95% CI 1·03–1·40; p=0·026), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·26, 1·02–1·59; p=0·041), and COVID-19-related death (1·69, 1·01–2·84; p=0·046). Similar results were observed in patients with connective tissue disease and inflammatory arthritis. Treatment with any dose of systemic corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were not associated with COVID-19-related outcomes, but those receiving high dose (≥10 mg per day) of systemic corticosteroids had an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR 1·47, 95% CI 1·05–2·03; p=0·022), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·76, 1·06–2·96; p=0·031), and COVID-19-related death (3·34, 1·23–8·90; p=0·017). INTERPRETATION: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases were associated with an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related deaths in South Korea. A high dose of systemic corticosteroid, but not DMARDs, showed an adverse effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Nurses play a major role in response to pandemics and epidemics in delivering patient care. The experiences of nurses who provided care have significant short and long‐term consequences for individuals, communities, and the nursing profession. METHODS: Descriptive qualitative research approach was adopted in this study. We interviewed 12 nurses (22–50 years) who cared for the coronavirus disease 2019 patients in one of the clinical units of two coronavirus disease 2019 hospitals in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2020. Interviews were conducted via phone calls and were analysed using the thematic analysis method. The Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research checklist was applied when constructing this paper. RESULTS: The nurses had to care for a number of situations during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Kurdistan. As people in the public did not believe that there was such a virus, nurses often had to deal with this lack of knowledge and aggression from some patients and their family members. Most nurses changed their preventive behaviours since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak at hospital or in public. This was mainly to protect not only themselves but their patients, colleagues, family members and friends. They were cautious about the use of a mask at the hospital and in public. Most nurses experienced fear, stress, anxiety and isolation during this period. CONCLUSIONS: The patients had some concerns about their health and staying at hospitals, and some of them had aggressive behaviours towards nurses at corona hospitals. The public, close friends and relatives of the nurses had a fear of getting the infection by the virus through the nurses. However, the nurses attempted to protect themselves, colleagues and family members, and provide the best care to coronavirus disease 2019 patients. The nurses had a high obligation towards care giving at hospitals. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The negative experiences of the nurses regarding the care of coronavirus disease 2019 patients must be considered in clinical settings. Sensitive policy programs must be established to protect nurses from the ostracization and stigmatization of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and to allow them to be able to achieve their professional practices safely.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Mohammedsadiq, Hawar Abdulrazaq; Liamputtong, Pranee",J Clin Nurs,666,25

We reviewed multiple aspects of COVID peri-pandemic air travel, including data on traveller numbers, peri-flight prevention, and testing recommendations and in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission, photo-epidemiology of mask use, the pausing of air travel to mass gathering events, and quarantine measures and their effectiveness. Flights are reduced by 43% compared to 2019. Hygiene measures, mask use, and distancing are effective, while temperature screening has been shown to be unreliable. Although the risk of in-flight transmission is considered to be very low, estimated at one case per 27 million travellers, confirmed in-flight cases have been published. Some models exist and predict minimal risk but fail to consider human behavior and airline procedures variations. Despite aircraft high-efficiency filtering, there is some evidence that passengers within two rows of an index case are at higher risk. Air travel to mass gatherings should be avoided. Antigen testing is useful but impaired by time lag to results. Widespread application of solutions such as saliva-based, rapid testing or even detection with the help of “sniffer dogs” might be the way forward. The “traffic light system” for traveling, recently introduced by the Council of the European Union is a first step towards normalization of air travel. Quarantine of travellers may delay introduction or re-introduction of the virus, or may delay the peak of transmission, but the effect is small and there is limited evidence. New protocols detailing on-arrival, rapid testing and tracing are indicated to ensure that restricted movement is pragmatically implemented. Guidelines from airlines are non-transparent. Most airlines disinfect their flights and enforce wearing masks and social distancing to a certain degree. A layered approach of non-pharmaceutical interventions, screening and testing procedures, implementation and adherence to distancing, hygiene measures and mask use at airports, in-flight and throughout the entire journey together with pragmatic post-flight testing and tracing are all effective measures that can be implemented. Ongoing research and systematic review are indicated to provide evidence on the utility of preventive measures and to help answer the question “is it safe to fly?“.","Bielecki, Michel; Patel, Dipti; Hinkelbein, Jochen; Komorowski, Matthieu; Kester, John; Ebrahim, Shahul; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.; Memish, Ziad A.; Schlagenhauf, Patricia",Travel Med Infect Dis,666,3

Families were among those directly impacted by the first measures imposed by health authorities worldwide to contain the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, where social distancing and mandatory quarantine were the main approaches implemented. Notably, little is yet known about how social distancing during COVID-19 has altered families' daily routines, particularly regarding music-related behaviors. The aim of this study was 2-fold: (i) to explore changes in families' daily routine and caregivers' levels of well-being and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil and (ii) to investigate whether musical behaviors of caregivers and the children under their care (aged from 3 to 6 years old) changed during social distancing. One hundred and eighty-eight caregivers residing in Brazil participated in an online cross-sectional study conducted between July and August 2020. Our findings suggest significant changes in families' dynamics during the COVID-19 outbreak, with parents (especially mothers) spending more time on childcare and a substantial decrease in caregiver's well-being. Regarding music-related behaviors, our results revealed considerable changes in caregivers' and children's musical activities at home during social distancing, including an increase in child-only musical behaviors and shared caregiver-child activities. Moreover, sociodemographic factors such as caregiver background and well-being as well as the child's disability status significantly influenced musical engagement at home during social distancing. This study captured some features of the home musical environment of middle-class families in Brazil in the first stages of social distancing restrictions during the pandemic and caregivers' role in providing an environment where musical experiences are nurtured.

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R(0) of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.","Carcione, José M.; Santos, Juan E.; Bagaini, Claudio; Ba, Jing",Front Public Health,666,16

We aim to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental, physical, and cognitive health of survivors, the experience of their families and their treating healthcare professionals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective, multicentre, mixed-methods cohort study in seven Chilean ICUs. Sample: 450 adults, able to walk independently prior to admission, in ICU and mechanical ventilation >48 hours with and without COVID-19. Clinical Frailty Scale, Charlson comorbidity index, mobility (Functional Status Score for the Status Score for the Intensive Care Unit) and muscle strength (Medical Research Council Sum Score) will be assessed at ICU discharge. Cognitive functioning (Montreal Cognitive Assessment–blind), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), post-traumatic stress (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) symptoms, disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0), quality of life (European Quality of Life Health Questionnaire), employment and survival will be assessed at ICU discharge, 3 months and 6 months. A sample will be assessed using actigraphy and the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire at 6 months after ICU discharge. Trajectories of mental, physical, and cognitive impairments will be estimated using multilevel longitudinal modelling. A sensitivity analysis using multiple imputations will be performed to account for missing data and loss-to-follow-up. Survival will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves. The perceptions of family members regarding the ICU stay and the later recovery will be explored 3 months after discharge. Healthcare professionals will be invited to discuss the challenges faced during the pandemic using semistructured interviews. Interviews will be thematically analysed by two independent coders to identify the main themes of the experience of family members and healthcare professionals. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo Ethics Committee (2020–78) and each participating site. Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through social media and conference meetings.

Throughout history, pathogens have accompanied human populations and caused various epidemics. One of the most significant outbreaks was the Black Death, which occurred in the 14th century and caused the death of one-third of Europe’s population. Pathogens have also been studied for their use as biological warfare agents by the former Soviet Union, Japan, and the USA. Among bacteria and viruses, there are high priority agents that have a significant impact on public health. Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Variola virus, Filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg), Arenoviruses (Lassa), and influenza viruses are included in this group of agents. Outbreaks and infections caused by them might result in social disruption and panic, which is why special operations are needed for public health preparedness. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria that significantly impede treatment and recovery of patients are also valid threats. Furthermore, recent events related to the massive spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an example of how virus-induced diseases cannot be ignored. The impact of outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, have had far-reaching consequences beyond public health. The economic losses due to lockdowns are difficult to estimate, but it would take years to restore countries to pre-outbreak status. For countries affected by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), their health systems have been overwhelmed, resulting in an increase in the mortality rate caused by diseases or injuries. Furthermore, outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, will induce serious, wide-ranging (and possibly long-lasting) psychological problems among, not only health workers, but ordinary citizens (this is due to isolation, quarantine, etc.). The aim of this paper is to present the most dangerous pathogens, as well as general characterizations, mechanisms of action, and treatments.","Janik, Edyta; Ceremuga, Michal; Niemcewicz, Marcin; Bijak, Michal",Medicina (Kaunas),666,1

One hundred and sixty-three consecutive patients who underwent non-T-cell-depleted allo-HSCT and met the criterion of LOHC after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. The median time from allo-HSCT to the occurrence of LOHC was 29 (range, 4–155) days. Pathogens identified in blood and/or urine samples from 143 patients were mostly viruses. All of the patients with LOHC received intravenous fluid hydration, alkalization, and forced diuresis, of which 2 patients achieved complete remission (CR) after these treatments. The remaining 161 patients received anti-infection therapies and 71 achieved CR after the therapies. Corticosteroids were additionally applied to 83 out of 90 patients who did not achieve CR after anti-infection therapies, and 88.0% (n = 73) of them showed a grade 3 to 4 LOHC at the beginning of corticosteroid therapy. Thirty-five patients showed an immediate response (CR or downgraded at least one grade) within 1 week after the beginning of the corticosteroid therapy. Sixty-four patients (77.1%) achieved CR after corticosteroid therapy, and the median period from the beginning of corticosteroid therapy to CR was 17 days. Thus, we observed that viruses were the most common pathogens in LOHC after allo-HSCT and that anti-infection therapies were critical. For patients not showing a satisfactory response to anti-infection therapies, additional corticosteroid therapy may help to achieve CR.","Mo, Xiao-Dong; Zhang, Xiao-Hui; Xu, Lan-Ping; Wang, Yu; Yan, Chen-Hua; Chen, Huan; Chen, Yu-Hong; Han, Wei; Wang, Feng-Rong; Wang, Jing-Zhi; Liu, Kai-Yan; Huang, Xiao-Jun",Ann Hematol,666,1

Whether sHLH may also be observed in patients with a cytokine storm induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still uncertain. We aimed to determine the incidence of sHLH in severe COVID-19 patients and evaluate the underlying risk factors. METHOD: Four hundred fifteen severe COVID-19 adult patients were retrospectively assessed for hemophagocytosis score (HScore). A subset of 7 patients were unable to be conclusively scored due to insufficient patient data. RESULTS: In 408 patients, 41 (10.04%) had an HScore ≥169 and were characterized as “suspected sHLH positive”. Compared with patients below a HScore threshold of 98, the suspected sHLH positive group had higher D-dimer, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, triglycerides, ferritin, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, troponin, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, while leukocyte, hemoglobin, platelets, lymphocyte, fibrinogen, pre-albumin, albumin levels were significantly lower (all P < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that high ferritin (>1922.58 ng/mL), low platelets (<101 × 10(9)/L) and high triglycerides (>2.28 mmol/L) were independent risk factors for suspected sHLH in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, COVID-19 patients that were suspected sHLH positive had significantly more multi-organ failure. Additionally, a high HScore (>98) was an independent predictor for mortality in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: HScore should be measured as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients. In particular, it is important that HScore is assessed in patients with high ferritin, triglycerides and low platelets to improve the detection of suspected sHLH.","Meng, Mei; Chen, Limin; Zhang, Sheng; Dong, Xuan; Li, Wenzhe; Li, Ranran; Deng, Yunxin; Wang, Tao; Xu, Yan; Liu, Jiao; Huang, Yanxia; Chen, Yizhu; Huang, Sisi; Wen, Zhenliang; Zhang, Lidi; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yongan; Annane, Djillali; Qu, Jieming; Chen, Dechang",BMC Infect Dis,666,16

The key question that the authors try to address in this manuscript is whether there is value in using and refining current animal models for this pre-clinical testing, or whether these should be relinquished in favor of new, more human-relevant non-animal methods. ABSTRACT: Respiratory diseases constitute a huge burden in our society, and the global respiratory drug market currently grows at an annual rate between 4% and 6%. Inhalation is the preferred administration method for treating respiratory diseases, as it: (i) delivers the drug directly at the site of action, resulting in a rapid onset; (ii) is painless, thus improving patients’ compliance; and (iii) avoids first-pass metabolism reducing systemic side effects. Inhalation occurs through the mouth, with the drug generally exerting its therapeutic action in the lungs. In the most recent years, orally inhaled drugs (OIDs) have found application also in the treatment of systemic diseases. OIDs development, however, currently suffers of an overall attrition rate of around 70%, meaning that seven out of 10 new drug candidates fail to reach the clinic. Our commentary focuses on the reasons behind the poor OIDs translation into clinical products for the treatment of respiratory and systemic diseases, with particular emphasis on the parameters affecting the predictive value of animal preclinical tests. We then review the current advances in overcoming the limitation of animal animal-based studies through the development and adoption of in vitro, cell-based new approach methodologies (NAMs).","Movia, Dania; Prina-Mello, Adriele",Animals (Basel),666,16

Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful. We compared the diagnostic performance of salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care (POC) immunochromatographic assays, with that of molecular testing. Methods. 234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Results. The overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the first week from symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing between positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC=0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva had an overall good accuracy (ROC- AUC=0.805, 95%CI:0.740-0.870), reaching the optimal value within 7 days from symptom onset (Sensitivity: 72%; Specificity: 97%). POC antigen in saliva had a very limited sensitivity (13%), performing better in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively), depending on viral loads. Conclusions: Self-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection not only by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, for which the highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved in the first week from symptom onset. Saliva is not suitable for POC, although the accuracy of these tests appears satisfactory for NPS with high viral load.","Basso, D.; Aita, A.; Padoan, A.; Cosma, C.; Navaglia, F.; Moz, S.; Contran, N.; Zambon, C.-F.; Cattelan, A.

Cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir have shown strong anti–hepatitis C virus activity in vitro and in clinical studies. However, little is known about whether hepatocyte cyclophilins are involved in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) life cycle. We investigated the effects of 2 cyclophilin inhibitors (alisporivir and NIM811) on HBV replication and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) production in cell lines. Methods Liver-derived cell lines producing full-length HBV and HBsAg particles, owing to stable (HepG2215) or transient (HuH-7) transfection, or infected with HBV (HepaRG cells; Invitrogen [Carlsbad, CA]), were incubated with alisporivir or NIM811 alone, or alisporivir in combination with a direct antiviral (telbivudine). The roles of individual cyclophilins in drug response was evaluated by small interfering RNA knockdown of cyclophilin (CYP)A, CYPC, or CYPD in HepG2215 cells, or CYPA knockdown in HuH-7 cells. The kinetics of antiviral activity were assessed based on levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg and Southern blot analysis. Results In HepG2215, HuH-7, and HepaRG cells, alisporivir reduced intracellular and secreted HBV DNA, in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of CYPA, CYPC, or CYPD (reduced by 80%) significantly reduced levels of HBV DNA and secreted HBsAg. Knockdown of CYPA significantly reduced secretion of HBsAg, leading to accumulation of intracellular HBsAg; the addition of alisporivir greatly reduced levels of HBsAg in these cells. The combination of alisporivir and telbivudine had greater antiviral effects than those of telbivudine or alisporivir alone. Conclusions Alisporivir inhibition of cyclophilins in hepatocyte cell lines reduces replication of HBV DNA and HBsAg production and secretion. These effects are potentiated in combination with direct antiviral agents that target HBV-DNA polymerase.","Phillips, Sandra; Chokshi, Shilpa; Chatterji, Udayan; Riva, Antonio; Bobardt, Michael; Williams, Roger; Gallay, Philippe; Naoumov, Nikolai V.",Gastroenterology,666,1

The development of effective drugs and vaccines against Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the current research priority. Thus, we aimed to find out effective drug and vaccine targets using a comprehensive genome-based analysis. A total of 4822 proteins were screened from V. parahaemolyticus proteome. Among 16 novel cytoplasmic proteins, ‘VIBPA Type II secretion system protein L’ and ‘VIBPA Putative fimbrial protein Z’ were subjected to molecular docking with 350 human metabolites, which revealed that Eliglustat, Simvastatin and Hydroxocobalamin were the top drug molecules considering free binding energy. On the contrary, ‘Sensor histidine protein kinase UhpB’ and ‘Flagellar hook-associated protein of 25 novel membrane proteins were subjected to T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction, antigenicity testing, transmembrane topology screening, allergenicity and toxicity assessment, population coverage analysis and molecular docking analysis to generate the most immunogenic epitopes. Three subunit vaccines were constructed by the combination of highly antigenic epitopes along with suitable adjuvant, PADRE sequence and linkers. The designed vaccine constructs (V1, V2, V3) were analyzed by their physiochemical properties and molecular docking with MHC molecules- results suggested that the V1 is superior. Besides, the binding affinity of human TLR-1/2 heterodimer and construct V1 could be biologically significant in the development of the vaccine repertoire. The vaccine-receptor complex exhibited deformability at a minimum level that also strengthened our prediction. The optimized codons of the designed construct was cloned into pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12.

However, the role of tumor expressed-CD38 on neoplastic formation and progression remains elusive. In the present study, we aimed to delineate the molecular and biochemical function of the tumor-associated CD38 in lung adenocarcinoma progression. Our clinical data showed that the upregulation of tumor-originated CD38 was correlated with poor survival of lung cancer patients. Using multiple in vitro assays we found that the enzymatic activity of tumor expressed-CD38 facilitated lung cancer cell migration, proliferation, colony formation, and tumor development. Consistently, our in vivo results showed that inhibition of the enzymatic activity or antagonizing the enzymatic product of CD38 resulted in the similar inhibition of tumor proliferation and metastasis as CD38 gene knock-out or mutation. At biochemical level, we further identified that cADPR, the mainly hydrolytic product of CD38, was responsible for inducing the opening of TRPM2 iron channel leading to the influx of intracellular Ca(2+) and then led to increasing levels of NRF2 while decreasing expression of KEAP1 in lung cancer cells. These findings suggested that malignant lung cancer cells were capable of using cADPR catalyzed by CD38 to facilitate tumor progression, and blocking the enzymatic activity of CD38 could be represented as an important strategy for preventing tumor progression.","Gao, Long; Liu, Yuan; Du, Xiaohong; Ma, Sai; Ge, Minmin; Tang, Haijun; Han, Chenfeng; Zhao, Xin; Liu, Yanbin; Shao, Yun; Wu, Zhao; Zhang, Lianjun; Meng, Fang; Xiao-Feng Qin, F.",Cell Death Dis,666,16

While the structures of the individual proteins involved are known, how they assemble into a functioning superstructure is not. Applying molecular modeling tools, including protein-protein docking, to the available structures of nsp7-nsp16 and the nucleocapsid, we have constructed an atomistic model of how these proteins associate. Our principal finding is that the complex is hexameric, centered around nsp15. The nsp15 hexamer is capped on two faces by trimers of nsp14/nsp16/(nsp10)(2), which then recruit six nsp12/nsp7/(nsp8)(2) polymerase subunits to the complex. To this, six subunits of nsp13 are arranged around the superstructure, but not evenly distributed. Polymerase subunits that coordinate dimers of nsp13 are capable of binding the nucleocapsid, which positions the 5’-UTR TRS-L RNA over the polymerase active site, a state distinguishing transcription from replication. Analysis of the viral RNA path through the complex indicates the dsRNA that exits the polymerase passes over the nsp14 exonuclease and nsp15 endonuclease sites before being unwound by a convergence of zinc fingers from nsp10 and nsp14. The template strand is then directed away from the complex, while the nascent strand is directed to the sites responsible for mRNA capping. The model presents a cohesive picture of the multiple functions of the coronavirus replication-transcription complex and addresses fundamental questions related to proofreading, template switching, mRNA capping and the role of the endonuclease.","Perry, Jason K.; Appleby, Todd C.; Bilello, John P.; Feng, Joy Y.; Schmitz, Uli; Campbell, Elizabeth A.",J Biol Chem,666,1

The objective of this study is to compare characteristics of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients, in a population primarily comprised of mild and moderate infections, identified from comprehensive population-level testing. Here, we extracted demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs from 20,088 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics, in Salt Lake County, Utah; and for a subset of tested patients, we performed manual chart review to examine symptoms and exposure risks. To determine risk factors for testing positive, we used logistic regression to calculate the odds of testing positive, adjusting for symptoms and prior exposure. Of the 20,088 individuals, 1,229 (6.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found that Non-White persons were more likely to test positive compared to non-Hispanic Whites (adjOR=1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.6), and that this increased risk is more pronounced among Hispanic or Latino persons (adjOR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.1). However, we did not find differences in the duration of symptoms nor type of symptom presentation between non-Hispanic White and non-White individuals. We found that risk of hospitalization increases with age (adjOR=6.9 95% CI: 2.1, 22.5 for age 60+ compared to 0-19), and additionally show that younger individuals (aged 0-19), were underrepresented both in overall rates of testing as well as rates of testing positive. We did not find major race/ethnic differences in hospitalization rates. In this analysis of predominantly non-hospitalized individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, enabled by expansive testing capacity, we found disparities in both testing and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by race/ethnicity and by age.

In this study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method utilizing ECoV spike S1 protein was developed in two formats, and further validated by analyzing 27 paired serum samples (acute and convalescent sera) from horses involved in an ECoV outbreak and 1084 sera of horses with unknown ECoV exposure. Both formats showed high diagnostic accuracy compared to virus neutralization (VN) assay. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to determine the best cut-off values for both ELISA formats, assuming a test specificity of 99%. Employing the developed ELISA method, we detected seroconversion in 70.4% of horses from an ECoV outbreak. Among the 1084 horse sera, seropositivity varied from 25.9% (young horses) to 82.8% (adult horses) in Dutch horse populations. Further, sera of Icelandic horses were included in this study and a significant number of sera (62%) were found to be positive. Overall, the results demonstrated that the ECoV S1-based ELISA has reliable diagnostic performance compared to the VN assay and is a useful assay to support seroconversion in horses involved with ECoV outbreaks and to estimate ECoV seroprevalence in populations of horses.","Zhao, Shan; Smits, Constance; Schuurman, Nancy; Barnum, Samantha; Pusterla, Nicola; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Bosch, Berend-Jan; van Maanen, Kees; Egberink, Herman",Viruses,666,1

Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. Given a noiseless measurement of the recovered population, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 101 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. With low noise added to the recovered population, accurate state estimates require a lengthening of the temporal baseline of measurements. Estimates of all parameters are sensitive to the contamination, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. The aim of this paper is to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown parameters to a desired precision, in a model with the complexity required to capture important features of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Armstrong, Eve; Runge, Manuela; Gerardin, Jaline",Infect Dis Model,666,28

METHODS: We undertook a quasi-experimental study reporting on a 5-month implementation period in 58 primary health care centres from municipal areas within Bogotá (Colombia), Mexico City (Mexico), and Lima (Peru). Within the municipal areas, units were randomized to four arms: (1) care as usual (control); (2) training alone; (3) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a less intensive clinical and training package; and (4) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a more intense clinical and training package. The primary outcome was the cumulative proportion of consulting adult patients out of the population registered within the centre whose alcohol consumption was measured (coverage). RESULTS: The combination of municipal support and training did not result in higher coverage than training alone (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.8). Training alone resulted in higher coverage than no training (IRR = 9.8, 95% CI = 4.1 to 24.7). Coverage did not differ by intensity of the clinical and training package (coefficient = 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Training of providers is key to increasing coverage of alcohol measurement amongst primary health care patients. Although municipal support provided no added value, it is too early to conclude this finding, since full implementation was shortened due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Thus, many artificial intelligence (AI)-base methods are proposed for COVID-19 chest CT (computed tomography) image analysis. However, there are very limited COVID-19 chest CT images publicly available to evaluate those deep neural networks. On the other hand, a huge amount of CT images from lung cancer are publicly available. To build a reliable deep learning model trained and tested with a larger scale dataset, the proposed model builds a public COVID-19 CT dataset, containing 1186 CT images synthesized from lung cancer CT images using CycleGAN. Additionally, various deep learning models are tested with synthesized or real chest CT images for COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 classification. In comparison, all models achieve excellent results (over than 90%) in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for both synthesized and real COVID-19 CT images, demonstrating the reliable of the synthesized dataset.

Nevertheless, there is compelling epidemiological and laboratory evidence that face masks can be effective in impeding the spread of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that this apparent inconsistency can be resolved with a simple face mask model that combines our filtration efficiency measurements of various mask materials with existing data on exhaled aerosol characteristics. By reanalyzing these data we are able to reconcile the vastly different aerosol size distributions reported and derive representative volume distributions for speech and breath aerosol. Multiplying filtration efficiency by those aerosol volumes, which are proportional to emitted viral load, shows that electrostatically charged materials perform the best but that even most uncharged fabrics remove > 85 % of breath and > 99 % of speech aerosol volume for exhaled particles < 10 m in diameter. A leak model we develop shows the best uncharged fabric masks are made of highly air-permeable and often thin materials reducing viral load by up to 45 % and 50 % for breath and speech, respectively. Less permeable materials provide reduced protection because unfiltered air is forced through the leak. This can even render some charged materials inferior to uncharged household materials. Our model also shows that thin fabric masks provide protection for the wearer from aerosols expelled by another person reducing inhaled viral load by up to 20 % and 50 % and if leaks are avoided up to 35 % and 90 % for breath and speech, respectively.","Freitag, S.; Howell, S.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study of RPE fit testing according to health and safety, and occupational health requirements. SETTING: A large tertiary referral UK healthcare facility. POPULATION: 1443 healthcare workers undergoing quantitative fit testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative fit test success (pass/fail) and the count of tests each participant required before successful fit. RESULTS: Healthcare workers were fit tested a median (IQR) 2 (1–3) times before successful fit was obtained. Males were tested a median 1 (1–2) times, while females were tested a median 2 (1–2) times before a successful fit was found. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Modelling each fit test as its own independent trial (n=2359) using multivariable logistic regression, male healthcare workers were significantly more likely to find a well-fitting respirator and achieve a successful fit on first attempt in comparison to females, after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR=2.07, 95% CI): 1.66 to 2.60, p<0.001). Staff who described their ethnicity as White were also more likely to achieve a successful fit compared with staff who described their ethnicity as Asian (OR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.58, p<0.001), Black (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.71, p<0.001), mixed (OR=0.50 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.80, p=0.004) or other (OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.99, p=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Male and White ethnicity healthcare workers are more likely to achieve RPE fit test success. This has broad operational implications to healthcare services with a large female and Black, Asian and minority ethnic group population. Fit testing is imperative in ensuring RPE effectiveness in protecting healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Carvalho, Clarissa Y M; Schumacher, Jan; Greig, Paul Robert; Wong, Danny J N; El-Boghdadly, Kariem",BMJ Open,666,22

Early diagnosis of infected individuals will play an important role in stopping its further escalation. The present gold standard for sampling is the nasopharyngeal swab method. However, several recent papers suggested that saliva-based testing is a promising alternative that could simplify and accelerate COVID-19 diagnosis. Objectives: Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis on the reliability and consistency of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in saliva specimens. Methods: We have reported our meta-analysis according to the Cochrane Handbook. We searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and clinical trial registries for eligible studies published between 1 January and 25 April 2020. The number of positive tests and the total number of tests conducted were collected as raw data. The proportion of positive tests in the pooled data were calculated by score confidence-interval estimation with the Freeman–Tukey transformation. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) measure and the χ(2)-test. Results: The systematic search revealed 96 records after removal of duplicates. Twenty-six records were included for qualitative analysis and 5 records for quantitative synthesis. We found 91% (CI 80–99%) sensitivity for saliva tests and 98% (CI 89–100%) sensitivity for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) tests in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients, with moderate heterogeneity among the studies. Additionally, we identified 18 registered, ongoing clinical trials of saliva-based tests for detection of the virus. Conclusion: Saliva tests offer a promising alternative to NPS for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, further diagnostic accuracy studies are needed to improve their specificity and sensitivity.","Czumbel, László Márk; Kiss, Szabolcs; Farkas, Nelli; Mandel, Iván; Hegyi, Anita; Nagy, Ákos; Lohinai, Zsolt; Szakács, Zsolt; Hegyi, Péter; Steward, Martin C.; Varga, Gábor",Front Med (Lausanne),666,1

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a diagnosis of vertebral fracture (VF) increased mortality risk in COVID-19 patients and whether this effect was greater than in those without COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed VFs by computed tomography (CT) in a cohort of 501 patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department (ED) for clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of pandemic emergency. Of those, 239 had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: VF prevalence was similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups (22.2 vs. 19%; p = 0.458). Death rates were similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups at both 30 (15.8 vs. 12.2%; p = 0.234) and 120 days (21.8 vs. 17.6%; p = 0.236). The mortality risk was higher in COVID-19 patients either with one or multiple fractures compared to those without VFs, at 30 and 120 days, but statistical significance was reached only in those with multiple VFs (30-day HR 3.03, 95% CI 1.36–6.75; 120-day HR 2.91, 95% CI 1.43–5.91). In the non-COVID-19 group, the 30-day mortality risk was significantly higher in patients either with one (HR 7.46, 95% CI 3.12–17.8) or multiple fractures (HR 6.2, 95% CI 2.75–13.98) compared to those without VFs. A similar effect was observed at 120 days. After adjustment for age, sex and bone density, mortality risk remained associated with VFs in the non-COVID-19 group only. CONCLUSIONS: VFs were not independently associated with short-term mortality in patients with COVID-19, but they strongly increased mortality risk in those without COVID-19.","Battisti, Sofia; Napoli, Nicola; Pedone, Claudio; Lombardi, Mariangela; Leanza, Giulia; Tramontana, Flavia; Faraj, Malak; Agnoletti, Vanni; Verna, Martina; Viola, Lorenzo; Giampalma, Emanuela; Strollo, Rocky",Endocrine,666,32

In this cross-sectional survey, we enrolled parents of children <18 years in 2 rounds for exploratory (n = 418) and confirmatory (n = 386) factor analysis. We developed a 12-item measure of parental openness to AI-driven technologies, and a 33-item measure identifying concerns that parents found important when considering these technologies. We also evaluated associations between openness and attitudes, beliefs, personality traits, and demographics. Parents (N = 804) reported mean openness to AI-driven technologies of M = 3.4/5, SD = 0.9. We identified seven concerns that parents considered important when evaluating these technologies: quality/accuracy, privacy, shared decision making, convenience, cost, human element of care, and social justice. In multivariable linear regression, parental openness was positively associated with quality (beta = 0.23), convenience (beta = 0.16), and cost (beta = 0.11), as well as faith in technology (beta = 0.23) and trust in health information systems (beta = 0.12). Parental openness was negatively associated with the perceived importance of shared decision making (beta = −0.16) and being female (beta = −0.12). Developers might support parental openness by addressing these concerns during the development and implementation of novel AI-driven technologies.","Sisk, Bryan A.; Antes, Alison L.; Burrous, Sara; DuBois, James M.",Children (Basel),666,16

PTX3 plasma levels are associated with poor outcome in systemic inflammatory conditions and vascular pathology. The present study was designed to assess expression and significance of PTX3 in COVID-19. By bioinformatics analysis of public databases PTX3 expression was detected in lung respiratory cell lines exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By analysis at single cell level of COVID-19 circulating mononuclear cells, we found that PTX3 was selectively expressed by monocytes among circulating leukocytes. Moreover, in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, single cell analysis revealed selective expression of PTX3 in neutrophils and macrophages, which play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease. By immunohistochemistry, PTX3 was expressed by lung myelomocytic cells, type 2 pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells. PTX3 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 96 consecutive patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Higher PTX3 plasma levels were observed in 52 (54.2%) patients admitted in ICU (median 21.0ng/mL, IQT 15.5-46.3 vs 12.4ng/mL IQT 6.1-20.2 in ward patients; p=0.0017) and in 22 (23%) patients died by 28 days (39.8ng/mL, IQT 20.2-75.7 vs 15.7ng/mL, IQT 8.2-21.6 in survivors; p=0.0001). After determining an optimal PTX3 cut-off for the primary outcome, the Kaplan-Meier curve showed an increased mortality in patients with PTX3>22.25ng/mL (Log-rank tests p<0.0001). In Cox regression model, PTX3>22.25ng/mL showed an adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) of 7.6 (95%CI2.45-23.76) in predicting mortality. Performing a multivariate logistic regression including all inflammatory markers (PTX3, ferritin, D-Dimer, IL-6, and CRP), PTX3 was the only marker significantly associated with death (aHR 1.13;95%CI1.02-1.24; p=0.021).

In this study, we examined the relationship between mental health and addictive behaviors, such as excessive exercise and the use of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs) across 12 sport disciplines. Materials and methods: A large cross-sectional sample of the adult population (N = 2,295) was surveyed. The mean age was 33.09 (SD = 11.40). The number of male participants was 668 (30.0%). The use of IPEDs was assessed in conjunction with psychometric measures such as the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) and the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI). The participants were grouped into activity group (AG) and non-activity group (NAG) according to the presence or absence of their exercise habits. The results were compared between these groups, as well as across sport disciplines, while taking into account the relationship between different psychological measures and IPEDs consumption. Results: The frequency of IPEDs use was higher among AG (34.6%) than NAG (14.6%), although AG participants reported less history of addictions (7.1%) than NAG (11.8%). The logistic regression analysis revealed that scores equal to or above cutoff points, in both the EAI and AAI, predicted the IPEDs use. Regarding the differences across the various sport disciplines, those who were involved in practicing Weight Lifting and Cross Fit were found to be more at risk of excessive exercising and more inclined to use a wide range of IPEDs. Conclusions: Although exercise could help to increase well-being and prevent addictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, our results show that those in the AG are particularly vulnerable to excessive IPEDs use. Sport disciplines associated with higher EAI and AAI scores have also shown a higher tendency to excessive IPEDs use. Furthermore, the factor of having above the cutoff scores in EAI or AAI in each sport could indicate larger IPEDs consumption regardless of the discipline. In light of the current findings, it is necessary to better define the “non-excessive” levels of exercise in various sport disciplines and an adequate intake of IPEDs to ensure the safety and well-being of people during a pandemic.","Shibata, Mami; Burkauskas, Julius; Dores, Artemisa R.; Kobayashi, Kei; Yoshimura, Sayaka; Simonato, Pierluigi; De Luca, Ilaria; Cicconcelli, Dorotea; Giorgetti, Valentina; Carvalho, Irene P.; Barbosa, Fernando; Monteiro, Cristina; Murai, Toshiya; Gómez-Martínez, Maria A.; Demetrovics, Zsolt; Ábel, Krisztina Edina; Szabo, Attila; Ventola, Alejandra Rebeca Melero; Arroyo-Anlló, Eva Maria; Santos-Labrador, Ricardo M.; Griskova-Bulanova, Inga; Pranckeviciene, Aiste; Bersani, Giuseppe; Fujiwara, Hironobu; Corazza, Ornella",Front Psychol,666,17

However, for human researchers studying viruses and hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly if our scientific understanding is also limited, which further lowers the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS (Topic‐wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures), a method that can deal with various scientific problems, such as liver cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and so forth, which can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, this information can be combined with independent functional data sources to build an inference system via a machine‐based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. Using TWIRLS, we automatically analyzed more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hr. We found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. On triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, the cytokine homeostasis regulation axis becomes imbalanced via the Renin‐Angiotensin System and IP‐10, leading to a cytokine storm.

Recently, astroviruses have been reported in bats in many countries, but not Korea. We collected 363 bat samples from thirteen species at twenty-nine sites in Korea across 2016 and tested them for astrovirus. The detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene in bat astroviruses was confirmed in thirty-four bats across four bat species in Korea: twenty-five from Miniopterus fuliginosusi, one from Myotis macrodactylus, four from M. petax, and four from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. The highest detection rates for astrovirus were found in Sunchang (61.5%, 8/13 bats), and in the samples collected in April (63.2%, 12/19 bats). The amino acid identity of astroviral sequences identified from bat samples was ≥ 46.6%. More specifically, the amino acid identity within multiple clones from individual bats was ≥ 50.8%. Additionally, the phylogenetic topology between astroviruses from different bat families showed a close relationship. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 sequence of bat astroviruses was found to have a maximum similarity of 73.3–74.8% with available bat astrovirus sequences. These results indicate potential multiple-infection by several bat astrovirus species in individual bats, or hyperpolymorphism in the astrovirus strains, as well as the transmission of astroviruses across bat families; furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 implied that a novel astrovirus may exist. However, the wide diversity of astroviral sequences appeared to have no significant correlation with bat species or the spatiotemporal distribution of Korean bat astroviruses.","Lee, Sook-Young; Son, Ki-Dong; Yong-Sik, Kim; Wang, Seung-Jun; Kim, Yong-Kwan; Jheong, Weon-Hwa; Oem, Jae-Ku",Arch Virol,666,3

Moreover, in a relevant number of cases, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains totally asymptomatic. All these findings seem to suggest that otherwise healthy children with suspected COVID-19 might be managed in the community in most cases, thus avoiding hospital admission and closely related medical, social and economic problems, including overwhelming hospitals. Unfortunately, home management of children with suspected COVID-19 rarely occurs, and many children with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are frequently hospitalized irrespective of the severity of disease. To evaluate the role of community health houses (CHHs) in the management of children with COVID-19, 1,009 children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were studied in Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. Among them, 194 (19.2%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The majority (583, 58%) were tested at home by CHHs, while 426 (42%) were brought to the hospital for testing. The patients who were managed in the hospital had a significantly lower median age than those who were managed at home (2 vs. 12 years, p < 0.001). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases within the family was significantly more frequent among those who were managed at home (82 vs. 46%, p < 0.05). The clinical findings were similar between the children who were managed at home and those who were managed in the hospital. Only one of the children managed at home (0.7%) required hospitalization; in comparison, 26 (48%) of those whose swab samples were taken at the hospital were hospitalized. Our research shows for the first time the importance of CHHs in the management of COVID-19 in children; because of the high frequency of mild to moderate cases, management by CHHs can reduce the care load in hospitals, providing enormous advantages on the familial, medical, social, and economic levels. These findings could be useful for suggesting a territorial rather than hospital-based strategy in pediatrics in the case of a new wave of the epidemic.","Vergine, Gianluca; Fantini, Michela; Marchetti, Federico; Stella, Marcello; Valletta, Enrico; Biasucci, Giacomo; Lanari, Marcello; Dodi, Icilio; Bigi, Maurizio; Magista, Anna Maria; Vaienti, Francesca; Cella, Andrea; Affanni, Paola; Re, Maria Carla; Sambri, Vittorio; Esposito, Susanna",Front Pediatr,666,16

Among them, 262 papers were published by authors from 67 countries regarding COVID-19 with water science and technology. Although the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in water cycle have not been proved, the water and wastewater play an important role in the control of COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, it is scholarly relevant and interesting to look into publications of COVID-19 in water science and technology to track the investigations for moving forward in the years to come. It is believed that, through the literature survey, the question on what we know and what we do not know about COVID-19 so far can be clear, thus providing useful information for helping curbing the epidemic from water sector. This forms the basis of the current study. As such, a bibliometric analysis was conducted. It reveals that wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has recently gained global attention with the source and survival characteristics of coronavirus in the aquatic environment; the methodology of virus detection; the water hygiene; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the water ecosystem being the main topics in 2020. Various studies have shown that drinking water is safety whereas wastewater may be a potential risk during this pandemic. From the perspective of the water cycle, the scopes for further research needs are discussed and proposed, which could enhance the important role and value of water science in warning, monitoring, and predicting COVID-19 during epidemic outbreaks.","Ji, Bin; Zhao, Yaqian; Wei, Ting; Kang, Peiying",J Environ Chem Eng,666,27

There is currently no effective means of preventing infections by SARS-CoV-2, except through restriction of population movement and contact. An understanding of the origin, evolution and biochemistry (molecular biology) of SARS-CoV-2 is a prerequisite to its control. Mutations in the phosphorylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 encoded nucleocapsid protein isolated from various populations and locations, are described. Mutations occurred in the phosphorylation sites, all located within a stretch which forms a phosphorylation dependent interaction site, including C-TAK1 phosphorylation sites for 14-3-3. The consequences of these mutations are discussed and a structure-based model for the role of protein 14-3-3 in the sequestration and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein's function is presented. It is proposed that the phosphorylation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and its sequestration by Protein 14-3-3 is a cellular response mechanism for the control and inhibition of the replication, transcription and packaging of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.","Tung, H.Y.

In this review article, we examine the new picture of the evolution of RNA viruses, the dominant component of the eukaryotic virome, that is emerging from metagenomic data analysis. The major expansion of many groups of RNA viruses through metagenomics allowed the construction of substantially improved phylogenetic trees for the conserved virus genes, primarily, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). In particular, a new superfamily of widespread, small positive-strand RNA viruses was delineated that unites tombus-like and noda-like viruses. Comparison of the genome architectures of RNA viruses discovered by metagenomics and by traditional methods reveals an extent of gene module shuffling among diverse virus genomes that far exceeds the previous appreciation of this evolutionary phenomenon. Most dramatically, inclusion of the metagenomic data in phylogenetic analyses of the RdRp resulted in the identification of numerous, strongly supported groups that encompass RNA viruses from diverse hosts including different groups of protists, animals and plants. Notwithstanding potential caveats, in particular, incomplete and uneven sampling of eukaryotic taxa, these highly unexpected findings reveal horizontal virus transfer (HVT) between diverse hosts as the central aspect of RNA virus evolution. The vast and diverse virome of invertebrates, particularly nematodes and arthropods, appears to be the reservoir, from which the viromes of plants and vertebrates evolved via multiple HVT events.","Dolja, Valerian V.; Koonin, Eugene V.",Virus Research,666,9

The host cell proteases cathepsin B and L activate the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) for cellular entry and constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention. However, it is unclear if different EBOV species and MARV equally depend on cathepsin B/L activity for infection of cell lines and macrophages, important viral target cells. Here, we show that cathepsin B/L inhibitors markedly reduce 293T cell infection driven by the GPs of all EBOV species, independent of the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2, which cleaved but failed to activate EBOV-GPs. Similarly, a cathepsin B/L inhibitor blocked macrophage infection mediated by different EBOV-GPs. In contrast, MARV-GP-driven entry exhibited little dependence on cathepsin B/L activity. Still, MARV-GP-mediated entry was efficiently blocked by leupeptin. These results suggest that cathepsins B/L promote entry of EBOV while MARV might employ so far unidentified proteases for GP activation.","Gnirß, Kerstin; Kühl, Annika; Karsten, Christina; Glowacka, Ilona; Bertram, Stephanie; Kaup, Franziska; Hofmann, Heike; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Virology,666,21

One third of 9 million Veterans Health Administration enrolled Veterans live in rural areas. Although digital solutions can expand capacity, enhance care access, and reduce financial burden, they may also exacerbate rural-urban health disparities. Careful evaluation of patients' perceptions and policy tradeoffs are necessary to optimize teleoncology postpandemic. METHODS Patients with ≥ 1 teleoncology visit with medical, surgical, or radiation oncology between March 2020 and June 2020 were identified retrospectively. Validated, Likert-type survey assessing patient satisfaction was developed. Follow-up survey was conducted on patients with ≥ 1 teleoncology visit from August 2020 to January 2021. Travel distance, time, cost, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on zip codes. RESULTS A hundred surveys were completed (response rate, 62%). Patients overall were satisfied with teleoncology (83% Agree or Strongly Agree) but felt less satisfied than in-person visits (47% Agree or Strongly Agree). Audiovisual component improved patient perception of involvement in care, ability to self-manage health or medical needs, and comparability to in-person visits. Follow-up survey demonstrated similar satisfaction. Total travel-related savings are as follows: 86,470 miles, 84,374 minutes, $49,720 US dollars, and 35.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide. CONCLUSION Veterans are broadly satisfied with teleoncology. Audiovisual capabilities are critical to satisfaction. This is challenging for rural populations with lack of technology access. Patients experienced financial and time savings, and society benefitted from reduced carbon emissions. Continued optimization is needed to enhance patient experience and address secondary effects.","Jiang, Cindy Y; Strohbehn, Garth W; Dedinsky, Rachel M; Raupp, Shelby M; Pannecouk, Brittany M; Yentz, Sarah E; Ramnath, Nithya",JCO oncology practice,666,23

This, combined with the government-imposed lockdown, may have impacted on patient attendance, severity of surgical disease, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible ‘lockdown’ effect on the volume and severity of surgical admissions and their outcomes. METHODS: Two separate cohorts of adult emergency general surgery inpatient admissions 30 days immediately before (16(th) February 2020 to 15(th) March 2020), and after UK government advice (16(th) March 2020 to 15(th) April 2020). Data were collected relating to patient characteristics, severity of disease, clinical outcomes, and compared between these groups. RESULTS: Following lockdown, a significant reduction in median daily admissions from 7 to 3 per day (p<0.001) was observed. Post-lockdown patients were significantly older, frailer with higher inflammatory indices and rates of acute kidney injury, and also were significantly more likely to present with gastrointestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. Patients had significantly higher rates of Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥3 complications (p=0.001), all cause 30-day mortality (8.5% vs. 2.9%, p=0.028), but no significant difference was observed in operative 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a “lockdown” effect on general surgical admissions with a profound impact; fewer surgical admissions, more acutely unwell surgical patients, and an increase in all cause 30-day mortality. Patients should be advised to present promptly with gastrointestinal symptoms, and this should be reinforced for future lockdowns during the pandemic.","McLean, Ross C.; Young, John; Musbahi, Aya; Lee, Jing Xian; Hidayat, Hena; Abdalla, Nagi; Chowdhury, Sabyasachi; Baker, Elizabeth A.; Etherson, Kevin Jon",Int J Surg,666,1

This qualitative study aimed to explore the experience of social stigma among COVID-19 positive patients and their family members. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted between April to June 2020 in Malaysia. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 for at least 1 month and their family members who were tested with negative results, Malaysian and aged 18–65 years old were purposively sampled. Cold call method was employed to recruit patients while their family members were recruited by their recommendations. Telephone interviews were conducted with the participants after obtaining their verbal consent. RESULTS: A total of 18 participants took part in this study. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (Ι) experience of stigmatization, (ΙΙ) perspective on disease disclosure, and (ΙΙΙ) suggestion on coping and reducing stigma. The participants expressed their experiences of being isolated, labelled, and blamed by the people surrounding them including the health care providers, neighbours, and staff at the service counters. Some respondents expressed their willingness to share their experience with others by emphasizing the importance of taking preventive measure in order to stop the chain of virus transmission and some of them chose to disclose this medical history for official purpose because of fear and lack of understanding among the public. As suggested by the respondents, the approaches in addressing social stigma require the involvement of the government, the public, health care provider, and religious leader. CONCLUSION: Individuals recovered from COVID-19 and their families experienced social stigma. Fear and lack of public understanding of the COVID-19 disease were the key factors for non-disclosure. Some expressed their willingness to share their experience as they perceived it as method to increase public awareness and thereby reducing social stigma. Multifaceted approaches with the involvement of multiple parties including the government, non-governmental organization as well as the general public were recommended as important measures to address the issues of social stigma.","Chew, Chii-Chii; Lim, Xin-Jie; Chang, Chee-Tao; Rajan, Philip; Nasir, Nordin; Low, Wah-Yun",BMC Public Health,666,1

The existing literature is limited. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. METHODS: Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high‐speed air‐turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3‐in‐1 spray, and procedures were performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis, and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearson’s correlation for comparison of analytic methods. RESULTS: All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1–1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high‐speed air‐turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m, and 1,695 at 4 m. There was uneven spatial distribution with highest levels of contamination opposite the operator. Very low levels of contamination (≤0.1% of original) were detected at 30 and 60 minutes post procedure. Suction reduced contamination by 67–75% at 0.5–1.5 m. Mannequin and operator were heavily contaminated. The two analytic methods showed good correlation (r=0.930, n=244, p<0.001).

Participants reported high compliance with face covering recommendations but often did not wear them around family, friends, and colleagues. The most prevalent motivation for the use of face coverings was to protect or respect other people, including high-risk populations and individuals. Other motivators were self-protection, responsibility, desire for control, requirements, and expert advice. Barriers included physical and social discomfort, confusion or misinformation, low perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceptions of identity and autonomy. Even among individuals who frequently wear face coverings, there are opportunities to improve compliance. Messaging should highlight how face coverings protect the wearer and others around them, normalize the use of face coverings in social settings, and emphasize requirements. Positive messages that focus on unity, personal experiences and the rationale for face coverings are recommended.","Shelus, Victoria S.; Frank, Simone C.; Lazard, Allison J.; Higgins, Isabella C.

Cleavage of signal peptide at the C-terminus of HCV core protein by SPP was characterized in this study. The spko mutant (mutate a.a. 189–193 from ASAYQ to PPFPF) is more efficient than the A/F mutant (mutate a.a 189 and 191 from A to F) in blocking the cleavage of signal peptide by signal peptidase. The cleavage efficiency of SPP is inversely proportional to the length of C-terminal extension of the signal peptide: the longer the extension, the less efficiency the cleavage is. Thus, reducing the length of C-terminal extension of signal peptide by signal peptidase cleavage could facilitate further cleavage by SPP. The recombinant core protein fused with signal peptide from the C-terminus of p7 protein, but not those from the C-termini of E1 and E2, could be cleaved by SPP. Therefore, the sequence of the signal peptide is important but not the sole determinant for its cleavage by SPP. Replacement of the HCV core protein E.R.-associated domain (a.a. 120–150) with the E.R.-associated domain (a.a.1–50) of SARS-CoV membrane protein results in the failure of cleavage of this recombinant protein by SPP, though this protein still is E.R.-associated. This result suggests that not only E.R.-association but also specific protein sequence is important for the HCV core protein signal peptide cleavage by SPP. Thus, our results suggest that both sequences of the signal peptide and the E.R.-associated domain are important for the signal peptide cleavage of HCV core protein by SPP.

During this period, surgical activity and admission to the Emergency Department (ED) globally decreased. The aim of this paper is to understand how Vascular Surgery patient’s admission to the ED changed in our center in Portugal and if this situation prevented urgent surgical procedures. METHODS: Through a retrospective study we compared the volume of patients admitted to the ED during the Emergency State (ES) in Portugal with the same period in 2019. Additionally, we analyzed the urgent surgical activity during ES and in the correspondent period of the previous 10 years, regarding limb acute ischemia, acute aortic pathology and vascular trauma. Two groups of patients were formed – patients operated during ES and during non-Emergency State (non-ES), for control. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS® Statistics 25. RESULTS: In the ES, 115 patients were observed at the ED and 179 in 2019 corresponding period. During the ES, patients significantly recurred less to the ED directly from home (p < .001) and were less referred to the ED by primary care doctors (p < .001). Patients observed at the ED were significantly more urgent - required urgent surgery or were admitted to the department - than in 2019 (40% vs. 24%). However, there were no differences when only considering urgent surgery (14% in ES vs. 10% in 2019). In the ES, 38% of patients observed at the ED were discharged with no follow-up related to Vascular surgery against 60% in 2019, although this difference was not significant. Comparing to the preceding 10 years, there aren’t significant differences in the of number of patients who had urgent surgery in both ES and non-ES periods. In patients with acute limb ischemia we did not find an increase in the time between onset of symptoms and ED admission, during the ES. CONCLUSION: Fewer patients were admitted at the ED during the ES and those admitted were significantly more urgent. We did not find a decrease in the number of urgent surgery when comparing to the preceding 10 years. Therefore, we cannot assume that coronavirus pandemic precluded urgent surgical procedures.","Correia, Mafalda; Constâncio, Vânia; Silva, Joana Cruz; Lima, Pedro; Moreira, Mário; Antunes, Luís F.; Fonseca, Manuel",Ann Vasc Surg,666,21

Two hundred thirty-eight patients were infected; 33 died. Forty-two percent were health care workers. The whole medical system in the country was put under stress. One major public hospital became the designated SARS hospital. Emergency cases were diverted to the remaining public hospitals, of which Singapore General Hospital was the main recipient. The increase in workload, new infection control procedures including mandatory wearing of the positive airway pressure respirator and personal protective equipment (PPE), and limiting the number of person-contacts with each patient were thought to affect resuscitation and airway management. Our aim is to study the effects of wearing of PPE and the restriction in number of resuscitation personnel on airway management during the SARS crisis. Methods: The emergency department has an ongoing airway registry that prospectively captures patient demographics, diagnosis, indications for intubation, persons and discipline of intubating physician, number of attempts, method of intubation, success rates, and complications. The data were divided into 3 periods: (1) before PPE was instituted from November 1, 2002, to March 31, 2003; (2) during SARS (when PPE use was mandatory) from April 1 to July 31, 2003; and (3) after SARs (when PPE use was nonmandatory but encouraged) from August 1 to December 31, 2003. Results: There was no change in patient demographics during the 3 periods, but there was a change in the patient diagnoses in period 2, with decreases in the proportion of respiratory and cardiac cases and increases in neurology and trauma cases. These changes reverted to the previous distribution in period 3. The alarming discovery was that whereas in period 1 (pre-SARS), resident medical officers attempted intubations 45% of the time, this figure went down to 35% in period 2 (SARS) and 23% in period 3 (post-SARS). Anesthetists performed 1.2%, 8%, and 0% of emergency intubations in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Attending emergency physicians performed 54%, 56%, and 77% of intubations in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The complication/peri-intubation event rates were 10.5%, 9.9%, and 9.4% in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The success rate for residents was 80.8%, 89%, and 86.2% in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusion: The wearing of PPE and positive airway pressure respirator is thought to make intubation more difficult, as seen by the increase in proportion of intubations performed by anesthetists in period 2 and by attending emergency physicians in periods 2 and 3. The infection control policy that restricts the number of health care staff attending to each patient may have influenced the department's decision to allow only the most confident or experienced personnel to manage the airway. The exposure of junior residents in emergency airway management during SARS and the immediate post-SARS period was decreased. This trend should be further monitored, and intervention may be necessary should it continue to decline.","Wong, E.; Ho, K.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,666,1

Our findings show that a early lockdowns barely shift the epidemic in time: moreover, beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, an epidemic that seems to be quelled fully recovers after lifting the restrictions. We investigate the effects on lockdown scenarios and exit mechanisms by introducing heterogeneities in the model. In particular, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities in which social interactions through different age classes occur. We find that, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics developed independently in different regions once the outbreak starts. Moreover, after the epidemics ha started, the influence of contacts with other regions becomes soon irrelevant. Sparsity accounts for the observed delays across different regions. Analogous arguments would apply to the international borders. We also show how disregarding the structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of the post-lockdown effects. Nevertheless, age class based mechanisms can help to mitigate rebound effects with milder strategies. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized beyond this particular model by providing a description of the effects of key parameters on non-medical mitigation strategies for epidemics.","Scala, Antonio; Flori, Andrea; Spelta, Alessandro; Brugnoli, Emanuele; Cinelli, Matteo; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Pammolli, Fabio",,666,32

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","Oliveiros, Barbara; Caramelo, Liliana; Ferreira, Nuno C; Caramelo, Francisco",,666,16

However, influenza in pigs is a zoonotic viral disease well-known to virologists for almost one century with the classical H1N1 subtype the only responsible agent for swine influenza in the United States for many decades. Swine influenza was first recognized clinically in pigs in the Midwestern U.S. in 1918 and since that time it has remained important to the swine industry throughout the world. Since 1998, however, the epidemiology of swine influenza changed dramatically. A number of emerging subtypes and genotypes have become established in the U.S. swine population. The ability of multiple influenza virus lineages to infect pigs is associated with the emergence of reassortant viruses with new genomic arrangements, and the introduction of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 from humans to swine represents a well-known example. The recent epidemiological data regarding the current state of influenza A virus subtypes circulating in the Canadian and American swine population is discussed in this review.","Lorusso, Alessio; Vincent, Amy L.; Gramer, Marie R.; Lager, Kelly M.; Ciacci-Zanella, Janice R.",Swine Influenza,666,1

Public health interventions continue in their attempts to control the spread as they wait for the planned significant effect of vaccination. METHODS: To tackle this challenge and the observed non-stationary aspect of the epidemic we used a modified SEIR stochastic model with time-varying parameters, following Brownian process. This enabled us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of COVID-19 with the non-specific hypothesis that it follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the available data. This model is coupled with Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) for parameter estimation and utilized mainly well-documented Irish hospital data. RESULTS: In Ireland, mitigation measures provided a 78–86% reduction in transmission during the first wave between March and May 2020. For the second wave in October 2020, our reduction estimation was around 20% while it was 70% for the third wave in January 2021. This third wave was partly due to the UK variant appearing in Ireland. In June 2020 we estimated that sero-prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2–3.5%) in complete accordance with a sero-prevalence survey. By the end of April 2021, the sero-prevalence was greater than 17% due in part to the vaccination campaign. Finally we demonstrate that the available observed confirmed cases are not reliable for analysis owing to the fact that their reporting rate has as expected greatly evolved. CONCLUSION: We provide the first estimations of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland and its key parameters. We also quantify the effects of mitigation measures on the virus transmission during and after mitigation for the three waves. Our results demonstrate that Ireland has significantly reduced transmission by employing mitigation measures, physical distancing and lockdown. This has to date avoided the saturation of healthcare infrastructures, flattened the epidemic curve and likely reduced mortality. However, as we await for a full roll out of a vaccination programme and as new variants potentially more transmissible and/or more infectious could continue to emerge and mitigation measures change silent transmission, challenges remain.
