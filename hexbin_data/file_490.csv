6522,Akutes Leberversagen,2012-12-28,"This paper describes a new fully differentiated Type-II alveolar epithelial cell line designated T(7), derived from transgenic H-2K(b)-tsA58 mice, capable of being passaged as an immortalized cloned cell line in culture. H-2K(b)-tsA58 mice harbor a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T antigen) under the control of the γ-interferon (INF)-inducible mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2K(b) promoter. When cultured under permissive conditions (33°C and in the presence of γ-INF) cells isolated from H-2K(b)-tsA58 mice express the large T antigen, which drives the cells to proliferate. However, upon withdrawal of the γ-INF and transfer of the cells to a higher temperature (39°C), T antigen expression is turned off, the cells stop proliferating and differentiate. The T(7) cell line is a clonal cell line originally derived from a Type-II cell-rich fraction isolated from lungs of H-2K(b)-tsA58 mice. The T(7) cells form confluent monolayers, and have a polarized epithelial cell morphology with tight junctions and apical microvilli. In addition, the T(7) cells have distinct cytoplasmic lamellar bodies, which become more numerous and pronounced when the cells are grown under nonpermissive conditions. The T(7) cells synthesize and secrete phosphatidylcholine and the three surfactant proteins, SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C. The T(7) cell line is unique in that it is the first non-tumor-derived Type-II cell line capable of synthesizing and secreting the major components of surfactant. Based on the criteria studied, the T(7) cell line is phenotypically very similar to normal Type-II cells. The T(7) cell line, therefore, should prove a valuable experimental system to advance the study of the cell biology/physiology of surfactant metabolism and secretion as well as serve as a model for other studies of Type-II cell physiology.","deMello, Daphne E.; Mahmoud, Sohir; Padfield, Philip J.; Hoffmann, Joseph W.",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101677/,490

The majority of cases are secondary to respiratory syncytial virus. There are a number of risk factors for severe disease, including children less than six weeks of age and patients with atopy and/or asthma. The management requires vigilant monitoring and high-quality supportive care, including impressive use of fluids and nutritional support. Further research on anti-virals is essential to prevent respiratory syncytial virus induced bronchiolitis.

10328,Veranstaltungstipps,2020-04-21,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Despite advances in antibiotic treatments, mortality among patients with CAP is still high. For this reason, interest has been focused on nonantibiotic therapeutic measures directed to the host response rather than the microorganism. The development of an efficacious adjunctive treatment has important implications for reducing mortality in CAP. Some clinical studies performed in the last decade have shown a clinically beneficial effect of corticosteroids, possibly by diminishing local and systemic inflammatory host response. Recent meta-analyses showed faster resolution of symptoms, shorter time to clinically stability, reduction of mechanical ventilation needed, and reduction of mortality in the most severe population, although some methodological limitations must be taken into account. In addition, some studies using statins also suggested improved outcomes due to its anti-inflammatory effect in CAP, although this requires further research. Other adjunctive therapies such as immunoglobulins and stem cells are being explored, but are not yet in the stage of clinical trials. In summary, the use of corticosteroids and other adjuvant treatments are promising in CAP, but more studies are needed to determine their impact on mortality.","Sibila, Oriol; Rodrigo-Troyano, Ana; Torres, Antoni",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171709/,490

Similar to recent calls for the early adoption of Blockchain technology, the so-called ‘microcredentialing craze’ could be no more than a fad, marketing hype, or another case of ‘learning innovation theater.’ Alternatively, the introduction of these compact skills- and competency-based online certificate programs might augur the arrival of a legitimate successor to the four-year university diploma. The thesis of this article is that the craze for microcredentialing reflects (1) administrative urgency to unbundle higher education curricula and degree programs for greater efficiency and profitability and (2) a renascent movement among industry and higher education leaders to reorient the university curriculum towards vocational training.","Ralston, Shane J.",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235178/,490
34491,Veranstaltungstipps,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 75% of all bicycle-related mortality is secondary to head injuries, 85% of which could have been prevented by wearing a bicycle helmet. Younger children appear to be at greater risk than adults, yet helmet use is low despite this risk and legislation and ordinances requiring helmet use among younger riders. We sought to determine whether bicycle helmets are associated with the incidence and severity of head injury among pediatric bicyclists involved in a bicycle crash involving a motor vehicle. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients age ≤ 18 years hospitalized at a level I pediatric trauma center between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Data were abstracted from the institutional trauma registry and electronic medical record. International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th editions and external causes of injury codes were used to identify MV related bicycle crashes and determine the abbreviated injury severity (AIS) for head injury severity. Injury narratives were reviewed to determine helmet use. We calculated the incidence of head injury from bicycle vs. MV crashes utilizing descriptive statistics. We analyzed the risk and severity of injury utilizing univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 226 bicyclists were treated for injuries from being struck by a MV. The median age was 11 (interquartile range (IQR): 8 to 13) years. Helmeted bicyclists (n = 26, 27%) were younger (9.4 years versus 10.8 years, p = 0.04), and were less likely (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.49) to be diagnosed with a head injury compared to unhelmeted bicyclists (n = 199). Of those with a head injury, helmeted bicyclists were less likely (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11–2.82) to sustain severe or higher injury using AIS. When adjusting for demographics (age, sex, race) and injury severity, helmet use predicted a reduction in head injury (OR 6.02, 95% CI 2.4–15.2). CONCLUSIONS: Bicycle helmet use was associated with reduced odds of head injury and severity of injury.. These results support the use of strategies to increase the uptake of bicycle helmets wearing as part of a comprehensive youth bicycling injury prevention program.","Strotmeyer, Stephen J.; Behr, Christopher; Fabio, Anthony; Gaines, Barbara A.",Inj Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291179/,490

43927,426. Use of Real Time IP-10 Measurements to Identify and Monitor the Dysregulated Immune Response in COVID-19 Patients,2020-12-31,"PURPOSE: Viral diseases increasingly endanger the world public health because of the transient efficacy of antiviral therapies. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recently identified as caused by a new type of coronaviruses. This type of coronavirus binds to the human receptor through the Spike glycoprotein (S) Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). The spike protein is found in inaccessible (closed) or accessible (open) conformations in which the accessible conformation causes severe infection. Thus, this receptor is a significant target for antiviral drug design. METHODS: An attempt was made to recognize 111 natural and synthesized compounds in order to utilize them against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to inhibit Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using simulation methods, such as molecular docking. The FAF-Drugs3, Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS), ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) databases along with Lipinski’s rules were used to evaluate the drug-like properties of the identified ligands. In order to analyze and identify the residues critical in the docking process of the spike glycoprotein, the interactions of proposed ligands with both conformations of the spike glycoprotein was simulated. RESULTS: The results showed that among the available ligands, seven ligands had significant interactions with the binding site of the spike glycoprotein, in which angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is bounded. Out of seven candidate molecules, six ligands exhibited drug-like characteristics. The results also demonstrated that fluorophenyl and propane groups of ligands had optimal interactions with the binding site of the spike glycoprotein. CONCLUSION: According to the results, our findings indicated the ability of six ligands to prevent the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to its cognate receptor, providing novel compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.

43961,565. Tocilizumab Use in COVID-19: Act(emra) to Inhibit Intubation and Decompensation,2020-12-31,"Costa Rica has long been a country of special interest in the Americas and in global health because of its good health. The United Nations Development Programme ranks countries according to their level of human development based on life expectancy, education and national income. Although Costa Rica is ranked at 63 and classified as ‘High’, in terms of health it belongs in the ‘Very High’ group. In 2018 mean life expectancy for the ‘Very High’ countries was 79.5, while in Costa Rica it was 80. In 2018, under five mortality was 8.8/1000 live births, lower than countries ranked in the ‘Very High’ human development group. Expected years of schooling in Costa Rica is 15.4, closer to the average, 16.4 years, of the ‘Very High’ human development group than the average of the ‘High’ group. The country is much healthier than would be predicted by its national income; rather, other features of society’s development are likely to have played a key role in the development of good health. These include (i) the decision to cease investment in national defence, which freed up money to invest in health, education and the welfare of the population; (ii) the decision to create a universal health system financed by the State, employers and workers in the 1940s; and (iii) the educational system, that generated opportunities to lift important sectors of the population out of poverty, allowing them to have basic sanitary conditions that increase their possibilities to live longer and in better conditions. Despite these advances, inequalities in terms of income and social conditions persist, presenting challenges in the field of health, particularly for lower-income populations and those of African and indigenous descent. These inequalities must be addressed using decisions based on scientific evidence, a greater use of disaggregated data to reveal progress in addressing these inequalities, and with a broader articulation of the health sector with policies that act on the social determinants of health.","Campbell Barr, Epsy; Michael, Marmot",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778463/,490

Impact of COVID-19 on UK Foundation Doctors: Education and Safety,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Despite the significant reductions in under-five mortality, campylobacteriosis has emerged as one of the most common causative agents of bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis in humans. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of Campylobacter species and associated risk factors among children less than 5 years of age in Ethiopia. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library. All identified observational studies reporting the prevalence and determinants of diarrhea among children under 5 years of age in Ethiopia were included. Two authors independently extracted data and analyzed them using STATA Version 13 statistical software. A random-effects model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence and the associations between determinant factors and campylobacteriosis. RESULTS: Out of 166 papers reviewed, 8 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Campylobacter species among children under 5 years of age in Ethiopia was 10% (95% CI: 7, 13). Contact with domestic animals (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.1), illiterate mothers (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.8), consumption of animal products (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.7, 4.5), and status of mothers’ personal hygiene (OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.7, 1.8) were significantly associated with the prevalence of Campylobacter species. CONCLUSION: In our study, Campylobacter species among children under 5 years of age in Ethiopia were significantly high.

Effectiveness of a Treatment Team on Adherence to Health System Guidelines for Hydroxychloroquine Use During Two Phases of the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unmasked the devastating impact of social and health disparities on communities of color. Black race, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbidities have been associated with increased severity of disease and need for mechanical ventilation (MV). We examined socioeconomic variables including social support, highest level of education, median income, housing, food insecurity, and employment status, and poverty rate to determine their impact on the need for MV. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 2,038 adult patients with positive SARS-CoV2 test admitted to four large hospitals within the Henry Ford Health System from March 12-April 24 and followed until May 27, 2020. Collected data included patient demographics, employment status, health insurance status, and comorbidities via Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Census tracts were obtained from patient addresses and used to obtain socioeconomic data from the 2018 American Community Survey and the Food Access Research Atlas. The primary outcome assessed was frequency of MV. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed on prehospital variables to identify independent predictors for mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Patients who required MV were significantly more likely to be male (p=0.0006), black race (p=0.012), and have higher CCI (p< 0.0001) and BMI (p< 0.0001). Using census tract data, patients who required MV lived in neighborhoods with lower median income (p< 0.0001), educational attainment (p< 0.0001), and higher levels of food insecurity (p=0.0007). Multivariate analysis revealed male sex, high BMI, CCI, and lower median income to be independent predictors of need for MV. The remaining results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 [Image: see text] Table 2 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant impact of socioeconomic status on frequency of MV in COVID-19 patients.

Use of CLABSI Prevention Bundle Audits to Decrease CLABSI Rates in COVID Positive ICU Patients in an Acute Care Hospital in New York City During the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID infections in inpatient psychiatry units present unique challenges during the pandemic, including behavioral characteristics of the patients, structural aspect of the unit, type of therapy for the patients. We present COVID outbreaks in psychiatry units in two hospitals in our medical center in Bronx, NY, and describe our mitigation strategies. [Image: see text] METHODS: Hosp A: In the early period of the pandemic in NY, 2 patients in the inpatient psychiatry unit tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. The unit was temporarily closed to new admissions. Hosp B: On 4/1, one of the patients in a 22 bed Psych unit, admitted since 3/10/20, developed fever, cough and tested positive for COVID-19 PCR. Two of her close contacts tested positive for SARS-COV-2 PCR. RESULTS: Hospital A: In total, 5 of the 29 patients (17.2%) in the unit were SARS-CoV-2 positive, all of whom were asymptomatic. Hospital B: Testing of the remaining patients showed positive PCR in 10/14. PCR tests of healthcare workers (HCW) were positive in 13/46. Except for the index patient, all the patients were asymptomatic but 32/46 HCW reported symptoms. One negative patient subsequently turned positive. Infection control and prevention strategies instituted in both hospitals were the same with subtle differences due to dissimilar burden of infection and structure of the units. Table 1 shows the timing of the outbreak and the rapid institution of preventive measures in each of the hospitals. There was still difficulty with patients regarding adherence. Some of the patients refused to stay in isolation and would roam. Compliance with masking and hand hygiene was problematic. Communication was of paramount importance. Multiple meetings were held between the Psychiatry staff, Infection Control and Prevention team, executive leadership of the hospital. Environmental Services and Engineering were also involved. Communications with the NY State Department of Health occurred frequently. CONCLUSION: Strategies for management of COVID-19 patients in inpatient psychiatric units depends on the density of infected patients in the hospital and in the community. The implementation of practice change may need to be rapidly adjusted depending on the situation and available resources. Contingency plans should be formulated early on.

44084,112. A Quality Management Project of a Midwestern Academic HIV Clinic Operation During COVID-19: Implementation Strategy and Preliminary Outcomes,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The management of the COVID-19 pandemic is hampered by the long delays associated with laboratory PCR testing. In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact and real-world diagnostic accuracy of molecular point-of-care testing (mPOCT) for COVID-19 in hospital. METHODS: We performed a prospective, interventional, non-randomised, controlled study of mPOCT for COVID-19 in adults presenting to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Patients were tested using the QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 at the point-of-care with results delivered to clinical and infection control teams. Control patients were tested using the PHE Rdrp reference assay. The Primary outcome measure was time to result and secondary outcome measures included infection control outcomes and measures of diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Between 20(th) March and 29(th) April 2020 500 patients were tested by POCT and 555 controls, who were tested with laboratory PCR, were identified. Overall 33% were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Median time to results with POCT was 1.7 (1.6 to 1.9) hours versus 21.3 (16.0 to 27.9) hours in the control group (difference of 19.6 hours, 95%CI 19.0 to 20.3; p< 0.0001). Median time to arrival in definitive clinical area (COVID-19 positive or negative ward) was 8.0 (6.0 to 15.0) hours in the POCT group versus 28.8 (23.5 to 38.9) hours in the control group, p< 0.0001. Median time to enrolment into other COVID-19 clinical trials was 1.5 (1 to 3) days in the POCT versus 3.0 (2 to 5) days in the control group, p< 0.0001. Sensitivity of the POCT was 99.4% and specificity was 98.3%. The sensitivity of the laboratory PHE reference RdRp assay was 87.2% and specificity was 98.9%. CONCLUSION: mPOCT was associated with a large reduction in time to results and improvements in infection control measures and patient flow, compared with laboratory PCR. In addition, patients were recruited onto other clinical trials more rapidly with POCT. The QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 panel had high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of COVID-19 compared to laboratory PCR. Resources should be urgently made available to support the widespread implementation of mPOCT in hospitals, in preparation for the second wave. DISCLOSURES: Tristan William.

44105,66. What Worked (And Didn’t Work): A Survey of COVID-19 Response in Michigan Nursing Homes in the Midst of the Pandemic,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Smell loss has been recognized as an important, and potentially early, sign of COVID-19. However, to date smell loss has only been assessed in retrospective, COVID+ cohorts, and largely through self-report. The objective of this study was to implement a daily standardized behavioral test of smell sensitivity in healthcare workers (HCW) to capture changes in smell sensitivity over time and to assess whether these changes occur prior to positive COVID test. METHODS: The study enrolled 500 high-risk COVID-negative HCW during the COVID-19 epidemic in Connecticut, beginning March 28, 2020 (80% F, mean age 38, 58% nurses). Initially, HCW received a daily symptom questionnaire with parosmia screening questions. On April 23 we introduced the “Jiffy”, a daily at-home psychophysical test of smell sensitivity, where olfactory stimuli are sampled and rated for perceived intensity. SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested every three days by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva. Screening Questionnaire for Parosmia [Image: see text] The “Jiffy” Survey and Test [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of the first 500 enrolled HCW, 376 HCW (75%) completed the Jiffy 4528 times (mean 12 times/HCW). 17/500 HCW (3.4%) had a COVID+ test, of which 9/17 (53%) reported smell loss through the Jiffy or the daily symptom survey. 6/9 (67%) reported smell loss that preceded or was concurrent with a COVID+ test. 8/17 COVID+ HCW completed the Jiffy, with 5/8 (63%) reporting reductions in smell versus 42/368 (11%) COVID- HCW (OR=13, 95% CI: 2.4–85, p=.001). COVID+ HCW rated their greatest reduction in smell sensitivity as slight (40%) and severe (60%), versus slight (88%) and moderate (12%) in COVID- HCW. 16/17 COVID+ HCW completed a daily symptom survey (mean 14 times/HCW), with 8/16 (50%) ever reporting parosmia versus 90/466 (19%) of COVID- HCW (OR=4.2, 95% CI: 1.3–13, p=.007). Overall, parosmia was the first reported symptom in 3/13 (23%) COVID+ HCW who reported symptoms. Smell Changes in COVID+ and COVID- HCW Reported in the “Jiffy” Test [Image: see text] Smell Changes in COVID+ and COVID- HCW Reported in Daily Symptom Questionnaire [Image: see text] Smell Changes among COVID+ HCW by Day, Relative to Day of Positive PCR Test [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We conducted a prospective study of smell testing in a population at high risk for COVID-19 using two parallel approaches. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of at-home smell testing for assessing parosmia during COVID-19, in some cases even prior to a positive PCR result. Given the urgent need for widespread, low-cost, non-invasive testing for COVID-19, we are now developing an easy-to-use app to distribute this survey more widely to high-risk populations.

44118,400. Secondary Infections in COVID-19 Patients Receiving Tocilizumab in a Community Hospital,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among infectious disease (ID) physicians during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: Using an online-based survey link sent via text message and email, we conducted a survey from April 21 to 25, 2020, targeting all ID physicians currently working in ID (n = 265). The questionnaire was based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, and information was collected on factors protecting against psychological distress and difficulties in relation to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 265 ID physicians, 115 (43.3%) responded, showing burnout (97, 90.4%), depression (20, 17.4%), anxiety (23, 20.0%), and stress (5, 4.3%). There were no differences in terms of distress between ID physicians who were directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 or not (Table 1). Greater than 50% of physicians valued their work and felt recognized by others, whereas < 10% indicated that sufficient human and financial support and private time had been provided during the outbreak. The most challenging issues concerned a lack of human resources for COVID-19 treatment or infection control, a shortage of personal protective equipment or airborne infection isolation rooms, pressure for research, and lack of guidelines for COVID-19 management (Figure 1).

44127,548. Baseline characteristics associated with clinical improvement and mortality in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The prevention and treatment of bacterial infections is a human health challenge. A disadvantage of antibiotics is that they often kill beneficial commensal, bacteria in addition to, pathogenic bacteria. Indiscriminate killing disrupts the homeostasis between commensal bacteria and the host gut epithelium allowing colonization of the gut by pathogenic bacteria and increases susceptibility to infections. This research was done to develop a non-antibiotic modality to prevent bacterial infections by growing, rather than killing, commensal bacteria in the gut. Gut commensal bacteria grown on carbohydrates produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that support gut homeostasis maintenance and promote resistance to bacterial colonization. SCFAs have direct and indirect effects on the gut and lung mucosal immune system. They have also been linked to respiratory viral infection reduction and shown to influence macrophage function to mitigate pro-inflammatory neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. METHODS: A library of over 1,500 synthetic proprietary glycans, termed Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™), was synthesized using different chemical and enzymatic approaches. An ex vivo platform using fecal bacterial communities from human subjects was devised to screen MMTs for their abilities to deplete pathogenic bacteria, and modulate multiple aspects of bacterial metabolism. RESULTS: KB109 was identified based on its ability to reduce the relative abundance of a diversity of pathogens including clinically relevant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in human fecal communities. KB109 also increased the relative abundance of prevalent commensal bacteria. Monoculture experiments demonstrated that KB109 promotes the growth of commensal bacteria, but not pathogens. Ex vivo screening revealed that KB109 consistently increased SFCA production across multiple fecal communities. CONCLUSION: KB109 represents an appealing activity profile and offers an opportunity to prevent enteric and systemic bacterial infections by promoting gut homeostasis and colonization resistance, and ameliorating respiratory viral infections by stimulating immune homeostasis. KB109 is under evaluation in two COVID-19 clinical studies.

44132,567. Use of corticosteroids and COVID-19 mortality in patients with pneumonia in a tertiary care center in México City,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The Bronx (BX) is an urban city with the most poverty, least educated population and poorest health outcomes among 62 counties in New York State. Unsurprisingly, BX has the highest rates of COVID-19 diagnoses across New York City (NYC). Lincoln Medical Center (LMC) is part of the NYC health and hospital system (NYC H+H) and has the highest COVID-19 admissions in BX and the second-highest across NYC. Herein we report our preliminary data on mortality rate (MR) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and discuss the disproportionate of MR across NYC. METHODS: On 26 April 2020, we acquired the total number of hospitalized COVID-19 and deaths and mechanically ventilated (MV) COVID-19 and death from LMC and all other NYC H+H. Scheffe test was used to determine MR differences. The P-value (p) < 0.005 was set as a statistically significant threshold. RESULTS: MR of our hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 31%, which is higher than that of Man (24%, p 0.001). However, LMC has a high proportion of MV COVID-19 (local and transferred cases). Sub-group analysis of non-MV COVID-19 showed LMC MR (6%) is lower than Brooklyn (BL) (17%, p 0.00) and Queens (Qu) (17%, p 0.00) and didn’t differ from Man NYC H+H centers (8%, p 0.68). Analysis of MR among MV patients between LMC and other NYC H+H centers across four boroughs did not discover any differences. Hospitalized COVID-19 MR from all NYC H+H centers in BX (28%) did not differ from Man (24%, p 0.7) and Qu (28%, p 0.99). Interestingly, we found that MR is the highest in BL (33%). Moreover, MR of non-MV COVID-19 was higher in BL (17%) and Qu (17%) than BX (10%) and Man (8%) NYC H+H centers. We hypothesize this may result partly from the tense and shortage of health care resources in these two boroughs, especially, at the beginning of pandemic so some critical patients may not receive adequate care such as delaying intubation. Further research investigating reasons for this disproportion will help in developing the best available care plan for the ongoing crisis.

MR of non-MV COVID-19 in BX is lower than BL and Qu. The studies determining the reasons underlying this disproportionate would be worthwhile.

44150,401. Short Term Outcomes in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Related to COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: American Indians have an increased risk of serious complications from COVID-19 due to the high prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and asthma. To date, there has been limited analysis of COVID-19 in the AI population. This study describes the characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from a well-defined AI population in eastern Arizona. Additionally, we explored the impact of early referral via contact tracing versus those who self-presented. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were completed for patients hospitalized for COVID from March 29 to May 16, 2020. Summary statistics were used to describe demographics, symptoms, pre-existing conditions, and hospitalization data. RESULTS: We observed 447 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in 71 (15.9%) hospitalizations over a 7-week period and a hospitalization rate of 159 per 1,000 persons. Of the 50 hospitalizations reviewed sequentially, 56% were female, median age of 55 (IQR 44–65). Median number of days hospitalized was 4 (2–6), with 16% requiring intensive care unit support, 15% intubated, 12% readmitted, and 10% deceased. 67% had an epidemiological link, and 32% had an emergency department or outpatient clinic visit within 7 days of hospitalization. All patients were symptomatic; the most common symptoms were cough (90%), shortness of breath (78%), and subjective fever (66%). 86% of patients had a pre-existing condition; the most common pre-existing conditions were diabetes (66%), obesity (58%), and hypertension (52%, Figure 1). All patients had elevated LDH, 94% had elevated CRP, 86% had elevated d-dimer, and 40% had lymphopenia; only 10% had an elevated WBC count and 26% had thrombocytopenia (Table 1). 26% of the patients were referred in by the tracing team (Table 2). Analysis of 500 hospitalizations will be available in October 2020. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Most AI patients hospitalized had a pre-existing condition, symptoms of cough or shortness of breath, and elevated LDH, CRP, and d-dimer. More research is needed to understand the patterns of COVID-19 related disease in vulnerable populations, like AI/AN, and to examine the utility of early referral by contact tracing teams in rural settings which may guide future tracing strategies.

The direct, indirect and structural causes are analyzed. Specifically, precarious employment in residences over the past decade was analyzed as one of the main explanatory causes of the structural crisis of nursing homes. The theoretical focus of analysis is the comprehensive and person-centered care (CPCC) model based on the autonomy of people and the centrality of their rights. The methodology combines a quantitative analysis of employment and a qualitative analysis of documents and debates. The study concludes by proposing a comprehensive reform of long-term care that includes both a change in residential care in the form of small cohabitation units and reinforcement of care in the home and the community as a growing preference for the elderly population. An optimal combination of residential and home care is the basic proposal of this work.","Gallego, Vicente Marbán; Codorniu, Julia Montserrat; Cabrero, Gregorio Rodríguez",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020261.33872020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533836/,490

METHODS A prospective randomised controlled study was conducted in a provincial maternity and child hospital in China. Participants were randomised regarding education to the intervention group (WeChat) and the control group (leaflets). The nutritional status and complications of the patients were compared after intervening for 1 month. RESULTS Nutrient status comparison at 1 month after intervention showed that the body weight, head circumference, haemoglobin, albumin and pre-albumin of the WeChat group were significantly higher than those of the leaflet group (P < 0.05). The STRONGkids score of the WeChat group was significantly lower than that of the leaflet group (P < 0.05). The incidence of feeding intolerance and respiratory tract infection in the WeChat group was significantly lower than that found in the leaflet group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of liver insufficiency and jaundice between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Providing pre-operative feeding and care guidance for parents of infants with non-restrictive VSD, via remote health education through WeChat, can effectively improve nutritional status and reduce the risk of malnutrition and feeding complications.","Lin, Ze-Wei; Liu, Jian-Feng; Xie, Wen-Peng; Zhang, Qi-Liang; Cao, Hua; Chen, Qiang",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057253/,490
64566,MRI characteristics in acute ischemic stroke patients with preceding direct oral anticoagulant therapy as compared to vitamin K antagonists.,2020-03-11,"BACKGROUND Mechanical ventilation is a life-support therapy that can be associated with respiratory muscle dysfunction that may perturb the weaning process. The timed inspiratory effort (TIE) index is a recently proposed weaning index that has been reported to be effective in predicting successful weaning. We sought to analyze the respiratory muscle groups involved with the TIE index measurement utilizing the surface electromyography (sEMG). METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study including 46 mechanically ventilated subjects. The variable analyzed with sEMG was the root mean square (RMS) for correlation with the degree of recruitment of motor units and strength. The data were obtained along the 60 s of the TIE index measurement and analyzed in each one of the 3 20-s intervals. Pooled and individual muscle RMS values were analyzed comparing success and failure groups. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS The median (interquartile range) age of the participants was 80 (71-87) y. The pooled sEMG data showed that muscle strength increased over time, following the profile observed for maximum inspiratory pressure, irrespective of the analyzed group. However, in line with the findings regarding maximum inspiratory pressure, the RMS medians were statistically higher at every 20-s interval in the success group. Diaphragm strength increased over time, with values reaching statistically significant differences at the end of the observation period, but only in the success group. In addition, diaphragm strength was statistically higher during the whole test in the success group. Finally, there was a substantial increase in sternocleidomastoid strength over time after 40 s of observation, which was not observed in the scalene muscles. CONCLUSIONS Subjects succeeding in a weaning trial had higher muscle strength, confirmed in the pooled and the individual sEMG analysis. A vigorous diaphragm with low fatigue potential seems essential for successful weaning; the sternocleidomastoid may also be of importance in this regard.","de Souza Costa, Helson Lino Leite; de Souza, Leonardo Cordeiro; da Silva Neto, Arthur Evangelista; da Silva Guimarães, Bruno Leonardo; de Azeredo, Leandro Miranda; Godoy, Marcos David Parada; Lugon, Jocemir Ronaldo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.07465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723857/,490

The objective of this study was to quantify the frequency of barriers encountered by patients seeking to fill buprenorphine prescriptions from pharmacies in United States (US) counties with high opioid-related mortality. METHODS To characterize buprenorphine availability, we conducted a telephone audit (""secret shopper"") study using a standardized script in two randomly selected pharmacies (one chain, one independent) in US counties reporting higher than average opioid overdose rates. Availability across pharmacy type (chain versus independent), county characteristics (rurality, region, overdose rate), and day of week were analyzed using univariate tests of categorical data. Independent predictors of buprenorphine availability were then identified using a multivariable binomial regression model. RESULTS Among 921 pharmacies contacted (467 chain, 454 independent), 73 % were in urban counties and 42 % were in Southern states. Of these pharmacies, 675 (73 %) reported being able to dispense buprenorphine. There were 183 (20 %) pharmacies that indicated they would not dispense buprenorphine. Independent pharmacies (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.59; 95 % CI 1.21-2.08) and pharmacies in Southern states (aPR 2.06; 95 % CI 1.43-2.97) were significantly more likely to restrict buprenorphine. CONCLUSIONS In US counties with high overdose mortality rates, one in five pharmacies indicated they would not dispense buprenorphine. Buprenorphine access limitations were more common among independent pharmacies and those in Southern states. Pharmacy-directed interventions may be necessary to ensure timely buprenorphine access for patients with opioid use disorder.","Kazerouni, Neda J; Irwin, Adriane N; Levander, Ximena A; Geddes, Jonah; Johnston, Kirbee; Gostanian, Carly J; Mayfield, Baylee S; Montgomery, Brandon T; Graalum, Diana C; Hartung, Daniel M",Drug and alcohol dependence,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932744/,490
82580,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: A Review.,2021-04-09,"It is becoming clear that the manner by which the immune response resolves or contains infection by a pathogen varies according to the tissue that is affected. Unlike many peripheral cell types, CNS neurons are generally non-renewable. Thus, the cytolytic and inflammatory strategies that are effective in controlling infections in the periphery could be damaging if deployed in the CNS. Perhaps for this reason, the immune response to some CNS viral infections favours maintenance of neuronal integrity and non-neurolytic viral control. This modified immune response - when combined with the unique anatomy and physiology of the CNS - provides an ideal environment for the maintenance of viral genomes, including those of RNA viruses. Therefore, it is possible that such viruses can reactivate long after initial viral exposure, contributing to CNS disease.","Miller, Katelyn D; Schnell, Matthias J; Rall, Glenn F",Nature reviews.

METHODS FDG-PET CT scans requested for evaluation of a suspected infection or inflammatory process in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients were analyzed (blinded for the final clinical diagnosis) and compared with clinical follow-up. RESULTS Thirty-five FDG-PET/CT scans performed in 33 ICU patients (28 adults and 5 children), median age 58 years (range 1 month-72 years), were analyzed. Twenty-one FDG-PET/CT scans were true positive. Three FDG-PET/CT scans were considered false positive, in one case leading to additional diagnostic procedures (specificity 79%). Additionally, 11 true negatives were found (sensitivity 100%), leading to an overall accuracy of 91%. CONCLUSIONS FDG-PET/CT scanning is of additional value in the evaluation of suspected infection in critically ill patients in whom conventional diagnostics did not lead to a diagnosis. Apart from the high accuracy, in this study it appeared that, in addition to conventional diagnostic techniques that were routinely performed, a normal FDG-PET/CT ruled out important infections requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy or drainage. Since sensitivity is lower in highly metabolic active tissues (e.g., endocarditis, meningitis), the FDG-PET/CT scan is not suited to detect infections in these tissues.","Simons, Koen S; Pickkers, Peter; Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P; Oyen, Wim J G; van der Hoeven, Johannes G",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-009-1697-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19847397/,490
88061,Short-Term sequelae of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Assessed by CMR.,2021-03-10,"OBJECTIVES To analyze current interventional radiology residency program websites based on validated criteria and highlight areas for improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS ACGME-accredited interventional radiology residency programs were identified from the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) public database, including 91 independent and 89 integrated programs. Program Webpages were then evaluated during September and October 2020 based on the presence of 48 criteria, organized into seven main categories including visibility & communication, program information, curriculum information, faculty description, research, recruitment, and salary and benefits. Programs were also evaluated based on region and research ranking. Additionally, 166 programs with accreditation for Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology (ESIR) were assessed for the presence or absence of ESIR pathway acknowledgement on program webpages. RESULTS The online search yielded information on all integrated programs (89/89, 100%) and 74 independent programs (74/91, 80.3%). For the ESIR programs, the online search for accreditation acknowledgement yielded 108 programs (108/166, 65%) approved for this pathway. Only seven of the 89 integrated programs met at least 75% of the criteria. Of the 91 independent programs, only one met at least 75% of the criteria. On average, integrated programs met more criteria (25, 52%) than independent programs (17, 36%). When comparing programs based on national rank, the visibility & communication category met more criteria on average than the lower ranked programs (integrated =73% vs. 64%, p = 0.01), (independent = 73% vs. 45%, p = 0.01). When comparing programs regionally, statistical significance was found only in the research category (p = 0.01). When comparing the integrated programs with the independent programs for averages in the 7 categories and the total criteria, statistical significance was found in all categories except facility description: visibility & communication (67.5% vs. 53. 7%, p = 0.01), program information (75.7% vs. 58%, p = 0.01), curriculum information (54.8% vs. 31.4, p = 0.01), research (42.5% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.01), recruitment (42.6% vs. 26.8%, p = 0.01), salary & benefits (47.8% vs. 26.8%, p = 0.01), and total criteria (52% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.01. CONCLUSION IR residency programs across the country are proficient in providing curricular, and logistical information online. However, improvement is needed in providing nonacademic highlights unique to programs that can aid in maximizing applicant match and compatibility. The information provided by online resources has the potential to influence residency applicant's program ranking and chosen pathway, particularly during the COVID19 pandemic.","Makary, Mina S; Niedermeier, Marilyn; Grewal, B K; Heilala, Adam; Ahmed, Osman",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.03.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994076/,490
93067,Status of vaccine development for COVID-19.,2020-12-02,"AIMS To ascertain whether in Brucella abortus-infected water buffalo herds, the number of newly infected animals could be reduced by culling superspreaders (the animals secreting > or =10(4) CFU per ml of milk). METHODS AND RESULTS The number of B. abortus present in the milk (CFU per ml) from 500 water buffaloes was measured by the culture. Each animal was tested three times, at one month intervals. The presence or the absence of B. abortus in each milk sample was confirmed by PCR. A majority of infected animals shed the pathogen at a low level (< or =10(3) CFU ml(-1)). However, a few infected individuals (superspreaders) shed large numbers of B. abortus (> or =10(4) CFU ml(-1)). Quantitative PCR of B. abortus positive milk samples gave comparable results to culture. Culling of the superspreaders was sufficient to arrest the spread of infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY The approach described here can reduce significantly the cost of controlling brucellosis. Culture and quantitative PCR tests identify superspreaders and, compared with the serological tests in use to detect brucellosis, provide also a more accurate estimate of the disease incidence.","Capparelli, R; Parlato, M; Iannaccone, M; Roperto, S; Marabelli, R; Roperto, F; Iannelli, D",Journal of applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04177.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19298512/,490

Our aim in this study is to discuss all aspects of approach strategies to ERCP patients whose operation is mandatory during the pandemic period, to draw the future perspective and to summarize the measures that the surgical team should take in terms of their own health and public health. MATERIALS AND METHODS During the pandemic period between 14 March and 31 December 2020, we accepted 270 patients to our ERCP unit. We made our analysis regarding the management of these cases under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. We presented our patients' form of application, application complaints, COVID- 19 contact stories, pre-procedure preparations, and our prevention methods to prevent COVID-19 transmission of the patient and healthcare team during the procedure, and post-procedure patient follow-up methods, and the management of our COVID-19 positive patients before the procedure. RESULTS ERCP was applied to 270 patients. The COVID-19 test of 13 patients was positive before the procedure and they were taken to our COVID-19 isolated service. There was no problem in the anesthesia of patients who had positive COVID-19 PCR test and subsequently underwent ERCP. There was no difference in the discharge time after the ERCP procedure. CONCLUSION COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the management and safety of ERCP units. ERCP procedures should be performed by determining the urgency of patients so that their treatment needs are not delayed. Postponing cases without planning can develop an increased workload in centers offering ERCP and this situation can lead to further delays or negative consequences.","Uğurlu, Esat Taylan; Kaya, Ahmet",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633735/,490

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three surgeons with previous experience in LESS performed 12 nephrectomies in six pigs. In all procedures, a multichannel access device (X-CONE) and a 5-mm extra-long telescope were used. Four sets of prebent instruments with different profiles (S-portal) were tested: Standard (one straight scissors and one curved grasper), Cuschieri, Carus, and Leroy set (each of them consisting of two curved instruments with different configurations). Assessment was performed based on both objective (procedure time; time to manage the pedicle; time to free kidney) and subjective parameters (entry/exit of instruments; triangulation; dissection up/down; dissection lateral; retraction; interdependence). The subjective assessment tool used was a Likert type scale (1 = easy to 5 = prohibitive). The access device was assessed by using objective (time to complete insertion of device after skin incision) and subjective (significant air leakage, movement constraint) parameters. RESULTS Time to insertion of the X-CONE was <1 minute in all the cases. Surgeons reported significant insufflant leakage in 58% of cases. The procedure was completed in 10/12 (83%) cases. Mean operative time was 8.3 ± 4.2 minutes, being lower for the Carus group (4.5 min) and higher for the standard group (13 min). Among the different sets, the standard one obtained the best mean scores for all subjective parameters. CONCLUSIONS X-CONE allows easy abdominal access, and its reusable properties represent cost savings for LESS compared with disposable devices. Prebent instruments might also represent attractive low-cost tools for LESS.","Autorino, Riccardo; Kim, Fernando J; Rane, Abhay; De Sio, Marco; Stein, Robert J; Damiano, Rocco; Micali, Salvatore; Correia-Pinto, Jorge; Kaouk, Jihad H; Lima, Estevão",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21319989/,490

117098,Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome and COVID-19: another novel syndrome?,2021-03-29,"PURPOSE The cemented Exeter V40 stem is known to migrate distally. Several previous studies have reported on the extent of stem migration and its influence on clinical outcome. However, no studies have investigated the influence of stem migration on Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM). METHODS One hundred and twelve total hip arthroplasties (THA) were included in a 2-year follow-up using Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA). Patients were evaluated using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and EQ-5D-3L PROMs. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of stem migration, measured by Maximum Total Point Motion (MTPM), on the 2-year postoperative score (OHS and EQ-5D). Furthermore, the influence of pre-operative PROM, age, gender, acetabular component and BMI was associated with the 2-year postoperative OHS and EQ-5D scores. RESULTS MTPM was a non-significant predictor of the 2-year postoperative OHS (regression coefficient (B) = - 2.38 (CI - 5.44; .69)) and of the 2-year postoperative EQ-5D (B = - .01 (CI - .04; .02)). The only significant predictor of the 2-year postoperative OHS and 2-year postoperative EQ-5D was gender (B = 8.71 (CI 3.52; 13.90)) and (B = .13 (CI .07; .18)), respectively. CONCLUSION Stem migration did not significantly influence PROMs at 2 years post-operatively. Using a patient-focused approach, our results seem to corroborate results reported by previous studies, showing that slow migration of the Exeter V40 stem does not seem to influence the clinical outcome.","Steiner, Daniel K; Drivsholm, Nikolaj S; Buchardt, Sebastian T E; Laursen, Mogens",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00590-021-02937-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763771/,490
117332,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and the Prothrombotic State: Coagulation Profiles and Rotational Thromboelastometry in a MIS-C Cohort.,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND Evidence suggests that cost sharing (i.e.,copayments and deductibles) decreases health expenditures but also reduces essential care. Value-based insurance design (VBID) has been proposed to encourage essential care while controlling health expenditures. Our objective was to estimate the impact of broader diffusion of VBID on US health care benefits and costs. METHODS AND FINDINGS We used a published computer simulation of costs and life expectancy gains from US health care to estimate the impact of broader diffusion of VBID. Two scenarios were analyzed: (1) applying VBID solely to pharmacy benefits and (2) applying VBID to both pharmacy benefits and other health care services (e.g., devices). We assumed that cost sharing would be eliminated for high-value services (<$100,000 per life-year), would remain unchanged for intermediate- or unknown-value services ($100,000-$300,000 per life-year or unknown), and would be increased for low-value services (>$300,000 per life-year). All costs are provided in 2003 US dollars. Our simulation estimated that approximately 60% of health expenditures in the US are spent on low-value services, 20% are spent on intermediate-value services, and 20% are spent on high-value services. Correspondingly, the vast majority (80%) of health expenditures would have cost sharing that is impacted by VBID. With prevailing patterns of cost sharing, health care conferred 4.70 life-years at a per-capita annual expenditure of US$5,688. Broader diffusion of VBID to pharmaceuticals increased the benefit conferred by health care by 0.03 to 0.05 additional life-years, without increasing costs and without increasing out-of-pocket payments. Broader diffusion of VBID to other health care services could increase the benefit conferred by health care by 0.24 to 0.44 additional life-years, also without increasing costs and without increasing overall out-of-pocket payments. Among those without health insurance, using cost saving from VBID to subsidize insurance coverage would increase the benefit conferred by health care by 1.21 life-years, a 31% increase. CONCLUSION Broader diffusion of VBID may amplify benefits from US health care without increasing health expenditures.","Braithwaite, R Scott; Omokaro, Cynthia; Justice, Amy C; Nucifora, Kimberly; Roberts, Mark S",PLoS medicine,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20169114/,490
118885,Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the Tracheobronchial Tree.,2015,"Cervical spinal cord trauma represents more than half of the spinal cord injury (SCI) cases worldwide. Respiratory compromise, as well as severe limb motor deficits, are among the main consequences of cervical lesions. In the present work, a Gellan Gum (GG)-based hydrogel modified with GRGDS peptide, together with adipose tissue-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), was used as a therapeutic strategy after a C2 hemisection SCI in rats. Hydrogel or cells alone, and a group without treatment, were also tested. Four weeks after injury, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were performed to assess functional phrenic motor neuron (PhMN) innervation of the diaphragm; no differences were observed amongst groups, confirming that the PhMN pool located between C3 and C5 was not affected by the C2 injury or by the treatments. In the same line, the vast majority of diaphragmatic neuromuscular junctions remained intact. Five weeks post-injury, inspiratory bursting of the affected ipsilateral hemidiaphragm was evaluated through EMG recordings of dorsal, medial and ventral subregions of the muscle. All treatments significantly increased EMG amplitude at the ventral portion in comparison to untreated animals, but only the combinatorial group presented increased EMG amplitude at the medial portion of the hemidiaphragm. No differences were observed in forelimb motor function, neither in markers for axonal regrowth (neuronal tracers), astrogliosis (GFAP) and inflammatory cells (CD68). Moreover, using Von Frey testing of mechanical allodynia, it was possible to find a significant effect of the group combining hydrogel and cells on hypersensitivity; rats with a SCI displayed an increased response of the contralateral forelimb to a normally innocuous mechanical stimulus, but after treatment with the combinatorial therapy this behavior was reverted almost to the levels of uninjured controls. These results suggest that our therapeutic approach may have beneficial effects on both diaphragmatic recovery and sensory function.","Gomes, Eduardo D; Ghosh, Biswarup; Lima, Rui; Goulão, Miguel; Moreira-Gomes, Tiago; Martins-Macedo, Joana; Urban, Mark W; Wright, Megan C; Gimble, Jeffrey M; Sousa, Nuno; Silva, Nuno A; Lepore, Angelo C; Salgado, António J",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984278/,490

157769,Rapid development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome after abatacept treatment in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,2020-04-06,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), is a highly communicable disease with the lungs as the major pathological target. Although SARS likely stems from overexuberant host inflammatory responses, the exact mechanism leading to the detrimental outcome in patients remains unknown. Pulmonary macrophages (Mphi), airway epithelium, and dendritic cells (DC) are key cellular elements of the host innate defenses against respiratory infections. While pulmonary Mphi are situated at the luminal epithelial surface, DC reside abundantly underneath the epithelium. Such strategic locations of these cells within the airways make it relevant to investigate their likely impact on SARS pathogenesis subsequent to their interaction with infected lung epithelial cells. To study this, we established highly polarized human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells by using the Transwell culture system. Here we report that supernatants harvested from the apical and basolateral domains of infected Calu-3 cells are potent in modulating the intrinsic functions of Mphi and DC, respectively. They prompted the production of cytokines by both Mphi and DC and selectively induced CD40 and CD86 expression only on DC. However, they compromised the abilities of the DC and Mphi in priming naïve T cells and phagocytosis, respectively. We also identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 as key SARS-CoV-induced epithelial cytokines capable of inhibiting the T-cell-priming ability of DC. Taken together, our results provide insights into the molecular and cellular bases of the host antiviral innate immunity within the lungs that eventually lead to an exacerbated inflammatory cascades and severe tissue damage in SARS patients.","Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Hill, Terence; Li, Kui; Peters, Clarence J; Tseng, Chien-Te K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01792-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19004938/,490

METHODS DEFINITIVE LE, a US/European multicenter study, assessed the effectiveness of directional atherectomy using SilverHawk/TurboHawk systems for treatment of peripheral artery disease in the superficial femoral, popliteal, and infrapopliteal arteries. Of the 800 patients enrolled in the study, only the 598 claudicant patients (mean age 69.5±10.4 years; 336 men) who were classified at baseline as Rutherford category 1-3 were eligible for this subset analysis. Of these, 46.8% (280/598) had diabetes. Follow-up to 12 months included duplex ultrasound examination, functional assessments, and adverse event evaluations. Independent angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories assessed primary patency and secondary endpoints; a clinical events committee adjudicated adverse events. RESULTS Although diabetics had significantly more baseline comorbidities, 12-month primary patency (77.0%) was no different than for nondiabetics (77.9%; superiority p=0.98; noninferiority p<0.001) across all anatomic territories treated. Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was no different between diabetics (83.8%) and nondiabetics (87.5%) overall (p=0.19) or by lesion locations. Secondary clinical outcomes (Rutherford category, ankle-brachial index, and walking impairment) improved at 12 months for both diabetics and nondiabetics. CONCLUSION Noninferior 12-month patency rates demonstrate that directional atherectomy is an effective treatment in diabetic as well as nondiabetic claudicants. Directional atherectomy remains an attractive treatment option, improving luminal diameters without stents, which preserves future treatment options for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with progressive, diffuse vascular disease.","Garcia, Lawrence A; Jaff, Michael R; Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Zeller, Thomas; Bosarge, Christopher; Kamat, Suraj; McKinsey, James F",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815599550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26250748/,490

Such tools and strategies are of value to apheresis medicine (AM) practitioners if they improve delivery of patient care, enhance safety during a therapeutic apheresis (TA) intervention, facilitate care access, advance technical capabilities of apheresis devices, and/or elevate quality performance within TA programs. In the past several years, healthcare delivery systems' adoption of telecommunication technologies has been fostered by organizational financial and quality improvement objectives. More recently, adoption of telehealth technologies has been catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic as these technologies enhance both patient and provider safety in an era of social distancing. These changes will also influence the delivery of TA services which now can be generally viewed in a tripartite model format comprised of traditional hospital-based fixed site locales, mobile TA operations and lately an evolving telemedicine remote management model now reffered to as telapheresis (TLA).

In areas of high enteropathogen burden, alterations in gut barrier function and subsequent inflammatory effects are observable but remain poorly characterised. Environmental enteropathy (EE)-a condition that affects both gut morphology and function and is characterised by blunted villi, inflammation and increased permeability-is thought to play a role in impaired linear growth (stunting) and severe acute malnutrition. However, the lack of tools to quantitatively characterise gut functional capacity has hampered both our understanding of gut pathogenesis in undernutrition and evaluation of gut-targeted therapies to accelerate nutritional recovery. Here we survey the technology landscape for potential solutions to improve assessment of gut function, focussing on devices that could be deployed at point-of-care in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We assess the potential for technological innovation to assess gut morphology, function, barrier integrity and immune response in undernutrition, and highlight the approaches that are currently most suitable for deployment and development.

Data on the socioeconomic factors affecting malnutrition in the under-age population of Sub-Saharan Africa brought by the COVID-19 pandemic remain limited. This paper assesses socioeconomic factors of malnutrition in relation with COVID-19 and potential mitigating measures. Methods: A scoping review of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from March 11, 2020, to May 1, 2021, was conducted. The included studies focused on COVID-19, children malnutrition, and Sub-Saharan Africa and adhered to the PRISMA guideline. Results: Among 73 total screened articles, 15 studies filled the inclusion criteria. The identified socioeconomic factors leading to malnutrition in children were reduction in average income or increase in unemployment rate, access to healthcare and food supplements, disrupted food supply chains and increased prices of food products, pauses in humanitarian responses, and reduced access to school-based meals. Potential mitigation measures were food subsidies, food price control measures, the identification of new vulnerable groups and the implementation of financial interventions. Conclusion: Malnutrition amongst Sub-Saharan African children due to COVID-19 is a result of a combination of multiple socioeconomic factors. To stabilize household purchasing power and eventually malnutrition in children in SSA, a combined strategy of initial detection of newly developing vulnerable groups and efficient, rapid financial assistance through mobile phone transfers was suggested. These strategies were proposed in combination with other economical models.","Sesito, P.; Rodriguez Velasquez, S.; Orel, E.; Keiser, O.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.21.21260929v1?rss=1,490

Yet, no molecular atlas of the human brain vasculature exists. Here, we develop Vessel Isolation and Nuclei Extraction for Sequencing (VINE-seq) to profile the major human brain vascular and perivascular cell types through 143,793 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 25 hippocampus and cortex samples of 17 control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. We identify brain region-enriched pathways and genes divergent between humans and mice, including those involved in disease. We describe the principles of human arteriovenous organization, recapitulating a gradual endothelial and punctuated mural cell continuum; but discover that many zonation and cell-type markers differ between species. We discover two subtypes of human pericytes, marked by solute transport and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization; and define perivascular versus meningeal fibroblast specialization. In AD, we observe a selective vulnerability of ECM-maintaining pericytes and gene expression patterns implicating dysregulated blood flow. With an expanded survey of brain cell types, we find that 30 of the top 45 AD GWAS genes are expressed in the human brain vasculature, confirmed in situ. Vascular GWAS genes map to endothelial protein transport, adaptive immune, and ECM pathways. Many are microglia-specific in mice, suggesting an evolutionary transfer of AD risk to human vascular cells.

171780,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and complete atrioventricular block: What have we learned so far and where do we go from here?,2021,"IntroductionPatients with severe mental illness experience physical health inequities. They are less likely to receive preventative care and adequate treatment for physical illnesses. Physical health screening of patients receiving antipsychotics is usually carried out every six months. This comprises screening bloodwork and ECGs, and the sharing of results with family physicians.ObjectivesWe sought to investigate whether the pandemic affected the receipt of routine physical health screening in patients managed by an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Service.MethodsA comprehensive chart review was performed on 62 ACT patients. We compared the receipt of screening bloodwork and ECGs from March—December 2020 to the same period in 2019. Results were analyzed using McNemar’s Chi square test with Yates’ correction.ResultsPatients were less likely to have received an ECG during the pandemic period. 69% received an ECG from March—December 2019 versus 42% from March—December 2020 (χ2= 7.76, p<0.01). Similarly, patients were less likely to have received screening bloodwork during the pandemic period (69% vs. 50%, Χ2= 4.32, p<0.05). Qualitative discussion with ACT staff regarding the 39 patients who had not received an ECG and/or bloodwork during the pandemic period revealed system-related (8%), patient-related (23%), and Covid-related (69%) barriers to screening.

However, existing plotting packages rely on relative positioning and sizing of plots, which is often sufficient for exploratory analysis but is poorly suited for the creation of publication-quality multi-panel images inherent to scientific manuscript preparation. We present plotgardener, a coordinate-based genomic data visualization package that offers a new paradigm for multi-plot figure generation in R. Plotgardener allows precise, programmatic control over the placement, aesthetics, and arrangements of plots while maximizing user experience through fast and memory-efficient data access, support for a wide variety of data and file types, and tight integration with the Bioconductor environment. Plotgardener also allows precise placement and sizing of ggplot2 plots, making it an invaluable tool for R users and data scientists from virtually any discipline.

The study includes 46 small and medium-sized towns in Hungary. The methodology of the study is mainly provided by a model that can be used for this purpose;however, the results obtained with the traditional regression method are compared with the results of another, more complex estimation method, the artificial neural network, which has the advantage of being able to use different types of models. The focus of our article is on methodological alignment, not necessarily the discovery of new results. Certain demographic characteristics significantly determine the energy demand of a household sector in a municipality. In this case, as the ratio of people aged 60 or over within a city rises by 1%, the urban household average energy consumption decreases by 61 kilowatt hours, and when it rises by 1%, the amount of pollutants expelled from urban households' average energy consumption may decrease by 22.8745 kg. The research area of our paper was greatly influenced by the availability of the statistical data.

Methods: We tracked testing programs reported by 1,159 Canadian and 1,081 international employers across sectors from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. We analyzed trends in uptake of testing programs, including over time and by workplace setting. Results: 9.5% (n=110) of Canadian employers and 24.6% (n=266) of international employers tracked reported testing. The prevalence of reported testing programs was less than 20% in some settings associated with high risk of transmission including retail and customer-facing environments, and indoor and mixed blue collar workplaces. Conclusions: Publicly-available data suggest that fewer employers are testing than indicated by surveys. Workplace safety in high-risk workplaces could be further improved by implementing testing strategies that deploy both screening and diagnostic tests.","Duarte, N.; D'Mello, S.; Duarte, N.

189052,Learning needs in a medical curriculum in Hong Kong.,2011,"BACKGROUND Although only a small percentage of patients with COVID-19 deteriorate to a critical condition, because of the associated high mortality rate and the sheer number of cases, it imposes a tremendous burden on the society and unprecedented strains the health care resources. Albeit lung is the primary organ involved resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), many patients additionally present with secondary multiorgan failure. Unfortunately, there is no definitive or curative treatment for this condition, and the management has been predominantly confined to supportive care, which necessitates an urgent need for novel therapies. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has a vast array of preclinical data and early, preliminary clinical data that suggests its potential to regenerate and restore the function of damaged tissues and organs. To date, there has been no review of all the clinical trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy in organ failure commonly seen in seriously complicated COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of MSC therapy in managing multiorgan failure, utilizing currently available literature. STUDY DESIGN A review of human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing the role of MSC therapy in managing multiorgan failure. METHODS PubMed, Cochrane Library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google Scholar, and prior systematic reviews and reference lists were utilized in the literature search from 1990 through May 2020. Studies that included embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, differentiated MSCs into specific lineage cells, and hematopoietic stem cells were excluded. Trials with intraorgan infiltration of MSC were also excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome evaluated the improvement in clinical assessment scores and indices of organ function. The secondary outcome assessed the safety of MSC therapy in the clinical trials. RESULTS Based on search criteria, 12 studies were found for lung, 52 for heart, 23 for liver, 16 for stroke, and 9 for kidney. Among the 6 studies that specifically assessed the effectiveness of MSC therapy in ARDS, 4 showed positive outcomes. Forty-one of the 52 trials that examined ischemic and nonischemic heart failure reported beneficial effects. Twenty of 23 trials for liver failure from different etiologies revealed favorable outcomes. Nine out of the 15 studies evaluating stroke had satisfactory effects. However, only 3 out of the 9 studies for kidney failure showed positive results. Nonexpanded bone marrow mononuclear cells were used in most of the negative studies. The incidence of disease worsening or major complications was extremely rare from MSC therapy. LIMITATIONS Among the studies evaluated, although there were many RCTs, there were also numerous case series. Additionally, most recruited a small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS MSC therapy seems to be promising to treat multiorgan failure from COVID-19. More studies are urgently needed to assess both safety and efficacy.","Atluri, Sairam; Manocha, Vivek; Boddu, Navneet; Bhati, Sachi; Syed, Zaid; Diwan, Sudhir",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942796/,490

Their presence in air is the result of dispersal from a site of colonization or growth. The health effects of bio-aerosols including infectious diseases, acute toxic effects, allergies and cancer coupled with the threat of bioterrorism and SARS have led to increased awareness on the importance of bio-aerosols. The evaluation of bio-aerosols includes use of variety of methods for sampling depending on the concentration of microorganisms expected. There have been problems in developing standard sampling methods, in proving a causal relationship and in establishing threshold limit values for exposures due to the complexity of composition of bio-aerosols, variations in human response to their exposure and difficulties in recovering microorganisms. Currently bio-aerosol monitoring in hospitals is carried out for epidemiological investigation of nosocomial infectious diseases, research into airborne microorganism spread and control, monitoring biohazardous procedures and use as a quality control measure. In India there is little awareness regarding the quality of indoor air, mould contamination in indoor environments, potential source for transmission of nosocomial infections in health care facilities. There is an urgent need to undertake study of indoor air, to generate baseline data and explore the link to nosocomial infections. This article is a review on composition, sources, modes of transmission, health effects and sampling methods used for evaluation of bio-aerosols, and also suggests control measures to reduce the loads of bio-aerosols.","Srikanth, Padma; Sudharsanam, Suchithra; Steinberg, Ralf",Indian journal of medical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974481/,490

The latest published developments in this area are discussed as well as recent publications regarding the continuing debates on the ethics of xenotransplantation and the safeguards that should be imposed to assure the minimization of risk to the patient and to human societies. RECENT FINDINGS Several laboratories are concentrating on the development of genetically manipulated donor pigs in order to bypass the immunological barriers against transplantation of porcine organs and cells into humans. Preliminary experiments with these new pig strains suggest that this strategy has a high likelihood of success with respect to hyperacute rejection. Ethical considerations have been extended to the establishment of regulatory, legal, and ethical frameworks that will be necessary to minimize the risk of xenotransplantation to the recipients, their families, and to the worldwide community. SUMMARY Xenotransplantation, because of the complexity of the medical, ethical and legal issues, will likely remain a controversial issue. If the scientific problems are solved, the decision to proceed with clinical application of this technique will depend on a collective decision guided by ethical, regulatory, and legal frameworks established by consensus.","George, James F",Current opinion in cardiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16470151/,490

Demonstrating value to administrators is an increasingly important function of the hospital epidemiologist because healthcare executives are faced with many demands and shrinking budgets. Aware of the difficulties that face local infection control programs, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) Board of Directors appointed a task force to draft this evidence-based guideline to assist hospital epidemiologists in justifying and expanding their programs. In Part 1, we describe the basic steps needed to complete a business-case analysis for an individual institution. A case study based on a representative infection control intervention is provided. In Part 2, we review important basic economic concepts and describe approaches that can be used to assess the financial impact of infection prevention, surveillance, and control interventions, as well as the attributable costs of specific healthcare-associated infections. Both parts of the guideline aim to provide the hospital epidemiologist, infection control professional, administrator, and researcher with the tools necessary to complete a thorough business-case analysis and to undertake an outcome study of a nosocomial infection or an infection control intervention.","Perencevich, Eli N; Stone, Patricia W; Wright, Sharon B; Carmeli, Yehuda; Fisman, David N; Cosgrove, Sara E",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17933084/,490
191716,Spatial clustering of SARS in Hong Kong.,2009,"The COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, has generated worldwide concern due to its effect on the health of the population and the potential health collapse. The strategy of ""flattening the curve"" through social distancing made it possible to adapt the resources of the health system to patients with COVID-19, but results in other areas of health could not be predicted. The objective of this work was to analyze the consequences of the pandemic on liver transplantation in general and for hepatocarcinoma (HCC). The following studies were carried out: a) a retrospective analysis using data from the CRESI / INCUCAI to compare admission to the waiting list, mortality on the list, donation and liver transplantation from 03/20 to 08/15, 2019 and the same period in 2020, and b) a survey of the transplant centers with the highest transplant activity to assess the effect of the measures taken in different institutional and regional situations. The first analysis showed a 55% decrease in liver transplants, with a similar reduction in donation and admission to the liver waiting list; while HCC transplantation rose from 10% in 2019 to 22% in 2020. The second analysis showed that the occupancy rate of beds by COVID-19 patients / week was variable: from 0.4% to 42.0%. The number of surgeries, hepato-bilio-pancreatic, resection of HCC and liver transplantation, were reduced by 47%, 49%, 31% and 36% respectively. The reduction in transplant activity mainly affected centers with high occupancy due to COVID-19.

Eighty-eight percent showed negative alpha-galactosidase and hippurate reactions, but a positive beta-glucosidase reaction. Two isolates were hippurate positive with a negative beta-glucosidase reaction. One additional German isolate diverged by showing a positive indole reaction in combination with a positive hippurate reaction. Sequencing of 16S rDNA indicated that the hippurate-positive isolates belonged to the species Brachyspira pilosicoli. Four representative isolates were examined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with six reference strains and five porcine isolates of Brachyspira spp. The canine isolates clustered together in the PFGE analysis.

Limited data exists on Indian experience. In a tertiary care hospital situated in South India, we analysed the incidence, clinical profile and outcomes of patients diagnosed with AKI due to COVID-19. METHODS Retrospective data of Adult cases admitted with COVID-19 over a 8 month period from April - November 2020 was collected. Incidence, Demographics, Clinical profile, Management and Outcomes of COVID-19 associated AKI were analysed. Primary outcome was In- hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Dialysis Requirement and Renal Recovery. RESULTS 52 (7%) out of a total 718 patients with COVID-19 developed AKI. Mean Age was 58 years (IQR 51-69) with a striking male predominance of 92%.(Male:Female -9.4:1) (P< 0.001). Co morbidities seen were Diabetes in 38 (73%) and Hypertension in 31(59%) and Coronary Artery Disease in 17(32%). Fever with myalgia was seen in 29 (46%), Respiratory symptoms in 31(59%), Oliguria in 26(50%) and Diarrhea in 2 (3%) patients. At admission, Hypoxemia and Hypotension were seen in 27 (51%) and 16 (30%) patients respectively. Urinalysis revealed > 2+ dipstick Proteinuria in 24 (46%) and Microscopic hematuria in 16(34%) patients. 25 (48%) were admitted in Stage 3 AKI with a mean S.Creatinine level of 4.4 + 3.4 mg/dl. CT chest showed > 50% lung involvement in 23 patients (44%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 20(38%). Hemodialysis was required in 12 (23%). The median duration of hospitalisation was 10 + 5 days. Primary Outcome of Mortality occurred in 44% of AKI cohort in comparison to 7% in Non AKI cohort (Relative Risk[RR]6.2; 95% Confidence Interval[CI], 4.1 to 9.4) (P= 0.001). Hypoxemia [RR,3.76;95% CI,1.4-9.5], Hypotension [RR 2.54; CI,1.5-4 ], Low Serum albumin [RR1.6;CI,1.1 - 2.3] and Requirement for mechanical ventilation [RR,11.3; CI, 2.9 - 23 ] were significant risk factors for mortality. All 5 patients who required both mechanical ventilation and Dialysis died. 31 patients (59%) were treated with Remdesivir therapy without survival benefit. Significantly higher C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin -6, D-Dimer levels and lower serum albumin levels were seen in those who died. Among the 29 patients who survived, the estimated GFR (e GFR) had recovered in 12 (41%) at discharge. After further followup of 4-6 weeks, the total number of patients who recovered renal function rose to 21 (72%). CONCLUSION Mortality in COVID associated AKI stood at 44%. Multiple factors contributed to high mortality such as Severe disease with hypotension and extensive pulmonary involvement, High Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio, Absolute Monocyte Count, inflammatory markers, d-Dimer and low serum albumin. It was encouraging to note that 72% of survivors recovered renal function by 4-6 weeks after discharge from hospital which means that it is worth the struggle to treat AKI in COVID-19.","Sampathkumar,; Hanumaiah, Harsha; Rajiv, Andrew; Kumar, Shakthi; Sampathkumar, Dwarak; Kumar, Senthil; Kumar, Hitesh; Karthikeyan,",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472780/,490

Our experience as clinical advisers in the Victorian Department of Human Services Emergency Operations Centre suggests the following: Case definitions may change frequently, and will tend to become more clinically specific over time. Early in a pandemic, laboratory diagnosis plays a critical role in case finding and pathogen identification. Later in the pandemic, standardised case management applied to well crafted case definitions should reduce reliance on the diagnostic laboratory in clinical management. The diagnostic laboratory will remain critical to monitoring disease surveillance, pathogen virulence, and drug susceptibility. Medical logistics will continue to challenge pandemic managers as the health sector struggles to do the most good for the greatest number of people.

Currently, facility engineers and designers of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems have few analytical tools to estimate a room's leakage area and establish an appropriate flow differential (DeltaQ) in hospitals, shelters, and other facilities where communicable diseases are present. An accurate estimate of leakage area and selection of DeltaQ is essential for ensuring that there is negative pressure (i.e., pressure differential [DeltaP]) between an AIIR and adjoining areas. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers evaluated the relationship between DeltaQ and DeltaP in 67 AIIRs across the United States and in simulated AIIR. Data gathered in the simulated AIIR was used to develop an empirical model describing the relationship between DeltaQ, DeltaP, and leakage area. Data collected in health care facilities showed that the model accurately predicted the leakage area 44 of 48 times. Statistical analysis of the model and experimental validation showed that the model effectively estimated the actual leakage area from -39% to +22% with 90% confidence. The NIOSH model is an effective, cost-cutting tool that can be used by HVAC engineers and designers to estimate leakage area and select an appropriate DeltaQ in AIIRs to reduce the airborne transmission of disease.","Hayden, Charles S; Earnest, G Scott; Jensen, Paul A",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237025/,490

TCV was detected in experimentally infected turkeys as early as day 1 postexposure (PE) by each of the four detection procedures. TCV was detected as late as day 35 PE by FA or IP and days 42 and 49 PE by VI and RT-PCR, respectively. With VI as a reference, sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were 93% and 92%, respectively; specificity of both FA and IP was 96%, and sensitivities were 69% and 61%, respectively. Each of the examined procedures was highly specific, but the RT-PCR procedure was also highly sensitive. These findings demonstrate the utility of both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR for detection of TCV.

Evaluation of Hydroxychloroquine-based Combination Therapies for the Treatment of COVID-19,2020,"Sexual reproduction, typically conceived of as a puzzling feature of eukaryotes, has posed an extraordinary evolutionary challenge in terms of the twofold replicative advantage of asexual over sexual organisms. Here we show mathematically that a greater than twofold cost is paid by retroviruses such as HIV during reverse transcription. For a retrovirus, replication is achieved through RNA reverse transcription and the effectively linear growth processes of DNA transcription during gene expression. Retroviruses are unique among viruses in that they show an alternation of generations between a diploid free living phase and a haploid integrated phase. Retroviruses engage in extensive recombination during the synthesis of the haploid DNA provirus. Whereas reverse transcription generates large amounts of sequence variation, DNA transcription is a high-fidelity process. Retroviruses come under strong selection pressures from immune systems to generate escape mutants, and reverse transcription into the haploid DNA phase serves to generate diversity followed by a phase of transcriptional clonal expansion during the restoration of diploidy from a stable, long lived, DNA encoded provirus.","Krakauer, David C; Sasaki, Akira",Proceedings.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, individuals must adopt preventive behaviors. However, to encourage behavior change, we must first understand current knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) that inform response to this health threat. METHODS: We explored KAPs among Venezuelans using a cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire. The questionnaire explored individuals' knowledge about COVID-19; their attitudes toward the world's and the Venezuelan authorities' abilities to control it; and their self-reported practices. We also collected demographic data. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to predict the adoption of preventive behaviors based on demographic variables, individual knowledge level, and individual attitudes. RESULTS: 3122 individuals completed the questionnaire. Participants had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19. They expressed high levels of optimism that the world would eventually control COVID-19, but they were very pessimistic about the public authorities in Venezuela. Most participants adopted preventive practices. Binomial regression suggests younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers hold lower levels of knowledge, and these groups, as well as men, were less likely to adopt preventive practices. Knowledge, by itself, had no association with optimism and little association with self-reported practices. CONCLUSIONS: As other KAP studies in Latin America found, knowledge is not sufficient to prompt behavior change. Venezuelans' pessimism about their own country's ability should be explored in greater depth. Health promotion in Venezuela may wish to target the most at risk groups: men, younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers.","Bates, Benjamin R; Tami, Adriana; Carvajal, Ana; Grijalva, Mario J",PLoS One,,490

Our respondents (n = 158) perceived conditions and safety generally positively: most reported having personal protective equipment (89.24%), technical support (88.61%), and induction training (79.11%). Only 38.61% said they had access to psychological support. In our view, benefits (e.g., an opportunity to make new contacts or receiving positive reactions from patients and staff) seemed to outweigh costs. 65.82% of the respondents agreed that they learnt new interesting things. A majority noticed the development of their soft skills (social 86.08%; organisational 78.48%; stress management 68.99%), while 40.51% - the development of their medical skills. The interviews pointed to additional benefits for students such as gaining insight of the healthcare system, and costs such as distress caused by some patient interactions. We conclude that student volunteering could become a viable solution for health professions education. To maximise its educational potential, volunteers' needs must be explored, psychological support ensured, and opportunities for mentoring and reflection provided. The organisational framework of a SVP should be culturally sensitive.","Chawlowska, Ewelina; Staszewski, Rafal; Lipiak, Agnieszka; Giernas, Bogusz; Karasiewicz, Monika; Bazan, Dominika; Nowosadko, Maria; Cofta, Mateusz; Wysocki, Jacek",Front Public Health,,490

207485,501.V2 and B.1.1.7 variants of COVID-19: a new time-bomb in the making?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cleft palate is a common craniofacial defect, which occurs when the palate fails to fuse during development. During fusion, the palatal shelves migrate towards the embryonic midline to form a seam. Apoptotic elimination of medial edge epithelium (MEE) cells along this seam is required for the completion of palate fusion. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) of six Chinese cleft palate families was applied to identify novel cleft palate-associated gene variants. Palatal fusion and immunofluorescence studies were performed in a murine palatal shelf organ culture model. Gene and protein expression were analyzed by qPCR and immunoblotting in murine MEE cells during seam formation in vivo. Mechanistic immunoprecipitation studies were performed in murine MEE cells in vitro. RESULTS: WES identified Bcl-2 associated anthanogene 6 (BAG6) as a novel cleft palate-associated gene. In murine MEE cells, we discovered upregulation of Bag6 and the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) during seam formation in vivo. Using a palatal shelf organ culture model, we demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 enhances MEE cell apoptosis by promoting p300's acetylation of FoxO1, thereby promoting transcription of the pro-apoptotic Fas ligand (FasL). Subsequent gain- and loss-of-function studies in the organ culture model demonstrated that FasL is required for Bag6/acFoxO1-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Bax/caspase-3 signaling, MEE apoptosis, and palate fusion. Palatal shelf contact was shown to enhance Bag6 nuclear localization and upregulate nuclear acFoxO1 in MEE cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 and p300 co-operatively enhance FoxO1 acetylation to promote FasL-mediated MEE apoptosis during palate fusion.","Xu, Jing; Liu, Fei; Xiong, Zhuyou; Huo, Jiwu; Li, Wei; Jiang, Banghong; Mao, Wu; He, Bo; Wang, Xiaojing; Li, Guangzao",Exp Cell Res,,490

How individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in mental health profiles in a non-invasive manner. The goal of this study is to examine, among college students, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of 49 students from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included late-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","Zaman, Anis; Zhang, Boyu; Hoque, Ehsan; Silenzio, Vincent; Kautz, Henry",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09076v1.pdf,490

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: To describe the innovative teaching practices, tools, and resources for remote learning developed by a school of pharmacy with a decentralized experiential program to empower and support preceptors in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. SUMMARY: As the pandemic has continued, there have been significant shifts in pharmacy workflow, staffing, and patient care delivery. Pharmacy students are slowly being reintegrated into these learning environments. Although preceptors are willing and eager to teach, many lack the resources, tools, and support to create remote learning experiences at their facilities. The University of the Pacific Thomas J. Long School of Pharmacy has a decentralized experiential education model in which faculty regional coordinators with clinical practices and diverse expertise are disseminated throughout California. This model allowed us to collaborate and understand preceptor needs from a local level. We created a preceptor COVID-19 guidance document, introduced innovative virtual playbooks to pivot up to 100% remote rotations, and promoted the layered learning model to integrate pharmacy residents into the remote teaching space. Communication and flexibility are key to ensure student and preceptor safety while maintaining high-quality advanced pharmacy practice experiences and preserving patient-student relationships in telehealth. CONCLUSION: Overall, we successfully created innovative solutions and leveraged our decentralized experiential model to meet the teaching and learning demands during an unanticipated crisis. We continue to adapt and plan to assess the effectiveness of the tools by administering surveys of preceptors and pharmacy students.","Law, Elaine; Scott, Marie C; Moon, Yong S K; Lee, Audrey J; Bandy, Veronica T; Haydon, Andrew; Shek, Allen; Kang-Birken, S Lena",Am. j. health system pharm,,490
214937,Successful management of SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome and newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Virtual care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) allows providers to monitor COVID-19-positive patients with variable trajectories while reducing the risk of transmission to others and ensuring health care capacity in acute care facilities. The objective of this descriptive analysis was to assess the initial adoption, feasibility and safety of a family medicine-led remote monitoring program, COVIDCare@Home, to manage the care of patients with COVID-19 in the community. METHODS: COVIDCare@Home is a multifaceted, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program developed at an ambulatory academic centre, the Women's College Hospital in Toronto. A descriptive analysis of the first cohort of patients admitted from Apr. 8 to May 11, 2020, was conducted. Lessons from the implementation of the program are described, focusing on measure of adoption (number of visits per patient total, with a physician or with a nurse; length of follow-up), feasibility (received an oximeter or thermometer; consultation with general internal medicine, social work or mental health, pharmacy or acute ambulatory care unit) and safety (hospitalizations, mortality and emergency department visits). RESULTS: The COVIDCare@Home program cared for a first cohort of 97 patients (median age 41 yr, 67% female) with 415 recorded virtual visits. Patients had a median time from positive testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to first appointment of 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-4) days, with a median virtual follow-up time of 8 (IQR 5-10) days. A total of 4 (4%) had an emergency department visit, with no patients requiring hospitalization and no deaths; 16 (16%) of patients required support with mental and social health needs. INTERPRETATION: A family medicine-led, team-based remote monitoring program can safely manage the care of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Virtual care approaches, particularly those that support patients with more complex health and social needs, may be an important part of ongoing health system efforts to manage subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Agarwal, Payal; Mukerji, Geetha; Laur, Celia; Chandra, Shivani; Pimlott, Nick; Heisey, Ruth; Stovel, Rebecca; Goulbourne, Elaine; Bhatia, R Sacha; Bhattacharyya, Onil; Martin, Danielle",CMAJ Open,,490
215398,Should we avoid colleagues in leisure time during COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation in COVID-19 often leads to multiple organ failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in combination with sequential extracorporeal blood purification therapies (EBP) might support renal function, attenuate systemic inflammation, and prevent or mitigate multiple organ dysfunctions in COVID-19. AIM: Describe overtime variations of clinical and biochemical features of critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with EBP with a hemodiafilter characterized by enhanced cytokine adsorption properties. METHODS: An observational prospective study assessing the outcome of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU (February to April 2020) treated with EBP according to local practice. Main endpoints included overtime variation of IL-6 and multiorgan function-scores, mortality, and occurrence of technical complications or adverse events. RESULTS: The study evaluated 37 patients. Median baseline IL-6 was 1230 pg/ml (IQR 895) and decreased overtime (p < 0.001 Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 24 h (p = 0.001). The reduction in serum IL-6 concentrations correlated with the improvement in organ function, as measured in the decrease of SOFA score (rho = 0.48, p = 0.0003). Median baseline SOFA was 13 (IQR 6) and decreased significantly overtime (p < 0.001 at Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 48 h (median 8 IQR 5, p = 0.001). Compared to the expected mortality rates, as calculated by APACHE IV, the mean observed rates were 8.3% lower after treatment. The best improvement in mortality rate was observed in patients receiving EBP early on during the ICU stay. Premature clotting (running < 24 h) occurred in patients (18.9% of total) which featured higher effluent dose (median 33.6 ml/kg/h, IQR 9) and higher filtration fraction (median 31%, IQR 7.4). No electrolyte disorders, catheter displacement, circuit disconnection, unexpected bleeding, air, or thromboembolisms due to venous cannulation of EBP were recorded during the treatment. In one case, infection of vascular access occurred during RRT, requiring replacement. CONCLUSIONS: EBP with heparin-coated hemodiafilter featuring cytokine adsorption properties administered to patients with COVID-19 showed to be feasible and with no adverse events. During the treatment, patients experienced serum IL-6 level reduction, attenuation of systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction improvement, and reduction in expected ICU mortality rate.","Villa, Gianluca; Romagnoli, Stefano; De Rosa, Silvia; Greco, Massimiliano; Resta, Marco; Pomarè Montin, Diego; Prato, Federico; Patera, Francesco; Ferrari, Fiorenza; Rotondo, Giuseppe; Ronco, Claudio",Crit Care,,490

Anionic disulfonated napthol derivates and cationic dendrimer macroions are used as building blocks for electrostatic self-assembly. Nanoparticles are already formed under the exclusion of light as a result of electrostatic interactions. Upon photoexcitation, an excited-state dissociation of the photoacidic hydroxyl group takes place, which leads to a more highly charged linker molecule and, subsequently, to a change in size and structure of the nano-assemblies. The effects of the charge ratio and the concentration on the stability have been examined with absorption spectroscopy and Î¶-potential measurements. The influence of the chemical structure of three isomeric photoacids on the size and shape of the nanoscale aggregates has been studied by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, revealing a direct correlation of the strength of the photoacid with the changes of the assemblies upon irradiation.","Zika, Alexander; Bernhardt, Sarah; Gröhn, Franziska",,,490

Researchers are working against the clock to ramp up research studies addressing every angle of COVID-19 - gaining a better understanding of person-to-person transmission, improving methods for diagnosis, and developing therapies to treat infection and vaccines to prevent it. The impact of the virus on research efforts is not limited to investigators and their teams. Potential participants also face unparalleled opportunities and requests to participate in research, which can result in a significant amount of participant fatigue. The Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research recognized early in the pandemic that a solution to assist researchers in the rapid identification of potential participants was critical, and thus developed the COVID-19 Recruitment Data Mart. This solution does not rest solely on technology; the addition of experienced project managers to support researchers and facilitate collaboration was essential. Since the platform and study support tools were launched on July 20, 2020, four studies have been onboarded and a total of 1693 potential participant matches have been shared. Each of these patients had agreed in advance to direct contact for COVID-19 research and had been matched to study-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our innovative Data Mart system is scalable and looks promising as a generalizable solution for simultaneously recommending individuals from a pool of patients against a pool of time-sensitive trial opportunities.","Helmer, Tara T; Lewis, Adam A; McEver, Mark; Delacqua, Francesco; Pastern, Cindy L; Kennedy, Nan; Edwards, Terri L; Woodward, Beverly O; Harris, Paul A",J Biomed Inform,,490
217184,Ruxolitinib for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),2020,"Many viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have a structure consisting of spikes protruding from an underlying spherical surface. Research in biological and colloidal sciences has revealed secrets of why spikes exist on virus surfaces. Specifically, the spikes favor virus attachment on surfaces via receptor-specific interactions (RSIs), mediate the membrane fusion, and determine or change viral tropism. The spikes also facilitate viruses to approach surfaces before attachment and subsequently escape back to the environment if RSIs do not occur (i.e., easy come and easy go). Therefore, virus spikes create the paradox of having a large capacity for binding with cells (high infectivity) and meanwhile great mobility in the environment. Such structure-function relationships have important implications for the fabrication of virus-like particles and analogous colloids (e.g., hedgehog- and raspberry-like particles) for applications such as the development of antiviral vaccines and drug delivery.","Shen, Chongyang; Bradford, Scott A",MSphere,,490
217185,Ruxolitinib for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),2020,"Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is one of the causes of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries, and is often triggered by physical events (e.g. acute respiratory failure), or emotional events (e.g. loss of a family member, cardiac stress induced by an acute illness). SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia currently represents a worldwide health problem; the correlations between cardiovascular disease, myocardial injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear, but initial data show that myocardial damage represents a negative prognostic factor. Myocardial injury during SARS-CoV-2, as defined by a pathological rise in circulating troponin levels, is not an uncommon complication in hospitalized patients, and is significantly more frequent in intensive care unit patients and among those who died. In this setting, myocardial injury is mainly secondary to type 2 myocardial infarction (mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand during respiratory failure); other causes include myocarditis, coronary thrombosis, sepsis or septic shock. At present, only few cases of TTS have been described during SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the case of a patient hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 with subsequent onset of TTS triggered by both physical and emotional events.","Moderato, Luca; Monello, Alberto; Lazzeroni, Davide; Binno, Simone; Giacalone, Rossella; Ferraro, Stefano; Piepoli, Massimo Francesco; Villani, Giovanni Quinto",G Ital Cardiol (Rome),,490

This study presents perceptions and attitudes of students that attended a hybrid course in environmental engineering that suddenly converted to an online synchronous delivery due to COVID-19. It also presents an assessment of the hybrid and online synchronous delivery approach on the final exam scores as well as the final grades of the same course. The course, 'Introduction to Environmental Engineering', was developed as an online course for Civil and Environmental Engineering program students and delivered with hybrid and online synchronous options due to COVID-19 pandemic for several semesters to test the concept. In the hybrid delivery set up, all the quizzes and homework assignments were online while the midterm and final exams were in-class. For Spring 2020 the final exam was online and for Summer 2020 both the midterm and final exams were online due to COVID-19 adjustment. At the very end of the semesters, an online anonymous survey was conducted with five questions to understand the students' perception and attitude on exam taking options and learning environment. Students' perceptions and attitudes about online synchronous delivery approach compared to hybrid delivery approach, as well as the learning outcomes, appeared at face value not to be favorable. However, statistical analysis revealed that differences between online synchronous delivery and the Pre-COVID-19 hybrid delivery were not significant, indicating that, at least for these engineering students, online synchronous delivery is a justifiable option.","Karim, M.

228477,The use of remote care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic - a perspective of Portuguese and Spanish physicians,2020,"BACKGROUND: In almost all lower and lower middle-income countries, the healthcare system is structured in the customary model of in-person or face to face model of care. With the current global COVID-19 pandemics, the usual health care service has been significantly altered in many aspects. Given the fragile health system and high number of immunocompromised populations in lower and lower-middle income countries, the economic impacts of COVID-19 are anticipated to be worse. In such scenarios, technological solutions like, Telemedicine which is defined as the delivery of healthcare service remotely using telecommunication technologies for exchange of medical information, diagnosis, consultation and treatment is critical. The aim of this study was to assess healthcare providers' acceptance and preferred modality of telemedicine and factors thereof among health professionals working in Ethiopia. METHODS: A multi-centric online survey was conducted via social media platforms such as telegram channels, Facebook groups/pages and email during Jul 1- Sep 21, 2020. The questionnaire was adopted from previously validated model in low income setting. Internal consistency of items was assessed using Cronbach alpha (&#945;), composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) to evaluate both discriminant and convergent validity of constructs. The extent of relationship among variables were evaluated by Structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS Amos version 23. RESULTS: From the expected 423 responses, 319 (75.4%) participants responded to the survey questionnaire during the data collection period. The majority of participants were male (78.1%), age <30 (76.8%) and had less than five years of work experience (78.1%). The structural model result confirmed the hypothesis ""self-efficacy has a significant positive effect on effort expectancy"" with a standardized coefficient estimate (ß) of 0.76 and p-value <0.001. The result also indicated that self-efficacy, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence have a significant direct effect on user's attitude toward using telemedicine. User's behavioral intention to use telemedicine was also influenced by effort expectancy and attitude. The model also ruled out that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence does not directly influence user's intention to use telemedicine. The squared multiple correlations (r2) value indicated that 57.1% of the variance in attitude toward using telemedicine and 63.6% of the variance in behavioral intention to use telemedicine is explained by the current structural model. CONCLUSION: This study found that effort expectancy and attitude were significantly predictors of healthcare professionals' acceptance of telemedicine. Attitude toward using telemedicine systems was also highly influenced by performance expectancy, self-efficacy and facilitating conditions. effort expectancy and attitude were also significant mediators in predicting users' acceptance of telemedicine. In addition, mHealth approach was the most preferred modality of telemedicine and this opens an opportunity to integrate telemedicine systems in the health system during and post pandemic health services in low-income countries.","Shiferaw, Kirubel Biruk; Mengiste, Shegaw Anagaw; Gullslett, Monika Knudsen; Zeleke, Atinkut Alamirrew; Tilahun, Binyam; Tebeje, Tsion; Wondimu, Robel; Desalegn, Surafel; Mehari, Eden Abetu",PLoS One,,490

235620,Risk Factors for Mortality and Progression to Severe COVID-19 Disease in the Southeast United States (US): A Report from the SEUS Study Group,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive effect on people with haematological cancers, who represent a high-risk population due to the nature of their disease and immunosuppressive treatments. We aimed to identify the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on haematology patients and identify correlated factors to inform the development of appropriate supportive interventions. METHODS: Three hundred and ninety-four respondents volunteered their participation in response to a study advertisement distributed online through established haematology groups. Participants completed a self-report online survey exploring wellbeing, psychological distress, unmet supportive care needs, and fear of cancer recurrence. RESULTS: At least 1 in 3 respondents (35%) reported clinical levels of distress and nearly 1 in 3 (32%) identified at least one unmet need. Among respondents in remission (n = 134), clinical fear of cancer recurrence was reported by nearly all (95%). Unmet needs, pre-existing health conditions, younger age, financial concerns, and perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 were the dominant factors contributing to psychological distress during the pandemic. Psychological distress, lost income, perceived inadequate support from care team, perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, and being a woman were significantly associated with unmet needs. Psychological distress and concern about the impact of COVID-19 on cancer management were significantly associated with fear of cancer recurrence among respondents in remission. CONCLUSION: Results highlight the high psychological burden and unmet needs experienced by people with haematological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic and indicate a need for innovative solutions to rapidly identify distress and unmet needs during, and beyond, pandemic times.","Zomerdijk, Nienke; Jongenelis, Michelle; Short, Camille E; Smith, Andrew; Turner, Jane; Huntley, Kathryn",Support. care cancer,,490
237539,Is Hydroxychloroquine a Possible Postexposure Prophylaxis Drug to Limit the Transmission to Healthcare Workers Exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019?,2020,"Purpose: Healthcare governance places medical ethics at the forefront of defining and maintaining the quality of care. Examples of serious ethical issues include sexual abuse of patients (Dubois, Walsh, Chibnall et al., 2017), criminal prescription of opioids (Johnson, 2019) and unnecessary surgical procedures (Tayade and Dalvi, 2016) or shortages in service delivery because of little knowledge or experience especially during pandemic outbreaks (Hay-David et al., 2020). In many cases involving medical ethics, patients are identified as the first victims; however, this study aimed to consider clinicians and other healthcare practitioners as other probable victims (Ozeke et al., 2019). Design/methodology/approach: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tens of millions of patients worldwide suffer disabling injuries or death every year due to unsafe medical practices and services. Nearly, one in ten patients is harmed due to preventable causes while receiving health care in well-funded and technologically advanced hospital settings (WHO, 2016). Much less is known about the burden of unsafe care in non-hospital settings, where most healthcare services are delivered (Jha et al., 2013). Furthermore, there is little evidence concerning the burden of unsafe care in developing countries, where the risk of harm to patients is likely to be greater, due to limitations in infrastructure, technologies and human resources (Elmontsri et al., 2018). Findings: While these problems are endemic in health care, they are exacerbated in times of health and social crises such as the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic has few precedents, being most closely paralleled with the global influenza pandemic of 1918 (Terry, 2020). Initially compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002–2003 (Parrym, 2003), COVID-19 is already proving much more deadly. The WHO’s estimates of the number of SARS cases from the start of the outbreak in 2002, until it was brought under control in July 2003, was 8,437 cumulative cases, with 813 deaths (WHO, 2003). The European Center for disease prevention and Control estimated that as of May 15, 2020, that 4,405,680 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with 302,115 deaths (ECDC, 2020) Research limitations/implications: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared in February 2020 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and up to March 2020, the cases of morbidity reached 12,729, with 611 deaths (Bedasht, 2020). The current figure at the time of editing (May 16, 2020) is 118,392 cases, with 6,937 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). Acting in cognizance of its ethical responsibility to the citizens of Iran, the Iranian government has taken the following action to attempt to mitigate the deleterious effects of the virus: in each province, one or more hospitals have been evacuated and allocated to patients with pulmonary problems with suspected to COVID-19. Access to intensive care units and specialist equipment is a primary ethical issue that concerns the Iranian healthcare system. The issue is exacerbated by the knowledge that these facilities are not distributed equitably in the country. Therefore, equity is the first ethical concern in this situation. Practical implications: All nurses, clinicians, practitioners and specialists have been asked to volunteer their services in hospitals in the most infected areas. This raises ethical concerns about access to personal protective equipment (PPE) such as appropriate masks, gowns, gloves and other equipment to protect healthcare workers from infection. Access to PPE was restricted because of government failure to stockpile the necessary amount of disposable medical equipment. This was related to lack of domestic capacity to produce the equipment and problems accessing it internationally due to political-economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran by the USA and some European countries. Such shortages can quickly lead to a catastrophic situation; current evidence demonstrates that about 40% of healthcare workers are vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection (Behdasht, 2020). However, it should be noted that this is not a problem limited to Iran. As of March 2020, the WHO was already warning about PPE shortages and the dangers this posed for healthcare workers around the world (WHO, 2020). Social implications: A Disaster Committee was created by the Iranian Ministry of Health to take responsibility for decision-making and daily information sharing to the community. The ethical dilemma that arises in terms of reporting the situation is the conflict between transparently presenting accurate and timely information and the creation of public panic and fear that this may cause in the community. Originality/value: As a steward for public health, the Ministry of Health was afforded direct responsibility to maintain intra-sector relationships and leadership with other organizations such as political executive organizations, municipalities, military agencies, schools, universities and other public organizations to reach consensus on the best methods of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. An important ethical issue is found in potential areas of conflict between the therapeutic and preventive roles of the Ministry of Health and those related to public health and the civil administrations.","Bastani, Peivand; Sheykhotayefeh, Mostafa; Tahernezhad, Ali; Hakimzadeh, Seyyed Mostafa; Rikhtegaran, Samaneh",Int.

237809,Cardiac Dysfunction in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: A Call to Action,2020,"The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017 guidelines for hypertension management lowered blood pressure (BP) thresholds to 130/80 mmHg to define hypertension while the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) 2018 guidelines retained 140/90 mmHg. Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65+ aged between 67 and 80 years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how to manage hypertension.","Anker, Daniela; Santos-Eggimann, Brigitte; Zwahlen, Marcel; Santschi, Valérie; Rodondi, Nicolas; Wolfson, Christina; Chiolero, Arnaud",J. hum. hypertens,,490

Using data from a representative sample of the Portuguese population (N = 1,411) collected early in the pandemic, we find that while media sources were more frequently used, scientific sources played a more important role on perceived personal and societal-level risks; higher trust in scientific sources associated with increased risk perceptions (i.e., amplified perceived risk), trust in social media associated with dismissing personal threat (i.e., attenuated perceived risk). These findings suggest that people's relations with science were determinant factors in risk perceptions, and dimensions that measure these deserve further investigation.","Entradas, Marta",Health Commun,,490

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms. RESULTS: The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.","Chen, Tao; Wu, Di; Chen, Huilong; Yan, Weiming; Yang, Danlei; Chen, Guang; Ma, Ke; Xu, Dong; Yu, Haijing; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Guo, Wei; Chen, Jia; Ding, Chen; Zhang, Xiaoping; Huang, Jiaquan; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin",BMJ,,490

Some of the chemical species involved in their production are considered hazardous and some industrial processes employing them categorised as ""having potential negative impact on the environment"". Biological surfactants have therefore been generally accepted worldwide as suitable sustainable greener alternatives. Biosurfactants exhibit the same functionalities of synthetic analogues while having the ability to synergize with other molecules improving performances; this strengthens the possibility of reaching different markets via innovative formulations. Recently, their use was suggested to help combat Covid-19. In this review, an analysis of recent bibliography is presented with descriptions, statistics, classifications, applications, advantages, and challenges; evincing the reasons why biosurfactants can be considered as the chemical specialities of the future.

243768,Addition of Corticosteroids to Immunoglobulins Is Associated With Recovery of Cardiac Function in Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2020,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in adult hypopituitary patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of hypopituitary adult patients followed in a single reference center for pituitary diseases. MetS was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. Patients with 18 years or older, presenting two or more anterior pituitary deficiencies associated or not with diabetes insipidus (DI), were included, while patients with hypopituitarism due to Acromegaly or Cushing's disease were excluded. RESULTS: We studied 99 hypopituitary patients (52 males, mean age 50.1 ± 16.3 years, mean age at diagnosis 33.7 ± 17.6 years) who have been followed for a mean time of 15.9 ± 10.1 years. Hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and non-tumoral etiologies were observed in 53.4% and 46.6% of the cases, respectively. FSH/LH, GH, TSH, ACTH deficiency and DI was present in 99%, 98.6%, 96%, 81.8%, and 23.2%, respectively. The prevalence of MetS was 39.4% and was significantly higher in patients older than 50 years (p = 0.02), overweight/obese (p < 0.001), with hypopituitarism diagnosed in adult life (p = 0.02), who did not replace GH (p = 0.004) and in smokers (p = 0.007). In the logistic regression model, body mass index (BMI) and GH replacement were significantly associated with the presence of MetS. Reduced HDL cholesterol was the most prevalent component of MetS in hypopituitary patients. CONCLUSIONS: MetS is a common finding in adult hypopituitary patients, which is mainly influenced by increased BMI and untreated GH deficiency.

RESULTS: This was a prospective cohort study in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre. We included 20 consecutive, invasively ventilated patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS who underwent prone positioning in ICU as part of their management. The main outcome was the effect of prone positioning on gas exchange and respiratory mechanics. There was a median improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 132 in the prone position compared to the supine position (IQR 67-228). We observed lower PaO2/FiO2 ratios in those with low (< median) baseline respiratory system static compliance, compared to those with higher (> median) static compliance (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in respiratory system static compliance with prone positioning. Prone positioning was effective in improving oxygenation in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. Furthermore, poor respiratory system static compliance was common and was associated with disease severity. Improvements in oxygenation were partly due to lung recruitment. Prone positioning should be considered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS.","Clarke, Jennifer; Geoghegan, Pierce; McEvoy, Natalie; Boylan, Maria; Ní Choileáin, Orna; Mulligan, Martin; Hogan, Grace; Keogh, Aoife; McElvaney, Oliver J; McElvaney, Oisín F; Bourke, John; McNicholas, Bairbre; Laffey, John G; McElvaney, Noel G; Curley, Gerard F",BMC Res Notes,,490

248634,The importance of heart and brain imaging in children and adolescents with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),2021,"Background: Ever since the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak emerged in China, there has been several attempts to predict the epidemic across the world with varying degrees of accuracy and reliability. This paper aims to carry out a short-term projection of new cases; forecast the maximum number of active cases for India and selected high-incidence states; and evaluate the impact of three weeks lock down period using different models. Methods: We used Logistic growth curve model for short term prediction; SIR models to forecast the maximum number of active cases and peak time; and Time Interrupted Regression model to evaluate the impact of lockdown and other interventions. Results: The predicted cumulative number of cases for India was 58,912 (95% CI: 57,960, 59,853) by May 08, 2020 and the observed number of cases was 59,695. The model predicts a cumulative number of 1,02,974 (95% CI: 1,01,987, 1,03,904) cases by May 22, 2020. As per SIR model, the maximum number of active cases is projected to be 57,449 on May 18, 2020. The time interrupted regression model indicates a decrease of about 149 daily new cases after the lock down period, which is statistically not significant. Conclusion: The Logistic growth curve model predicts accurately the short-term scenario for India and high incidence states. The prediction through SIR model may be used for planning and prepare the health systems. The study also suggests that there is no evidence to conclude that there is a positive impact of lockdown in terms of reduction in new cases.","Malavika, B; Marimuthu, S; Joy, Melvin; Nadaraj, Ambily; Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Jeyaseelan, L",,,490

Given the importance to assess the evolution and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to forecast the next scenario of the pandemic, mainly in countries with limited healthcare systems, we estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, and a possible scenario for this pandemic in the region. Subject and methods: We estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in its first outbreak stage in the northwestern region of Himalaya, India, and we also predicted new daily cases for the next 90 days using different R0, testing a plausible end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results: Our results showed a considerable increase in the number of cases, but with a tendency to asymptote. Anantnag, Bandipora, Baramulla, Shopian, and Srinagar districts showed more than 100 cases and Kulgam and Kathua districts showed strong growth of the number of cases from the beginning of May, without a tendency to normalization. The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%. Conclusion: In this study, we indicate positive effects of the preventive measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, taken in the J&K region, showing a stabilization of the growth curves of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, which tends to a strong decrease over time as the R0 decreases.","Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Yaqoob, Umer; Hassan, Musheerul; da Silva, Rafaela José; Calixto, Eduardo Soares",Z Gesundh Wiss,,490

This paper focuses on using Blockchain to provide a robust and secure decentralized computing system. The paper conducts a literature review on Blockchain-based methods capable for the decentralization of the future Internet. To achieve that decentralization, two research aspects of Blockchain have been investigated that are highly relevant in realizing the decentralized Internet. The first aspect is the consensus algorithms, which are vital components for decentralization of Blockchain. We have identified three consensus algorithms being PoP, Paxos, and PoAH to be more adequate for reaching consensus in Blockchain-enabled Internet architecture. The second aspect that we investigated is the impact of future Internet technologies on Blockchain, where their combinations with Blockchain would help to make it overcome its established flaws and be more optimized and applicable for Internet decentralization.","Zarrin, Javad; Wen, Phang Hao; Saheer, Lakshmi Babu; Zarrin, Bahram",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01096v1.pdf,490

259442,Inclusion of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Adolescents Temporally Related to COVID-19 in the Differential Diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease Reply,2021,"Background In addition to clinical, epidemiological, and political aspects, the pandemic situation has a clinical and psychological aspect, as long as the measures taken to counteract infection inevitably cause unusual living conditions for a large number of people. Stress experience is accompanied by changes in autonomic regulation and, as a result, a number of somatic shifts. Stress markers include sleep disorders, changes in appetite, gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, chest pain, dyspnea, body pain, dizziness, numbness, fluctuations in blood pressure, sleep disorders, panic attacks, depressive and suicidal tendencies. Objective. We suggested that resilience is the predictor of successful resolution of existential crisis from the point of view of maintaining mental and somatic health, as well as gaining experience of deep self-improvement, strengthening of personality and potential for coping with life difficulties. Resilience includes coping at all levels of functioning physical, psychological, social and existential. The latter defines the perception of reality itself as a challenge of complexity that requires coping, and regulates resilience at all other levels. The indicator of sleep quality was used as an empirical criterion to evaluate coping with stress. It is both an indicator and an antistress resource for physical functioning. The hypothesis of the study was the assumption that psychological content of resilience differs in subjects with moderate severity insomnia and with no sleep disturbances during pandemic period. Design and methods. To evaluate this hypothesis during the period of self-isolation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020), an empirical study was carried out on a randomized sample of 93 subjects using clinical and psychological scales. Results. This research resulted in the identification of differences in psychological content of resilience which reflect clinical and psychological characteristics in subjects with moderate severity insomnia and with normal sleep during the pandemic. The psychological content of resilience in respondents without sleep disturbances during the pandemic can be considered as complex and mature mechanisms of personality self regulation that allow of maintaining mental and somatic health, efficiency, ability to develop. Identified features can be used as psychotherapeutic targets in patients at different stages of exposure to stress factors. © 2021 All-Russian Public Organization Antihypertensive League.

260105,The other 'C': Hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile infection during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pandemics lead to new challenges for healthcare systems and a subsequent shift of the scientific focus, which can partially be seen in alterations in scientific publication activity. OBJECTIVES: Follow-up on the global publication activity within the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a comparison of national contexts with regards to local infection rates and the involvement of the discipline of pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative analysis of the number of publications in the PubMed® database concerning COVID-19 with respect to publication type, date and place of publication, affiliation to an institute of pathology, and correlation with the number of SARS-CoV­2 infections over the same timeframe. RESULTS: After an initial peak with regards to the number of publications in the months of May and June 2020, a slight decrease was observed, followed by another increase starting in August/September 2020. Further, the time between data collection and publication contracted to approximately 3-4 months. Countries faced with early SARS-CoV­2 infections published promptly, even though there was no overall association between the number of publications and COVID-19 case numbers. On average, 4% of authors were affiliated to an institute of pathology, with a steady increase of this percentage within the course of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 altered global publication activity by providing for an unprecedented number of publications combined with an acceleration of publication times irrespective of the geographical location and overall case numbers.","Strobl, Stephanie; Roth, Wilfried",Pathologe,,490

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) usually result from viral or bacterial respiratory infections, but may also result from exposure to environmental pollution. AECOPD are associated with functional decline, increased risk of subsequent exacerbations, and death. Despite the poor prognosis of AECOPD, patients are empowered through self-management programs in their battle against this lethal disease.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting incidence, mortality and risk factors for AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: We systematically searched 11 electronic databases until 29 May 2020 for studies in English reporting original data on AKI and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Incidences of AKI and KRT and risk ratios for mortality associated with AKI were pooled using generalized linear mixed and random-effects models. Potential risk factors for AKI were assessed using meta-regression. Incidences were stratified by geographic location and disease severity. Results: A total of 3042 articles were identified, of which 142 studies were included, with 49 048 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 5152 AKI events. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-39.5] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the USA and Europe (20 studies) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1-7.4) among patients from China (62 studies), whereas the pooled incidence of KRT was 7.7% (95% CI 5.1-11.4; 18 studies) and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5-3.3; 52 studies), respectively. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the incidence of KRT was 20.6% (95% CI 15.7-26.7; 38 studies). Meta-regression analyses showed that age, male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease were associated with the occurrence of AKI; in itself, AKI was associated with an increased risk of mortality, with a pooled risk ratio of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3-6.5). Conclusions: AKI and KRT are common events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with estimates varying across geographic locations. Additional studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment of AKI in these patients.","Fu, Edouard L; Janse, Roemer J; de Jong, Ype; van der Endt, Vera H W; Milders, Jet; van der Willik, Esmee M; de Rooij, Esther N M; Dekkers, Olaf M; Rotmans, Joris I; van Diepen, Merel",Clin Kidney J,,490

Although the rate of new infections in China has decreased, currently, 169 countries report confirmed cases, with many nations showing increasing numbers daily. Testing for COVID-19 infection is performed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, but availability is limited in many parts of the world. The role of chest computed tomography is yet to be determined and may vary depending on the local prevalence of disease and availability of laboratory testing. A common but nonspecific pattern of disease with a somewhat predictable progression is seen in patients with COVID-19. Specifically, patchy ground-glass opacities in the periphery of the lower lungs may be present initially, eventually undergoing coalescence, consolidation, and organization, and ultimately showing features of fibrosis. In this article, we review the computed tomography features of COVID-19 infection. Familiarity with these findings and their evolution will help radiologists recognize potential COVID-19 and recognize the significant overlap with other causes of acute lung injury.","Goyal, Nikhil; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Keir, Graham; Mei, Xueyan; Huang, Mingqian; Li, Shaolin; Kanne, Jeffrey P",J Thorac Imaging,,490

Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown typical changes of the disease but there is limited data comparing CT scan findings with COVID-19 clinical severity and illness duration. The study aims to determine the common chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in association with clinical severity and duration of symptoms.METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study including all adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted from March 2020 to August 2020, with baseline RT-PCR and chest CT scan. Demographic data and CT scan findings were tabulated and analyzed using STATA 13.1.RESULTS: In this study of 304 patients, majority were above 60 years old (49%), male(62%), non-smokers (72.6%) with associated hypertension(56%) and diabetes mellitus(34%). Most common symptoms were cough (82%), dyspnea (76%) and fever (69%). Predominant chest CT patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia were ground glass opacity (GGO) (65%) and consolidation (39%) in bilateral, peripheral, and lower lobe distribution. Moderate group had higher GGO (72%, p0.047), unilateral (10%,p0.001) and peripheral distribution (68%,p0.001). Severe to critical groups had higher consolidation, number of lobes (&gt;4 lobes), and diffuse involvement. Subjects with less than 14 days of symptoms, had more GGO. Those with more than 4 days of symptoms, had CT findings that were bilateral, more than 4 lobes, and extending to middle and upper lobes.CONCLUSION: Chest CT patterns typical of COVID-19 pneumonia and their extent of involvement were associated with clinical severity and illness duration. A simple Chest CT scan would help support physicians' decision making and prognostication.","Dela Pena, E.

In addition, IoMT-based SHSs are enabling automated medication, allowing communication among myriad healthcare sensor devices. However, adversaries can launch various attacks on the communication network and the hardware/firmware to introduce false data or cause data unavailability to the automatic medication system endangering the patient's life. In this paper, we propose SHChecker, a novel threat analysis framework that integrates machine learning and formal analysis capabilities to identify potential attacks and corresponding effects on an IoMT-based SHS. Our framework can provide us with all potential attack vectors, each representing a set of sensor measurements to be altered, for an SHS given a specific set of attack attributes, allowing us to realize the system's resiliency, thus the insight to enhance the robustness of the model. We implement SHChecker on a synthetic and a real dataset, which affirms that our framework can reveal potential attack vectors in an IoMT system. This is a novel effort to formally analyze supervised and unsupervised machine learning models for black-box SHS threat analysis.","Haque, Nur Imtiazul; Rahman, Mohammad Ashiqur; Shahriar, Md Hasan; Khalil, Alvi Ataur; Uluagac, Selcuk",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03472v1.pdf,490

The German physician Rudolph Virchow, about two centuries ago, described three pivotal factors contributing together to thromboembolic risk: endothelial injury, hypercoagulability, and blood stasis. COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability is unique and distinctive, and has its own features involving the immune system. Many of the drugs proposed and currently undergoing evaluation for the treatment of COVID-19 have one or more of the Virchow's triad elements as a target. The three factors outlined by Virchow are still able to explain the venous and arterial hypercoagulable state in the dramatic COVID-19 setting. Nowadays, we have decidedly more sophisticated diagnostic tools than Virchow had, but many of the challenges that we are facing are the same as Virchow faced in the 19th century.","Mehta, Jawahar L; Calcaterra, Giuseppe; Bassareo, Pier P",Clin Cardiol,,490

Furthermore, the D614G spike mutant dominates the pandemic and it is unclear how serological tests designed to detect anti-spike antibodies perform against this variant. We assess the diagnostic accuracy of combined rapid antibody point of care (POC) and nucleic acid assays for suspected COVID-19 disease due to either wild-type or the D614G spike mutant SARS-CoV-2. The overall detection rate for COVID-19 is 79.2% (95% CI 57.8-92.9) by rapid NAAT alone. The combined point of care antibody test and rapid NAAT is not affected by D614G and results in very high sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis with very high specificity.","Mlcochova, Petra; Collier, Dami; Ritchie, Allyson; Assennato, Sonny M; Hosmillo, Myra; Goel, Neha; Meng, Bo; Chatterjee, Krishna; Mendoza, Vivien; Temperton, Nigel; Kiss, Leo; James, Leo C; Ciazynska, Katarzyna A; Xiong, Xiaoli; Briggs, John A G; Nathan, James A; Mescia, Federica; Bergamaschi, Laura; Zhang, Hongyi; Barmpounakis, Petros; Demeris, Nikos; Skells, Richard; Lyons, Paul A; Bradley, John; Baker, Steven; Allain, Jean Pierre; Smith, Kenneth G C; Bousfield, Rachel; Wilson, Michael; Sparkes, Dominic; Amoroso, Glenn; Gkrania-Klotsas, Effrosyni; Hardwick, Susie; Boyle, Adrian; Goodfellow, Ian; Gupta, Ravindra K",Cell Rep Med,,490

288347,Interactive Web-based Graphs of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cases and Deaths per Population by Country,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the provision of maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly altered to limit transmission of the virus. Many hospitals limited face-to-face appointments to only the pregnant woman and restricted the number of support people present during labour, birth, and postnatal visits to one person. How these restrictions were experienced by partners and support persons of childbearing women are unknown. AIM: To explore the experiences of partners and support persons of women receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A two-phased qualitative study including an online survey and interviews. Analysis was undertaken using content analysis. FINDINGS: Partners and support persons experienced a sense of 'missing out' from the pregnancy and maternity care experience because of changes in the provision of care during the pandemic. They reported feelings of isolation, psychological distress, and reduced bonding time with babies. Conflicting information and processes within and across maternity services contributed to feelings of uncertainty and a perceived reduction in the quality of care. Partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions on maternity wards, however they also perceived these to be of benefit to women. DISCUSSION: Many partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions in maternity services during the pandemic; strategies to ensure their active involvement in maternity care are needed. CONCLUSION: This study offers insights from the unique perspective of partners and support people of women receiving maternity care during the pandemic. Policies and processes that exclude partners and support persons need to be reconsidered.","Vasilevski, Vidanka; Sweet, Linda; Bradfield, Zoe; Wilson, Alyce N; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Homer, Caroline S E; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wynter, Karen",Women and birth (Online),,490

291462,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: A Mimicker of Severe Dengue,2021,"For precise health status monitoring and disease diagnostics in the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to detect various kinds of target signals robustly under high noise and strong interferences. Moreover, the health monitoring system is preferred to be realized in a small form factor for convenient mass deployments. A CMOS-integrated coherent sensing platform is proposed to achieve the goal, which synergetically leverages quadrature coherent photoacoustic (PA) detection and radar sensing for versatile healthcare. By utilizing configurable mixed-signal quadrature coherent PA detection, high sensitivity and enhanced specificity can be achieved. In-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) templates are specifically designed to accurately sense and precisely reconstruct the target PA signals coherently. By mixed-signal implementation leveraging an FPGA to generate template waveforms adaptively, accurate capturing and precise reconstruction on the target PA signal can be attained. The multiplication between the received PA signal and the templates is implemented efficiently in analog-domain by the Gilbert cell on-chip. In vivo temperature monitoring was realized based on the integrated PA sensing platform fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology. With the help of an integrated radar sensor deployed in the indoor scenario, noncontact monitoring on respiration and heartbeat rates can be attained. By complementary usage of PA-EM sensing, comprehensive and cognitive health status monitoring and remote disease diagnostics can be achieved for the current global COVID-19 pandemic and the future pervasive healthcare in the Internet of Everything (IoE) era.","Fang, Zhongyuan; Yang, Chuanshi; Zheng, Zesheng; Jin, Haoran; Tang, Kai; Lou, Liheng; Tang, Xiaoyan; Wang, Wensong; Zheng, Yuanjin",IEEE trans. biomed. circuits syst.

Given the global obesity prevalence, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind obese susceptibility to infection is imperative. Altered immune cell metabolism and function are often perceived as a key causative factor of dysregulated inflammation. However, the contribution of adipocytes, the dominantly altered cell type in obesity with broad inflammatory properties, to infectious disease pathogenesis remains largely ignored. Thus, skewing of adipocyte-intrinsic cellular metabolism may lead to the development of pathogenic inflammatory adipocytes, which shape the overall immune responses by contributing to either premature immunosenescence, delayed hyperinflammation, or cytokine storm in infections. In this review, we discuss the underappreciated contribution of adipocyte cellular metabolism and adipocyte-produced mediators on immune system modulation and how such interplay may modify disease susceptibility and pathogenesis of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections in obese individuals.","Alarcon, Pablo C; Damen, Michelle S M A; Madan, Rajat; Deepe, George S; Spearman, Paul; Way, Sing Sing; Divanovic, Senad",Mucosal immunology (Online),,490

295885,One-house one-person testing: Strategical plan to limit COVID-19 spread in stage three in the developing world,2020,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify research perspectives/clusters in the field of urban tourism (city tourism) in narrow sense and tourism cities (cities and tourism) in the broader sense to examine the complex relationship through the optics of science mapping. This paper believes that the existing qualitative assessments of this field can be experimentally verified and visualized. Design/methodology/approach First, the key conceptual dilemmas of research perspectives in urban tourism are highlighted. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection and the VOSviewer (computer program for visualizing bibliometric networks), the data will be analyzed. Clustering is used to evaluate information retrieval (inclusivity or selectivity of the search query), publication patterns (journal articles), author keywords, terminology and to identify the respective cities and author collaborations between countries. Findings Terminological specificities and their contextuality (authors' preferences) are elaborated, as the topic is studied by authors from different disciplinary fields. Compared to other specific tourisms, urban tourism includes geographic terms (variations of city names) and terms with different connotations (travelers, visitors). Recent Spanish (also Portuguese) linguistic/geographic contexts are noticeable and a strong presence of WOS Emerging Sources Citation Index papers. Research perspectives are represented in the network of clusters of connected terms. If the search is based on a narrower sense of strict urban tourism, then tourism-business topics predominate. If tourism and cities are less closely linked, socio-cultural and environmental-spatial perspectives emerge, as does tourism/cities vulnerability (climate change and health issues). Research limitations/implications The construction of a search syntax for the purpose of retrieval is always marked by compromises, given different terminological usages. A narrow search query will miss many relevant documents. On the other hand, if the query is too general, it returns less relevant documents. To this end, this paper tested queries on three different levels of inclusivity or selectivity. More consistent use of terms would benefit authors in the field of urban tourism when searching for references (information retrieval) and, as a consequence, would allow better integration of the field. Practical implications This study provides a practical method for evaluating cities and tourism in combining the expertise of an information scientist and a sociologist. It points out numerous caveats in information retrieval. It offers an overview of publishing just prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, thus providing an opportunity for further comparative studies. Originality/value This study is the first to examine urban tourism using such a method and can serve as a complement to the existing systematization of qualitative approaches. The findings are consistent with numerous qualitative assessments of weak the research interconnection between the specifics of cities and tourism in terms of broader socio-spatial processes. However, the study suggests that such research linkage is increasing, which is noticeable in relation to issues of social sustainability (e.g. overtourism, Airbnb and touristification).","Hocevar, M.; Bartol, T.",International Journal of Tourism Cities,,490

We used a matching procedure designed to create groups of counties that are aligned along age, race, income, population, and urban/rural categories--socio-demographic variables that have been shown to be correlated with COVID-19 outcomes. We find that counties with IHEs that remained primarily online experienced fewer cases and deaths during the Fall 2020 semester; whereas before and after the semester, these two groups had almost identical COVID-19 incidence. Additionally, we see fewer deaths in counties with IHEs that reported conducting any on-campus testing compared to those that reported none. We complement the statistical analysis with a case study of IHEs in Massachusetts--a rich data state in our dataset--which further highlights the importance of IHE-affiliated testing for the broader community. The results in this work suggest that campus testing can itself be thought of as a mitigation policy and that allocating additional resources to IHEs to support efforts to regularly test students and staff would be beneficial to mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the general population.","Klein, Brennan; Generous, Nicholas; Chinazzi, Matteo; Bhadricha, Zarana; Gunashekar, Rishab; Kori, Preeti; Li, Bodian; McCabe, Stefan; Green, Jon; Lazer, David; Marsicano, Christopher R.; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Vespignani, Alessandro",,,490

Data covering about 2 months (March-April 2020) were retrieved from public databases. Infection risk was defined as the ratio between infected and infectious. In a separate sensitivity analysis different models were applied to estimate the number of infectious people per day. The impact of air pollution was assessed through a linear regression on the natural logarithm of infection risk. Risk of COVID-19 mortality was estimated by Poisson regression. Both pollutants were positively correlated with the risk of infection with the coefficient for NO2 being 0.032 and for PM10 0.014. That association was significant for the irritant gas (pâ¯= 0.012) but not for particles (pâ¯= 0.22). Pollutants did not affect COVID-19-related mortality.

316199,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2020,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers with a high incidence rate and adverse complications are related to severe morbidity and mortality around the world. MicroRNAs (miRs) are potential regulators of cellular events, and their aberrant expression occurs in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Increasing evidence demonstrates that plant derived-natural compounds are capable of regulation of miRs in cancer therapy. Curcumin is a naturally occurring nutraceutical compound isolated from curcuma longa and possesses valuable pharmacological activities in which anti-tumor activity is of importance, since in suppressing cancer malignancy, curcumin can target various molecular pathways such as STAT3, PTEN, PI3K/Akt, Wnt, and so on. In the present review, our aim is to shed some light on regulation of miRs by curcumin in GI cancers, and demonstrate how regulation of miRs by curcumin can affect proliferation and metastasis of GI cancers. Noteworthy, curcumin affects down-stream targets such as PTEN, VEGFA, PI3K/Akt and so on that are responsible for growth and migration of GI cancers via regulation of miRs. Affected miRs, and their down-stream targets are discussed in this review in a mechanistic way.

But this approach was tested only on deterministic time series. In this paper piramidal approach is applied to construct prognoses in the case where the time series contains a random component. It is studied the procedure for constructing the forecast value in accordance with the pyramidal method and improved the main criteria of this method. The main idea of the method improving is to find special patterns in the table of finite differences.

We conducted a convergent mixed method analysis of audience responses to actor Tom Hanks' March 11, 2020 disclosure of his COVID-19 diagnosis via social media. We collected our data within 24 hours of his announcement, allowing us to quickly capture emotional and cognitive responses to the announcement and to assess both demographic and psychosocial differences in types of people who heard the news in this time frame and those who had not. In our study, 587 participants had heard the news of Hanks' disclosure while 95 had not. Participants who had heard responded to an open-ended prompt asking if the disclosure affected them at all. Those who had not heard were funneled into a field intervention to test how random assignment to seeing Hanks' disclosure post or not would affect audiences' COVID-19-related emotions, cognitions, and willingness to enact prevention behaviors. The results of this mixed methods study revealed differences in responses to Hanks' disclosure based on health information source trust and involvement with Hanks as well as effects of the intervention on efficacy for dealing with COVID-19.

334572,"Local, state and federal face mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"Background The Connecticut Orthopaedic Institute (COI) conceptualized a Pivot Plan during an elective surgery moratorium at the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic with the goal of planning and executing orthopedic procedures safely. With the resumption of elective surgeries and the continued planning of surgical recovery over the months (and possibly years) to follow, facilities must brace themselves for repeat waves of COVID-19. Thereby, herein we share the Pivot Plan, its implementation process, evaluation of patient safety, and program performance during a pandemic. This could inform the efforts of other institutions seeking to restart non-emergent surgeries during similarly trying times in the future. Methods The COI formed a multidisciplinary team of leaders that met weekly to design a Pivot Plan and a dashboard to guide the resumption of surgeries and assess the performance of the Pivot Plan. The plan revolved around four domains: safety, space, staff, and supplies. It was implemented in two COI-affiliated facilities: MidState Medical Center (MMC) and St. Vincent's Medical Center (SVMC). Monthly metrics from May to November 2020 were compared to the six-month averages for the pre-pandemic baseline period from September 2019 to February 2020. Results The total number (N) of elective orthopaedic cases prior to the pandemic pre-COVID averaged 372 cases per month for MMC and 197 cases for SVMC. During the pandemic post-COVID, N averaging al 361 for MMC and 243 for SVMC illustrates COI was able to perform elective surgeries amid a worsening pandemic. Sameday (SD) discharge rates for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) pre-COVID averaged 8% for MMC and 3% for SVMC. Post-COVID, the SD average was 16.7% for MMC and 11.4% for SVMC. This data indicates that orthopaedic providers were cognizant of length of stay in order to reduce the risk of in-hospital exposure to COVID-19. The 30-day readmission (30R) rate for TJA pre-COVID averaged 1.4% for MMC and 2.7% for SVMC. A high level of care and follow-up is reflected in a lower average 30R post-COVID, 1.1% for both MMC: and SVMC. Transitions for TJA patients to their home settings after surgery also reflect the quality of care and the efficiency of the patient throughput process with necessary precautions in place. Post-COVID, the patient transition to home (T) averaged 98.1% for MMC and 97.5% for SVMC compared to T = 96.8% for MMC: and 88% for SVMC pre-COVID. No patients experienced deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during the time period of the project. Positive COVID-19 diagnosis 23 days after discharge was 0% at MMC and 0.2% at SVMC. Conclusion The COI Pivot Plan was successfully implemented at two different hospitals offering elective orthopaedic surgeries to a varied patient population. The precautions taken by COI were effective in controlling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus while returning to elective orthopaedic surgery. Furthermore, data collected before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that program performance and quality improved.","Vaidya, S.; Berluti, D.; Irving, J.

The aim of this study is to describe characteristics and outcomes of HT recipients infected by SARS-COV-2, from a high-volume transplant center. METHODS: We have described data of all adult HT recipients with confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples from April 5th,2020 to January 5th, 2021. Outcomes and follow-up were recorded until February 5th, 2021. RESULTS: Forty patients were included. Twenty-four patients (60%) were men; the median age was 53 (40-60) years old; median HT time was 34 months and median follow-up time 162 days. The majority needed hospitalization (83%). Immunosuppressive therapy was reduced/withdrawn in the majority of patients, except from steroids, which were maintained. Seventeen patients (42.5%) were classified as having severe disease according to the ordinal scale developed by the WHO Committee. They tended to have lower absolute lymphocyte count (p<0.001) during follow-up when compared to patients with mild disease. Thirty-day mortality was 12.5%. However, a longer follow-up revealed increased later mortality (27.5%), with median time to death around 35 days. Bacterial nosocomial infections were a leading cause of death. Cardiac allograft rejection (10%) and ventricular dysfunction (12.5%) were also not negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Major findings of this study corroborate other cohorts' results, but it also reports significant rate of later events, suggesting that a strict mid-term surveillance is advisable to HT recipients with COVID-19.","Marcondes-Braga, Fabiana G; Murad, Ciro M; Belfort, Deborah S P; Dantas, Rafael C T; Lira, Maria Tereza S S; Aragão, Carlos A S; Siciliano, Rinaldo F; Mangini, Sandrigo; Seguro, Luis Fernando B C; Campos, Iáscara W; Avila, Mônica S; Bello, Mariana V O; Dos Santos, Fernanda B A; Strabelli, Tânia M V; Gaiotto, Fabio A; Bacal, Fernando",Transplantation,,490
335593,Evaluation of COVID-19 RT-qPCR tests in multi-sample pools,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel infectious disease that is in rapid growth. Several trials are going on worldwide to find a solution for this pandemic. The viral replication can be blocked by inhibiting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro) and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). The binding of potential small molecules to these proteins can inhibit the replication and transcription of the virus. The spice molecules that are used in our food have antiviral, antifungal and antimicrobial properties. As spice molecules are consumed in the diet, hence its antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 will benefit in a significant manner. Therefore, in this work, the molecular docking of 30 selected spice molecules (screened through ADME property) was performed to identify the potential inhibitors for the RBD Spro and Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. We have found that though all the molecules bind actively with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and Mpro, but Piperine has the highest binding affinity among the 30 screened molecules. Besides, the comparative study between Piperine and currently used drugs show that Piperine is more effective. The interaction of Piperine with RBD Spro and Mpro is further validated by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The free energy landscape and binding free energy results also, support for the stable complex formation of Piperine with RBD Spro and Mpro. We anticipate immediate wet-lab experiments and clinical trials in support of this computational study that might help to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

339910,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detected in placentas of 2 coronavirus disease 2019–positive asymptomatic pregnant women—case report,2021,"OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of evidence addressing several important human factors questions pertaining to the quality of supportive information provided by commercial manufacturers that can affect the adoption and use of lateral flow serology assays in practice. We aimed to: (1) identify and assess the quality of information that commercial manufacturers provided for their point-of-care tests (POCTs) and (2) examine the implications of these findings on real-world settings. DESIGN: We used a content analysis methodology in two stages to systematically, code and analyse textual data from documents of commercial manufacturers. A deductive approach was applied using a coding guide based on the validated Point-of-Care Key Evidence Tool (POCKET) multidimensional checklist. An inductive approach was used to identify new patterns or themes generated from our textual analysis. SETTING: Publicly available supportive information documents by commercial manufacturers for lateral flow serology, were identified and gathered from online searches. PARTICIPANTS: Supportive information documents retrieved from online searches over 3 months (March 2020 to June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 79 POCTs were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. Using the POCKET coding guide, we found that the quality of information varied significantly between the manufacturers and was often lacking in detail. Our inductive approach further examined these topics and found that several statements were vague and that significant variations in the level of details existed between manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant concerns surrounding the supportive information reported by manufacturers for lateral flow serology assays. Information transparency was poor and human factor issues were not properly addressed to mitigate the risk of improper device use, although it should be noted that the results of our study are limited by the data that manufactures were prepared to disclose. Overall, commercial manufacturers should improve the quality and value of information presented in their supporting documentation.","Kierkegaard, Patrick; McLister, Anna; Buckle, Peter",BMJ Open,,490
340944,Implementation of COVID-19 Provider Resource Task Force: A provider support initiative during emergency preparedness in a quaternary-care center in western Michigan,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to cause a significant public-health burden and disruption globally. Genomic epidemiology approaches point to most countries in the world having experienced many independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic. However, this situation may change with local lockdown policies and restrictions on travel, leading to the emergence of more geographically structured viral populations and lineages transmitting locally. Here, we report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine sampled from early March 2020, when the first cases were observed, through to August of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine fall across the diversity of the global phylogeny, consistent with at least nine independent introductions into the region. We identify one locally predominant lineage in circulation represented by 50 Palestinian SARS-CoV-2, grouping with genomes generated from Israel and the UK. We estimate the age of introduction of this lineage to 05/02/2020 (16/01/2020-19/02/2020), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 was already in circulation in Palestine predating its first detection in Bethlehem in early March. Our work highlights the value of ongoing genomic surveillance and monitoring to reconstruct the epidemiology of COVID-19 at both local and global scales.","Qutob, Nouar; Salah, Zaidoun; Richard, Damien; Darwish, Hisham; Sallam, Husam; Shtayeh, Issa; Najjar, Osama; Ruzayqat, Mahmoud; Najjar, Dana; Balloux, François; van Dorp, Lucy",Microb. genom,,490

However, strong evidence has not been established regarding the optimal timing and preoperative examination for elective laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer in individuals with a previous coronavirus disease 2019 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old Asian man underwent elective laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer 3 weeks after asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019. The postoperative course was good, and none of the surgical staff was infected with coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSION: In this patient infected with coronavirus disease 2019 within 4 weeks of surgery, preoperative venous ultrasound of the lower extremities and a chest computed tomography scan were useful examinations for ensuring a safe surgical procedure for the patient and the staff. Surgery within 4 weeks may be possible with careful selection of cases based on thorough preoperative examination. This report may contribute to the development of a consensus on performing safe elective colectomy for colon cancer in persons previously infected with coronavirus disease 2019.","Tateno, Yuki; Harada, Kimito; Okamoto, Fumiki; Katsuragawa, Hideo",J Med Case Rep,,490

E-government and social media have been used widely during this unprecedented time to spread awareness and educate the public on preventive measures. However, the extent to which the 2 digital platforms bring to improve public health awareness and prevention during a health crisis is unknown. In this study, we examined the influence of e-government and social media on the public's attitude to adopt protective behavior. For this purpose, a Web survey was conducted among 404 Malaysian residents during the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) period in the country. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software. Social media was chosen by most of the respondents (n = 331 or 81.9%) as the source to get information related to COVID-19. Multiple regression analysis suggests the roles of e-government and social media to be significantly related to people's attitudes to engage in protective behavior. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 outbreak, public health decision makers may use e-government and social media platforms as effective tools to improve public engagement on protective behavior.

This study, in which we planned to study the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, aims to reveal the relationship between ""intolerance of uncertainty,"" ""belief in conspiracy theories,"" and ""COVID-19 phobia"" with vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak. Participants were reached via various social media platforms and e-mailing lists for convenience. Data were collected with an online survey using SurveyMonkey application. ""Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12),"" ""Conspiracy Mentality Scale (CMS),"" and ""COVID-19 Phobia Scale"" were applied to 488 participants. Statistical significance level was considered p < 0.05. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-eight people between the ages of 18 and 65 participated. Twenty-one participants were excluded from the analysis due to random marking and unreasonable filling times (< 10 min). In this way, analyzes were made with 467 people. We found a positive correlation between the belief in conspiracy theories and vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05).

352714,A dynamic residential community-based quarantine strategy: China's experience in fighting COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: To clarify the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic features of patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled 681 patients with confirmed cases of severe COVID-19. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: The median age of the study participants was 65 years, 53.2% were male, and 104 (15.3%) died. Age, Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), acute myocardial injury, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CD3 T cells counts were independently associated with death, while arbidol and ribavirin were protective from death. The combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission (AUC = 0.914) predicted mortality better than NLR, CRP, LDH, and acute myocardial injury. There were 312 (45.8%) patients with cardiovascular disease, of whom 23.4% died. ß-blockers, ACEI/ARB, arbidol, and ribavirin might have a beneficial effect for severe COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: The combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission was highly predictive of mortality and survival. Clinicians should adopt more aggressive strategies for patients with a high NLR (>6.66) combined with myocardial injury. ß-blockers and ACEI/ARB, as well as arbidol and ribavirin, were effective in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease.","Chen, Fang-Fang; Zhong, Ming; Liu, Ya; Zhang, Yi; Zhang, Kai; Su, De-Zhen; Meng, Xiao; Zhang, Yun",J Crit Care,,490

There is no information regarding the RA patient health status in Egypt during the COVID-19. Thus,the aim of this work was to study the impact of the pandemic on RA patients through a patient-reported questionnaire and to determine the influence of gender, geographic regions. This multi-centre study initiated by the Egyptian College of Rheumatology (ECR) was conducted on 1037 RA patients attending rheumatology clinics from 10 governorates. The questionnaire provided covered socio-demographic data, health/disease status, information/knowledge about COVID-19 and medical/family history of the infection. Patients mean age was 44.2 ± 12.3 years;855 females and 182 males; 539(52%) from rural and 497(48%) from urban areas. 41.8% reported a striking difficulty to obtain hydroxychloroquine during the pandemic. The majority (70%) considered maintaining a regular visit to the rheumatologist in addition to remote contact mainly by phone (44.4%) or via WhatsApp (33.1%), in particular among male and urban patients. Urban patients were more likely to be infected by COVID-19 (12.9% vs 6.2%; p < 0.0001) than rural.

354910,COVID-19 and ophthalmology: An underappreciated occupational hazard,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic placed public health measures against infectious diseases at the core of global health challenges, especially in cities where more than half of the global population lives. SARS-CoV-2 is an exposure agent recently added to the network of exposures that comprise the human exposome, i.e. the totality of all environmental exposures throughout one's lifetime. At the same time, the application of measures to tackle SARS-CoV-2 transmission leads to changes in the exposome components and in characteristics of urban environments that define the urban exposome, a complementary concept to the human exposome, which focuses on monitoring urban health. This work highlights the use of a comprehensive systems-based approach of the exposome for better capturing the population-wide and individual-level variability in SARS-CoV-2 spread and its associated urban and individual exposures towards improved guidance and response. Population characteristics, the built environment and spatiotemporal features of city infrastructure, as well as individual characteristics/parameters, socioeconomic status, occupation and biological susceptibility need to be simultaneously considered when deploying non-pharmacological public health measures. Integrating individual and population characteristics, as well as urban-specific parameters is the prerequisite in urban exposome studies. Applications of the exposome approach in cities/towns could facilitate assessment of health disparities and better identification of vulnerable populations, as framed by multiple environmental, urban design and planning co-exposures. Exposome-based applications in epidemics control and response include the implementation of exposomic tools that have been quite mature in non-communicable disease research, ranging from biomonitoring and surveillance to sensors and modeling. Therefore, the exposome can be a novel tool in risk assessment and management during epidemics and other major public health events. This is a unique opportunity for the research community to exploit the exposome concept and its tools in upgrading and further developing site-specific public health measures in cities.","Andrianou, Xanthi D; Pronk, Anjoeka; Galea, Karen S; Stierum, Rob; Loh, Miranda; Riccardo, Flavia; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Makris, Konstantinos C",Environ Int,,490
354972,Development of a Standardized Data Collection Tool for Evaluation and Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiologic studies are warranted to improve the disease understanding, evaluate the care procedure and prepare for futures waves. The aim of the study was to describe epidemiologic characteristics associated with hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This real-world, observational, multicenter and retrospective study screened all consecutive patients admitted to 8 Spanish private hospitals. Inclusion criteria: hospitalized adults (age&#8805;18 years old) with clinically and radiologically findings compatible with COVID-19 disease from March 1st to April 5th, 2020. Exclusion criteria: patients presenting negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 during the first 7 days from hospital admission, transfer to a hospital not belonging to the HM consortium, lack of data and discharge against medical advice in emergency departments. RESULTS: One thousand and three hundred thirty-one COVID-19 patients (medium age 66.9 years old; males n= 841, medium length of hospital stayed 8 days, non-survivors n=233) were analyzed. One hundred and fifteen were admitted to intensive care unit (medium length of stay 16 days, invasive mechanical ventilation n= 95, septic shock n= 37 and renal replacement therapy n= 17). Age, male gender, leukocytes, platelets, oxygen saturation, chronic therapy with steroids and treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin were independent factors associated with mortality. The proportion of patients that survive and received tocilizumab and steroids were lesser and higher respectively than those that die, but their association was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Overall crude mortality rate was 17.5%, rising up to 36.5% in the subgroup of patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit. Seven factors impact in hospital mortality. No immunomodulatory intervention were associated with in-hospital mortality.","Cardinal-Fernández, P; Garcia Cuesta, E; Barberán, J; Varona, J F; Estirado, A; Moreno, A; Villanueva, J; Villareal, M; Baez-Pravia, O; Menéndez, J; Villares, P; López Escobar, A; Rodríguez-Pascual, J; Almirall, C; Domínguez, E; Pey, C; Ferreiro, A; Revilla Amores, M; Sánchez, N; Ruiz de Aguiar, S; Castellano, J M",Rev. esp. quimioter,,490
355619,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Afghanistan: Measures and challenges,2020,"BACKGROUND: South Korea took preemptive action against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by implementing extensive testing, thorough epidemiological investigation, strict social distancing, and rapid treatment of patients according to disease severity. The Korean government entrusted large-scale hospitals with the operation of living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) for the management for clinically healthy COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to introduce our experience implementing information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote patient management systems at a COVID-19 LTSC. METHODS: We adopted new electronic health record templates, hospital information system (HIS) dashboards, cloud-based medical image sharing, a mobile app, and smart vital sign monitoring devices. RESULTS: Enhancements were made to the HIS to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the LTSC. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile app to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real time. Cloud-based image sharing enabled interoperability between medical institutions. Korea's strategy of aggressive mitigation has ""flattened the curve"" of the rate of infection. A multidisciplinary approach was integral to develop systems supporting patient care and management at the living and treatment support center as quickly as possible. CONCLUSIONS: Faced with a novel infectious disease, we describe the implementation and experience of applying an ICT-based patient management system in the LTSC affiliated with Seoul National University Hospital. ICT-based tools and applications are increasingly important in health care, and we hope that our experience will provide insight into future technology-based infectious disease responses.","Bae, Ye Seul; Kim, Kyung Hwan; Choi, Sae Won; Ko, Taehoon; Jeong, Chang Wook; Cho, BeLong; Kim, Min Sun; Kang, EunKyo",J Med Internet Res,,490
359808,Different hair loss patterns in two pediatric patients with COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus that has typically resulted in upper respiratory symptoms. However, we have encountered acute arterial and venous thrombotic events after COVID-19 infection. Managing acute thrombotic events from the novel virus has presented unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. In our study, we have highlighted the unique treatment required for these patients and discussed the role of anticoagulation for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The data from 21 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease and acute venous or arterial thrombosis were collected. The demographics, comorbidities, home medications, laboratory markers, and outcomes were analyzed. The primary postoperative outcome of interest was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were primary patency and morbidity. To assess for significance, a univariate analysis was performed using the Pearson &#967;2 and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous variables. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with acute thrombotic events met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most cases were acute arterial events (76.2%), with the remainder venous cases (23.8%). The average age for all patients was 64.6 years, and 52.4% were male. The most prevalent comorbidity in the group was hypertension (81.0%). Several markers were markedly abnormal in both arterial and venous cases, including an elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (8.8) and D-dimer level (4.9 µg/mL). Operative intervention included percutaneous angiography in 25.00% of patients and open surgical embolectomy in 23.8%. Most of the patients who had undergone arterial intervention had developed a postoperative complication (53.9%) compared with a 0% complication rate after venous interventions. Acute kidney injury on admission was a factor in 75.0% of those who died vs 18.2% in the survivors (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: We have described our experience in the epicenter of the pandemic of 21 patients who had experienced major thrombotic events from infection with COVID-19. The findings from our cohort have highlighted the need for increased awareness of the vascular manifestations of COVID-19 and the important role of anticoagulation for these patients. More data are urgently needed to optimize treatment and prevent further vascular complications of COVID-19 infections.","Ilonzo, Nicole; Rao, Ajit; Safir, Scott; Vouyouka, Ageliki; Phair, John; Baldwin, Melissa; Ting, Windsor; Soundararajan, Krishna; Han, Daniel; Tadros, Rami; Marin, Michael; Faries, Peter",J. vasc. surg,,490

363732,Lack of transparency during the COVID-19 pandemic: Nurturing a future and more devastating crisis,2021,"In December 2019, a new type of SARS corona virus emerged from China and caused a globally pandemic corona virus disease (COVID-19). This highly infectious virus has been named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee of the Taxonomy of Viruses. It has severely affected a large population and economy worldwide. Globally various scientific communities have been involved in studying this newly emerged virus and is lifecycle. Multiple diverse studies are in progress to design novel therapeutic agents, in which understanding of interactions between the target and drug ligand is a significant key for this challenge. Structures of proteins involved in the life cycle of the virus have been revealed in RCSB PDB by researchers. In this study, we employed molecular docking study of 4-Acetamido-3-nitrobenzoic acid (ANBA) with corona virus proteins (spike protein, spike binding domain with ACE2 receptor and Main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Single crystal X-ray analysis and density functional theory calculations were carried out for ANBA to explore the structural and chemical-reactive parameters. Intermolecular interactions which are involved in the ligand-protein binding process are validated by Hirshfeld surface analysis. To study the behaviour of ANBA in a living organism and to calculate the physicochemical parameters, ADMET analysis was done using SwissADME and Osiris data warrior tools. Further, Toxicity of ANBA was predicted using pkCSM online software. Based on the molecular docking analysis, we introduce here a potent drug molecule that binds to the COVID-19 proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Vertices give birth at a constant rate (growth), each edge may be removed independently (fragmentation of the tree) and clusters are frozen with a rate proportional to their size (isolation of connected component). A phase transition occurs when the isolation is able to stop the growth fragmentation process and cause extinction. When the process survives, we characterize its growth and prove that the empirical measure of clusters a.s. converges to a limit law on recursive trees. This approach exploits the branching structure associated to the size of clusters, which is inherited from the splitting property of random recursive trees. This issue is motivated by the control of epidemics and contact-tracing where clusters correspond to subtrees of infected individuals that can be identified and isolated.","Bansaye, Vincent; Gu, Chenlin; Yuan, Linglong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05760v1.pdf,490

In addition to excess mortality and the weekly incidence, these include the doubling time $T_2$ and the reproduction number $R_t$. For the latter, various estimates can be found on the website of the Robert-Koch-Institute, see \cite{EstR:RKI}, which are calculated from the case numbers for all of Germany; local differences are not taken into account here. In the present article, the calculations of the RKI on a local level are examined using the example of northern Rhineland-Palatinate and its districts. Here, not the reporting date but the onset of illness is used as a reference for the calculation of $R_t$. For cases where the onset of illness is not known, an adjusted generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) is first fitted to the data for which the reporting delay (difference between the onset of illness and the reporting date) is available and examined for further characteristics such as local as well as demographic differences. This GEV distribution is then used to calculate the reporting delays of incomplete data points. The calculation of the daily value of $R_t$ between the end of February and the end of October showed a similar course of the reproductive rate compared to the nationwide figures. Expectably larger statistical fluctuations were observed in the summer, mainly due to lower case numbers. The values for northern Rhineland-Palatinate have been consistently above $1$ since about mid-September. The calculations can also be transferred to other regions and administrative districts.","Gotz, Thomas; Mohrmann, Silja; Rockenfeller, Robert; Schafer, Moritz; Wijaya, Karunia Putra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08632v1.pdf,490
369307,To relax restrictions: Are communities ready to deal with repeated epidemic waves of COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: One hundred fifty million contagions, more than 3 million deaths and little more than 1 year of COVID-19 have changed our lives and our health management systems forever. Ageing is known to be one of the significant determinants for COVID-19 severity. Two main reasons underlie this: immunosenescence and age correlation with main COVID-19 comorbidities such as hypertension or dyslipidaemia. This study has two aims. The first is to obtain cut-off points for laboratory parameters that can help us in clinical decision-making. The second one is to analyse the effect of pandemic lockdown on epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters concerning the severity of the COVID-19. For these purposes, 257 of SARSCoV2 inpatients during pandemic confinement were included in this study. Moreover, 584 case records from a previously analysed series, were compared with the present study data. RESULTS: Concerning the characteristics of lockdown series, mild cases accounted for 14.4, 54.1% were moderate and 31.5%, severe. There were 32.5% of home contagions, 26.3% community transmissions, 22.5% nursing home contagions, and 8.8% corresponding to frontline worker contagions regarding epidemiological features. Age &gt; 60 and male sex are hereby confirmed as severity determinants. Equally, higher severity was significantly associated with higher IL6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and leukocyte counts, and a lower percentage of lymphocyte, CD4 and CD8 count. Comparing this cohort with a previous 584-cases series, mild cases were less than those analysed in the first moment of the pandemic and dyslipidaemia became more frequent than before. IL-6, CRP and LDH values above 69 pg/mL, 97 mg/L and 328 U/L respectively, as well as a CD4 T-cell count below 535 cells/muL, were the best cut-offs predicting severity since these parameters offered reliable areas under the curve. CONCLUSION: Age and sex together with selected laboratory parameters on admission can help us predict COVID-19 severity and, therefore, make clinical and resource management decisions. Demographic features associated with lockdown might affect the homogeneity of the data and the robustness of the results.","Martin, M.

Data on the clinical course of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients are limited, and the optimal management strategy for these patients is yet unclear. METHODS: We present 53 SOT recipients (31 kidney, 8 liver, 5 heart, 5 lung, 3 liver-kidney and one kidney-after-heart), transplanted at a Swedish high-volume transplant center and each diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 21, 2020, and June 22, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were extracted from the electronic patient files. RESULTS: Patients reported fever (61%), cough (43%), diarrhea (31%), and upper respiratory symptoms (29%). The median age was 56 years, and 57% were male. According to severity, 55% had mild, 13% had moderate, 19% had severe, and 13% had critical disease. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were hospitalized, with 8 requiring intensive care. Thirteen of the 37 patients were initially managed as outpatients but later hospitalized. One patient received hydroxychloroquine, and no patients received antivirals. Antimetabolites and calcineurin inhibitors were held or reduced in two thirds. Twenty-seven out of 37 hospitalized patients (73%) received low molecular weight heparin. Five (13,5%) hospitalized patients died. Overall survival for the entire cohort was 94%. No rejection episodes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization, lowering of immunosuppression, and prophylactic anticoagulation were the most common therapeutic interventions for SOT recipients with COVID-19. A significant proportion of patients could be managed on an outpatient basis, while keeping a low threshold for admission. Mild and moderate disease forms seems to have good outcome.","Felldin, Marie; Søfteland, John Mackay; Magnusson, Jesper; Ekberg, Jana; Karason, Kristjan; Schult, Andreas; Larsson, Hillevi; Oltean, Mihai; Friman, Vanda",Transplantation,,490

Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities. METHODS: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. RESULTS: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average (standard deviation) hourly value of -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. The isolation space was successfully implemented and, as of writing, continues to be operational through the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Skilled nursing facilities can be retrofitted to provide negative pressure isolation space in a reasonable time frame and a cost effective manner to minimize airborne disease transmission within that space.","Miller, Shelly L; Mukherjee, Debanjan; Wilson, Joseph; Clements, Nicholas; Steiner, Cedric",Am. j. infect. control,,490

376498,[Health management of breast cancer patients outside the hospital during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease],2020,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have highlighted the role of host-microbiome interactions in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), resulting in an increasing amount of data mainly focusing on Western patients. Because of the increasing prevalence of IBD in newly industrialized countries such as those in Asia, the Middle East, and South America, there is mounting interest in elucidating the gut microbiota of these populations. We present a comprehensive analysis of several IBD-related biomarkers and gut microbiota profiles and functions of a unique population of patients with IBD and healthy patients from Kazan (Republic of Tatarstan, Russia). METHODS: Blood and fecal IBD biomarkers, serum cytokines, and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content were profiled. Finally, fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota whole-genome sequencing confirmed the presence of classic IBD dysbiotic features at the phylum level, with increased abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia. At the genus level, the abundance of both fermentative (SCFA-producing and hydrogen (H2)-releasing) and hydrogenotrophic (H2-consuming) microbes was affected in patients with IBD. This imbalance was confirmed by the decreased abundance of SCFA species in the feces of patients with IBD and the change in anaerobic index, which mirrors the redox status of the intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses highlighted how IBD-related dysbiotic microbiota-which are generally mainly linked to SCFA imbalance-may affect other important metabolic pathways, such as H2 metabolism, that are critical for host physiology and disease development.","Lo Sasso, Giuseppe; Khachatryan, Lusine; Kondylis, Athanasios; Battey, James N D; Sierro, Nicolas; Danilova, Natalia A; Grigoryeva, Tatiana V; Markelova, Maria I; Khusnutdinova, Dilyara R; Laikov, Alexander V; Salafutdinov, Ilnur I; Romanova, Yulia D; Siniagina, Mariia N; Vasiliev, Ilya Yu; Boulygina, Eugenia A; Solovyeva, Valeriya V; Garanina, Ekaterina E; Kitaeva, Kristina V; Ivanov, Konstantin Y; Chulpanova, Darja S; Kletenkov, Konstantin S; Valeeva, Alina R; Odintsova, Alfiya Kh; Ardatskaya, Maria D; Abdulkhakov, Rustam A; Ivanov, Nikolai V; Peitsch, Manuel C; Hoeng, Julia; Abdulkhakov, Sayar R",Inflamm. bowel dis,,490
378559,Return to Work During COVID-19: Temperature Screening is No Panacea,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Measuring the attitudes of health professionals in two Maghreb countries (Tunisia and Algeria) with regard to the response to COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020. METHODS: This scoping study was based on a ""Google Form"" covering three constituents of the response plan against COVID-19: responders, activities and crisis communication. The attitudes of health professionals who are working in Tunisia and Algeria were measured through the Likert scale with four propositions, grouped in pairs, during the analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 280 health professionals, 170 of whom are Tunisians along with 110 Algerians. The medians of age and that of professional seniority are, respectively, 37 and 10 years. The role of ""health workers"", ""Mass Media"" and ""civil society associations"" was found to be satisfactory according, respectively, to 92%, 71%, and 55% of the respondents. As far as 72% of health professionals are concerned, the ""barrier measures"" were respected by the population. Approximately, seven in ten respondents were satisfied with the quality of communication occuring between the Ministries of Health and its epidemiological structures. CONCLUSION: Health professionals of the Maghreb working in Tunisia and Algeria had a generally positive perception of the role of population responders, community engagement, and the quality of official communication in regards to the response plan against COVID- 19. This perception would be a prerequisite for the success of community participation and multisectoral action as well as essential in the strategy of prevention and control of this pandemic and of possible other health emergencies.","Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Benzarti, Sofien; Nouira, Sarra; Mlouki, Imen; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Ben Abdelaziz, Islem; Yahia, Faten; Barhoumi, Tarek; Soulimane, Abdelkrim",Tunis Med,,490
380528,"COVID-19 Testing Results by HIV Status, March-July 2020, Chicago, USA",2021,"Contact tracing apps running on mobile devices promise to reduce the manual effort required for identifying infection chains and to increase the tracing accuracy in the presence of COVID-19. Several contract tracing apps have been proposed or deployed in practice. Also Google and Apple have announced their joint effort of providing an API for exposure notification in order to implement decentralized contract tracing apps using Bluetooth Low Energy, the so-called""Google/Apple Proposal"", which we abbreviate by""GAP"". Some countries have already decided or are planning to base their contact tracing apps on GAP. Several researchers have pointed out potential privacy and security risks related to most of the contact tracing approaches proposed until now, including those that claim privacy protection and are based on GAP. This report makes a first attempt towards providing empirical evidence in real-world scenarios for two such risks discussed in the literature: one concerning privacy, and the other one concerning security. In particular, we focus on a practical analysis of GAP, given that it is the foundation of several tracing apps. We demonstrate that in real-world scenarios the current GAP design is vulnerable to (i) profiling and possibly de-anonymizing infected persons, and (ii) relay-based wormhole attacks that principally can generate fake contacts with the potential of significantly affecting the accuracy of an app-based contact tracing system. For both types of attack, we have built tools that can be easily used on mobile phones or Raspberry Pis (e.g., Bluetooth sniffers). We hope that our findings provide valuable input in the process of testing and certifying contact tracing apps, e.g., as planned for the German Corona-Warn-App, ultimately guiding improvements for secure and privacy-preserving design and implementation of digital contact tracing systems.","Baumgartner, Lars; Dmitrienko, Alexandra; Freisleben, Bernd; Gruler, Alexander; Hochst, Jonas; Kuhlberg, Joshua; Mezini, Mira; Miettinen, Markus; Muhamedagic, Anel; Nguyen, Thien Duc; Penning, Alvar; Pustelnik, Dermot Frederik; Roos, Filipp; Sadeghi, Ahmad-Reza; Schwarz, Michael; Darmstadt, Christian Uhl TU; Marburg, Philipps-Universitat; Wurzburg, JMU",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05914v1.pdf,490

We describe our management of a peri-viable pregnant patient requiring intubation; discussion includes pharmacologic interventions, mechanical ventilation adjustments, and consideration of fetal interventions, including delivery timing. Case: A 36-year-old, gravida 2, para 1 woman positive for COVID-19 at 23â¯weeks of gestation with severe disease required admission to the intensive care unit and intubation. She completed 5â¯days of hydroxychloroquine and 7â¯days of prednisone. She was successfully intubated after 8â¯days and discharged home in a stable condition without preterm delivery on hospital day 11. Conclusion: Fortunately, the patient responded to aggressive respiratory support with intubation and mechanical ventilation early upon presentation. It is unclear whether our institution's empiric use of hydroxychloroquine and prednisone facilitated her recovery. We hope that our report helps other institutions navigate the complex care surrounding pregnant patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care.","Hong, Leah; Smith, Nicolina; Keerthy, Madhurima; Lee-Griffith, Monica; Garcia, Robyn; Shaman, Majid; Goyert, Gregory",Case Rep Womens Health,,490
387201,112. A Quality Management Project of a Midwestern Academic HIV Clinic Operation During COVID-19: Implementation Strategy and Preliminary Outcomes,2020,"A series of strict lockdown measures were implemented in the areas of China worst affected by coronavirus disease 19, including Wuhan, to prevent the disease spreading. The lockdown had a substantial environmental impact, because traffic pollution and industrial emissions are important factors affecting air quality and public health in the region. After the lockdown, the average monthly air quality index (AQI) in Wuhan was 59.7, which is 33.9% lower than that before the lockdown (January 23, 2020) and 47.5% lower than that during the corresponding period (113.6) from 2015 to 2019. Compared with the conditions before the lockdown, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by 36.9% and remained the main pollutant. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) showed the largest decrease of approximately 53.3%, and ozone (O3) increased by 116.6%. The proportions of fixed-source emissions and transported external-source emissions in this area increased. After the lockdown, O3 pollution was highly negatively correlated with the NO2 concentration, and the radiation increase caused by the PM2.5 reduction was not the main reason for the increase in O3. This indicates that the generation of secondary pollutants is influenced by multiple factors and is not only governed by emission reduction.","Lian, Xinbo; Huang, Jianping; Huang, Rujin; Liu, Chuwei; Wang, Lina; Zhang, Tinghan",Sci Total Environ,,490

This study was aimed to investigate the diversity and evolution of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with progression of the pandemic over time and to identify similarities and differences of viral diversity and evolution across geographical regions (countries). Methods: Publicly available data on type definitions based on whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 sampled during December and March 2020 from 3636 infected patients spread over 55 countries were collected. Phylodynamic analyses were performed and the temporal and spatial evolution of the virus was examined. Results: It was found that (i) temporal variation in frequencies of types of the coronavirus was significant; ancestral viruses of type O were replaced by evolved viruses belonging to type A2a; (ii) spatial variation was not significant; with the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the dominant virus was the A2a type virus in every geographical region; (iii) within a geographical region, there was significant micro-level variation in the frequencies of the different viral types, and (iv) the evolved coronavirus of type A2a swept rapidly across all continents.

Whether the alveolar compartmentalization of biomarkers has a clinical significance in patients with pneumonia-related ARDS is unknown. This study aimed at assessing the interrelation of ARDS/sepsis biomarkers in the alveolar and blood compartments and explored their association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Immunocompetent patients with pneumonia-related ARDS admitted between 2014 and 2018 were included in a prospective monocentric study. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and blood samples were obtained within 48 h of admission. Twenty-two biomarkers were quantified in BAL fluid and serum. HLA-DR+ monocytes and CD8+ PD-1+ lymphocytes were quantified using flow cytometry. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was hospital mortality. Patients undergoing a bronchoscopy as part of routine care were included as controls. RESULTS: Seventy ARDS patients were included. Hospital mortality was 21.4%. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-8 was 20 times higher in ARDS patients than in controls (p < 0.0001). ARDS patients with shock had lower BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra (p = 0.026), IL-6 (p = 0.002), IP-10/CXCL10 (p = 0.024) and IL-10 (p = 0.023) than others. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra was more elevated in hospital survivors than decedents (p = 0.006), even after adjusting for SOFA and driving pressure (p = 0.036). There was no significant association between alveolar or alveolar/blood monocytic HLA-DR or CD8+ lymphocytes PD-1 expression and hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 was the most compartmentalized cytokine and lower BAL fluid-to-serum concentration ratios of IL-1Ra were associated with hospital mortality in patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS.","Bendib, Inès; Beldi-Ferchiou, Asma; Schlemmer, Frédéric; Surenaud, Mathieu; Maitre, Bernard; Plonquet, Anne; Carteaux, Guillaume; Razazi, Keyvan; Godot, Veronique; Hüe, Sophie; Mekontso Dessap, Armand; de Prost, Nicolas",Crit Care,,490

396080,Preliminary Recommendations for Lung Surgery during SARS-CoV-2 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Epidemic Period [Chinese],2020,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing and public policy have been crucial to minimizing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. Publicly available, county-level time series data on mobility are derived from individual GPS-devices, providing a variety of indices of social distancing behavior per day. Such indices allow a fine-grained approach to modeling public behavior during the pandemic. Previous studies of social distancing and policy have not accounted for the occurrence of pre-policy social distancing and other dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of public mobility data. OBJECTIVE: We propose a differential equation state-space model of county-level social distancing that accounts for distancing behavior leading up to the first official policies, equilibrium dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of mobility, and the specific impacts of four kinds of policy. The model is fit to each US county individually, producing a nation-wide data set of novel, estimated mobility indices. METHODS: A differential equation model was fit to three indicators of mobility for each of N=3054 counties, with T=100 occasions per county of: distance traveled, visitations to key sites, and the log number of interpersonal encounters. The indicators were highly correlated and assumed to share common underlying latent trajectory, dynamics, and responses to policy. Maximum likelihood estimation with the Kalman-Bucy filter was used to estimate the model parameters. Bivariate distributional plots and descriptive statistics were used to examine the resulting county-level parameter estimates. The association of chronology with policy impact was also considered. RESULTS: Mobility dynamics show moderate correlations with two census covariates: population density (Spearman's r ranging from .11 to .31) and median household income (Spearman's r ranging from -.03 to .39). Stay-at-home order effects were negatively correlated with both (r=-.37 and r=-.38 respectively) while the effects of the ban on all gatherings were positively correlated with both (r=.51, r=.39). Chronological ordering of policies was a moderate to strong determinant of their effect per county (Spearman's r ranging from -.12 to -.56), with earlier policies accounting for most of the change in mobility, and later policies having little or no additional effect. CONCLUSIONS: Chronological ordering, population density, and median household income were all associated with policy impact. The stay-at-home order and the ban on gatherings had the largest impacts on mobility on average. The model is implemented in a graphical online app for exploring county-level statistics and running counterfactual simulations. Future studies can incorporate the model-derived indices of social distancing and policy impacts as important social determinants of COVID-19 health outcomes.","McKee, Kevin L; Crandell, Ian C; Hanlon, Alexandra L",,,490

With unique panel data collected in the course of the COVID-19 in South Korea and the use of individual fixed-effects models, we examined how social trust in various social institutions changed and identified a causal effect of crisis management on social trust. According to the results, trust in South Korean society, people, and the central and local governments improved substantially, whereas trust in judicature, the press, and religious organizations sharply decreased. Improvement in trust in the central and local governments was associated with proactive responses to the pandemic crisis, and failure to take appropriate actions was responsible for the deteriorating trust in religious organizations. These findings illustrate the importance of risk management in trust formation and imply that South Korea may be transforming from a low-trust to a high-trust society.","Kye, Bongoh; Hwang, Sun-Jae",Res.

To date, however, no effective treatments or enough vaccines for COVID-19 are available. The roles of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike protein in the treatment of COVID-19 are major areas of research. In this study, we explored the potential of ACE2 and spike protein as targets for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed clinical data, genetic data, and receptor binding capability. Clinical data revealed that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities related to an abnormal renin-angiotensin system exhibited more early symptoms and poorer prognoses. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 progression is still not clear. Furthermore, if ACE2 is not a good targetable protein, it would not be applicable across a wide range of populations. The spike-S1 receptor-binding domain that interacts with ACE2 showed various amino acid mutations based on sequence analysis. We identified two spike-S1 point mutations (V354F and V470A) by receptor-ligand docking and binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These variants enhanced the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 receptors and were potentially associated with increased infectivity. Importantly, the number of patients infected with the V354F and V470A mutants has increased with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These results suggest that ACE2 and spike-S1 are likely not ideal targets for the design of peptide drugs to treat COVID-19 in different populations.","Shu, Chuan-Jun; Huang, Xuan; Tang, Hui-Hao; Mo, Ding-Ding; Zhou, Jian-Wei; Deng, Cheng",Zool Res,,490

409300,Impact of COVID-19 second wave on healthcare worker staffing levels,2020,"Background: The COVID19 pandemic has necessitated innovative ways to provide safe healthcare remotely for large numbers of infected patients. We implemented a COVID Virtual Clinic (CVC) in a tertiary referral centre allowing such patients to be monitored in the community. This study describes the CVC's remote monitoring experience and explores the predictors of need for specialist intervention. Methods: We included all patients enrolled in the CVC at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin between March 1st and June 1st 2020. Patients received a Bluetooth-enabled pulse oximeter and smartphone application (Patient-M-Power®) and uploaded twice-daily SpO2 readings, heart rate and dyspnoea score (1-10). A team of 2-14 healthcare providers monitored results. Abnormal or absent data triggered calls from the CVC, with assessments and/or admission as required. We collected data on demographics, calls received from/made to patients, outcomes and readmissions. Descriptive analysis of the CVC was performed as well as simple logistic regression to explore factors associated with the likelihood of readmission. Results: 502 patients were included (179 (36.4%) male, median age 39 (IQR 50-3) years, 360 (73.2%) staff). Outcomes are illustrated in Figure 1. Median time in CVC was 12 days (IQR 13-10). 1902 calls were made to patients by CVC staff prompted by abnormal data: dyspnoea (41 patients, 8.2%), low SpO2 (133, 26.5%), tachycardia, (99, 19.7%), technical issues (81, 16.1%), absent results (255, 50.1%). This resulted in 45 (9%) patients requiring re-assessment and 42 (8.4%) being readmitted. Of those readmitted, 3 (7%) required critical care admission. Median length of stay was 2 (IQR 6.75-1) days. Those readmitted were more likely to be older (odds ratio [OR] per year older 1.03 (1.01, 1.05), P=0.0050, have an abnormal SpO2 (&lt;94%, OR 5.43 [2.93, 11.1], P&lt;0.001), a high dyspnoea score (&gt;7, OR 4.33 (2.04, 9.3), P&lt;0.001) and be staff (OR 6.08 (3.11, 11.87), P&lt;0.001). Neither gender nor abnormal HR were associated with higher likelihood of readmission. 22.2% of presenting patients were hypoxic in the absence of dyspnoea, of which 70% required admission and one patient required intensive care. Conclusion: We describe the largest remotely monitored cohort of COVID19 patients to date. The low frequency of readmissions and value of SpO2 monitoring and dyspnoea scores as predictors of readmission highlights the value of this model in providing safe care whilst minimising unnecessary admissions.","Connolly, S.

414594,India fights hard to neutralize the spread of COVID-19,2020,"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus. In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus. COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive. In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future.","Rokni, Mohsen; Ghasemi, Vida; Tavakoli, Zahra",Rev Med Virol,,490

The purpose of our study was to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and use of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of patients with COVID-19 through the hospital system in Ontario. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and hospital health care capacity. Our outcomes included the number of patients who needed admission to the ward or to the intensive care unit (ICU) with or without the need for mechanical ventilation, number of days to resource depletion, number of patients awaiting resources and number of deaths. RESULTS: We found that with effective early public health measures, hospital system resources would not be depleted. For scenarios with late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, hospital resources would be depleted within 14-26 days, and in the worst case scenario, 13 321 patients would die while waiting for needed resources. Resource depletion would be avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to increase ICU, ventilator and acute care hospital capacities. INTERPRETATION: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures, the Ontario hospital system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19 despite a rapid increase in capacity. This lack of hospital resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease using public health measures and by increasing hospital capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its hospitals.","Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Naimark, David M J; Sander, Beate",CMAJ,,490

Perspectives from an integrated behavior change model,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In the Swiss canton of Valais, the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected on 28 February 2020. Discharged patients' and their family caregivers' experiences in relation to safety, quality of care, trust and communication during the COVID-19 hospitalisation period remain unexplored. The study aims to collect the patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) survey of patients discharged during the COVID-19 pandemic and their family caregivers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients aged &#8805;18 years, hospitalised between 28 February and 11 May 2020 and then discharged home, plus their family caregivers will be invited to complete a self-administrated questionnaire made up of 14 closed questions and 1 open-ended question. The questionnaire will include items on the patient's hospital trajectory and assess the interpersonal trust placed in nurses and physicians based on Krajewska-Kulak et al's Trust in Nurse Scale and Anderson et al's Trust in Physician Scale. Participants' perceived stress will be assessed using Cohen et al's Perceived Stress Scale. Feelings of safety will be examined based on Dryhurst et al's questionnaire on Risk Perception During Pandemics. After ethical clearance, data will be collected using a postal paper questionnaire and via an online web link. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be computed, and the open question will undergo a qualitative thematic analysis. We will analyse perceptions of the different hospital trajectories experienced by patients undergoing surgery with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of Vaud (2020-02025) authorised this study. Gathering experiences and learning about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social determinants of health among discharged patients and families fit in well with the Triple Aim framework and the PREMs survey.

In this case study, the challenge is to determine a schedule that attempts to meet the contractual working time of the employees, considering the fact that they must be divided into mutually exclusive groups to reduce the risk of contagion. To solve the problem, we propose a mixed integer linear programming formulation (MILP). The solution obtained indicates that optimal schedule attained by our model is better than the one generated by the company. In addition, we performed tests on random instances of larger size to evaluate the scalability of the formulation. In most cases, the results found using an open-source MILP solver suggest that high quality solutions can be achieved within an acceptable CPU time. We also project that our findings can be of general interest for other personnel scheduling problems, especially during emergency scenarios such as those related to Covid-19 pandemic.","Zucchi, Giorgio; Iori, Manuel; Subramanian, Anand",Optim Lett,,490

METHODS: The TECC study will assess the acceptability and efficacy of this model of care in 50 participants as compared to an age and gender matched cohort of patients presenting with similar clinical severity of depression, anxiety, or psychotic symptoms. Participants will be recruited from clinics in the metro Boston area. Aspects of TECC will be conducted in both Spanish and English, in order to ensure wide access to care for multiple populations. RESULTS: The results of the TECC study will be used to support or adapt this model of care and create training resources to ensure its dissemination. The study results will be posted on ClincialTrails.gov with primary outcomes related to changes in mood, anxiety, and stress and secondary related to engagement, alliance, and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: TECC combines new digital mental health technology with updated clinical protocols and workflows designed to ensure patients can benefit from innovation in digital mental health. Supporting multiple language, TECC is designed to ensure digital health equity and highlight how mobile health can bridge, not expand, gaps in care for underserved populations.

Infrared thermometers (IRT) are fast, convenient and ease to use. Two types of infrared thermometers are uses to measure body temperature: tympanic and forehead. With the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus, forehead temperature measurement is used widely to screen people for the illness. The performance of this type of device and the criteria for screening are worth studying. This study evaluated the performance of two types of tympanic infrared thermometers and an industrial infrared thermometer. The results showed that these infrared thermometers provide good precision. A fixed offset between tympanic and forehead temperature were found. The measurement values for wrist temperature show significant offsets with the tympanic temperature and cannot be used to screen fevers. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for the measurement of body temperature using an infrared thermometer was proposed. The suggestion threshold for the forehead temperature is 36 °C for screening of fever. The body temperature of a person who is possibly ill is then measured using a tympanic infrared thermometer for the purpose of a double check.","Chen, Hsuan-Yu; Chen, Andrew; Chen, Chiachung",,,490

GICA and ELISA were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 86 serum samples, including 5 influenza A virus (Flu A) IgM-positive sera, 5 influenza B virus (Flu B) IgM-positive sera, 5 Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM-positive sera, 5 Legionella pneumophila IgM-positive sera, 6 sera of HIV infection patients, 36 rheumatoid factor IgM (RF-IgM)-positive sera, 5 sera from hypertensive patients, 5 sera from diabetes mellitus patients, and 14 sera from novel coronavirus infection disease 19 (COVID-19) patients. The interference factors causing false-positive reactivity with the two methods were analyzed, and the urea dissociation test was employed to dissociate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive serum using the best dissociation concentration. The two methods detected positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 22 mid-to-high-level-RF-IgM-positive sera and 14 sera from COVID-19 patients; the other 50 sera were negative. At a urea dissociation concentration of 6 mol/liter, SARS-CoV-2 IgM results were positive in 1 mid-to-high-level-RF-IgM-positive serum and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using GICA. At a urea dissociation concentration of 4 mol/liter and with affinity index (AI) levels lower than 0.371 set to negative, SARS-CoV-2 IgM results were positive in 3 mid-to-high-level-RF-IgM-positive sera and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using ELISA. The presence of RF-IgM at mid-to-high levels could lead to false-positive reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM detected using GICA and ELISA, and urea dissociation tests would be helpful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 IgM false-positive results.","Wang, Qiang; Du, Qin; Guo, Bin; Mu, Daiyong; Lu, Xiaolan; Ma, Qiang; Guo, Yangliu; Fang, Li; Zhang, Bing; Zhang, Guoyuan; Guo, Xiaolan",J. clin. microbiol,,490

The relationship between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 infection was systematically reviewed. To identify relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria, unrestricted searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted. The search strategy included clinical date published until May 9, 2020. Twelve articles involving more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases were included. To estimate overall risk, random-effects models were adopted. Our results showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.99; 95 % CI, 0-1.04; P = 0.672). Among those with COVID-19 infection, ACEI/ARB exposure was also not associated with a higher risk of having severe infection (OR = 0.98; 95 % CI, 0.87-1.09; P = 0.69) or mortality (OR = 0.73, 95 %CI, 0.5-1.07; P = 0.111). However, ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.48, 95 % CI, 0.29-0.81; P = 0.006). In conclusion, current evidence did not confirm the concern that ACEI/ARB exposure is harmful in patientswith COVID-19 infection. This study supports the current guidelines that discourage discontinuation of ACEIs or ARBs in COVID-19 patients and the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Xue; Yu, Jiong; Pan, Li-Ya; Jiang, Hai-Yin",Pharmacol Res,,490

438761,"Reply to ""COVID-19 pandemic and home-based physical activity""",2020,"BACKGROUND: The spectrum of neurological involvement in COVID-19 is not thoroughly understood. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review with meta-analysis and a sub-group comparison between severe and non-severe cases has been published. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of neurological manifestations and complications, identify the neurodiagnostic findings, and compare these aspects between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was conducted for studies published between the 1st of January 2020 and 22nd of April 2020. In addition, we scanned the bibliography of included studies to identify other potentially eligible studies. The criteria for eligibility included studies published in English language (or translated to English), those involving patients with COVID-19 of all age groups, and reporting neurological findings. Data were extracted from eligible studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled percentages and means with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of individual studies on the summary estimate. A subgroup analysis was conducted according to severity. The main outcomes of the study were to identify the frequency and nature of neurological manifestations and complications, and the neuro-diagnostic findings in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: 44 articles were included with a pooled sample size of 13,480 patients. The mean age was 50.3 years and 53% were males. The most common neurological manifestations were: Myalgia (22.2, 95% CI, 17.2 to 28.1%), taste impairment (19.6, 95% CI, 3.8 to 60.1%), smell impairment (18.3, 95% CI, 15.4 to 76.2%), headache (12.1, 95% CI, 9.1 to 15.8%), dizziness (11.3, 95% CI, 8.5 to 15.0%), and encephalopathy (9.4, 95% CI, 2.8 to 26.6%). Nearly 2.5% (95% CI, 1 to 6.1%) of patients had acute cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). Myalgia, elevated CK and LDH, and acute CVD were significantly more common in severe cases. Moreover, 20 case reports were assessed qualitatively, and their data presented separately. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological involvement is common in COVID-19 patients. Early recognition and vigilance of such involvement might impact their overall outcomes.","Yassin, Ahmed; Nawaiseh, Mohammed; Shaban, Ala; Alsherbini, Khalid; El-Salem, Khalid; Soudah, Ola; Abu-Rub, Mohammad",BMC Neurol,,490

This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 among university students as well as its associated factors. METHOD: This is a cross sectional study that was conducted among students in a public university during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. An online validated self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis test was used to determine the association between independent variables with knowledge, attitude, and practice score. RESULTS: Overall response rate of this study was 92.9 (n=524). Median score of knowledge domain was 78.0 (IQR= ±12.0), median attitude score of 49.0 (IQR= ±5.0), and median practice score of 80.0 (IQR= ±11.0). The mean knowledge, attitude and practice score were significantly higher among diploma holder (vs degree holder, p<0.05), residing in main Kota Kinabalu campus (vs non-KK campus, p<0.001), studying in medical faculty (vs non-medical faculty, p<0.001), and attended COVID-19 education (vs non-attendance; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related knowledge and attitude were below satisfactory level during earlier phase of the pandemic.

Here, we present a case of viral persistence for over 19 weeks in a patient with a history of solid organ transplant and explore the clinical, virologic, and immunologic course. Our patient still demonstrated viral persistence at 138 days with low polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values and evidence of continuing viral sequence evolution indicative of ongoing virus replication. These findings have important implications for infection prevention and control recommendations in immunosuppressed patients. Immune response, including neutralizing antibody titers, T cell activity, and cytokine levels, peaked around days 44-72 after diagnosis. Anti-S trimer antibodies were low at all time points, and T cell response was attenuated by day 119. As immune response waned and viral load increased, increased genetic diversity emerged, suggesting a mechanism for the development of viral variants.","Purpura, Lawrence J.; Chang, Michelle Annavajhala Medini K.; Mohri, Hiroshi Liu Lihong Shah Jayesh Cantos Anyelina Medrano Nicola Laracy Justin Scully Brian Miko Benjamin A.; Habal, Marlena Pereira Marcus R.; Tsuji, Moriya Ho David D.; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin Yin Michael T.",American Journal of Transplantation,,490
442438,Childhood Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome - A New Challenge in the Pandemic,2020,"Probiotics are known to modulate gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function and host immune response, but due to the species and strain specific response their mechanisms are not clearly understood. Thus, the present study was designed to isolate, assess the anti-inflammatory potential and underlying modulatory mechanisms of indigenous probiotics in murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Forty lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from different sources and monitored for their anti-inflammatory potential against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory stress employing RAW 264.7 cells. Among these isolates, only four LAB isolates exhibited more than 90% nitric oxide inhibition and possessed the probiotic attributes. Further, these selected LAB isolates reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß and IL-6, inhibited the phosphorylation of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) i.e. p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The in vitro analysis suggested that the selected probiotic isolates attenuated the LPS-induced inflammation by downregulating MAPK pathway vis-a-vis inhibiting COX-2 and can be employed as anti-inflammatory agents in various inflammatory diseases.","Khanna, Sakshi; Bishnoi, Mahendra; Kondepudi, Kanthi Kiran; Shukla, Geeta",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,,490
443144,Characterizing coinfection in children with COVID-19: A dual center retrospective analysis,2020,"The changing global geopolitical circumstances (with a revisionist Russia, a rising and more assertive China, a withdrawing United States with values increasingly different from those of Europe, the instability coming from the East and the Southern Mediterranean, the consummation of Brexit ) are the contextual backdrop of the European Union, and following the adoption of its Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy it has developed a series of political and institutional tools to support its strategic autonomy in the field of security and defence (Action Plans, EU-NATO cooperation, permanent structured cooperation, the European Initiative for Intervention ) To these instruments can be added others provided for in the Lisbon Treaty (2009), such as the solidarity and mutual assistance clauses, the latter invoked after the Daesh attack in Paris in November 2015, as a defensive alliance to guarantee security in European countries All this is in line with the level of ambition set by the Member States, which ranges from protecting their neighbourhood to becoming a universal provider of global security -in this respect one notes the Franco-German leadership in defence German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron approved a Declaration in June 2018 at the Chateau de Meseberg that included majority voting in foreign policy, security and defence matters in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making In addition, it advocated the European Intervention Initiative and new formats such as a European Security Council, as well as strengthening European coordination within the United Nations and the development of a European fighter jet Based on this context that is outlined in previous lines, in which diverse variables and actors concur and from the perspective offered by the science of international relations, our object of study is articulated that aspires to verify if the changes from a world order based on rules to another truffle of hard power, require a step forward for the European Union with a common strategic culture, analysed from a constructivist approach (Meyer, 2007 y 2004), along with greater leadership and political will In other words, in the current international context is ensuring the security and defence of Europe autonomously a necessity for the European Union? Consequently, would NATO support be reduced? At the moment, the Union needs NATO, but it cannot neglect its own capabilities In order to articulate our research proposal, we place ourselves in one of the levels of analysis specific to international relations, on the plane of micro-internationality (Calduch, 1991, p 13), which would be identified with that of the European Union's foreign policy and the challenges it faces And also in a temporal framework that responds to the line of action that has been developed since the adoption of the Global Strategy in 2016 until the present moment with a Union that is committed to a""geopolitical"" Europe From an explanatory perspective, supported by consultation of current sources (primary and derived), the analysis is structured as follows: I) The starting point is to examine the complex and uncertain international and European scenario, from which global and regional challenges emerge, with the risk of further conflicts We explain this context from the instability coming from the East, the Balkans and the Southern Mediterranean, as well as the references to the Trump Administration and the process commonly known as Brexit 2) To subsequently define what is meant by strategic autonomy in the context of that European Global Strategy and to delimit the variables of analysis This autonomy has its immediate antecedent in the Saint Malo Agreement (1998) In that agreement, both the United Kingdom and France agreed that the EU should have the capacity for ""autonomous action"", supported by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them and a preparation to do so This is with the aim of responding to international crises, and under French-Britis sponsorship the 1999 Cologne European Council introduced ""autonomy of action"" with the purpose of acting in international crises included in the Treaties, either when NATO does not do so, as an independent actor, or together with the Atlantic Alliance 3) The foregoing considerations are complemented and contextualised by the institutionalist approach (Smith, 2004) that provides the study with the different political and institutional instruments that the Union is adopting in the face of the need to promote the generation of civilian and military capabilities, as well as to assess their suitability or otherwise for promoting European strategic autonomy All of this is aimed at strengthening European unity and giving coherence to external action within the framework of one of its founding pillars, such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), launched at the Cologne Council in 1999 and renamed the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) by the Lisbon Treaty, which called for the adoption of measures to increase EU-NATO cooperation 4) Finally, fulfilling a practical function, the conclusion is to assess whether or not the Union's evolutionary process in this field is fulfilling its capacities and conditions, and to discern how the next stage should be approached In this regard, we must assimilate those facts that will impact on the course and pace of the integration process and, therefore, on this desire for strategic autonomy, we refer to the departure of the United Kingdom (Brexit), the economic difficulties of certain European countries of the South in balancing their economic balance and the consequent reaction of the creditor countries of the North, the different perception of the threats and risks of the countries of the North in the face of Russian pressure or those of the South that have to deal with immigration pressure, the expansion of jihadist terrorism or the social and economic crisis caused by the COVID- 19 coronavirus pandemic For its part, the European Council, held in June 2018, ratified the will of the Member States to continue taking decisive steps to boost European defence, increase strategic autonomy and complement and strengthen NATO activities","Benedicto, Solsona; Miguel, Angel; Molina, Garcia; Maria, Jose",Relaciones Internacionales-Madrid,,490

In response to the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients in Japan, we launched an ECMO support team comprised of multidisciplinary experts including physicians, nurses, perfusionists, and bioethicists in preparation for the threat of a pandemic. From April 2 to July 15, 2020, Tokyo Medical and Dental University hospital treated 104 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. Among those, 34 patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and 5 patients required VV ECMO. All management related to ECMO was decided by the ECMO support team in addition to participation of the ECMO support team in daily multidisciplinary rounds in the ICU. Median age was 54 years old. Duration from onset to mechanical ventilation (MV) and MV to ECMO were 8 and 7 days, respectively. Four patients (80%) were successfully weaned off from ECMO. One patient died after 81 days of ECMO run. Four patients were discharged and recovered to their prehospital quality of life without major disability. We achieved a high survival rate using ECMO in our low volume ECMO institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multidisciplinary decision-making and a team approach for the unclear pathology with an emerging infectious disease was effective and contributed to the survival rate.","Nagaoka, Eiki; Arai, Hirokuni; Ugawa, Toyomu; Masuda, Takahiro; Ochiai, Kanae; Tamaoka, Meiyo; Kurashima, Naoki; Oi, Keiji; Fujiwara, Tatsuki; Yoshida, Masayuki; Shigemitsu, Hidenobu; Otomo, Yasuhiro",Artif. organs,,490

444160,How we mitigated and contained the COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center: Lessons and experience,2020,"Knowledge bases (KBs) and text often contain complementary knowledge: KBs store structured knowledge that can support long range reasoning, while text stores more comprehensive and timely knowledge in an unstructured way. Separately embedding the individual knowledge sources into vector spaces has demonstrated tremendous successes in encoding the respective knowledge, but how to jointly embed and reason with both knowledge sources to fully leverage the complementary information is still largely an open problem. We conduct a large-scale, systematic investigation of aligning KB and text embeddings for joint reasoning. We set up a novel evaluation framework with two evaluation tasks, few-shot link prediction and analogical reasoning, and evaluate an array of KB-text embedding alignment methods. We also demonstrate how such alignment can infuse textual information into KB embeddings for more accurate link prediction on emerging entities and events, using COVID-19 as a case study.","Pahuja, Vardaan; Gu, Yu; Chen, Wenhu; Bahrami, Mehdi; Liu, Lei; Chen, Wei-Peng; Su, Yu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01586v1.pdf,490
444161,How we mitigated and contained the COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center: Lessons and experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had significant health-related and behavioral impacts worldwide. Cancer survivors (hereafter referred to as ""survivors"") are particularly prone to behavioral changes and are encouraged to be more vigilant and observe stricter social distancing measures. OBJECTIVE: We explored (1) changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviors since the onset of COVID-19, along with changes in mental health status, and (2) alternative strategies to support survivors' physical activity and social health during and after COVID-19, along with the role of digital health in such strategies. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed among survivors participating (currently or previously) in the community-based physical activity program LIVESTRONG at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), from 3 sites outside an urban area in Massachusetts. Questions addressed pre-COVID-19 vs current changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and scores &#8805;3 indicated a clinical diagnosis of anxiety or depression, respectively. Digital health preferences were assessed through closed-ended questions. Open-ended responses addressing other preferences for physical activity programs and social support were analyzed, coded, and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Among 61 participants (mean age 62 [SD 10.4] years; females: 51/61 [83.6%]), 67.2% (n=41) reported decreased physical activity and 67.2% (n=41) reported prolonged sitting times since the onset of COVID-19. Further, 24.6% (n=15) and 26.2% (n=16) met the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 criteria for clinical anxiety and depression, respectively. All participants owned a cellphone; 90% (n=54) owned a smartphone. Preferences for physical activity programs (n=28) included three themes: (1) use of digital or remote platforms (Zoom, other online platforms, and video platforms), (2) specific activities and locations (eg, outdoor activities, walking, gardening, biking, and physical activities at the YMCA and at senior centers), and (3) importance of social support regardless of activity type (eg, time spent with family, friends, peers, or coaches). The survey revealed a mean score of 71.8 (SD 21.4; scale 0-100) for the importance of social support during physical activity programs. Social support preferences (n=15) revealed three themes: (1) support through remote platforms (eg, texting, Zoom, phone calls, emails, and Facebook), (2) tangible in-person support (YMCA and senior centers), and (3) social support with no specific platform (eg, small gatherings and family or friend visits). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity and mental health are critical factors for the quality of life of survivors, and interventions tailored to their activity preferences are necessary. Digital or remote physical activity programs with added social support may help address the ongoing needs of survivors during and after the pandemic.","Faro, Jamie M; Mattocks, Kristin M; Nagawa, Catherine S; Lemon, Stephenie C; Wang, Bo; Cutrona, Sarah L; Sadasivam, Rajani S",JMIR Cancer,,490

The Causative factor for COVID 19 is SARS-COV2. It was first noticed in Wuhan city of China. World Health Organisation declared the fatality of this disease as a pandemic. This disease has become a problem of great concern globally. This virus targets the respiratory system of human beings. There is a high incidence of person to person transmission of this disease through contact. However, there is also a significant role in innate immunity in pathogenesis and management of this disease. The whole world is seeking for flawless control of this viral disease. Ayurveda is a holistic science. Its aim is not only on the cure of diseases but also on its prevention. It emphasises mainly on healthy life of an individual. There is a wide range of principles described in Ayurveda which are used to combat disease from its root. Rasayana Chikista is a useful principle of Ayurveda, beneficial for management and prevention of many diseases. It is always said that “prevention is better than cure”. Chyavan-prash is one of the well known Rasayana. Contents of Chyavanprash shows a wide range of actions on respiratory diseases as well as on boosting immunity. These properties of it provoke us to review the role of Chyavanprash in the prevention of Covid 19, thereby increasing one’s immune response.

449735,Utility of repeat testing for COVID-19: Laboratory stewardship when the stakes are high,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The Japanese prime minister declared a state of emergency on April 7 2020 to combat the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This declaration was unique in the sense that it was essentially driven by the voluntary restraint of the residents. We examined the change of the infection route by investigating contact experiences with COVID-19-positive cases. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a population-level questionnaire-based study using a social networking service (SNS). METHODS: To assess the impact of the declaration, this study used population-level questionnaire data collected from an SNS with 121,375 respondents (between March 27 and May 5) to assess the change in transmission routes over the study period, which was measured by investigating the association between COVID-19-related symptoms and (self-reported) contact with COVID-19-infected individuals. RESULTS: The results of this study show that the declaration prevented infections in the workplace, but increased domestic infections as people stayed at home. However, after April 24, workplace infections started to increase again, driven by the increase in community-acquired infections. CONCLUSIONS: While careful interpretation is necessary because our data are self-reported from voluntary SNS users, these findings indicate the impact of the declaration on the change in transmission routes of COVID-19 over time in Japan.","Eguchi, A; Yoneoka, D; Shi, S; Tanoue, Y; Kawashima, T; Nomura, S; Matsuura, K; Makiyama, K; Ejima, K; Gilmour, S; Nishiura, H; Miyata, H",Public Health,,490

This model learns to grow an image starting from a fixed single pixel. In this paper, we move a step further and propose a new model that extends the expressive power of NCA from a single image to an manifold of images. In biological terms, our approach would play the role of the transcription factors, modulating the mapping of genes into specific proteins that drive cellular differentiation, which occurs right before the morphogenesis. We accomplish this by introducing dynamic convolutions inside an Auto-Encoder architecture, for the first time used to join two different sources of information, the encoding and cell's environment information. The proposed model also extends the capabilities of the NCA to a general purpose network, which can be used in a broad range of problems.

466038,Critical role of Wuhan cabin hospitals in controlling the local COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background and aims The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is currently facing several challenges, one of these being that the placebo response appears to be increasing in RCTs, thereby making it difficult to demonstrate an effect of potentially new treatments over placebo. This problem has primarily been approached by predicting the magnitude of the placebo response via stable factors, such as demographic variables, and/or by developing complex designs aimed at reducing the placebo response in the hope that it will improve the test of the active treatment. Yet, the success of this approach has so far been limited. Methods A new approach toward improving the RCT is put forward based on placebo and nocebo mechanism studies, i.e. studies that investigate the mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. In a series of meta-analyses the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects were determined. Experimental studies across nociplastic and neuropathic pain conditions and across pharmacological and acupuncture treatments investigated psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these effects. The obtained results were used to make approximations of expectations to see if that could predict the placebo response in RCTs and function as a new way of tapping into the placebo component of treatment effects. Results The magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects is large and highly variable. Placebo effects exist across chronic pain conditions with varying degrees of known etiology as well as across pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Patients' perception of the treatment, the verbal suggestions given for pain relief, and the patients' expectations toward pain relief contribute to the magnitude of the placebo effect and to pain relief following placebo interventions. Also, unintentional unblinding and patients' perception of a treatment markedly influence the treatment outcome. By making approximations of expectations toward treatment effects it was possible to predict the magnitude of the placebo response in RCTs. Conclusions and implications The new approach of tapping into or directly asking patients about their perception and expectations toward a treatment, along with the account of the natural history of pain, has the potential to improve the information that can be obtained from RCTs. Thus, by interfacing insights from placebo and nocebo mechanism studies, it may be possible to enhance the information that can be obtained from RCTs and to account for a large part of the variability in the placebo component of the overall treatment effect. This approach has the potential to improve the scientific evaluation of treatments, as well as to illustrate how the effect of treatments can be optimized in clinical practice, which is the crux of evidence-based medicine.","Vase, Lene",Scandinavian journal of pain (Online),,490

Bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) measurements enable designing and regulating medical masks to prevent bioaerosol dissemination; however, despite the simplicity of these measurements, several scientific questions remain unanswered regarding BFE tests. Here, we investigated (1) the impact of substituting 100-mm Petri dishes with 90-mm disposable Petri dishes, (2) the impact of colony-counting methods on the bioaerosol aerodynamic size, and (3) the impact of colony-counting methods on the total viable particle counts. We demonstrated that disposable 90-mm Petri dishes can be used to replace the 100-mm dishes. We also showed that an automatic high-resolution colony counter can be used to directly count viable particles on collection substrates and to measure the bioaerosol size parameters. Our results enable possible modernization of the outdated testing methods recommended in the US and European standards for BFE measurements. Specifically, use of a modernized colony counter should be clearly regulated and permitted to avoid the counting of positive holes. The median aerodynamic diameter appears to be the most relevant parameter for characterizing bioaerosol size.","Pourchez, Jérémie; Peyron, Aurélien; Montigaud, Yoann; Laurent, Coralie; Audoux, Estelle; Leclerc, Lara; Verhoeven, Paul O",Sci Rep,,490

What Worked (And Didn’t Work): A Survey of COVID-19 Response in Michigan Nursing Homes in the Midst of the Pandemic,2020,"Ivermectin (IVM) is an FDA-approved drug that has shown antiviral activity against a wide variety of viruses in recent years. IVM inhibits the formation of the importin-&#945;/ß1 heterodimeric complex responsible for the translocation and replication of various viral species proteins. Also, IVM hampers SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro; however, the molecular mechanism through which IVM inhibits SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. Previous studies have explored the molecular mechanism through which IVM inhibits importin-&#945; and several potential targets associated with COVID-19 by using docking approaches and MD simulations to corroborate the docked complexes. This study explores the energetic and structural properties through which IVM inhibits importin-&#945; and five targets associated with COVID-19 by using docking and MD simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) approach. Energetic and structural analysis showed that the main protease 3CLpro reached the most favorable affinity, followed by importin-&#945; and Nsp9, which shared a similar relationship. Therefore, in vitro activity of IVM can be explained by acting as an inhibitor of importin-&#945;, dimeric 3CLpro, and Nsp9, but mainly over dimeric 3CLpro.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

470064,Unusual Clinical Manifestations and Outcome of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in a Tertiary Care Hospital of North India,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need. METHODS: We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.

472628,Regional variation in trajectories of healthcare worker infections during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,2020,"Computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) have been the two dominant imaging modalities deployed for improved management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to faster imaging, less radiation exposure, and being cost-effective CXR is preferred over CT. However, the interpretation of CXR images, compared to CT, is more challenging due to low image resolution and COVID-19 image features being similar to regular pneumonia. Computer-aided diagnosis via deep learning has been investigated to help mitigate these problems and help clinicians during the decision-making process. The requirement for a large amount of labeled data is one of the major problems of deep learning methods when deployed in the medical domain. To provide a solution to this, in this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach using minimal data for training. We integrate local-phase CXR image features into a multi-feature convolutional neural network architecture where the training of SSL method is obtained with a teacher/student paradigm. Quantitative evaluation is performed on 8,851 normal (healthy), 6,045 pneumonia, and 3,795 COVID-19 CXR scans. By only using 7.06% labeled and 16.48% unlabeled data for training, 5.53% for validation, our method achieves 93.61\% mean accuracy on a large-scale (70.93%) test data.

478640,Pediatric antimicrobial stewardship in the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"In 2020 the world is facing unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19. To address these challenges, many digital tools are being explored and developed to contain the spread of the disease. With the lack of availability of vaccines, there is an urgent need to avert resurgence of infections by putting some measures, such as contact tracing, in place. While digital tools, such as phone applications are advantageous, they also pose challenges and have limitations (eg, wireless coverage could be an issue in some cases). On the other hand, wearable devices, when coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), are expected to influence lifestyle and healthcare directly, and they may be useful for health monitoring during the global pandemic and beyond. In this work, we conduct a literature review of contact tracing methods and applications. Based on the literature review, we found limitations in gathering health data, such as insufficient network coverage. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel intelligent tool that will be useful for contact tracing and prediction of COVID-19 clusters. The solution comprises a phone application combined with a wearable device, infused with unique intelligent IoT features (complex data analysis and intelligent data visualization) embedded within the system to aid in COVID-19 analysis. Contact tracing applications must establish data collection and data interpretation. Intelligent data interpretation can assist epidemiological scientists in anticipating clusters, and can enable them to take necessary action in improving public health management.

479765,COVID-19 Vaccination Preparedness Policies in U.S. Hospitals,2021,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to viral or bacterial pathogens increases the number of neutrophils with a relative decrease in lymphocytes, leading to elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This study aimed to investigate whether differences in NLR among real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive and -negative patients presenting with a prediagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia could be useful in the differential diagnosis. METHODS: The study included 174 patients admitted because of suspected COVID-19 infection between March and April 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: PCR-negative and PCR-positive. Hemogram, NLR, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, troponin, and coagulation parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: On comparison of laboratory parameters between both groups at presentation, PCR-positive patients were significantly more likely to have leukopenia (p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (p = 0.006), neutropenia (p < 0.001), lymphopenia (p = 0.001), and increased NLR (p = 0.003). Furthermore, PCR-positive patients showed significant elevations of ferritin (p = 0.012) and procalcitonin (p = 0.038) and significant lower potassium levels (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia has become a major global health problem. Early diagnosis and treatment of these patients are crucial, as COVID-19 pneumonia shows a rapid progression in most cases. Thus, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated NLR, and elevated ferritin may be useful as supplementary diagnostic tests in these patients, which may allow early initiation of treatment and may contribute to preventing progression in patients with abnormal results.","Kabak, M; Çil, B; Hocanli, I",Int Immunopharmacol,,490

The aim of the present work has been to design and explore a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with quarantine fatigue. A deterministic model represented by a system of differential equations, based on Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics, was developed. The model was explored by means of computational simulations. The results obtained show that, in some scenarios, after a first prevalence peak, fatigue can cause a second peak. Thus, the dynamic behavior of the model suggests that fatigue may have contributed to the production of the second peak of infected people observed in different parts of the world between 2020 and early 2021. The explorations performed also showed that the model is sensitive to infection rate and other parameters related to propagation dynamics. The developed model is relatively simple and has important limitations for performing accurate predictions in the real world. However, our study highlights the importance of considering quarantine fatigue in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as of possible future pandemics caused by other pathogens.","Gualtieri, Ariel F'elix; Hecht, Pedro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14192v1.pdf,490

482636,The Utility of Paired Upper and Lower COVID-19 Sampling in Patients with Artificial Airways,2021,"BACKGROUND: To combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing apps have been discussed as digital health solutions to track infection chains and provide appropriate information. However, observational studies point to low acceptance in most countries, and few studies have yet examined theory-based predictors of app use in the general population to guide health communication efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study utilizes established health behavior change and technology acceptance models to predict adoption intentions and frequency of current app use. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between May and July 2020 in a German convenience sample (N=349; mean age 35.62 years; n=226, 65.3% female). To inspect the incremental validity of model constructs as well as additional variables (privacy concerns, personalization), hierarchical regression models were applied, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: The theory of planned behavior and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology predicted adoption intentions (R2=56%-63%) and frequency of current app use (R2=33%-37%). A combined model only marginally increased the predictive value by about 5%, but lower privacy concerns and higher threat appraisals (ie, anticipatory anxiety) significantly predicted app use when included as additional variables. Moreover, the impact of perceived usefulness was positive for adoption intentions but negative for frequency of current app use. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several theory-based predictors of contact tracing app use. However, few constructs, such as social norms, have a consistent positive effect across models and outcomes. Further research is required to replicate these observations, and to examine the interconnectedness of these constructs and their impact throughout the pandemic. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that promulgating affirmative social norms and positive emotional effects of app use, as well as addressing health concerns, might be promising strategies to foster adoption intentions and app use in the general population.","Tomczyk, Samuel; Barth, Simon; Schmidt, Silke; Muehlan, Holger",J Med Internet Res,,490

486861,Atypical COVID-19: Preventing transmission from unexpected cases,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease with rapid human-to-human transmission caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the exponential growth of infections, identifying patients with the highest mortality risk early is critical to enable effective intervention and prioritisation of care. Here, we present the COVID-19 early warning system (CovEWS), a risk scoring system for assessing COVID-19 related mortality risk that we developed using data amounting to a total of over 2863 years of observation time from a cohort of 66 430 patients seen at over 69 healthcare institutions. On an external cohort of 5005 patients, CovEWS predicts mortality from 78.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 76.0, 84.7%) to 69.4% (95% CI: 57.6, 75.2%) specificity at sensitivities greater than 95% between, respectively, 1 and 192 h prior to mortality events. CovEWS could enable earlier intervention, and may therefore help in preventing or mitigating COVID-19 related mortality.","Schwab, Patrick; Mehrjou, Arash; Parbhoo, Sonali; Celi, Leo Anthony; Hetzel, Jürgen; Hofer, Markus; Schölkopf, Bernhard; Bauer, Stefan",Nat Commun,,490

Vitamin D deficiency, which can result in a compromised immune response, has been also linked to increased risk and increased morbidities associated with COVID-19. In the absence of large-scale longitudinal studies to determine the strength of association between vitamin deficiency and COVID-19, cross-sectional studies of large patient cohorts can be used. METHODS: We used the i2b2 patient's registry platform at the University of Florida Health Center to generate a count of patients using the international classification of diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis codes for the period of October 1, 2015, through June 30, 2020. Logistic regression of the aggregates was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Patients with vitamin D deficiency were 4.6 times more likely to be positive for COVID-19 (indicated by the ICD-10 diagnostic code COVID19) than patients with no deficiency (P < 0.001). The association decreased slightly after adjusting for sex (odds ratio [OR] = 4.58; P < 0.001) and malabsorption (OR = 4.46; P < 0.001), respectively. The association decreased significantly but remained robust (P < 0.001) after adjusting for race (OR = 3.76; P < 0.001), periodontal disease status (OR = 3.64; P < 0.001), diabetes (OR = 3.28; P < 0.001), and obesity (OR = 2.27; P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, patients with vitamin D deficiency were 5 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than patients with no deficiency after adjusting for age groups (OR = 5.155; P < 0.001).

Potentially curative treatments (surgical resection, radiofrequency or liver transplantation) are only available for few patients, while transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or systemic agents are the best treatments for intermediate and advanced stage disease. The identification of markers that allow us to choose the best treatment for the patient is urgent.Areas covered: In this review we summarize the potential biological markers to predict the efficacy of all treatment available in patients with HCC and discuss anew biomarker with ahigher potential of success in the next future.Expert opinion: HCC is aheterogeneous disease. Tumors are heterogeneous in terms of genetic alteration,with spatial heterogeneity in cellular density, necrosis and angiogenesis.This heterogeneity may affect prognosis and treatment. Tumor heterogeneity can be difficult to quantify with traditional imaging due to subjective assessment of images; the same for sampling biopsy, which evaluates only asmall part of the tumor. We think that combining multi-OMICSwith radiomics represents apromising strategy for evaluating tumor heterogenicity and for identifying biomarkers of response and prognosis.","Casadei-Gardini, Andrea; Orsi, Giulia; Caputo, Francesco; Ercolani, Giorgio",Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,,490

Some viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr Virus infections, are known to cause malignant lymphoproliferation, like certain B-cell lymphomas. However, their role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is still debatable. Here, we report a unique case of Type-1 CG associated to a CLL transformation diagnosed in the course of a human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 91-year-old man was initially hospitalized for delirium. In a context of febrile rhinorrhea, the diagnosis of hMPV infection was made by molecular assay (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab. Owing to hyperlymphocytosis that developed during the course of the infection and unexplained peripheral neuropathy, a type-1 IgG Kappa CG secondary to a CLL was diagnosed. The patient was not treated for the CLL because of Binet A stage classification and his poor physical condition. CONCLUSIONS: We report the unique observation in the literature of CLL transformation and hMPV infection. We provide a mini review on the pivotal role of viruses in CLL pathophysiology.","Barben, Jérémy; Putot, Alain; Mihai, Anca-Maria; Vovelle, Jérémie; Manckoundia, Patrick",Viruses,,490
499398,Battle with COVID-19 in Iran: What lessons can be learned from the implementation of response strategies so far?,2020,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The need for social distancing has resulted in rapid restructuring of medical student education in radiology. While students traditionally spend time learning in the reading room, remote clinical learning requires material shared without direct teaching at the radiology workstation. Can remote clinical learning meet or exceed the educational value of the traditional in-person learning experience? Can student engagement be matched or exceeded in a remote learning environment? MATERIALS AND METHODS: To replace the in-person reading room experience, a small-group learning session for medical students named Virtual Read-Out (VRO) was developed using teleconferencing software. After Institutional Review Board approval, two student groups were anonymously surveyed to assess differences in student engagement and perceived value between learning environments: ""Conventional"" students participating in the reading room (before the pandemic) and ""Remote"" students participating in VRO sessions. Students reported perceived frequency of a series of five-point Likert statements. Based on number of respondents, an independent t-test was performed to determine the significance of results between two groups. RESULTS: Twenty-seven conventional and 41 remote students responded. Remote students reported modest but significantly higher frequency of active participation in reviewing radiology exams (p < 0.05). There was significantly lower frequency of reported boredom among Remote students (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in perceived educational value between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Students report a high degree of teaching quality, clinical relevance, and educational value regardless of remote or in-person learning format. Remote clinical radiology education can be achieved with equal or greater student interaction and perceived value in fewer contact hours than conventional learning in the reading room.","Alpert, Jeffrey B; Young, Matthew G; Lala, Shailee V; McGuinness, Georgeann",Acad Radiol,,490

As the mosquito season progressed, the understandable concern that mosquitoes could transmit the virus began to increase among the general public and public health organisations. We have investigated the vector competence of Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus, the two most common species of vector mosquitoes in Europe, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the very unusual feeding behaviour of Ae. albopictus, we also evaluated the role of this mosquito in a potential mechanical transmission of the virus. METHODS: For the vector competence study, mosquitoes were allowed to take several infectious blood meals. The mosquitoes were then collected and analysed at 0, 3, 7 and 10 days post-feeding. For the mechanical transmission test, Ae. albopictus females were allowed to feed for a short time on a feeder containing infectious blood and then on a feeder containing virus-free blood. Both mosquitoes and blood were tested for viral presence. RESULTS: Culex pipiens and Ae. albopictus were found not be competent vectors for SARS-CoV-2, and Ae. albopictus was unable to mechanically transmit the virus. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that the most common species of vector mosquitoes in Europe do not transmit SARS-CoV-2 and that Ae. albopictus is unable to mechanically transmit the virus from a positive host to a healthy host through host-feeding.","Fortuna, Claudia; Montarsi, Fabrizio; Severini, Francesco; Marsili, Giulia; Toma, Luciano; Amendola, Antonello; Bertola, Michela; Michelutti, Alice; Ravagnan, Silvia; Capelli, Gioia; Rezza, Giovanni; Di Luca, Marco",Parasit Vectors,,490

507060,Transparency and information sharing could help abate the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The widespread COVID-19 vaccination program, issued by the Israel Government, provides a unique opportunity to examine psychiatric morbidity and vaccine attitudes among individuals who have already been vaccinated. Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3). LIMITATIONS: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals.","Palgi, Yuval; Bergman, Yoav S; Ben-David, Boaz; Bodner, Ehud",J Affect Disord,,490

508197,A Survey of COVID-19 Preparedness Among Hospitals in Idaho,2020,"Since the emergence of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported from Wuhan, China, neither a specific vaccine nor an antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 has become available. However, a combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has been found to be effective against SARS-CoV, and both drugs could bind well to the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV 3CLpro). In this work, molecular complexation between each inhibitor and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and pair interaction energy analyses based on MM/PB(GB)SA and FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* methods. Both anti-HIV drugs interacted well with the residues at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Ritonavir showed a somewhat higher number atomic contacts, a somewhat higher binding efficiency, and a somewhat higher number of key binding residues compared to lopinavir, which correspond with the slightly lower water accessibility at the 3CLpro active site. In addition, only ritonavir could interact with the oxyanion hole residues N142 and G143 via the formation of two hydrogen bonds. The interactions in terms of electrostatics, dispersion, and charge transfer played an important role in the drug binding. The obtained results demonstrated how repurposed anti-HIV drugs could be used to combat COVID-19.","Nutho, Bodee; Mahalapbutr, Panupong; Hengphasatporn, Kowit; Pattaranggoon, Nawanwat Chainuwong; Simanon, Nattapon; Shigeta, Yasuteru; Hannongbua, Supot; Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada",Biochemistry,,490

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 3351 college students from China were surveyed through questionnaires about their sociodemographic and COVID-19 characteristics, the needs of school support, and their experiences with anxiety and depression. RESULTS Anxiety and depression were reported by 6.88% and 10.50% of students, respectively. Married, higher education, non-medical, and urban students had significantly higher risks of anxiety or depression. Additionally, symptoms such as cough and fever, especially when following a possible contact with suspected individuals, quarantine history of a personal contact, going out 1-3 times a week, not wearing a mask, and spending 2-3 hours browsing COVID-19-related information were significantly associated with the occurrence of anxiety or depression. Those who used methods to regulate their emotional state, used a psychological hotline, and who had visited a psychiatrist showed higher anxiety or depression. Those who used online curricula and books, used preventive methods for COVID-19, and who had real-time information about the epidemic situation of the school showed lower anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS In addition to sociodemographic and COVID-19-related aspects, students' needs for psychological assistance and information from schools were also associated with anxiety and depression among college students.","Meng, Na; Liu, Zheng; Wang, Ya; Feng, Yan; Liu, Qin; Huang, Junqiang; Li, Xiaolin",Med Sci Monit,,490

RECENT FINDINGS: ACE2 has quickly gained prominence in basic research as it has been identified as the main entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This novel pathogen causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pathogenic condition that reached pandemic proportion and is associated with unprecedented morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY: The renin-angiotensin system is a complex, coordinated hormonal cascade that plays a pivotal role in controlling individual cell behaviour and multiple organ functions. ACE2 acts as an endogenous counter-regulator to the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways triggered by ACE through the conversion of Ang II into the vasodilatory peptide Ang 1-7. We discuss the structure, function and expression of ACE2 in different tissues. We also briefly describe the role of ACE2 as a pivotal driver across a wide spectrum of pathogenic conditions, such as cardiac and renal diseases. Furthermore, we provide the most recent data concerning the possible role of ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and dictating COVID-19 severity.","Perico, Luca; Benigni, Ariela; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,,490

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases were searched. We selected studies ensuring that diagnosis of ICBs in PD patients depends on semi-structured interviews according to the clinical diagnostic criteria of ICBs. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate quality of the included studies. The analyzed factors included demographic information, clinical characteristics of PD and medications. RESULTS: A total of 856 records were screened and 66 full texts were evaluated, and 13 studies (684 PD patients with ICBs [PD-ICBs] and 3,382 PD patients without ICBs [PD-non-ICBs]) were included. Compared with PD-non-ICBs, PD-ICBs were younger in age (- 3.7 [- 5.53, - 1.87], P < 0.0001), with a greater proportion of males (1.64 [1.21, 2.22], P = 0.001), with a younger age of PD onset (- 5.42 [- 7.87, - 2.97], P < 0.0001) and a longer course of PD (1.30 [0.38, 2.22], P = 0.005). PD-ICBs were also associated with higher HAM-D (1.74 [0.47, 3.01], P = 0.007), more levodopa dosage (1.74 [1.09, 2.77], P = 0.02) and dopamine receptor agonists (DA) use (3.96 [2.74, 5.71), P < 0.00001), and higher average dose (levodopa 117.53 [53.59, 181.46], P = 0.0003; DA 80.03 [46.16, 113.90], P < 0.00001), as well as more amantadine use (2.20 [1.42, 3.40], P = 0.0004). The meta-analysis of most factors showed less heterogeneity, except age, age of onset, PD duration, Hoehn and Yahr stage, MMSE and drug dosage. However, whether rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, dyskinesia, genetic polymorphism and other factors are risk factors for PD-ICBs remains unclear. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that males, young, early disease onset, long disease duration, depression, dose of levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists and amantadine are risk factors of ICBs in PD patients.","Cao, Lanxiao; Xu, Tian; Zhao, Gaohua; Lv, Dayao; Lu, Jinyu; Zhao, Guohua",J. neurol,,490

Management efficiency is one of the important indexes to measure the quality of shipping management. This paper aims to assess the management efficiency from a new perspective of congestion index to point out the causes affecting efficiency and provide suggestions to the shipping company. Based on a two-stage data envelopment analysis, we establish a novel congestion management system to comprehensively examine the organization's congestion from three aspects, including the macro-level, the micro-level, and resource allocation. Accordingly, we apply three congestion models, namely stage congestion, slack-based congestion, and resource reallocation congestion, respectively, to measure Hapag-Lloyd's congestion index from 2017 to 2020. We find that: 1) Hapag-Lloyd's capacity is higher than its market share;2) major events (e.g., merger and acquisition, COVID-19) have significant impacts on the congestion index of the company;3) excessive redistributable resource input invalidate the congestion index.","Wang, Zhijie Wu Xianhua Lo Kai Lisa Mi Jackson Jinhong",Ocean &amp; Coastal Management,,490

591927,CK-MB Elevation in Mild Hypothermia: What We Did and We Should Have Done,2021-02-15,"The peri-urban interface (PUI) exhibits characteristic qualities of both urban and rural regions, and this complexity has meant that risk assessments and long-term planning for PUI are lagging, despite these areas representing new developing settlement frontiers. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by modifying an existing approach to quantify and assess flood risk. The risk triangle framework was used to map exposure, vulnerability and biophysical variables; however, in a novel application, the risk triangle framework was adapted by presuming that there is a variation in the degree of exposure, vulnerability and biophysical variables. Within Australia and globally, PUIs are often coastal, and flood risk associated with rainfall and coastal inundation poses considerable risk to communities in the PUI; these risks will be further exacerbated should projections of increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events and accelerating sea-level rise eventuate. An indicator-based approach using the risk triangle framework that maps flood hazard, exposure and vulnerability was used to integrate the biophysical and socio-economic flooding risk for communities in PUI of the St Georges Basin and Sussex Inlet catchments of south-eastern Australia. Integrating the flood risk triangle with future scenarios of demographic and climate change, and considering factors that contribute to PUI flood risk, facilitated the identification of planning strategies that would reduce the future rate of increase in flood risk. These planning strategies are useful for natural resource managers and land use planners across Australia and globally, who are tasked with balancing socio-economic prosperity for a changing population, whilst maintaining and enhancing ecosystem services and values. The indicator-based approach used in this study provides a cost-effective first-pass risk assessment and is a valuable tool for decision makers planning for flood risk across PUIs in NSW and globally.","Asbridge, E.

The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.","Meng, Tong; Cao, Hao; Zhang, Hao; Kang, Zijian; Xu, Da; Gong, Haiyi; Wang, Jing; Li, Zifu; Cui, Xingang; Xu, Huji; Wei, Haifeng; Pan, Xiuwu; Zhu, Rongrong; Xiao, Jianru; Zhou, Wang; Cheng, Liming; Liu, Jianmin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.926006,490

We evaluated convergent antigen-specific antibody genes of similar sequences shared between individuals in pediatric and adult blood, and deceased organ donor tissues. B cell memory varied for different pathogens. Polysaccharide antigen-specific clones were not exclusive to the spleen. Adults’ convergent clones often express mutated IgM or IgD in blood and are class-switched in lymphoid tissues; in contrast, children have abundant class-switched convergent clones in blood. Consistent with serological reports, pre-pandemic children had class-switched convergent clones to SARS-CoV-2, enriched in cross-reactive clones for seasonal coronaviruses, while adults showed few such clones in blood or lymphoid tissues.

An old-time problem,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: Antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be less sensitive than the standard reference method – real-time PCR (RT-PCR). It has been suggested that many patients with positive RT-PCR ‘missed’ by antigen testing might be non-infectious. METHODS: In a real-world high-throughput setting for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, 494 patients were tested using RT-PCR as well as a single lateral flow antigen test (Ecotest, AssureTech, China). Where the results differed, virus viability was evaluated by cell culture. The test parameters were calculated with RT-PCR and RT-PCR adjusted on viability as reference standards. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the used antigen test related to the RT-PCR only was 76.2%, specificity was 97.3%. However, 36 out of 39 patients ‘missed’ by the antigen test contained no viable virus. After adjusting on that, the sensitivity grew to 97.7% and, more importantly for disease control purposes, the negative predictive value reached 99.2%. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that viability testing should be always performed when evaluating a new antigen test. A well-chosen and validated antigen test provides excellent results in identifying patients who are shedding viable virus (although some caveats still remain) in the real-world high-throughput setting of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals.","Homza, Miroslav; Zelena, Hana; Janosek, Jaroslav; Tomaskova, Hana; Jezo, Eduard; Kloudova, Alena; Mrazek, Jakub; Svagera, Zdenek; Prymula, Roman",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1914857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985403/,490

It has consequences for virus–host interactions, and it represents the first step in the diversification of viruses in nature. Measurements during infections and with purified viral polymerases indicate that mutation rates for RNA viruses are in the range of 10(−3) to 10(−6) copying errors per nucleotide incorporated into the nascent RNA product. Although viruses are thought to exploit high error rates for adaptation to changing environments, some of them possess misincorporation correcting activities. One of them is a proofreading-repair 3′ to 5′ exonuclease present in coronaviruses that may decrease the error rate during replication. Here we review experimental evidence and models of information maintenance that explain why elevated mutation rates have been preserved during the evolution of RNA (and some DNA) viruses.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of wait list time on long-term disease-free survival in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for surgery at a tertiary care center. Wait list time was defined as the time from completion of diagnostic workup to definitive surgery and divided into 2-week intervals from 0 to 6 weeks. The outcome variables were 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients, 364 (60.5%) male, median age 73 years (range = 71) were defined. The median wait list time was 28 days (range = 99). Two and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 521 (86.5%) and 500 (83.1%) respectively. There were no differences in 2-year or 5-year disease-free survival for the whole cohort or by tumor stage between wait list time intervals except for AJCC stage II tumors which showed a higher 5-year disease-free survival for the 2–4 and 4–6-week wait list time interval (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Time from diagnosis to definitive surgery up to 6 weeks is not associated with a decrease in 2-year or 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in AJCC stage I through III colorectal cancer patients.

COVID-19 is a novel emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 characterized as atypical pneumonia. As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea combined with recent exposure. Most of the patients with COVID-19 have mild or moderate disease, however up to 5–10% present with severe and even life-threatening disease course. The mortality rates are approximately 2%. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective and specific antiviral treatment. Currently, supportive care measures such as ventilation oxygenation and fluid management remain the standard of care. Several clinical trials are currently trying to identify the most potent drug or combination against the disease, and it is strongly recommended to enroll patients into ongoing trials. Antivirals can be proven as safe and effective only in the context of randomized clinical trials. Currently several agents such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma and vaccines are being evaluated.

609800,Balancing Scientific Rigor With Urgency in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020-07-21,"The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has managed to control the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected patients. However, a complete HIV-1 cure, including a functional cure for or eradication of HIV-1, has yet to be achieved because of the persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in adherent patients. The primary source of these viral reservoirs is integrated proviral DNA in CD4(+) T cells and other non-T cells. Although a small fraction of this proviral DNA is replication-competent and contributes to viral rebound after the cessation of cART, >90% of latent viral reservoirs are replication-defective and some contain high rates of G-to-A mutations in proviral DNA. At least in part, these high rates of G-to-A mutations arise from the APOBEC3 (A3) family proteins of cytosine deaminases. A general model has shown that the HIV-1 virus infectivity factor (Vif) degrades A3 family proteins by proteasome-mediated pathways and inactivates their antiviral activities. However, Vif does not fully counteract the HIV-1 restriction activity of A3 family proteins in vivo, as indicated by observations of A3-mediated G-to-A hypermutation in the proviral DNA of HIV-1-infected patients. The frequency of A3-mediated hypermutation potentially contributes to slower HIV-1/AIDS disease progression and virus evolution including the emergence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte escape mutants. Therefore, combined with other strategies, the manipulation of A3-mediated mutagenesis may contribute to an HIV-1 functional cure aimed at cART-free remission. In this mini-review, we discuss the possibility of an HIV-1 functional cure arising from manipulation of A3 mutagenic activity.","Ikeda, Terumasa; Yue, Yuan; Shimizu, Ryo; Nasser, Hesham",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.686357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211449/,490

Generation of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (seroconversion) may inform on acquired immunity from prior exposure, and antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) are speculated to neutralize virus infection. Some serology assays rely solely on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) as the antibody detection antigen; however, whether such immune responses correlate with S-RBD response and COVID-19 immunity remains unknown. Here, we generated a quantitative serological ELISA using recombinant S-RBD and N-protein for the detection of circulating antibodies in 138 serial serum samples from 30 reverse transcription PCR–confirmed, SARS-CoV-2–hospitalized patients, as well as 464 healthy and non–COVID-19 serum samples that were collected between June 2017 and June 2020. Quantitative detection of IgG antibodies against the 2 different viral proteins showed a moderate correlation. Antibodies against N-protein were detected at a rate of 3.6% in healthy and non–COVID-19 sera collected during the pandemic in 2020, whereas 1.9% of these sera were positive for S-RBD. Approximately 86% of individuals positive for S-RBD–binding antibodies exhibited neutralizing capacity, but only 74% of N-protein–positive individuals exhibited neutralizing capacity. Collectively, our studies show that detection of N-protein–binding antibodies does not always correlate with presence of S-RBD–neutralizing antibodies and caution against the extensive use of N-protein–based serology testing for determination of potential COVID-19 immunity.","McAndrews, Kathleen M.; Dowlatshahi, Dara P.; Dai, Jianli; Becker, Lisa M.; Hensel, Janine; Snowden, Laura M.; Leveille, Jennifer M.; Brunner, Michael R.; Holden, Kylie W.; Hopkins, Nikolas S.; Harris, Alexandria M.; Kumpati, Jerusha; Whitt, Michael A.; Lee, J.

Consequently, indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these patients are still controversial, except as a bridge to lung transplantation. The objective of this study was to clarify in-hospital mortality and prognostic factors in interstitial lung disease patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. METHODS: In this case–control study using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, hospitalized interstitial lung disease patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from 2010 to 2017 were reviewed. Patients’ characteristics and treatment regimens were compared between survivors and non-survivors to identify prognostic factors. To avoid selection biases, patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to lung transplantation were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 164 interstitial lung disease patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were included. Their in-hospital mortality was 74.4% (122/164). Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and received high-dose cyclophosphamide, protease inhibitors, and antifungal drugs more frequently, but macrolides and anti-influenza drugs less frequently. On multivariate analysis, the following factors were associated with in-hospital mortality: advanced age (odds ratio [OR] 1.043; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.009–1.078), non-use of macrolides (OR 0.305; 95% CI 0.134–0.698), and use of antifungal drugs (OR 2.416; 95% CI 1.025–5.696).

While these significant and often unavoidable disruptions have been shown to bear consequences for mental health, less attention has been devoted to behavioral changes, such as changes to sleeping or eating due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their implications for emotional well-being. METHODS: We utilized data from a nationally representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries (aged 65 and older), which was administered between June and October 2020 (n = 3,122). We examine the relationship between self-reported changes to daily behaviors (e.g., sleep, drinking alcohol, and exercise) and emotional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., feelings of depression and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic) using stepwise hierarchical multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: We found that worse sleep quality, sleeping more or less, watching more television, and walking less were associated with more feelings of depression and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Previous research has shown a connection between the significant and often unavoidable disruptions to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., sheltering in place) and adverse mental health symptoms. Less attention has been paid to potentially modifiable behaviors, such as sleep and exercise. Our findings highlight the behavioral changes associated with adverse emotional impacts among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research may evaluate whether behavioral interventions may aim to attenuate the impact of pandemics on daily, modifiable behaviors to buffer against adverse emotional impacts.","Robbins, Rebecca; Weaver, Matthew D; Czeisler, Mark É; Barger, Laura K; Quan, Stuart F; Czeisler, Charles A",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156467/,490

629635,Temporal Changes in the Risk of Superspreading Events of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021-06-30,"Abstract Objectives Children admitted with stridor and respiratory distress comprise a complex patient group that requires the otolaryngologist to decide when to assess and intervene with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (DLB). Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether RVP positive testing is correlated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. Methods A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. Results Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have an anatomic airway abnormality (p = 0.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (p = 0.0464). The most common reason for DLB was to assess for structural airway abnormality. Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. Conclusions Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare. RVP positivity, specific pathogens identified on RVP, and presence of URI symptoms were not associated with perioperative complications.","Niermeyer, Weston L.; Ball, Jessica; Worobetz, Noah; Bourgeois, Tran; Onwuka, Amanda; Burrier, Candice; Chiang, Tendy",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388322/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587620302007?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587620302007; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110057,490

PERSPECTIVE: We describe the need to sustainably resume, and temporarily expand, routine elective cardiac services in the face of resurgent COVID-19. Some, but not all, cardiac patient groups are particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes following COVID-19 infection. We explore mitigation measures at the institutional level to increase resilience within cardiac services to enable them to operate deep into subsequent waves of COVID infection which place unprecedented demands on intensive care infrastructure. As measures to eradicate the virus appear to have failed in many countries, and vaccine roll-out will take many months we take the view that the threat imposed by endemic COVID-19 alters the way elective procedural care should be offered to cardiovascular patients. CONCLUSION: Our patients are at definite risk from their cardiovascular disease, and a return to suspension of proven prognostic interventional treatments on an elective basis – the default for the first wave – must be avoided at all costs.","Zaman, Mahvash; Tiong, Denise; Saw, Jacqueline; Zaman, Sarah; Daniels, Matthew J.",Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-021-00901-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642850/,490

We hypothesized that prior infection with ZIKV could be confirmed through the presence of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) of the 3′ untranslated region (UTR), which persists in tissues due to XRN-1 stalling during RNA decay. We amplified ZIKV sfRNA but not NS5 from three experimentally-infected Jamaican fruit bats, supporting the hypothesis of sfRNA tissue persistence. Applying this approach to 198 field samples from Uganda, we confirmed presence of ZIKV sfRNA, but not NS5, in four bats representing three species: Eidolon helvum (n = 2), Epomophorus labiatus (n = 1), and Rousettus aegyptiacus (n = 1). Amplified sequence was most closely related to Asian lineage ZIKV.

With the emergence of COVID-19, this requirement has been even greater. This review was undertaken to determine the impact of the pandemic on safety and surveillance of opioids in the United Kingdom. RECENT FINDINGS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surveillance of opioids in the United Kingdom continued, although primary research was often conducted with data prior to the pandemic. Of those studies that were conducted while the pandemic was ongoing, access to opioids (or opioid substitution therapy) and the subsequent effect on patient safety was the main theme. SUMMARY: In the United Kingdom, changes in accessibility to the healthcare system and how healthcare providers operated during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had unintended consequences on use and safety of opioids, due to the shift in focus to preventing COVID-19 from overwhelming the healthcare system. The findings from this review support the need to continue surveillance in the United Kingdom, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on opioid utilization and safety.","Osborne, Vicki",Curr Opin Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993168/; https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000719,490

648380,[Development Progress of Ventilator],2021,"OBJECTIVE: A key challenge towards a successful COVID-19 vaccine uptake is vaccine hesitancy. We examine and provide novel insights on the key drivers and barriers towards COVID-19 vaccine uptake. DESIGN: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK in September 2020. The survey was designed to include several sections to collect demographic data and responses on (1) extent of agreement regarding various statements about COVID-19 and vaccinations, (2) previous vaccination habits (eg, if they had previously declined vaccination) and (3) interest in participation in vaccine trials. Multinominal logistic models examined demographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. We used principle component analysis and text mining to explore perception related to vaccine uptake. SETTING: The survey was circulated through various media, including posts on social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram), national radio, news articles, Clinical Research Network website and newsletter, and through 150 West Midlands general practices via a text messaging service. PARTICIPANTS: There were a total of 4884 respondents of which 9.44% were black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) group. The majority were women (n=3416, 69.9%) and of white ethnicity (n=4127, 84.5%). RESULTS: Regarding respondents, overall, 3873 (79.3%) were interested in taking approved COVID-19 vaccines, while 677 (13.9%) were unsure, and 334 (6.8%) would not take a vaccine. Participants aged over 70 years old (OR=4.63) and the BAME community (OR=5.48) were more likely to take an approved vaccine. Smokers (OR=0.45) and respondents with no known illness (OR=0.70) were less likely to accept approved vaccines. The study identified 16 key reasons for not accepting approved vaccines, the most common (60%) being the possibility of the COVID-19 vaccine having side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an insight into focusing on specific populations to reduce vaccine hesitancy. This proves crucial in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sethi, Sonika; Kumar, Aditi; Mandal, Anandadeep; Shaikh, Mohammed; Hall, Claire A; Kirk, Jeremy M W; Moss, Paul; Brookes, Matthew J; Basu, Supratik",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130964/,490

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterizes the most critical stage of the illness with progressive respiratory failure. Hypoxemia is the most dangerous and challenging problem. We suggest an inductive study approach to postulate a hypothesis and synthesis of supporting evidence as a trial to resolve hypoxia in patients with COVID-19 by increasing the volume of fetal hemoglobin which has a high affinity for oxygen using methods for hypothesis related research evidence synthesis. CONCLUSION: We recommend involving umbilical cord fetal blood transfusion or the use of hydroxyl urea as a clinical trial on COVID-19 patients and also for all other types of ARDS to determine its efficacy in correction of hypoxemia, controlling progression of the disease, and increasing survival rate.","Abdelzaher, Muhamed A.; Ibrahim, Ashraf E.

Fundus examination showed moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy of both eyes with scattered microaneurysms. On initial visit, FA displayed a hyperfluorescent lesion with leakage on late frames in the left eye. OCT revealed the lesion to be spheroid with a hyperreflective wall and hyporeflective lumen in the inner retina, corresponding to a capillary macroaneurysm. Intraretinal cystic fluid surrounded the lesion. On subsequent visit 7 months later, subretinal fluid in the location of the capillary macroaneurysm was noted on OCT. Vision was maintained at 20/30–2 OD, 20/40 OS throughout. No treatment was necessary.

Herein we conceptualize hospital surge elements, and lessons learnt from such events, to help build appropriately matched responses to future ID surge threats. METHODS: We used the Interpretive Descriptive qualitative approach. Interviews (n = 35) were conducted with governance and public health specialists; hospital based staff; and General Practitioners. Key policy literature in tandem with the interview data were used to iteratively generate a Hospital ID Surge framework. We anchored our narrative account within this framework, which is used to structure our analysis. RESULTS: A spectrum of surge threats from combinations of capacity (for crowding) and capability (for treatment complexity) demands were identified. Starting with the Pyramid scenario, or an influx of high screening rates flooding Emergency Departments, alongside fewer and manageable admissions; the Reverse-Pyramid occurs when few cases are screened and admitted but those that are, are complex; during a ‘Black’ scenario, the system is overburdened by both crowding and complexity. The Singapore hospital system is highly adapted to crowding, functioning remarkably well at constant near-full capacity in Peacetime and resilient to Endemic surges. We catalogue 26 strategies from lessons learnt relating to staffing, space, supplies and systems, crystalizing institutional memory. The DECIDE model advocates linking these strategies to types of surge threats and offers a step-by-step guide for coordinating outbreak planning and response. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of a shared definition and decision making of surge threats had rendered the procedures somewhat duplicative. This burden was paradoxically exacerbated by a health system that highly prizes planning and forward thinking, but worked largely in silo until an ID crisis hit. Many such lessons can be put into play to further strengthen our current hospital governance and adapted to more diverse settings.","Singh, Shweta R.; Coker, Richard; Vrijhoef, Hubertus J-M; Leo, Yee Sin; Chow, Angela; Lim, Poh Lian; Tan, Qinghui; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Hildon, Zoe Jane-Lara",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870193/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-017-2552-1,490

We present case volume data from our community hospital to demonstrate how this shutdown affected surgical care. METHODS: Between March 16 and June 14, 2020, all elective surgeries were canceled at our institution. All procedures performed during this operating room shutdown (ORS) were logged, as well as those 4 weeks before (PRE) and 4 weeks after (POST) for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2,475 cases were included in our analysis, with 754 occurring during shutdown. Overall case numbers dropped significantly during ORS and increased during recovery (mean 245.0±28.4 PRE vs. 58.0±30.9 ORS vs. 186.0±19.4 POST cases/week, p <0.001).

CONCLUSION: Operative volume significantly decreased during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Emergency cases predominated during this time, although there were fewer emergency cases overall. General/vascular surgery became the most active service and open surgeries became more common.

661175,The COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021: Avoiding Overdiagnosis of Anaphylaxis Risk While Safely Vaccinating the World,2021-01-30,"INTRODUCTION: Passive data from smartphone sensors may be useful for health‐care research. Our aim was to use the coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic as a positive control to assess the ability to quantify behavioral changes in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from smartphone data. METHODS: Eight participants used the Beiwe smartphone application, which passively measured their location during the COVID‐19 outbreak. We used an interrupted time series to quantify the effect of the US state of emergency declaration on daily home time and daily distance traveled. RESULTS: After the state of emergency declaration, median daily home time increased from 19.4 (interquartile range [IQR], 15.4‐22.0) hours to 23.7 (IQR, 22.2‐24.0) hours and median distance traveled decreased from 42 (IQR, 13‐83) km to 3.7 (IQR, 1.5‐10.3) km. The participant with the lowest functional ability changed behavior earlier. This participant stayed at home more and traveled less than the participant with highest functional ability, both before and after the state of emergency. DISCUSSION: We provide evidence that smartphone‐based digital phenotyping can quantify the behavior of people with ALS. Although participants spent large amounts of time at home at baseline, the COVID‐19 state of emergency declaration reduced their mobility further. Given participants' high level of daily home time, it is possible that their exposure to COVID‐19 could be less than that of the general population.","Beukenhorst, Anna L.; Collins, Ella; Burke, Katherine M.; Rahman, Syed Minhajur; Clapp, Margaret; Konanki, Sai Charan; Paganoni, Sabrina; Miller, Timothy M.; Chan, James; Onnela, Jukka‐Pekka; Berry, James D.",Muscle Nerve,https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.27110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118628/,490

METHODS: Data for the retrospective cohort study were collected from a large UK tertiary maternity unit over a 4-week period using computerised hospital records. Literature searches were performed across multiple repositories. COVID-19 prevalence was extracted from online repositories. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 457/465 (98%) women during the study period. The median turnaround time for results was 5.3 h (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6–8.9 h), with 92% of the results returned within 24 h. In our cohort, only one woman tested positive, giving a screen positive rate of 0.22% (1/457; 95% CI: 0.04–1.23%). One woman who tested negative developed a fever postnatally following discharge but was lost to follow-up. From our literature review, we did not find any correlation between asymptomatic carriage in pregnant women and the reported regional prevalence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Testing using the SAMBA-II machine was acceptable to the vast majority of pregnant women requiring admission and had a low turnaround time. Asymptomatic carriage is low, but not correlated to community prevalence rates. Screening pregnant women on admission will remain an important component in order to minimise nosocomial infection.

Therefore, these patients need to take additional precautions against the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to examine factors associated with precautionary behavior among Israeli breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of knowledge about COVID-19, perceived threat, sense of mastery, social support, precautionary behavior, and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multivariate regression model was calculated with precautionary behavior as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The mean of precautionary behavior score was relatively high. Participants perceived their health as relatively good, had relatively high knowledge about COVID-19, and moderate perceived threat. Sense of mastery was relatively moderate and perceived social support was relatively high. In the multivariate regression analysis, after controlling for the background variables, knowledge about COVID-19 (F(2,149) = 8.68, p < 0.001; beta = 0.36) was significantly associated with precautionary behavior. This variable explained 15.4% of the precautionary behavior variance. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that in order to enhance precautionary behavior among women with breast cancer during a pandemic outbreak, it is recommended to pay attention their knowledge about the virus.","Shinan-Altman, Shiri; Levkovich, Inbar",Support Care Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05948-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404805/,490
672131,Unusual Clinical Manifestations and Outcome of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in a Tertiary Care Hospital of North India,2021-01-29,"Objectives We sought to explore the spectrum of cardiac abnormalities in student-athletes who returned to university campus in July 2020 with an uncomplicated Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Background There is limited information regarding cardiovascular involvement in young individuals with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Methods Screening echocardiograms were performed in 54 consecutive student-athletes (mean age: 19 years, 85% males) who tested positive on reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction nasal swab testing of the upper respiratory tract or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A sequential cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed in 48 (89%) subjects. Results A total of 16 (30%) athletes were asymptomatic while 36 (66%) and 2 (4%) reported mild and moderate COVID-19 related symptoms, respectively. For the 48 athletes completing both imaging studies, abnormal findings were identified in 27 (56.3%) individuals. This included 19 (39.5%) showing pericardial late enhancements with associated pericardial effusion. Of the individuals with pericardial enhancements, 6 (12.5%) had reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS) and/or an increased native T1. One patient showed myocardial enhancement and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or reduced GLS with or without increased native T1 were also identified in additional 7 (14.6%) individuals. Native T2 were normal in all subjects and no specific imaging features of myocardial inflammation were identified. Hierarchical clustering of LV regional strain identified three unique myopericardial phenotypes that showed significant association with the CMR findings (P=0.03). Conclusion Over one in three previously healthy college-athletes recovering from COVID-19 infection showed imaging features of a resolving pericardial inflammation. Although subtle changes in myocardial structure and function were identified, no athlete showed specific imaging features to suggest an ongoing myocarditis. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical implications and long-term evolution of these abnormalities in uncomplicated COVID-19.","Brito, Daniel; Meester, Scott; Yanamala, Naveena; Patel, Heenaben B.; Balcik, Brenden J.; Casaclang-Verzosa, Grace; Seetharam, Karthik; Riveros, Diego; Beto, Robert James; Balla, Sudarshan; Monseau, Aaron J.; Sengupta, Partho P.",JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.10.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223496/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1936878X20309463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936878X20309463?v=s5,490
672209,Healthcare Facilities Should Publicly Report the COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage of Healthcare Personnel,2021,"Background: Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences have raised fears of its psychological impact. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of student status on mental health conditions during Covid-19 general lockdown among adults in France. Methods: Using cross-sectional data of the Confins cohort, we estimated the effect of student status on depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicidal thoughts and perceived stress using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Stratified models for college students and non-students were performed to identify associated population-specific factors. Results: Among the 2260 included participants, students represented 59% (n=1335 vs 925 non-students) and 78% of the total sample were female. Student status was more frequently associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted OR(aOR)=1.58; 95%CI 1.17;2.14), anxiety symptoms (aOR=1.51; 95%CI 1.10;2.07), perceived stress (n=1919, aOR=1.70, 95%CI 1.26;2.29) and frequent suicidal thoughts (n=1919, aOR=1.57, 95%CI 0.97;2.53). Lockdown conditions that could be potentially aggravating on mental health like isolation had a higher impact on students than non-students. Limitations: Participants were volunteers, which could limit generalisation of the findings. The cross-sectional design did not allow determining if lockdown impacted directly mental health or if there is another cause. However, we adjusted analyses with the history of psychiatric disorders, and factors related to lockdown conditions were associated with mental health disturbances. Conclusions: College student's mental health is of great importance in the context of the general lockdown set up during the pandemic. Follow-up and interventions should be implemented especially for those at high-risk (younger people and those with history of psychiatric disorders).","Arsandaux, J.; Montagni, I.; Macalli, M.; Texier, N.; Pouriel, M.; Germain, R.; Mebarki, A.; Kinouani, S.; Tournier, M.; Schuck, S.; Tzourio, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.04.20225706; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.04.20225706v1?rss=1,490
673071,"Derivation and Validation of Clinical Prediction Rules for COVID-19 Mortality in Ontario, Canada",2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the occurrence of symptoms resembling those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a large nonhospitalized population at the peak of the epidemic in Italy is of paramount importance; however, data are currently scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the association of self-reported symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test results in nonhospitalized individuals and to estimate the occurrence of symptoms associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a larger nontested population. METHODS: EPICOVID19 is a self-administered cross-sectional voluntary web-based survey of adults throughout Italy who completed an anonymous questionnaire in the period of April 13 to 21, 2020. The associations between symptoms potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and NPS results were calculated as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% CIs by multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, education, smoking habits, and number of comorbidities. Thereafter, for each symptom and for combinations of the symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and areas under the curve (AUCs) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the occurrence of COVID-19–like infection in the nontested population. RESULTS: A total of 171,310 people responded to the survey, of whom 102,543 (59.9%) were women; mean age 47.4 years. Out of the 4785 respondents with known NPS test results, 4392 were not hospitalized. Among the 4392 nonhospitalized respondents, those with positive NPS tests (856, 19.5%) most frequently reported myalgia (527, 61.6%), olfactory and taste disorders (507, 59.2%), cough (466, 54.4%), and fever (444, 51.9%), whereas 7.7% were asymptomatic. Multiple regression analysis showed that olfactory and taste disorders (aOR 10.3, 95% CI 8.4-12.7), fever (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.1), myalgia (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8), and cough (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) were associated with NPS positivity. Having two to four of these symptoms increased the aOR from 7.4 (95% CI 5.6-9.7) to 35.5 (95% CI 24.6-52.2). The combination of the four symptoms showed an AUC of 0.810 (95% CI 0.795-0.825) in classifying positive NPS test results and then was applied to the nonhospitalized and nontested sample (n=165,782). We found that 7739 to 20,103 of these 165,782 respondents (4.4% to 12.1%) had experienced symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that self-reported symptoms are reliable indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pandemic context. A nonnegligible number of symptomatic respondents (up to 12.1%) were undiagnosed and potentially contributed to the spread of the infection.

It has been described as associated with either genetic or environmental risk factors, such as viral infections, and in a few cases has been reported to be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although steroid treatment is the most widely used first-line treatment of ITP, in the early days of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) it was controversial, but it has since become approved in treatment for COVID-19. The authors report two different cases of COVID-19-associated ITP, with special emphasis on the timing of presentation, severity, and treatment decisions. Remarkably, one of the patients who suffered severe thrombocytopenia was safely treated with corticosteroids in the late phase of COVID-19 infection.","Pedroso, Ana; Frade, Luciana; Trevas, Sara; Correia, Maria João; Esteves, Ana Luísa",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269133/,490

Therefore, we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, n = 204), inpatients (cohort B, n = 81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohort C, n = 23). Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6 μmol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.","Hippchen, Theresa; Altamura, Sandro; Muckenthaler, Martina U.; Merle, Uta",Hemasphere,https://doi.org/10.1097/hs9.0000000000000492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33205000/,490

With this important step achieved, it is now time to consider what is needed to bring disease-modifying therapy for prevention or delay of T1D to clinical use from this point. Long considered a chicken and egg problem (why screen for T1D risk when we have no therapy, and how can we develop therapies without more screening), we now have the opportunity to break this impasse. The purpose of this article is to place this clinical trial result in context, highlighting key foundational studies leading to this accomplishment, addressing the current gaps, and suggesting that a key next step for prevention of T1D is to screen and monitor relatives for T1D risk in the context of clinical care.","Greenbaum, Carla J.",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db20-1112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931405/,490

Hydrous ethanol was selected for blending in diesel to produce diesohol. The palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and PFADE were directly blended in ethanol and diesel. A comparative study of the phase stability in diesel–PFAD–hydrous ethanol and diesel–PFADE–hydrous ethanol was performed with varied blend proportions. The fuel properties, emissions (CO, CO(2), NO(x), O(2), exhaust gas temperature), and fuel consumptions of diesel, PFADE, diesel–PFADE–hydrous ethanol were compared to evaluate the feasibilities of these fuel blends in a diesel engine at the engine speeds 1100, 1400, 1700, 2000, and 2300 rpm. At 2300 rpm, the maximum CO(2) emission with 10 wt % hydrous ethanol in the blend was approximately 2%. With regard to fuel consumption, clearly, 20 wt % diesohol gave higher consumption than 10 wt % ethanol at a maximum engine speed of 2300 rpm. The blend D50PE40E10 gave the lowest fuel consumption, while the maximum fuel consumption was with the D10PE70E20 blend. Therefore, both 10 and 20 wt % hydrous ethanol in the diesel fuel are alternatives usable in a diesel engine without modifications.","Thawornprasert, Jarernporn; Somnuk, Krit; Oo, Ye Min; Prateepchaikul, Gumpon",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832756/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c01475,490

Aim of the article is to verify the most frequent reasons for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and their role in the secondary transmission of the infection. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in all SARS-CoV-2 positive children (n = 81) and an equal number of age- and sex- matched controls who were referred to the S. Camillo-Forlanini Pediatric Walk-in Center of Rome. The results of all SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs performed in children aged < 18 years from October 16 to December 19, 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: School contacts were more frequent in controls than in cases (OR 0.49; 95% CI: 0.3–0.9), while household contacts were higher in cases (OR 5.09; 95% CI: 2.2–12.0). In both cases and controls, school contacts were significantly less frequent, while on the contrary household contacts seemed to be more frequent in nursery school children compared to primary school or middle/high school children. A multivariate logistic regression showed that the probability of being positive to SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in children who had school contacts or who had flu symptoms compared to children who had household contacts. Results showed a 30.6% secondary attack rate for household contacts. CONCLUSION: In our study population, the two most frequent reasons for SARS-CoV-2 infection were school and home contacts. The risk of being positive was 5 times lower in children who had school contacts than in children who had household contacts.
