Simple HIV tests need to be performed in hospitals or other medical agencies instead of more invasive HIV blood tests. To enable point-of-care (POC) HIV diagnostics, based on a recently developed lateral flow strip for HIV urine testing, a microfluidic immunoassay cassette with a handheld optical reader is developed. Based on lateral flow strip with gold colloid reporter, the integrated immunoassay cassette can perform sample introduction, metering, discharging, applying and detection which simplifies HIV testing. An indicator is incorporated into the cassette to guide sample introduction based on color change, and further, the excess test sample is stored inside the sealed cassette to avoid any contamination. The low-cost handheld optical reader can provide a test result within a few seconds, which is useful for simple, sensitive and affordable HIV onsite detection. Instead of using normal white LEDs, a customized back light module embedded with green LEDs is adopted to illuminate the lateral flow strip with an appropriate working current to achieve optimal performance. Compared to the standard lateral flow strips using a benchtop reader, with the disposable immunoassay cassette assisted by the handheld optical reader, more convenient, easier-to-operate, and more affordable HIV urine testing can be achieved in POC diagnostics.","Yang, Wenbo; Yang, Dianlong; Gong, Shisong; Dong, Xiaobing; Liu, Luyao; Yu, Shengda; Zhang, Xiaolei; Ge, Shengxiang; Wang, Dong; Xia, Ningshao; Yu, Duli; Qiu, Xianbo",Biomed Microdevices,620,9

METHODS This was an epidemiological, observational, descriptive study. Between March and September of 2020, all outpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a tertiary medical center located in Santiago de Chile were included. Demographic variables, comorbidities, red flags, and other symptoms were compiled using follow-up surveys at specific time points. The risk of clinical worsening (hospitalization) and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. RESULTS A total of 7,108 patients were included. The median age was 38 years (range, 0-101), and 52% were men. At baseline, 77% of the patients reported having characteristic symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most prevalent onset symptoms were headache (53%), myalgia (47%), and fever (33%). According to the follow-up surveys, the incidence of symptoms decreased during the isolation period; however, 28% of the patients still presented with symptoms on day 14. The risk of hospitalization for patients with new-onset fever and dyspnea during the follow-up period was HR = 7.43 (95% CI, 3.85-14.3, p<0.01) and HR = 5.27 (95% CI, 1.52-18.30; p < 0.01 for both), respectively. New-onset chest pain showed no association with clinical worsening. CONCLUSIONS In this sample of outpatients with a recent diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a survey-based monitoring of symptoms was useful to identify those at risk of clinical worsening. New-onset fever and dyspnea during the isolation period were considered as red flags associated with clinical worsening and warrants prompt medical evaluation.","Simian, Daniela; Martínez, Maripaz; Dreyse, Jorge; Chomali, May; Retamal, Marcelo; Labarca, Gonzalo",Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia,620,0

Whether direct EVT (dEVT) could improve the chances of favorable outcome remains unknown. Methods Consecutively, prospectively enrolled patients with ELVO presenting within 4 h of onset were entered into a National Acute Stroke Registry of patients undergoing revascularization. Patients treated with bridging were compared to those treated with dEVT. Excellent outcome was defined as having a modified Rankin Scale score ≤1 at 90 days following stroke. Results Out of 392 patients that underwent thrombectomy, 270 (68%) presented within 4 h and were included. Of those, 159 (59%) underwent bridging and 111 (41%) underwent dEVT. Atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure were more common in the dEVT group (43 vs. 30%, p = 0.04 and 20 vs. 8%, p = 0.009, respectively), but other risk factors, demographics, stroke severity and subtypes as well as baseline vessel patency state and time metrics did not differ. Excellent target vessel recanalization defined as TICI 3 (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score) was more common in the dEVT group (75 vs. 61%, p = 0.03), but in-hospital mortality, discharge destinations, short- and long-term excellent outcome rates did not differ. On multivariate regression analysis, treatment modality did not significantly modify the chances of excellent outcome at discharge (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.3-1.5) or at 3 months (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.4-1.4). Conclusions The chances of attaining excellent functional outcomes are similar in ELVO patients undergoing dEVT or bridging.","Leker, Ronen R; Cohen, Jose E; Tanne, David; Orion, David; Telman, Gregory; Raphaeli, Guy; Amsalem, Jacob; Streifler, Jonathan Y; Hallevi, Hen; Gavriliuc, Pavel; Bornstein, Natan M; Horev, Anat; Yaghmour, Nour Eddine",Interventional neurology,620,24

Malnutrition is a risk factor for postoperative complications and a poor prognosis. Early evaluation and management of nutrition can improve these outcomes. Various combined indices in which albumin is the primary component are used to evaluate the nutritional status, including the Prognostic Nutritional Index, Glasgow Prognostic Score, and Controlling Nutritional Status score. Both the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism guidelines recommend immediate and early oral/enteral nutrition. However, few reports have described the additional effects of preoperative immunonutrition on clinical outcomes of gastric cancer surgery. Gastrectomy types and reconstruction methods that consider the postoperative nutritional status have been used when oncologically acceptable. Total gastrectomy has recently tended to be avoided because of its negative impact on nutritional status. New findings obtained from the emergence of continuous glucose measurement, such as glucose fluctuation and nocturnal hypoglycemia, may affect nutritional management after gastrectomy. Some prospective clinical studies on perioperative nutritional intervention have set postoperative body weight loss as a primary endpoint. It seems important to continue oral nutritional supplement, even in small doses, to reduce body weight loss after gastrectomy. Evidence generated by prospective, well-developed randomized controlled studies must be disseminated so that nutritional therapy is widely recognized as an important multimodal therapy in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery.","Kubota, Takeshi; Shoda, Katsutoshi; Konishi, Hirotaka; Okamoto, Kazuma; Otsuji, Eigo",Annals of gastroenterological surgery,620,1

Human health risk and threats to aquatic organisms from heavy metals were assessed. Heavy metals have no regular spatial distribution. Biochemical parameters and nutrients pollute seriously in midstream and downstream, respectively. Hydrochemical indices suggested high levels of pollution in the midstream section. Water quality improved downstream of the Fenhe Reservoir, but total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the downstream section increased in recent years. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CWQI) suggested midstream water quality was poor in general, and 80% of annual calculations had a marginal grade. For aquatic organisms, ecological risks of Cu and Zn were high. For local residents, drinking water was generally safe, but continued monitoring is critical due to ongoing threats to water quality in these areas.","Li, Yuan; Wang, Fei; Feng, Jia; Lv, Junping; Liu, Qi; Nan, Fangru; Liu, Xudong; Xu, Lan; Xie, Shulian",Environmental science and pollution research international,620,1

The WHO has in the seven decades of its existence used its formidable legislative powers only sparingly. It has been widely chided for being weak in regional coordination and unresponsive to transnational emergencies like the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. In 2020, it found itself at the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the middle of the Sino-American geopolitical tug-of-war. This paper traces the discordance between the Constitution's stated purposes and the actual track record of the WHO not back to its organisational culture nor to weak leadership but to the design of the Constitution itself. It analytically distinguishes the Constitution's expressive from its instrumental halves, and shows that, whilst the former embodies a 'constitutional moment' of international health solidarity right after the Second World War, the latter embodies a reserved and limited delegation from member-states that are jealous of their sovereignty.","Ip, Eric C","Health economics, policy, and law",620,1

Previous studies revealed a prevalence of 7%-56% of hypokalaemia in patients taking thiazide diuretics. The clinical manifestations of hypokalaemia due to diuretics are non-specific, varying from asymptomatic to fatal arrhythmia. Diagnosis of hypokalaemia is based on the level of serum potassium. ECG is useful in identifying the more severe consequences. A high dosage of diuretics and concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of potassium depletion or cardiac arrhythmias can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Thiazide-induced potassium depletion may cause dysglycaemia. The risk of thiazide-induced hypokalaemia is higher in women and in black people. Reducing diuretic dose and potassium supplementation are the most direct and effective therapies for hypokalaemia. Combining with a potassium-sparing diuretic or blocker of the renin-angiotensin system also reduces the risk of hypokalaemia. Lowering salt intake and increasing intake of vegetables and fruits help to reduce blood pressure as well as prevent hypokalaemia.","Lin, Ziying; Wong, Louisa Y F; Cheung, Bernard M Y",Postgraduate medical journal,620,1

On the liability side, the risks are driven by future mortality developments as well as price and wage inflation. All the risk factors are modeled as a multivariate stochastic process that captures the dynamics and the dependencies across different risk factors. The model is easy to interpret and to calibrate to both historical data and to forecasts or expert views concerning the future. The simple structure of the model allows for efficient computations.

This change in practice patterns may place patients at risk of a perceived lower-quality exchange with their healthcare provider, which may in turn impact satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: This study compares patient satisfaction scores between in-person clinic visits and telemedicine video visits in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with CRS presenting to an academic rhinology clinic between March to April 2020 were retrospectively divided into video visits (VV) and clinic visits (CV) groups based on mandated state quarantine orders on March 19. Patient demographics, disease severity measures, and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 (PSQ-18) scores were collected and analyzed. Chi square test and Fisher's exact test were performed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age (p = 0.81), gender (p = 0.55), CRS phenotype (p = 0.16), and disease severity measures (Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT-22) (p = 0.92); Lund-Mackay score (p = 0.96)) between the video and clinic visit groups. There were no significant differences in PSQ-18 total scores (VV PSQ-18 mean score = 78.1, CV PSQ-18 mean score = 78.4; p = 0.67) or the following subdomain scores between the two groups: general satisfaction (p = 0.73), technical quality (p = 0.62), interpersonal manner (p = 0.41), communication (p = 0.31), financial aspects (p = 0.89), time spent with doctor (p = 0.88), and accessibility and convenience (p = 0.47). CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic parallels that of traditional in-person visits.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoting molecules such as peroxides are detrimental to many viruses, including coronaviruses. In this paper, metal decorated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) adsorption for potential use for designing viral inactivation surfaces. We employed first-principles methods based on the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the capture of an individual H2O2 molecule on pristine and metal (Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Ru) decorated SWCNTs. Although the single H2O2 molecule is weakly physisorbed on pristine SWCNT, a significant improvement on its adsorption energy was found by utilizing metal functionalized SWCNT as the adsorbent. It was revealed that Rh-SWCNT and Ru-SWCNT systems demonstrate outstanding performance for H2O2 adsorption. Furthermore, we discovered through calculations that Pt- and Cu-decorated SWNCT-H2O2 systems show high potential for filters for virus removal and inactivation with a very long shelf-life (2.2 × 1012 and 1.9 × 108 years, respectively). The strong adsorption of metal decorated SWCNTs and the long shelf-life of these nanomaterials suggest they are exceptional candidates for designing personal protection equipment against viruses.","Aasi, Aref; Aghaei, Sadegh M; Moore, Matthew D; Panchapakesan, Balaji",Int. j. mol. sci.

Studies of cross-species transmission, and intra-species transmission of antigenically variable viruses, indicates T/F variants may express distinct, transmissibility enhancing phenotypes. However, with evidence that transmissibility is associated with not only intrinsic virological features, such as virion composition, but also extrinsic factors, such as viral population structure, the challenge of resolving T/F signatures that can be targeted by rational vaccine or antiviral design is substantial. Nonetheless, failure to develop vaccines for antigenically variable viruses, such as HIV/HCV, and the ongoing risk of cross-species transmission with pandemic potential, recommends development of T/F targeting vaccines. In this commentary, the T/F phenomena is introduced, explored in both the classical (HIV) and non-canonical (coronaviruses) instances, and discussed in relation to rational and preemptive vaccine design.","Mosa, Alexander I",Hum Vaccin Immunother,620,1

Old age, comorbid conditions, end-stage organ impairment, and advanced cancer, increase the risk of mortality in serious COVID-19. A subset of serious COVID-19 patients with serious acute respiratory illness may be triaged not to receive aggressive intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and ventilation or may be discontinued from ventilation due to their underlying conditions. Those not eligible for aggressive ICU measures should receive appropriate symptom management. Early warning scores (EWS), oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate, can facilitate categorizing COVID-19 patients as stable, unstable, and end of life. Breathlessness, delirium, respiratory secretions, and pain, are the key symptoms that need to be assessed and palliated. Palliative sedation measures are needed to manage intractable symptoms. Goals of care should be discussed, and advance care plan should be made in patients who are unlikely to benefit from aggressive ICU measures and ventilation. For patients who are already in an ICU, either ventilated or needing ventilation, a futility assessment is made. If there is a consensus on futility, a family meeting is conducted either virtually or face to face depending on the infection risk and infection control protocol. The family should be sensitively communicated about the futility of ICU measures and foregoing life-sustaining treatment. Family meeting outcomes are documented, and consent for foregoing life-sustaining treatment is obtained.

This coronavirus mainly spreads through the respiratory tract and enters cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, and fatigue. Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, anorexia, and vomiting) may be present in 50% of patients and may be associated with worst prognosis. Other risk factors are older age, male gender, and underlying chronic diseases. Mitigation measures are essential to reduce the number of people infected. Hospitals are a place of increased SARS-CoV-2 exposure. This has implications in the organization of healthcare services and specifically endoscopy departments. Patients and healthcare workers safety must be optimized in this new reality. Comprehension of COVID-19 gastrointestinal manifestations and implications of SARS-CoV-2 in the management of patients with gastrointestinal diseases, under or not immunosuppressant therapies, is essential. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress and major societies recommendations regarding the implications of COVID-19 in gastroenterology, namely the adaptations that gastroenterology/endoscopy departments and professionals must do in order to optimize the provided assistance, as well as the implications that this infection will have, in particularly vulnerable patients such as those with chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease under or not immunosuppressant therapies.","Ferreira-Silva, Joel; Peixoto, Armando; Rodrigues-Pinto, Eduardo; Macedo, Guilherme",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,620,29

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on AIH patients with COVID-19 from 34 centres in Europe and the Americas. We analyzed factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission, and/or death. The outcomes of patients with AIH were compared to a propensity-score matched cohort of non-AIH patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD) and COVID-19. The frequency and clinical significance of new-onset liver injury (alanine aminotransferase>2xupper limit of normal) during COVID-19 was also evaluated. RESULTS: We included 110 AIH patients (80%,female) with a median age of 49 (range:18-85) years at COVID-19 diagnosis. New-onset liver injury was observed in 37.1% (33/89) of the patients. Use of antivirals was associated with liver injury (p=0.041; odds ratio (OR) 3.36[1.05-10.78]) while continued immunosuppression during COVID-19 was associated with a lower rate of liver injury (p=0.009; OR 0.26[0.09-0.71]). The rates of severe COVID-19 (15.5% vs 20.2% p=0.231) and all-cause mortality (10% vs 11.5%; p=0.852) were not different between AIH and non-AIH CLD. Cirrhosis was an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 in patients with AIH (p<0.001; OR 17.46[4.22-72.13]). Continuation of immunosuppression or presence of liver injury during COVID-19 was not associated with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This international, multi-center study reveals that patients with AIH were not at risk for worse outcomes with COVID-19 than other causes of CLD. Cirrhosis was the strongest predictor for severe COVID-19 in AIH patients. Maintenance of immunosuppression during COVID-19 was not associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19, but did lower the risk for new-onset liver injury during COVID-19.","Efe, Cumali; Dhanasekaran, Renumathy; Lammert, Craig; Ebi, Berat; Higuera-de la Tijera, Fatima; Aloman, Costica; Riza Caliskan, Ali; Peralta, Mirta; Gerussi, Alessio; Massoumi, Hatef; Catana, Andreea M; Torgutalp, Murat; Purnak, Tugrul; Rigamonti, Cristina; Gomez Aldana, Andres Jose; Khakoo, Nidah; Kacmaz, Hüseyin; Nazal, Leyla; Frager, Shalom; Demir, Nurhan; Irak, Kader; Ellik, Zeynep Melekoglu; Balaban, Yasemin; Atay, Kadri; Eren, Fatih; Cristoferi, Laura; Batibay, Ersin; Urzua, Álvaro; Snijders, Romee; Kiyici, Murat; Akyildiz, Murat; Ekin, Nazim; Carr, Rotonya M; Harputoglu, Murat; Hatemi, Ibrahim; Mendizabal, Manuel; Silva, Marcelo; Idilman, Ramazan; Silveira, Marina; Drenth, Joost P H; Assis, David N; Björnsson, Einar; Boyer, James L; Invernizzi, Pietro; Levy, Chyntia; Schiano, Thomas D; Ridruejo, Ezequiel; Wahlin, Staffan",Hepatology (Baltim.),620,2

Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing. Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing. A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sullivan, Patrick Sean; Sailey, Charles; Guest, Jodie Lynn; Guarner, Jeannette; Kelley, Colleen; Siegler, Aaron Julius; Valentine-Graves, Mariah; Gravens, Laura; Del Rio, Carlos; Sanchez, Travis Howard",JMIR Public Health Surveill,620,32

The knowledge about the impact of blood pressure lowering medications on outcomes is still incomplete: whilst studies about renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors did not show association with increased mortality, less is known about the impact of other antihypertensive classes. Diuretics, in particular, are frequently used in patients with hypertension thus we aimed to investigate the association between diuretics and mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in two referral centers in the Lombardy region (Istituto Auxologico Italiano and Humanitas Research Hospital) Methods: Data of con firmed COVID-19 patients, with information available about drug treatment and outcomes, were pooled together. Socio-demographic clinical features, and medications pre and during hospitalization were retrieved patients were classi fied according to the use of diuretics before and/or during hospitalization. The effect of diuretic use before and during hospitalization on death was estimated by means of a multiple Poisson regression model with robust variance and reported as Relative Risk (RR) and 95% con fidence interval (95% CI) Design and method: From the pooled sample of 637 patients, a final sample of 502 patients with complete data was analyzed (mean age 67 years, 67% males, 54% patients with hypertension). Among hypertensive patients, 64% were not treated with diuretics either pre-or during hospitalization (Reference group), 15% had diuretic treatment only during hospitalization (Group A), 9% only pre-hospitalization (Group B) and 12% both pre-and during hospitalization (Group C) After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, respiratory rate at admission, number of comorbidities, number of other drugs taken during hospitalization, orotracheal intubation), use of diuretics only during hospitalization was signi ficantly associated with mortality (Figure 1) Conclusion: Our data show an association between diuretic use only during hospitalization and worse outcome in patients with COVID-19. Such association needs to be further investigated in order to possibly improve outcomes in patients admitted for COVID-19 Figure 1: Relative Risks and 95% con fidence intervals of patients treated with diuretics only during hospitalization (Group A), only during pre-hospitalization (Group B) and during both pre-and hospitalization (Group C).

However, the importance of social distancing has recently been highlighted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of vaccination, or when vaccine efficacy is poor, social distancing may help to curb the spread of new virus strains. However, both vaccination and social distancing are associated with various costs. It is critical to consider these costs in addition to the benefits of these strategies when determining the optimal rates of application of control strategies. We developed a game-theoretic epidemiological model that considers vaccination and social distancing under the assumption that individuals pursue the maximization of payoffs.

Infections are more frequent in women than in men in close contact with probable/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consistent with deaths in men, they are hospitalized more frequently than women: Significant gender differences in signs/symptoms can drive this pattern, already observed in other pathologies. In late April, excess mortality is the same in women (67%) than in men (66%).

Current research posits that younger adults without persisting health conditions may be at reduced risk for complications of COVID-19 infection. However, young adults are often in unstable places in their careers, education, and social lives, which may be more disrupted by policy changes than those of older adults. Thus, it is imperative to identify young adult subgroups who are at increased risk for mental health difficulties to develop targeted interventions to mitigate emotional distress. This study recruited 620 young adults, Ages 18-35 (M = 26.59; SD = 5.24), to determine whether there were differences in self-reported anxiety and depression in the weeks following the pandemic declaration by gender (male, female, or nonbinary) and health status (i.e., the absence of health conditions, the presence of either physical or mental health conditions, and the presence of both physical and mental health conditions) using a 3 × 4 analysis of variance. For both depression and anxiety, nonbinary participants reported the highest levels, followed by female participants. For health status, those with both mental and physical health conditions reported the highest anxiety and depression, followed by those with mental health conditions, physical health conditions, and no health conditions. These findings call for resources to be directed toward individuals who fall into groups reporting greater emotional distress, so that clinicians can intervene as early as possible to prevent mental health decline.

The results obtained from analysis of prospectively collected database were compared with a similar period (group 1) prior to the onset of pandemic in India using appropriate statistical tests. In group 2, an increase (17%) in number of patients was noted. The need of organ support was more than 4 times the usual period. An upsurge in neurosurgical emergencies was noted, though the number of interventions decreased by 40%. A significant decrease in hospital stay was also documented (7 days vs 12 days).

Results reveal positive associations between stigmatization and stress, social avoidance, and fear of disclosure, in addition to positive associations between stress and social avoidance and fear of disclosure. Findings thus suggest that the effects of stigmatization on social avoidance and fear of disclosure is mediated, in part, by stress.

The patches in the lower row should be calorimetrically identical, while the color of the patches in the upper row should vary progressively in constant steps of CIELAB color difference along selected color space vector directions. Prospective observers are instructed to indicate the patch pair number for which they begin to perceive a slight color difference between corresponding patches. The frequency data obtained from the observers was used to build a threshold color-difference model. The intention was to validate the method with theoretical data to determine the effect of the precision with which the strips are constructed, on the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Theoretical frequency data was generated using the CIE94 color difference formula, whose associated color discrimination ellipsoid parameters are very easy to determine, associated with a hypothetical logistic psychometric curve for different color centers. The proposed method allows to determine color discrimination parameters with a precision nearby 4% and an accuracy of 3% with respect to the simulated theoretical parameters, for color samples generated with a standard deviation of &#916;Eab&#8727;=0.2 of the superimposed error around the ideal color difference of pairs of patches.","Brusola, Fernando; Tortajada, Ignacio; Lengua, Ismael; Jordá, Begoña; Peris-Fajarnés, Guillermo",Opt Express,620,1

Crowdsourcing for participant recruitment may also be one effective strategy to address ED research disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to: (a) develop a rigorous method for assessing self-reported athropometrics; (b) determine if individuals with EDs self-select into MTurk studies assessing eating behaviors; and (c) characterize ED-related psychopathology in an MTurk sample. We recruited 400 US adults to complete an MTurk study assessing ED features. Results did not indicate the presence of a self-selection bias among individuals with EDs; however, 40% of the sample met criteria for a current ED diagnosis, with all diagnoses represented except ARFID, and 18.1% reported currently being in ED treatment. The sample was characterized by higher scores on measures of ED psychopathology compared to extant non-clinical norms. Approximately 66% of the overall sample and 73% of participants with EDs indicated that they have participated in more MTurk studies since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Finally, we identified an alternative approach to assessing self-reported height and weight that appears to reduce error, which we strongly recommend researchers conducting online surveys use.

As businesses move to safely reopen and frontline healthcare workers (HCW) continue to face this crisis, it is essential that health officials know who in the population is at the greatest risk of mortality if hospitalized and, therefore, has the greatest need to protect themselves from being infected. We examined the factors that increase the risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the four Trinity Health of New England hospitals (THONE) in Connecticut and Massachusetts who either died or were discharged between March 1-April 22, 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes of care were extracted from the electronic health record. A model of in-hospital mortality was made using a generalized linear model with binomial distribution and log link. RESULTS: The analysis included 346 patients: 229 discharged and 117 deceased. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality was increased for patients who were aged 60 or older (relative risk [RR] = 2.873; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.733-4.764; p = <0.001), had diabetes (RR = 1.432; 95% CI,1.068-1.921; p = 0.016), or had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR = 1.410; 95% CI, 1.058-1.878; p = 0.019). Hyperlipidemia had a protective effect, reducing the likelihood of mortality (RR = 0.745; 95% CI, 0.568-0.975; p = 0.032). Sensitivity and specificity of the model were 51.4% and 88.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Being age 60 or older or having a history of diabetes or COPD are the most useful risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

During the pandemic, the medical community is faced with teaching students many skills necessary to become adept medical practitioners. Although the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity for the implementation of new technologies, virtual instruction does not have to end beyond this crisis. Virtual technology can teach medical students interpersonal skills such as empathy, engaging in difficult conversations, and delivering bad news. Because students have traditionally been exposed to passive teaching styles, it is time to look toward expanding medical students? repertoire and allow them to personalize their education.","Caruso, Jessica Harmon Lauren Born Gabriella Dufeau David",The FASEB Journal,620,1

The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was aberrantly expressed in many tumors. In this study, by exploring the TCGA and GTEx public databases, we investigated ACE2 expression and its association with prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most susceptible caner type. We found that lung was one of the major organs with highly expressed ACE2. Furthermore, ACE2 expression was significantly elevated in lung adenocarcioma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) compared to normal tissues. DNA methylation might be one possible mechanism leading to ACE2 upregulation. Despite that, the AEC2 expression was not statistically associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for LUAD patients, and higher ACE2 expression was associated with prolonged DFS in LUSC patients. Taken together, we observed ACE2 was highly expressed in LUAD and LUSC despite the controversial role of ACE2 expression in predicting prognosis in these two common lung cancer types.","Zhang, Hongming; Quek, Kelly; Chen, Runzhe; Chen, Jibei; Chen, Baoan",J.

Most important, the authors are learning about the impact on motor vehicle crashes and fatalities. This report draws from an array of sources to bring together as much information as possible to provide an understanding of current traffic safety environment, and to better address changing traffic safety needs. Prior economic downturns, such as the financial crisis of 2008, provide some comparison for reduced roadway travel and changes in travel patterns. As this report documents, although there are some similarities with that time frame, there are many differences in impact on speeding and other dangerous driving behaviors, such as reduced seat belt use. This report explores changes in countermeasure use including traffic enforcement and public communications and outreach. This report also examines the question of whether some people – who continued driving even when many communities had stay-at-home guidelines – may be inherently higher-risk drivers.

It is often difficult to identify the causes of AHRF at the time of admission. The SpO2 to FiO2 (S/F) ratio has been recently used as a non-invasive and alternative marker of the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio in acute respiratory failure. This retrospective cohort study was conducted from October 2010 to March 2019 at the Showa University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. We enrolled 94 AHRF patients who had bilateral opacities and received mechanical ventilation in ICU to investigate their prognostic markers including S/F ratio. Significant differences were observed for APACHE II, S/F ratio, PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio, and ventilator-free-days at day 28 for ICU mortality, and for age, S/F ratio, P/F ratio, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ventilator-free days at day 28 for hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the S/F ratio was significantly and independently associated with the risk of death during in ICU (p = 0.003) and hospitalization (p = 0.002). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on the S/F ratio were significantly greater than those based on simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) for ICU mortality (0.785 in S/F ratio vs. 0.575 in SAPS II, p = 0.012; 0.785 in S/F ratio vs 0.594 in SOFA, p = 0.021) and for hospital mortality (0.701 in S/F ratio vs. 0.502 in SAPS II, p = 0.012; 0.701 in S/F ratio vs. 0.503 in SOFA, p = 0.005). In the subanalysis for bacterial pneumonia and interstitial lung disease groups, the AUC based on the S/F ratio was the greatest among all prognostic markers, including APACHE II, SAPS II, and SOFA.

However, direct mask-less fabrication has only been possible with electron and ion beams. That is because light has an inherent disadvantage; the diffraction limit makes it difficult to interact with matter on dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light. Here we demonstrate spatially controlled formation of nanocones on a silicon surface with a positional precision of 50 nm using femtosecond laser ablation comprising a superposition of optical vector vortex and Gaussian beams. Such control and precision opens new opportunities for nano-printing of materials using techniques such as laser-induced forward transfer and in general broadens the scope of laser processing of materials.","Rahimian, M G; Jain, A; Larocque, H; Corkum, P B; Karimi, E; Bhardwaj, V R",Sci Rep,620,4

We suggest that any attempt to meaningfully influence ICR would require stakeholders to possess both power and legitimacy; moreover, magnitude and urgency of the issue at stake may affect the ability to influence ICR. The framework is applied to the retail banking industry, focusing on post-crisis experiences in two countries-Spain and the UK-where there has been considerable pressure on the retail banking industry by civil society and/or government to change behaviours, especially to abandon unethical practices.

However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control, it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are significantly increased if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. With all related control measures maintained at their baseline levels, this study shows that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods. The burden of the second wave of the pandemic would have been reduced significantly if the lockdown measures were extended by two weeks. We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are maintained at their baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the community lockdown measures were lifted at the mild lifting level (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the levels of these activities allowed during the corresponding lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. It is further shown that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their respective first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (and severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.","Ngonghala, Calistus N; Iboi, Enahoro A; Gumel, Abba B",Math Biosci,620,16

To alleviate this issue, we propose ATSO, an asynchronous version of teacher-student optimization.

Conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate whether the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was affected by smoking status. RESULTS: A total of 4,167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 20,937 matched controls were enrolled. The proportion of ex-smokers and current smokers was 26.6% of the total participants. In multivariate analysis, smoking was not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.62).

The concepts of structural stigma and moral distress are important and interrelated, yet rarely explored or researched in medical education. Structural stigma refers to how discrimination towards certain groups is enacted through policy and practice. Moral distress describes the tension and conflict that health workers experience when they are unable to fulfil their duties due to circumstances outside of their control. In this study, the authors explored how resident physicians perceive moral distress in relation to structural stigma. An improved understanding of such experiences may provide insights into how to prepare future physicians to improve health equity. METHODS: Utilizing constructivist grounded theory methodology, 22 participants from across Canada including 17 resident physicians from diverse specialties and 5 faculty members were recruited for semi-structured interviews from April-June 2020. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Results describe a distinctive form of moral distress called structural distress, which centers upon the experience of powerlessness leading resident physicians to go above and beyond the call of duty, potentially worsening their psychological well-being. Faculty play a buffering role in mitigating the impact of structural distress by role modeling vulnerability and involving residents in policy decisions. CONCLUSION: These findings provide unique insights into teaching and learning about the care of structurally vulnerable populations and faculty's role related to resident advocacy and decision-making. The concept of structural distress may provide the foundation for future research into the intersection between resident well-being and training related to health equity.","Sukhera, Javeed; Kulkarni, Chetana; Taylor, Taryn",Perspectives on medical education,620,20

Several strategies are applied to restrict the spread of this disease such as lockdown, adequate social distance in different activities, hand disinfection and the use of masks. Potential hazard outdoors comes from released viruses, which may remain in the air for a while and settle down afterward and contaminating surfaces. Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is known to act as a natural environmental virucide. The virucidal effectivity of UVR depends on a first order on the sensitivity of the virus against UVR as well as on the amount of incoming UVR. Here, we present estimates of the potential of solar UVR in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. This is done by combining DNA-damaging surface solar UVR retrieved by satellites and the available information on fluence for inactivation of Coronaviridae. Our results show that solar UVR has a high potential to inactivate these viruses, but the degree depends strongly on location and season. In the subtropics (Sao Paulo, 23.5°S), the daily survival fraction is lower than 10-4 during the whole year, while close at norther latitudes (Reykjavik, 64°N), such a reduction can be found in June and July only.","Carvalho, Fernanda R S; Henriques, Diamantino V; Correia, Osvaldo; Schmalwieser, Alois W",Photochem. photobiol,620,13

The phenomenon has been implicated in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus implicated in COVID-19. Critically ill COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm are believed to have a worse prognosis and increased fatality rate. In SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, cytokine storm appears important to the pathogenesis of several severe manifestations of COVID-19: acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic diseases such as acute ischemic strokes caused by large vessel occlusion and myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis (Kawasaki-like syndrome in children and renal vasculitis in adult). Understanding the pathogenesis of cytokine storm will help unravel not only risk factors for the condition but also therapeutic strategies to modulate the immune response and deliver improved outcomes in COVID-19 patients at high risk for severe disease.

Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling these patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treating these patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in SARS-CoV-2 RNA re-positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary outcome was time to achieve a consecutive twice (at intervals of more than 24 h) negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and sputum sample. RESULTS: Between March 27 and May 9, 2020, 55 patients underwent randomization; 36 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 19 were assigned to the control group. Favipiravir group had a significantly shorter time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab and sputum than control group (median 17 vs. 26 days); hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI [1.1-4.0], p = 0.038). The proportion of virus shedding in favipiravir group was higher than control group (80.6% [29/36] vs. 52.6% [10/19], p = 0.030, respectively). C-reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment in the favipiravir group (p = 0.016). The adverse events were generally mild and self-limiting.

The transformation from internal combustion engines to new electrical technologies requires enormous investment, and hence the IC engines are likely to serve as a means of transportation for the coming decades. The search for sustainable green alternative fuel and operating parameter optimization is a current feasible solution and is a critical issue among the scientific community. Engine experiments are complicated, costly, and time-consuming, especially when the global economy is drastically down due to the COVID-19 pandemic and putting the limitation of social distancing. Industries are looking for proven computational solutions to address these issues. Recently, artificial neural network has been proven beneficial in several areas of engineering to reduce the time and experimentation cost. The IC engine is one of them. ANN has been used to predict and analyze different characteristics such as performance, combustion, and emissions of the IC engine to save time and energy. The complex nature of ANN may lead to computation time, energy, and space. Recent studies are centered on changing the network topology, deep learning, and design of ANN to get the highest performance. The present study summarizes the application of ANN to predict and optimize the complicated characteristics of various types of engines with different fuels.

Agricultural landscapes are complex, and the value of resource patches may vary substantially among species. The spatial extent at which landscape features affect populations (i.e., scale of effect) may also differ among species. There is a need for regional-scale conservation planning that considers landscape-scale and species-specific responses of grassland birds to environmental change. We developed a spatially explicit approach to optimizing grassland conservation in the context of species-specific landscapes and prioritization of species recovery and applied it to a conservation program in Kentucky (USA). We used a hierarchical distance-sampling model with an embedded scale of effect predictor to estimate the relationship between landscape structure and abundance of eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). We used a novel spatially explicit optimization procedure rooted in multi-attribute utility theory to design alternative conservation strategies (e.g., prioritize only northern bobwhite recovery or assign equal weight to each species' recovery). Eastern meadowlarks and field sparrows were more likely to respond to landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies than landscape-scale patch densities. Northern bobwhite responded to both landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies and densities and responded strongly to increased grassland density. Effects of landscape features on local abundance decreased as distance increased and had negligible influence at 0.8 km for eastern meadowlarks (0.7-1.2 km 95% Bayesian credibility intervals [BCI]), 2.5 km for field sparrows (1.5-5.8 km 95% BCI), and 8.4 km for bobwhite (6.4-26 km 95% BCI). Northern bobwhites were predicted to benefit greatly from future grassland conservation regardless of conservation priorities, but eastern meadowlark and field sparrow were not. Our results suggest similar species can respond differently to broad-scale conservation practices because of species-specific, distance-dependent relationships with landscape structure. Our framework is quantitative, conceptually simple, customizable, and predictive and can be used to optimize conservation in heterogeneous ecosystems while considering landscape-scale processes and explicit prioritization of species recovery.","Yeiser, John M; Morgan, John J; Baxley, Danna L; Chandler, Richard B; Martin, James A",Conserv. biol,620,1

In the multivariable analyses, patients with low health literacy had limited knowledge about COVID-19 and did not change daily routines and perform preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: In this pandemic, healthcare providers may need to be aware of more vulnerable individuals and share COVID-19 related information promptly and effectively with their patients.","Itaya, Takahiro; Torii, Mie; Hashimoto, Motomu; Jindai, Kazuaki; Yamamoto, Wataru; Tanigawa, Kyosuke; Urai, Yuki; Kinoshita, Ayae; Nin, Kazuko; Watanabe, Ryu; Murata, Koichi; Murakami, Kosaku; Tanaka, Masao; Ito, Hiromu; Matsuda, Shuichi; Morinobu, Akio",Clin Rheumatol,620,16

Whether BTKis affect COVID-19 risk or severity or reduce vaccine efficacy are important but unanswered questions. Here, we provide an overview on BTKi mechanisms relevant to COVID-19 infection and vaccination and review preliminary data on BTKi use in patients with COVID-19. BTKis block B-cell receptor– and myeloid fragment crystallizable receptor–mediated signaling, thereby dampening B-cell activation, antibody class-switching, expansion, and cytokine production. Beyond antibodies, COVID-19 severity and vaccine efficacy appear largely linked to T-cell responses and interferon induction, processes not directly affected by BTKis. Given that B cells have clear roles in antigen presentation to T cells, however, it is possible that BTKis may indirectly interfere with beneficial or detrimental T-cell responses during COVID-19 infection or vaccination. In addition to these possible effects on generating a protective immune response, BTKis may attenuate the hyperinflammatory dysregulation often seen in severe cases of COVID-19 that evolves as a key risk factor in this disease. Currently available outcomes from BTKi-treated patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BTKis in individuals with MS. Although limited data suggest a potential benefit of BTKis on outcomes for some COVID-19 patients, data from adequately powered, prospective and randomized clinical trials are lacking. Likewise, the specific effect of BTKis on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines remains to be determined. Any potential unknown risks that BTKi therapy may present to the patient relative to COVID-19 infection, severity, and vaccine efficacy must be balanced with the importance of timely intervention to prevent or minimize MS progression.","Weber, Martin S.; Nicholas, Jacqueline A.; Yeaman, Michael R.",Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm,620,16

Understanding the host-parasite interactions between pathogen virulence/avirulence genes and the corresponding host susceptibility/resistance genes is important for the deployment of genetic resistance against SFNB. Two recombinant inbred mapping populations were developed to characterize genetic resistance/susceptibility to the Ptm isolate 13IM8.3, which was collected from Idaho (ID). An Illumina Infinium array was used to produce a genome wide marker set. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified ten significant resistance/susceptibility loci, with two of the QTL being common to both populations. One of the QTL on 5H appears to be novel, while the remaining loci have been reported previously. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closely linked to or delimiting the significant QTL have been converted to user-friendly markers. Loci and associated molecular markers identified in this study will be useful in genetic mapping and deployment of the genetic resistance to SFNB in barley.","Alhashel, Abdullah Fahad; Poudel, Roshan Sharma; Fiedler, Jason; Carlson, Craig H; Rasmussen, Jack; Baldwin, Thomas; Friesen, Timothy L; Brueggeman, Robert S; Yang, Shengming",G3,620,1

PURPOSE: Guidelines from the National Institutes of Health support the use of balanced crystalloid solutions such as Normosol-R (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, their clinical utility is hindered by a lack of Y-site compatibility data that is essential for use in patients with limited intravenous access. The objective of this study was to determine the physical compatibility of selected intensive care unit medications with Normosol-R. METHODS: The study involved laboratory simulation of Y-site compatibility. Medications tested included amiodarone, caspofungin, dexmedetomidine, dobutamine, dopamine, epinephrine, levofloxacin, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, phenylephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and vasopressin. Tests performed were visual assessment with Tyndall light, turbidity measurement, and pH assessment. Tests were performed immediately after mixing (with the exception of turbidity testing) and after 1 hour and 4 hours. RESULTS: Incompatibility was defined as observation of haze, gas, particulate, or color change or admixture turbidity above 0.3 or above 0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU), depending on whether the baseline turbidity was less than or greater than 0.5 NTU, respectively. Analysis of solubility and compatibility based on change from baseline to admixture pH in relation to reported acid dissociation constant (pKa) was performed. There was no evidence of visual incompatibility for any of the admixtures when mixed with Normosol-R. Turbidity exceeded the defined threshold with pantoprazole, phenylephrine, and highly concentrated norepinephrine. Pantoprazole was the only test medication with a significant pH change when compared to its pKa. CONCLUSION: Normosol-R is compatible for Y-site administration with all tested medications except for pantoprazole, phenylephrine, and highly concentrated norepinephrine, allowing for potential increased use in patients with COVID-19.","Holyk, Amanda A; Lindner, Alexandra H; Lindner, Scott E; Shippert, Brian W",Am. j. health system pharm,620,12

Aim: This review analyzes the recent literature with the aim to put in light the possible relationship between the abuse of different substances (Tobacco, opioid, and Alcohol) with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Tobacco: Multiple studies confirmed that cigarette smoking affects the respiratory system by increasing the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors, which have a significant association with COVID-19 infection rate and disease severity. Opioid: Studies conducted regarding the association of opioid use disorder (OUD) and COVID-19 infection severity are limited; however, opioids can lead to both respiratory depression and kidney injuries, causing poor prognosis for those with COVID-19 infections. Alcohol: People with alcohol use disorders are at risk of developing acute lung injury and severe COVID-19 infection. Alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic has two possible scenarios: either increased or decreased based on situations. Conclusion: SUD has been frequently reported to have a positive relationship with COVID-19 severity Further studies are needed to understand the effects of opioids and alcohol abuse on COVID-19.","Althobaiti, Yusuf S.; Alzahrani, Maram A.; Alsharif, Norah A.; Alrobaie, Nawal S.; Alsaab, Hashem O.; Uddin, Mohammad N.",Healthcare (Basel),620,20

In this study, we described the development of a lateral flow dipstrip (LFD) of isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method for rapid detection of IBRV. METHODS: Distinct regions were selected as a candidate target for designing the LFD-RPA primers and probes. The analytical sensitivity of the RPA assay was determined using ten-fold serially diluted IBRV DNA. The specificity of the assay was assessed with other viral pathogens of cattle with similar clinic and other herpesviruses. The clinical performance was evaluated by testing 106 acute-phase high fever clinical specimens. RESULTS: RPA primers and probe were designed to target the specific conserved UL52 region fragment of IBRV. The detection could be completed at a constant temperature of 38 °C for 25 min, and the amplification products were easily visualized on a simple LFD. The detection limit of this assay was 5 copies per reaction of IBRV DNA and there was no cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and respiratory infections or other herpesviruses. The assay performance on acute-phase high fever clinical samples collected from cattle with no vaccine against IBRV, which were suspected to be infected with IBRV, was validated by detecting 24 fecal, 36 blood, 38 nasal swab and 8 tissue specimens, and compared with SYBR Green I based real-time PCR. The coincidence between IBRV LFD-RPA and real-time PCR was 100%. CONCLUSION: IBRV LFD-RPA was fast and much easier to serve as an alternative to the common measures used for IBRV diagnosis, as there is reduction in the use of instruments for identification of the infected animals. In addition, this assay may be the potential candidate to be used as point-of-care diagnostics in the field.","Hou, Peili; Wang, Hongmei; Zhao, Guimin; He, Chengqiang; He, Hongbin",BMC Vet Res,620,2

Risk factors for poor outcomes include older age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, and minority ethnicity. The impact of sleep apnea (OSA) on COVID-19 illness remains a topic of ongoing research. The association seems plausible as OSA shares common risk factors with COVID-19 comorbidities. The aim of our study is to investigate if the severity of OSA correlates with COVID-19 hospitalization outcomes. METHODS: The study is an observational retrospective electronic medical chart review of patients admitted to the Yale Health system for COVID-19 illness, who have an ICD medical history diagnosis of sleep apnea. Subjects with an available sleep study were grouped based on AHI severity. Composite outcome was determined by mortality or critical illness (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, High-Flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation). Interim analysis was conducted with data from 256 patients. Logistic regression was performed to calculate OR associated with the primary outcome comparing mild versus moderate-severe OSA groups. RESULTS: The sample of 256 patients included 50% females, with a median age of 64 (IQR,55–73) and BMI of 36 (IQR,30–41). Race distribution composed of 45% Whites and 40% African-Americans with 18% identifying as Hispanic. Overall mortality rate was 16%. Median length of stay (LOS) was 9 days (IQR,5 -15). 155 patients had a recorded AHI with a median of 26/hour (IQR,11–51) grouped into mild (34%), moderate (20%) and severe (45%) disease. Severe sleep apnea had the highest mortality rate of 19% and median LOS of 10 days (IQR,5- 16) compared to moderate (6% mortality,9 days (IQR,6–14)) and mild (17% mortality,6 days (IQR,4–11)) disease; differences were not statistically significant. Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the composite outcome for mild versus moderate-severe OSA groups (OR=1.2; 95% CI:0.58–2.32). CONCLUSION: Severe OSA appeared to have a trend towards an association with higher mortality versus moderate but not mild disease. Comparing moderate-severe disease to a reference group of mild disease did not demonstrate a significant difference in our composite outcome of death or critical illness. Additional subject recruitment and re-analysis are needed to confirm the findings of this interim analysis. SUPPORT (IF ANY): N/A","Mansour, Wissam; Knauert, Melissa",Sleep,620,16

Vitamin D is well-known to play a significant role in maintaining the immune health of an individual. Moreover, it induces antimicrobial peptide expression that can decrease viral replication and regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, supplementation of vitamin D has the potential to reduce the incidence, severity and the risk of death from pneumonia resulting from the cytokine storm of many viral infections including COVID-19. We suggest that supplementation of subjects at high risk of COVID-19 with vitamin D (1.000 to 3.000 IU) to maintain its optimum serum concentrations may be of significant benefit for both in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.","Boulkrane, Mohamed Said; Ilina, Victoria; Melchakov, Roman; Fedotova, Julia; Drago, Filippo; Gozzo, Lucia; Das, Undurti Narasimha; Abd El-Aty, A.

Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. METHOD: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions. Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died. The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16–34) days. The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: A close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period.","Thai, Pham Quang; Toan, Do Thi Thanh; Son, Dinh Thai; Van, Hoang Thi Hai; Minh, Luu Ngoc; Hung, Le Xuan; Toan, Ngo Van; Hoat, Luu Ngoc; Luong, Duong Huy; Khue, Luong Ngoc; Khoa, Nguyen Trong; Huong, Le Thi",Epidemiol Infect,620,1
